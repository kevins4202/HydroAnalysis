2725,heavy rainfall coupled with storm surge and river flooding are typical compound flood driving elements which cause much heavier losses than that of single driving element to address this issue we propose a framework for assessing compound flood potential the framework includes three aspects 1 defining and sampling compound events under different scenarios 2 based on kendall correlation joint return period and copula model to quantify compound flood potential 3 explore the impact of typhoons on compound events and generate a spatiotemporal distribution map of typhoon compound events we explore the applicability of this framework by taking china s coastal areas as an example the results show that different definitions of compound events and different sampling methods can affect the quantification results of compound flood potential overall the potential of compound flood in the southern coastal provinces is higher than that in northern provinces and the potential of compound flood is still increasing in some areas with high potential at the same time it is found that typhoon is the most significant conditions leading to compound events and its intensity and path also affect the generation and distribution of compound events the rainfall associated with tropical cyclones is the main contributor to the disaster loss of compound events the framework is based on global data sets for calculation and analysis which can provide reference for compound flood risk assessment in other areas lacking data keywords extreme rainfall storm surge river discharge tropical cyclone copula data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction floods are some of the world s most dangerous natural disasters according to the report human losses caused by disasters 2000 2019 issued by the united nations disaster prevention and mitigation agency flood disasters increased from 1 389 to 3 254 in the last 20 years and storm surge disasters increased from 1 457 to 2 043 accounting for 44 and 28 of the total reported disasters respectively in the past 20 years flood disasters have caused economic losses of 651 billion usd worldwide and storm surge disasters have caused economic losses of 1 390 billion usd unite nations office for disaster risk reduction 2020 there are three main sources of flooding in coastal areas 1 the rise of coastal water levels caused by atmospheric disturbances astronomical tides submarine earthquakes and other factors 2 direct surface runoff stemming from rain and 3 river floods caused by upstream flood discharge fang et al 2021b floods can be especially damaging when more than one of these sources simultaneously or consecutively contributes to flooding tropical cyclones tcs are generally accompanied by heavy rains and storm surge which can trigger severe compound flooding if extreme river runoff and astronomical tides occur simultaneously compound flooding events during typhoons haiyan in 2013 typhoon fett and typhoon lekima in 2019 caused severe damage to coastal areas china is one of the world s fastest growing coastal countries china s coastal low lying areas less than 10 m above sea level account for only 2 of the country s land area but are home to more than 12 of the country s population liu et al 2015 more than 40 of the population resides in coastal provincial administrative regions which contribute nearly 60 of the national gross domestic product approximately 47 of the national capital stock was found in the eastern economic region in 2012 wu et al 2014 china s coastal areas are frequently hit by tcs zhang et al 2021 from 1989 to 2014 storm surge caused 71 billion usd in losses and 4 376 deaths fang et al 2017 harsh natural conditions fragile socio economic conditions and serious human and economic losses make the risk assessment of compound flood very important to china s coastal areas failure to consider the correlations between different flood risk sources can lead to the underestimation of compound flood risk europe and the united states attach great importance to this and have investigated the compound effects of different flood driving factors svensson and jones et al assessed the dependence between ocean tides river discharge and precipitation in the southern and western uk suggesting that higher correlations between risk source lead to higher flood risk svensson and jones 2004 nonlinear combinations of different floods can increase flood costs prime et al studied the physical and economic effects of sea level rise and low probability flood events on british coastal communities prime et al 2015 van den hurk et al analyzed the mechanism and disaster causing scenarios of compound surge and precipitation events in the netherlands and found that the damage caused by different flood hazard scenarios was not consistent at the same time it should also be considered that the generation of compound floods has regional specificity van den hurk et al 2015 however these studies were carried out in a small areas and did not reveal the climatic conditions related to the compound event wahl et al studied the combined flood risk of storm surge and extreme rainfall in major coastal cities in the united states and ghanbari et al studied changes in compound coastal river flood disasters in the united states the risk source correlation and the interannual variation of the combined return period of the compound flood show an upward trend in the risk of compound floods under the background of climate change ghanbari et al 2021 wahl et al 2015 it is worth noting that most of the research on compound flood is to assess the potential of compound flood by investigating the correlation between different flood drivers rather than the risk of compound flood a large number of subsequent studies have used the joint probability function to calculate the return period of compound floods in specific locations including fuzhou china lian et al 2013 the xixiang river in shenzhen tu et al 2018 taiwan beihai khanal et al 2019 and the burreg river mouth in morocco based on the joint flood risk probabilistic analysis the probability of extreme rainfall and extreme tide levels occurring at the same time is very low but when they occur they will bring greater inundation range and water depth zellou and rahali 2019 assessments of compound flood risk have been limited in some regions because of limited amounts of data in recent years global assessments of compound flood risk have been conducted and this research has benefited from global research using simulated storm surge data couasnon et al studied the compound flood potential of extreme river discharge and storm surge on a global scale couasnon et al 2020 bevacqua et al evaluated the compound flood risk between global coastal rainfall and river discharge bevacqua et al 2020 lai et al studied the simultaneous occurrence of heavy rainfall and storm surge on a global scale the evolution of the frequency and intensity of rainfall and its effect on compound flooding had also been studied lai et al 2021 these studies have provided valuable information on compound floods in areas lacking in observations such as the coastal areas of south america and africa in addition most of the previous studies focused on compound scenarios generated by two flood risk sources there is no comprehensive evaluation of the dependence of three flood risk sources in a region previous studies of flooding risk in china have been conducted on specific regions and the effects of combinations of two sources of flood risk lian et al 2013 tu et al 2018 however up to now no research has fully considered the impacts of different compound scenarios nor the factors leading to compound floods chen and liu 2014 xu et al 2014 fang et al studied the flood potential of storm surge and extreme rainfall in coastal areas of china but did not assess the correlations between the three risk sources fang et al 2021a in view of the difficulty in obtaining tidal level and river data in china comprehensive regional assessments of china s coastal areas only uses a few years data lacking the latest data we found that no studies have explored the potential of multivariate compound flooding and conventional correlation measures cannot measure the correlation of multivariate drivers the complex compound scenarios make it difficult to unify the compound flood potential and some studies are insufficient to analysis of the impact of climate factors related to compound events in order to meet the challenge of compound flood a potential risk assessment framework of compound flood based on global data set is put forward which provides a reference for the risk assessment of compound flood in areas lacking data in this framework based on kendall correlation joint return period and copula model we quantified the potential of compound flood under different compound scenarios in addition we also analyze the interannual variation of compound flood potential and the occurrence probability of extreme compound flood within the framework in the analysis of climate factors we analyzed the impact of typhoon intensity and track on the generation and distribution of compound events based on typhoon data to uniformly display the compound flood potential of the region we plotted the intensity distribution of typhoon compound events based on the nested archimedes copula model this paper is divided into five parts as follows section 2 presents the global reanalysis datasets selected for this study and the delineation of compound regions section 3 mainly introduces the sampling and definition of compound events the quantitative method of compound flood potential the identification of climate driving factors of compound events and the construction of typhoon compound event distribution model section 4 presents the results of the quantification of the compound flood potential reveals the trend of the interannual variation of the compound flood potential discusses the influence of the typhoon track and intensity on the compound event and draws the intensity distribution of the typhoon compound event the conclusion and outlook are given in section 5 2 study region and data 2 1 study region we studied the coastal area of china which includes 12 provinces 2 municipalities and 2 special administrative regions the coastal area was divided into 13 regions according to administrative divisions of the coastal area the compound events of hong kong and macau were included for guangdong numbers 0 12 represent hainan guangxi guangdong fujian taiwan zhejiang shanghai jiangsu shandong hebei tianjin beijing and liaoning respectively in coastal areas rainfall and storm surge can often occur simultaneously storm surge can flood coastal areas directly through any body of water on or near the coast and rainfall will increase the risk of coastal flooding during hurricane ike storm surge directly caused flooding 50 km from the coast world meteorological organization 2021 thus 50 km along the coastline was considered the compound area for rainfall and storm surge i e the area where both rainfall and storm surge can occur simultaneously the compound area for rainfall and river discharge as well as storm surge and river discharge was determined based on the global flood awareness system glofas harrigan et al 2020 and consists of a river unit with an upstream catchment area greater than 1 000 km2 tides can travel about 200 km inland along the river causing the river to block so river units within 200 km of the coastline are designated as compound areas of storm surge and river flow hoitink and jay 2016 beijing is also within 200 km along the coast and thus was located within the study area the different ranges are shown in fig 1 2 2 data the rainfall data were the products of daily precipitation analysis based on the cpc global unified meter from noaa noaa physical sciences laboratory 2021a the storm surge data were derived from the global reanalysis of storm surge and extreme sea level muis et al 2016 river discharge data were obtained from the global modeled daily data of river discharge from glofas this data set was simulated by forcing a hydrological modeling chain with inputs from a global reanalysis harrigan et al 2019 data for the historical simulation were from january 1 1979 to the present we use the 0 1 resolution river discharge data as the benchmark downscale the 0 5 resolution rainfall data and use bilinear interpolation to convert the storm surge data to 0 1 resolution raster data to determine the weather patterns associated with the identified compound events as well as the contribution of tcs of different paths and intensities to the compound scenario we used the wind field barometric pressure and rainfall data in the noaa cires doe 20th century reanalysis v3 noaa physical sciences laboratory 2021b the cma best path data set provided data on the position intensity and central wind speed of tcs in the northwest pacific ocean since 1949 lu et al 2021 ying et al 2014 the intensity and path of the tcs affect the disaster loss of the tcs to determine the actual loss of the compound events of identified tcs we used the death toll the number of people affected and economic losses in the tc disaster data set to determine the actual losses of the tc compound events under different compound scenarios the original data were from 1951 to 2012 yap et al 2015 we used the china marine disaster bulletin and other news sources to supplement the disaster loss data for 2013 2014 china oceanic infomation network 2013 details of the data of different data sets are shown in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 identification of compound events compound floods in coastal areas refer to floods that occur in coastal areas with compound effects of various meteorological hydrological and hydrodynamic processes the complex interaction between precipitation storm surge and river discharge can cause or exacerbate the impact of coastal flooding through a variety of mechanisms bevacqua et al 2020 wahl et al 2015 1 the joint occurrence of rain storm surge and river flood may elevate water levels to a point where flooding is initiated or its impacts exacerbated 2 rainfall upstream flooding or both occur simultaneously following large scale storm surge 3 rainfall storm surge or both occur simultaneously following large scale upstream flooding and 4 extreme rainfall causes flooding following moderate storm surge a moderate flood or both occurring simultaneously commonly used methods for the identification of compound events include the annual maximum method am ganguli and merz 2019 lai et al 2021 and the peak over threshold method pot am is widely used for sampling extreme scenarios whereas pot is used for sampling more compound events we used different methods to identify compound events in light of the various compound flood action mechanisms for mechanism 1 we set a threshold for the historical rainfall storm surge and river discharge data a compound event occurred when two or three of them simultaneously exceeded the threshold there are four compound scenarios for mechanism 1 compound flooding stemming from rainfall and storm surge pot rt rainfall and river discharge pot rf storm surge and river flooding pot tf and rainfall storm surge and river discharge pot rtf the threshold was estimated using the provided data points we set the threshold to 95 in the bivariate compound scenario and 90 in the trivariate scenario fang et al 2021a ridder et al 2020 for mechanism 2 the maximum storm surge each year was determined and the maximum rainfall and river discharge within 1 day was determined if the rainfall was less than 1 mm the second highest storm surge in the year was determined until rainfall was greater than 1 there are three scenarios for mechanism 2 compound flooding stemming from extreme storm surge and rainfall am tr extreme storm surge and river flooding am tf and the combination of extreme storm surge rainfall and river flooding am trf for mechanism 3 the maximum annual river discharge was determined and then the maximum storm surge and rainfall within 1 day was determined similar to mechanism 2 rainfall needed to be greater than 1 there are three scenarios for mechanism 3 compound flooding stemming from extreme river discharge and rainfall am fr extreme river discharge and storm surge am ft and extreme river flooding rainfall and storm surge am frt for mechanism 4 the maximum annual rainfall was determined and then the maximum storm surge and river discharge within 1 day were determined there are three scenarios for mechanism 4 compound flooding stemming from extreme rainfall and storm surge am rt extreme rainfall and river flooding am rf and extreme rainfall storm surge and river flooding am rtf during sampling we take into account both simultaneous and delayed events in compound events mechanism 1 collects samples of simultaneous events and mechanism 2 adds a time window of 1 day so samples of delayed events are collected fig 2 shows the results of different sampling methods using the unit where guangzhou city is located as an example the blue line in the figure is the 95 threshold set in the bivariate compound scenario and the red line is the 90 threshold set in the multivariate compound scenario the circles represent samples sampled by the am method and the boxes represent samples sampled by the pot method the compound events we define and sample do not necessarily have actual impacts but the probability of compound events occurring and the dependencies among flood drivers can be considered as precursors to the impact of actual compound events ridder et al 2020 3 2 quantification of compound flood potential 3 2 1 joint return period for mechanism 1 we counted the number of compound events that occurred in each grid in 12 784 days from 1980 to 2014 and divided it by the total number of days in the study period to calculate the joint probability of occurrence for each grid cell the result is then expressed as return period rp by dividing the inverse of the probability by the number of days per year we use this to quantify the compound flood potential of bivariate and trivariate scenarios ridder et al 2020 1 t i 1 e x c e e d t h e t h r e s h o l d 0 d o e s n o t e x c e e d t h e t h r e s h o l d 2 r p 12784 365 t t i 3 2 2 kendall s τ and tail dependence in mechanisms 2 4 we used the kendall τ metric to quantify compound flooding potential kendall τ provides better overall parameter estimates with smaller asymptotic variance it is also less susceptible to outliers chok 2010 an equivalent definition of the kendall rank coefficient can be given as follows two observations are called concording if the two members of one observation are larger than the respective members of the other observation in a sample of size n with n pairs of observations let nc and nd denote the total number of pairs of concording and discording observations respectively with this notation the kendall s τ is given by 3 τ 2 n c n d n n 1 kendall s τ measures the consistency of changes between variables the value of τ is between 1 and 1 τ 1 indicates that the change of x is completely consistent with the change of y τ 1 indicates that the change of x is completely consistent with the reverse change of y when τ 0 it is impossible to judge whether there is a correlation between the two however τ cannot describe the entire correlation structure of the joint distribution when the variables are positively correlated we need to calculate the tail dependence between the variables to better understand the correlation the standard method for determining whether the variables are tail correlated is to examine the upper tail correlation coefficient and lower tail correlation coefficient denoted by λu and λl respectively joe 1997 c is bivariate archimedes copula functions and u is marginal distributions of variables 4 lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u 5 lim u 0 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ l 3 2 3 copula model the copula model is one of the most widely used joint probability models in hydrology copula model can facilitate us to calculate the joint return period of bivariate and trivariate compound floods and at the same time can help us build a spatiotemporal distribution model of typhoon compound events according to sklar s theorem durante et al 2013 any trivariate joint cumulative distribution function can be represented by a univariate marginal distribution function and a copula that describes the structure of dependencies between variables according to sklar s theorem let h be an n dimensional distribution function whose marginal distribution is f1 f2 fn then there is an n copula function c such that for any u rn 6 h u 1 u 2 u n c f 1 u 1 f 2 u 2 f n u n it can be seen that the general formula of the copula function is as follows 7 c u 1 u 2 u n h f 1 u 1 f 2 1 u 2 f n 1 u n copula functions can be generally divided into three categories ellipse archimedean and quadratic aas and berg 2009 savu and trede 2010 the archimedean copula with one parameter is the most widely used the construction of trivariate archimedean copula is usually based on bivariate according to the different construction methods it can be divided into two types symmetrical and asymmetrical bivariate archimedean copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrology include gumble copula clayton copula function frank copula joe copula and ali mikhail haq amh copula karmakar and simonovic 2009 and commonly used symmetrical trivariate copula are m3 copula m4 copula m5 copula and m6 copula grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 the marginal distribution of variables in different scenarios uses nine distributions commonly used in hydrology and ocean engineering table 2 a kolmogorov smirnov test and cramer von mises test were used to fit the optimal distribution of variable data the parameters of the copula function were determined by the maximum likelihood method akaike information criterion akaike 1998 and bayesian information criterion schwarz 1978 were used to select the optimal copula and the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the joint distribution for the trivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 we used the nested archimedean copula model to perform a statistical analysis of trivariate compound floods and the and return period salvadori 2004 to calculate the joint return period 3 3 regional seasonal and interannual analysis in the regional analysis we had to take into account differences in coverage under different scenarios we counted the number of compound events in different regions and different scenarios according to the definition of mechanism 1 the contributions of different scenarios in different regions were analyzed by calculating the proportion of compound events in each region under different scenarios for mechanism 2 4 we use the average τ value within the region to represent the compound flood potential within the region and compare the compound flood potential of the region under different scenarios to determine the contribution of different compound scenarios within the region for the seasonal analysis we counted the number of compound events from 1980 to 2014 for each month separately in mechanisms 1 and we assessed the compound flood potential for each month by calculating the proportion of the number of compound events in each month quantification of compound flood potential in mechanisms 2 4 fails to reveal seasonality based on the rolling window calculations of the rank dependence trend between the grid variables in the area for the 35 years of data data of the first 15 years were needed to ensure that estimates based on τ were robust chebana and ouarda 2021 the size of the obtained rolling window series was 20 years each time step moves one year we calculated the linear trend in τ under different scenarios for each grid cell since 1995 based on the rolling window even if the τ change was not significant it could still greatly affect the results of the joint regression wahl et al 2015 3 4 climate drivers associated with compound events we identified compound events caused by tcs and compound events caused by non tc in each cell we divided tc compound events into different extreme compound events based on the two or three mechanisms occurring simultaneously if the compound event sampled in the cell occurs within 1 day of the occurrence of tcs within 200 km it is defined as a tc compound event yap et al 2015 generally speaking the weather conditions associated with compound events are characterized by deep low pressure cyclones and high precipitation lai et al 2021 we used sea level pressure wind direction from noaa cires doe twentieth century reanalysis version 3 and tc path data from the cma best path data set to analyze the climatic drivers of compound disasters we compared the weather scales and weather patterns of tc compound events and non tc compound events under the three compound scenarios of mechanisms 2 4 3 5 construction of spatiotemporal distribution model to comprehensively evaluate the spatial distribution of typhoon compound floods it is necessary to characterize not only the frequency of typhoons but also the intensity of typhoons we use the total intensity of the typhoon the accumulation of wind speeds at the center of the typhoon to measure the risk of typhoon compound flooding we used the nested archimedean copula model and cma tcs path data to construct the joint distribution of tc compound events zhao et al 2020 the joint distribution function is as follows 8 location c 1 longitude u l a t i t u d e v 9 joint d i s t r i b u t i o n o f t c s c o m p o u n d e v e n t s c 2 time t c 1 longitude u l a t i t u d e v c1 and c2 are bivariate archimedes copula functions table 2 u is the marginal distribution of longitude v is the marginal distribution of latitude and t is the marginal distribution of month 4 results 4 1 quantifying the potential of compound flood under different scenarios 4 1 1 bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 here we use the kendall tau value to quantify the compound flood potential under the bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 the distribution results of the compound flood potential in different scenarios are shown in fig 3 in the two scenarios am rt and am tr in which rainfall and storm surge are compounded regions with higher dependence were observed in the coastal areas of guangxi hainan northern fujian taiwan zhejiang and eastern shandong the overall dependence of the am tr scenario was higher than that of the am rt scenario fig 3a and d indicating that the occurrence of compound events in coastal areas of china are more affected by storm surge the difference in dependence between guangdong and jiangsu was the largest of these two scenarios in the two scenarios am rf and am fr where rainfall and river discharge are compounded the dependence was generally high and the distribution pattern was similar fig 3b and e this is to be expected given that rainfall is the main cause of river flooding however some rivers with larger discharge and larger upstream catchment areas had lower τ values such as the xijiang and beijiang of the pearl river and in the vicinity of the yangtze river estuary the lower dependence of these river grids indicates that higher river confluence discharge weaken the dependence between rainfall and river discharge in the two scenarios am tf and am ft where storm surge and river discharge are compounded the dependence was generally low high dependence was observed in hainan fujian taiwan zhejiang hebei and liaoning the am tf scenario showed higher dependence than the am ft scenario fig 3c and f which suggests that the occurrence of compound events in coastal areas are more affected by storm surge compound events caused by storm surge are easier to identify in general the coastal compound flood potential of southern china was higher than that of northern china under the bivariate scenarios of mechanisms 2 4 4 1 2 bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 1 in mechanism 1 we quantify the compound flood potential by counting the joint return period of historical compound events and the potential distribution is shown in fig 4 the distribution of mechanism 1 and mechanism 2 was similar the distribution of the compound events return period under the pot rt mechanism was similar to the distribution of dependence under the am rt and am tr mechanism larger values were observed in guangxi hainan zhejiang taiwan shandong and liaoning the return period of compound events under the pot rf mechanism was the same as that under the am rf and am fr scenarios the distribution of the compound events return period under the pot tf mechanism was quite different from that under the am tf mechanism the main difference lies in the high compound events return period and high dependence in the coastal areas of fujian and zhejiang overall the compound flood potential in the northern area under the bivariate scenario in mechanism 1 was higher than that in the coastal areas of south china which is inconsistent with the conclusions for mechanisms 2 4 we suspect that pot only calculates the compound flood potential under the simultaneous occurrence of different flood sources while the am method sampling mechanism 2 4 calculates the compound flood potential under both the consecutive and simultaneous occurrence scenarios at the same time in addition rainfall and river discharge are generally lower in the north than in the south which indicates that there is a closer connection between events wherein thresholds are exceeded in the northern threshold exceeding event and the weather system the higher compound flood potential in shandong hebei and liaoning might be related to temperate storm surge 4 1 3 multivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 for the multivariate compound scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 we quantify compound flood potential by calculating the combined return period of once in a decade rainfall storm surge and river flooding with the help of a nested archimedes copula model fig 7 showed that the extreme compound events in the am rtf and am frt scenarios mainly occurred in hainan guangxi guangdong fujian taiwan zhejiang shandong and liaoning the compound flood potential was higher and more concentrated in liaoning for am trf the compound flood potential on the side close to the sea was greater than that on the other side which is related to the mechanism of storm surge in this scenario the compound events caused by storm surge are more likely to appear significantly higher compound flood potential was observed for hainan fujian zhejiang taiwan and shandong 4 1 4 regional and seasonal analysis to more clearly compare and analyze the compound flood potential of different scenarios in different regions under the four mechanisms we calculated the average τ value of different provinces and municipalities in mechanisms 2 4 under different scenarios and for different provinces and municipalities the proportion of historical compound events in different provinces and scenarios for mechanism 1 is shown in the heat map on the right side of fig 4 comparing the am tr and am rt scenarios in the heat map in fig 4 in most regions the high storm surge compound event is more dependent than the high rainfall compound event this regular also appears in the southern coastal areas of the am tf and am ft scenarios which once again proves that the generation of compound events in the southern region is greatly affected by tc however the highly similar dependencies in the am rf and am fr scenarios prove that the intra grid rainfall has a higher contribution to the intra grid channel flow thus leading to a tighter dependency between high rainfall and high river flow because no seasonality was detected for mechanisms 2 4 according to the τ value we only performed seasonal analysis for mechanism 1 line charts in fig 4a d show that historical compound events under different scenarios primarily occurred from june to september which coincided with most of the rainy season and the season for tcs 4 2 temporal changes in rank dependence and tail dependence between compound flood sources under different scenarios to better understand changes in the dependence of variables in different scenarios in china s coastal areas in recent decades we used the rolling window method to calculate the linear trend in changes in the τ value over the past 20 years fig 5 shows the pattern of dependence between variables in different scenarios over the past 20 years under the am rt scenario dependence increased in zhejiang shanghai southeastern jiangsu the leizhou peninsula of guangdong and the northeastern side of hainan under the am tr scenario an increase in dependence was observed in the guangxi the northwestern side of hainan and the coastal areas of guangdong fujian zhejiang shanghai the southeast side of jiangsu as well as hebei in the am rf and am fr scenarios increases in dependence were mainly observed in zhejiang fujian guangdong taiwan tianjin and hainan the patterns in the am tf and am tr scenarios were similar in the am ft scenario the dependence increased in the coastal areas of fujian zhejiang and taiwan comparison of figs 3 and 5 revealed that areas such as guangxi hainan zhejiang and shanghai had high τ values and these τ values were continuously increasing indicating that more frequent and more serious compound events are possible in the future no single correlation coefficient can reflect the correlation structure of the entire data set we thus used tail dependences to analyze the dependence of different scenarios the tail dependences in different scenarios were measured for mechanism 2 4 we were more focused on the dependence with the upper tail the probability of extreme compound events in areas with upper tail dependences is predicted to greatly increase fig 6 shows the distribution of tail dependence in different scenarios a positive value represents the upper tail dependence a negative value represents the lower tail dependence and the gray area represents no tail dependence 4 3 weather patterns of compound events under different scenarios we used tc path data to define tc compound events we counted the number of tc compound events in each grid cell in the coastal area of china over a 35 year sample the result was shown in fig 8 there is little difference between guangzhou and shanghai in social and economic conditions but there are great differences in climate meteorology and location characteristics by comparing the distribution characteristics of compound events in the two places the impact of climate meteorology and location factors on compound events can be well analyzed guangzhou is close to the estuary of the pearl river and shanghai is close to the estuary of the yangtze river the complex dynamic conditions of the river and the sea will cause serious flood losses we used grid data from guangzhou and shanghai the two location is shown as red dots in fig 1 to analyze the proportion of tc events in different scenarios and the weather patterns of tc compound events and non tc compound events under the am rtf scenario 13 out of 35 years of data in shanghai consisted of tc compound events and only 8 were detected in guangzhou however under the am trf scenario there were 17 tc compound events in shanghai and 29 tc compound events in guangzhou in the am frt scenario the number of tc compound events in shanghai and guangzhou was 8 and 5 respectively tc events were more likely to cause compound events in am trf scenarios followed by am rtf scenarios and the lowest number was observed for am frt scenarios the greater number of non tc events in guangzhou in the am rtf scenario may be caused by extreme rainfall which decreases the dependence between rainfall and storm surge nevertheless the potential for compound flooding cannot be ignored because 8 storm surge events were identified and all 8 storm surge events resulted in greater harm as shown in figs 9 and 10 we analyzed the climate patterns of the tc compound events and the non tc compound events by examining the pressure wind field and rainfall in the am rtf and am frt scenarios when non tc compound events occur the rainfall in both the local area and upstream areas is large non tc compound events in the am trf scenario were mainly caused by pronounced pressure gradients and strong winds for tc compound events we analyzed the correlation between different tc paths and different scenarios of compound events whether a tc makes landfall and its path and intensity before and after landfall affects the probability of tc compound events under different scenarios in different areas before and after the tc makes landfall it brings heavy rainfall and high storm surge to the area which is more likely to cause compound disasters under the am rtf scenario if the tc continues to advance it can cause compound disasters in downstream areas under the am frt scenario if the tc does not pass downstream and produces heavy rainfall upstream it can lead to compound events in downstream areas under the am frt scenario the wind speed in the right semicircle of a tc is higher than that in the left semicircle and the tide is highest in the right semicircle if the tc does not make landfall the coastal areas closest to the right half of the tcs experience stronger storm surge storm surge can also occur with rainfall in areas outside the tcs to cause a compound disaster under the am trf scenario 4 4 intensity distribution and possible contribution of compound events caused by tcs storm surge increases the likelihood of compound flooding in coastal areas of china we show the paths of all tcs recorded in the western pacific from 1980 to 2014 we used the tc and loss database identified in different compound scenarios to calculate the tc losses under different compound scenarios the results are shown in fig 11 using am sampling for mechanisms 2 4 we found that the compound events loss in the am rtf scenario caused by tcs was the highest using pot sampling for mechanism 1 we found that the disaster loss was the highest in the pot rt compound scenario and the disaster losses of pot tf and pot rt were almost the same because of the high dependence between rainfall and river discharge overall rainfall was the main reason for tc compound event loss and the tc compound event losses identified by am sampling and pot sampling were similar to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the compound flood potential associated with storm surge we used the nested archimedean copula model to analyze the latitude longitude and time of all tcs identified by mechanisms 1 4 comprehensively evaluating the spatial distribution of compound disasters caused by storm surge not only involves characterizing the frequency and intensity of storm surge we used the storm surge wind speed ratio to measure the storm surge compound flood potential to characterize variation in the storm surge compound flood potential for a location in different months we obtained the storm surge wind speed ratio distribution map based on the latitude and longitude results sampled in different months as we see in fig 12 tcs mainly occurred from july to september the compound flood potential was highest in july and lowest from april to may overall tc compound flood potential was mainly concentrated in waters near hainan and taiwan the center of tcs was in the northeastern part of hainan in june the northwestern part of hainan and the northwestern part of taiwan in july taiwan in august eastern hainan and taiwan in september and southwestern hainan from october to december because the intensity and duration of tcs decrease after they make landfall the center of a tc compound flood potential often occurs in the sea and they often bring compound events along the coast under am rtf and am trf scenarios tcs mostly made landfall from july to september tcs mostly made landfall in hainan taiwan zhejiang shanghai fujian and guangdong tcs made landfall in a greater variety of sites in august after a tc makes landfall the probability of flood disasters that involve rainfall storm surge and river discharge increases 5 conclusion in this study we constructed a framework for assessing compound flood potential in coastal areas taking china s coastal areas as an example this framework identifies compound events under different compound scenarios based on different sampling methods and definitions of compound mechanisms and quantifies the potential of compound floods based on the corresponding sampling results and the results of regional and interannual analysis show that in some places where the potential of compound flood is high the potential of compound flood is still increasing during this process we also analyzed that storm surge was the dominant driving factor leading to this compound event and typhoon was the main climate driving factor of the compound event subsequent in depth research on typhoon compound events has led us to find that the path and intensity of typhoons will affect compound events at the same time through disaster damage analysis we have determined that the main contributing factor to compound event damage is typhoon rain finally according to the spatial and temporal distribution model the intensity distribution map of typhoon complex events is drawn when formulating compound flood disaster prevention and mitigation policies local governments should focus on carrying out disaster prevention measures in areas with high potential for compound floods that have a potential upward trend the formulation of flood control standards should take into account the leading factors of compound events and the main contributing factors of compound event disaster losses when a typhoon comes relevant departments should keep alert and according to the predicted typhoon path and intensity prevent compound flood events in different areas and different scenarios the results of this compound flood potential assessment framework and corresponding control measures are largely depending on local conditions different conditions can affect the selection of sampling method the delimitation of compound areas and the influence of climate driving factors in the compound events sampled by the am method and the pot method in this paper the number of tc compound events is the same and the number of tcs identified is similar to the disaster losses caused by tc compound events there is a strong correlation between heavy rainfall and high river discharge in small watersheds and its impact on the results and solutions still need to be further studied the occurrence of compound events is associated with many weather systems and climate patterns the southeastern coast of china is affected by the subtropical high temperature monsoon chang et al 2000 and tc precipitation in the northwest pacific and the northern coast of china is affected by the temperate storm surge previous studies have shown that the el niño southern oscillation affects the dependence of compound events wu et al 2018 and that sea level rise associated with global warming can exacerbate compound events cazenave and cozannet 2014 moftakhari et al 2017 in this study we performed a spatiotemporal analysis of compound events caused by historical tcs and more research is needed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of other weather systems on compound events credit authorship contribution statement lele zhang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

2725,heavy rainfall coupled with storm surge and river flooding are typical compound flood driving elements which cause much heavier losses than that of single driving element to address this issue we propose a framework for assessing compound flood potential the framework includes three aspects 1 defining and sampling compound events under different scenarios 2 based on kendall correlation joint return period and copula model to quantify compound flood potential 3 explore the impact of typhoons on compound events and generate a spatiotemporal distribution map of typhoon compound events we explore the applicability of this framework by taking china s coastal areas as an example the results show that different definitions of compound events and different sampling methods can affect the quantification results of compound flood potential overall the potential of compound flood in the southern coastal provinces is higher than that in northern provinces and the potential of compound flood is still increasing in some areas with high potential at the same time it is found that typhoon is the most significant conditions leading to compound events and its intensity and path also affect the generation and distribution of compound events the rainfall associated with tropical cyclones is the main contributor to the disaster loss of compound events the framework is based on global data sets for calculation and analysis which can provide reference for compound flood risk assessment in other areas lacking data keywords extreme rainfall storm surge river discharge tropical cyclone copula data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction floods are some of the world s most dangerous natural disasters according to the report human losses caused by disasters 2000 2019 issued by the united nations disaster prevention and mitigation agency flood disasters increased from 1 389 to 3 254 in the last 20 years and storm surge disasters increased from 1 457 to 2 043 accounting for 44 and 28 of the total reported disasters respectively in the past 20 years flood disasters have caused economic losses of 651 billion usd worldwide and storm surge disasters have caused economic losses of 1 390 billion usd unite nations office for disaster risk reduction 2020 there are three main sources of flooding in coastal areas 1 the rise of coastal water levels caused by atmospheric disturbances astronomical tides submarine earthquakes and other factors 2 direct surface runoff stemming from rain and 3 river floods caused by upstream flood discharge fang et al 2021b floods can be especially damaging when more than one of these sources simultaneously or consecutively contributes to flooding tropical cyclones tcs are generally accompanied by heavy rains and storm surge which can trigger severe compound flooding if extreme river runoff and astronomical tides occur simultaneously compound flooding events during typhoons haiyan in 2013 typhoon fett and typhoon lekima in 2019 caused severe damage to coastal areas china is one of the world s fastest growing coastal countries china s coastal low lying areas less than 10 m above sea level account for only 2 of the country s land area but are home to more than 12 of the country s population liu et al 2015 more than 40 of the population resides in coastal provincial administrative regions which contribute nearly 60 of the national gross domestic product approximately 47 of the national capital stock was found in the eastern economic region in 2012 wu et al 2014 china s coastal areas are frequently hit by tcs zhang et al 2021 from 1989 to 2014 storm surge caused 71 billion usd in losses and 4 376 deaths fang et al 2017 harsh natural conditions fragile socio economic conditions and serious human and economic losses make the risk assessment of compound flood very important to china s coastal areas failure to consider the correlations between different flood risk sources can lead to the underestimation of compound flood risk europe and the united states attach great importance to this and have investigated the compound effects of different flood driving factors svensson and jones et al assessed the dependence between ocean tides river discharge and precipitation in the southern and western uk suggesting that higher correlations between risk source lead to higher flood risk svensson and jones 2004 nonlinear combinations of different floods can increase flood costs prime et al studied the physical and economic effects of sea level rise and low probability flood events on british coastal communities prime et al 2015 van den hurk et al analyzed the mechanism and disaster causing scenarios of compound surge and precipitation events in the netherlands and found that the damage caused by different flood hazard scenarios was not consistent at the same time it should also be considered that the generation of compound floods has regional specificity van den hurk et al 2015 however these studies were carried out in a small areas and did not reveal the climatic conditions related to the compound event wahl et al studied the combined flood risk of storm surge and extreme rainfall in major coastal cities in the united states and ghanbari et al studied changes in compound coastal river flood disasters in the united states the risk source correlation and the interannual variation of the combined return period of the compound flood show an upward trend in the risk of compound floods under the background of climate change ghanbari et al 2021 wahl et al 2015 it is worth noting that most of the research on compound flood is to assess the potential of compound flood by investigating the correlation between different flood drivers rather than the risk of compound flood a large number of subsequent studies have used the joint probability function to calculate the return period of compound floods in specific locations including fuzhou china lian et al 2013 the xixiang river in shenzhen tu et al 2018 taiwan beihai khanal et al 2019 and the burreg river mouth in morocco based on the joint flood risk probabilistic analysis the probability of extreme rainfall and extreme tide levels occurring at the same time is very low but when they occur they will bring greater inundation range and water depth zellou and rahali 2019 assessments of compound flood risk have been limited in some regions because of limited amounts of data in recent years global assessments of compound flood risk have been conducted and this research has benefited from global research using simulated storm surge data couasnon et al studied the compound flood potential of extreme river discharge and storm surge on a global scale couasnon et al 2020 bevacqua et al evaluated the compound flood risk between global coastal rainfall and river discharge bevacqua et al 2020 lai et al studied the simultaneous occurrence of heavy rainfall and storm surge on a global scale the evolution of the frequency and intensity of rainfall and its effect on compound flooding had also been studied lai et al 2021 these studies have provided valuable information on compound floods in areas lacking in observations such as the coastal areas of south america and africa in addition most of the previous studies focused on compound scenarios generated by two flood risk sources there is no comprehensive evaluation of the dependence of three flood risk sources in a region previous studies of flooding risk in china have been conducted on specific regions and the effects of combinations of two sources of flood risk lian et al 2013 tu et al 2018 however up to now no research has fully considered the impacts of different compound scenarios nor the factors leading to compound floods chen and liu 2014 xu et al 2014 fang et al studied the flood potential of storm surge and extreme rainfall in coastal areas of china but did not assess the correlations between the three risk sources fang et al 2021a in view of the difficulty in obtaining tidal level and river data in china comprehensive regional assessments of china s coastal areas only uses a few years data lacking the latest data we found that no studies have explored the potential of multivariate compound flooding and conventional correlation measures cannot measure the correlation of multivariate drivers the complex compound scenarios make it difficult to unify the compound flood potential and some studies are insufficient to analysis of the impact of climate factors related to compound events in order to meet the challenge of compound flood a potential risk assessment framework of compound flood based on global data set is put forward which provides a reference for the risk assessment of compound flood in areas lacking data in this framework based on kendall correlation joint return period and copula model we quantified the potential of compound flood under different compound scenarios in addition we also analyze the interannual variation of compound flood potential and the occurrence probability of extreme compound flood within the framework in the analysis of climate factors we analyzed the impact of typhoon intensity and track on the generation and distribution of compound events based on typhoon data to uniformly display the compound flood potential of the region we plotted the intensity distribution of typhoon compound events based on the nested archimedes copula model this paper is divided into five parts as follows section 2 presents the global reanalysis datasets selected for this study and the delineation of compound regions section 3 mainly introduces the sampling and definition of compound events the quantitative method of compound flood potential the identification of climate driving factors of compound events and the construction of typhoon compound event distribution model section 4 presents the results of the quantification of the compound flood potential reveals the trend of the interannual variation of the compound flood potential discusses the influence of the typhoon track and intensity on the compound event and draws the intensity distribution of the typhoon compound event the conclusion and outlook are given in section 5 2 study region and data 2 1 study region we studied the coastal area of china which includes 12 provinces 2 municipalities and 2 special administrative regions the coastal area was divided into 13 regions according to administrative divisions of the coastal area the compound events of hong kong and macau were included for guangdong numbers 0 12 represent hainan guangxi guangdong fujian taiwan zhejiang shanghai jiangsu shandong hebei tianjin beijing and liaoning respectively in coastal areas rainfall and storm surge can often occur simultaneously storm surge can flood coastal areas directly through any body of water on or near the coast and rainfall will increase the risk of coastal flooding during hurricane ike storm surge directly caused flooding 50 km from the coast world meteorological organization 2021 thus 50 km along the coastline was considered the compound area for rainfall and storm surge i e the area where both rainfall and storm surge can occur simultaneously the compound area for rainfall and river discharge as well as storm surge and river discharge was determined based on the global flood awareness system glofas harrigan et al 2020 and consists of a river unit with an upstream catchment area greater than 1 000 km2 tides can travel about 200 km inland along the river causing the river to block so river units within 200 km of the coastline are designated as compound areas of storm surge and river flow hoitink and jay 2016 beijing is also within 200 km along the coast and thus was located within the study area the different ranges are shown in fig 1 2 2 data the rainfall data were the products of daily precipitation analysis based on the cpc global unified meter from noaa noaa physical sciences laboratory 2021a the storm surge data were derived from the global reanalysis of storm surge and extreme sea level muis et al 2016 river discharge data were obtained from the global modeled daily data of river discharge from glofas this data set was simulated by forcing a hydrological modeling chain with inputs from a global reanalysis harrigan et al 2019 data for the historical simulation were from january 1 1979 to the present we use the 0 1 resolution river discharge data as the benchmark downscale the 0 5 resolution rainfall data and use bilinear interpolation to convert the storm surge data to 0 1 resolution raster data to determine the weather patterns associated with the identified compound events as well as the contribution of tcs of different paths and intensities to the compound scenario we used the wind field barometric pressure and rainfall data in the noaa cires doe 20th century reanalysis v3 noaa physical sciences laboratory 2021b the cma best path data set provided data on the position intensity and central wind speed of tcs in the northwest pacific ocean since 1949 lu et al 2021 ying et al 2014 the intensity and path of the tcs affect the disaster loss of the tcs to determine the actual loss of the compound events of identified tcs we used the death toll the number of people affected and economic losses in the tc disaster data set to determine the actual losses of the tc compound events under different compound scenarios the original data were from 1951 to 2012 yap et al 2015 we used the china marine disaster bulletin and other news sources to supplement the disaster loss data for 2013 2014 china oceanic infomation network 2013 details of the data of different data sets are shown in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 identification of compound events compound floods in coastal areas refer to floods that occur in coastal areas with compound effects of various meteorological hydrological and hydrodynamic processes the complex interaction between precipitation storm surge and river discharge can cause or exacerbate the impact of coastal flooding through a variety of mechanisms bevacqua et al 2020 wahl et al 2015 1 the joint occurrence of rain storm surge and river flood may elevate water levels to a point where flooding is initiated or its impacts exacerbated 2 rainfall upstream flooding or both occur simultaneously following large scale storm surge 3 rainfall storm surge or both occur simultaneously following large scale upstream flooding and 4 extreme rainfall causes flooding following moderate storm surge a moderate flood or both occurring simultaneously commonly used methods for the identification of compound events include the annual maximum method am ganguli and merz 2019 lai et al 2021 and the peak over threshold method pot am is widely used for sampling extreme scenarios whereas pot is used for sampling more compound events we used different methods to identify compound events in light of the various compound flood action mechanisms for mechanism 1 we set a threshold for the historical rainfall storm surge and river discharge data a compound event occurred when two or three of them simultaneously exceeded the threshold there are four compound scenarios for mechanism 1 compound flooding stemming from rainfall and storm surge pot rt rainfall and river discharge pot rf storm surge and river flooding pot tf and rainfall storm surge and river discharge pot rtf the threshold was estimated using the provided data points we set the threshold to 95 in the bivariate compound scenario and 90 in the trivariate scenario fang et al 2021a ridder et al 2020 for mechanism 2 the maximum storm surge each year was determined and the maximum rainfall and river discharge within 1 day was determined if the rainfall was less than 1 mm the second highest storm surge in the year was determined until rainfall was greater than 1 there are three scenarios for mechanism 2 compound flooding stemming from extreme storm surge and rainfall am tr extreme storm surge and river flooding am tf and the combination of extreme storm surge rainfall and river flooding am trf for mechanism 3 the maximum annual river discharge was determined and then the maximum storm surge and rainfall within 1 day was determined similar to mechanism 2 rainfall needed to be greater than 1 there are three scenarios for mechanism 3 compound flooding stemming from extreme river discharge and rainfall am fr extreme river discharge and storm surge am ft and extreme river flooding rainfall and storm surge am frt for mechanism 4 the maximum annual rainfall was determined and then the maximum storm surge and river discharge within 1 day were determined there are three scenarios for mechanism 4 compound flooding stemming from extreme rainfall and storm surge am rt extreme rainfall and river flooding am rf and extreme rainfall storm surge and river flooding am rtf during sampling we take into account both simultaneous and delayed events in compound events mechanism 1 collects samples of simultaneous events and mechanism 2 adds a time window of 1 day so samples of delayed events are collected fig 2 shows the results of different sampling methods using the unit where guangzhou city is located as an example the blue line in the figure is the 95 threshold set in the bivariate compound scenario and the red line is the 90 threshold set in the multivariate compound scenario the circles represent samples sampled by the am method and the boxes represent samples sampled by the pot method the compound events we define and sample do not necessarily have actual impacts but the probability of compound events occurring and the dependencies among flood drivers can be considered as precursors to the impact of actual compound events ridder et al 2020 3 2 quantification of compound flood potential 3 2 1 joint return period for mechanism 1 we counted the number of compound events that occurred in each grid in 12 784 days from 1980 to 2014 and divided it by the total number of days in the study period to calculate the joint probability of occurrence for each grid cell the result is then expressed as return period rp by dividing the inverse of the probability by the number of days per year we use this to quantify the compound flood potential of bivariate and trivariate scenarios ridder et al 2020 1 t i 1 e x c e e d t h e t h r e s h o l d 0 d o e s n o t e x c e e d t h e t h r e s h o l d 2 r p 12784 365 t t i 3 2 2 kendall s τ and tail dependence in mechanisms 2 4 we used the kendall τ metric to quantify compound flooding potential kendall τ provides better overall parameter estimates with smaller asymptotic variance it is also less susceptible to outliers chok 2010 an equivalent definition of the kendall rank coefficient can be given as follows two observations are called concording if the two members of one observation are larger than the respective members of the other observation in a sample of size n with n pairs of observations let nc and nd denote the total number of pairs of concording and discording observations respectively with this notation the kendall s τ is given by 3 τ 2 n c n d n n 1 kendall s τ measures the consistency of changes between variables the value of τ is between 1 and 1 τ 1 indicates that the change of x is completely consistent with the change of y τ 1 indicates that the change of x is completely consistent with the reverse change of y when τ 0 it is impossible to judge whether there is a correlation between the two however τ cannot describe the entire correlation structure of the joint distribution when the variables are positively correlated we need to calculate the tail dependence between the variables to better understand the correlation the standard method for determining whether the variables are tail correlated is to examine the upper tail correlation coefficient and lower tail correlation coefficient denoted by λu and λl respectively joe 1997 c is bivariate archimedes copula functions and u is marginal distributions of variables 4 lim u 1 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ u 5 lim u 0 1 2 u c u u 1 u λ l 3 2 3 copula model the copula model is one of the most widely used joint probability models in hydrology copula model can facilitate us to calculate the joint return period of bivariate and trivariate compound floods and at the same time can help us build a spatiotemporal distribution model of typhoon compound events according to sklar s theorem durante et al 2013 any trivariate joint cumulative distribution function can be represented by a univariate marginal distribution function and a copula that describes the structure of dependencies between variables according to sklar s theorem let h be an n dimensional distribution function whose marginal distribution is f1 f2 fn then there is an n copula function c such that for any u rn 6 h u 1 u 2 u n c f 1 u 1 f 2 u 2 f n u n it can be seen that the general formula of the copula function is as follows 7 c u 1 u 2 u n h f 1 u 1 f 2 1 u 2 f n 1 u n copula functions can be generally divided into three categories ellipse archimedean and quadratic aas and berg 2009 savu and trede 2010 the archimedean copula with one parameter is the most widely used the construction of trivariate archimedean copula is usually based on bivariate according to the different construction methods it can be divided into two types symmetrical and asymmetrical bivariate archimedean copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrology include gumble copula clayton copula function frank copula joe copula and ali mikhail haq amh copula karmakar and simonovic 2009 and commonly used symmetrical trivariate copula are m3 copula m4 copula m5 copula and m6 copula grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 the marginal distribution of variables in different scenarios uses nine distributions commonly used in hydrology and ocean engineering table 2 a kolmogorov smirnov test and cramer von mises test were used to fit the optimal distribution of variable data the parameters of the copula function were determined by the maximum likelihood method akaike information criterion akaike 1998 and bayesian information criterion schwarz 1978 were used to select the optimal copula and the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the joint distribution for the trivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 we used the nested archimedean copula model to perform a statistical analysis of trivariate compound floods and the and return period salvadori 2004 to calculate the joint return period 3 3 regional seasonal and interannual analysis in the regional analysis we had to take into account differences in coverage under different scenarios we counted the number of compound events in different regions and different scenarios according to the definition of mechanism 1 the contributions of different scenarios in different regions were analyzed by calculating the proportion of compound events in each region under different scenarios for mechanism 2 4 we use the average τ value within the region to represent the compound flood potential within the region and compare the compound flood potential of the region under different scenarios to determine the contribution of different compound scenarios within the region for the seasonal analysis we counted the number of compound events from 1980 to 2014 for each month separately in mechanisms 1 and we assessed the compound flood potential for each month by calculating the proportion of the number of compound events in each month quantification of compound flood potential in mechanisms 2 4 fails to reveal seasonality based on the rolling window calculations of the rank dependence trend between the grid variables in the area for the 35 years of data data of the first 15 years were needed to ensure that estimates based on τ were robust chebana and ouarda 2021 the size of the obtained rolling window series was 20 years each time step moves one year we calculated the linear trend in τ under different scenarios for each grid cell since 1995 based on the rolling window even if the τ change was not significant it could still greatly affect the results of the joint regression wahl et al 2015 3 4 climate drivers associated with compound events we identified compound events caused by tcs and compound events caused by non tc in each cell we divided tc compound events into different extreme compound events based on the two or three mechanisms occurring simultaneously if the compound event sampled in the cell occurs within 1 day of the occurrence of tcs within 200 km it is defined as a tc compound event yap et al 2015 generally speaking the weather conditions associated with compound events are characterized by deep low pressure cyclones and high precipitation lai et al 2021 we used sea level pressure wind direction from noaa cires doe twentieth century reanalysis version 3 and tc path data from the cma best path data set to analyze the climatic drivers of compound disasters we compared the weather scales and weather patterns of tc compound events and non tc compound events under the three compound scenarios of mechanisms 2 4 3 5 construction of spatiotemporal distribution model to comprehensively evaluate the spatial distribution of typhoon compound floods it is necessary to characterize not only the frequency of typhoons but also the intensity of typhoons we use the total intensity of the typhoon the accumulation of wind speeds at the center of the typhoon to measure the risk of typhoon compound flooding we used the nested archimedean copula model and cma tcs path data to construct the joint distribution of tc compound events zhao et al 2020 the joint distribution function is as follows 8 location c 1 longitude u l a t i t u d e v 9 joint d i s t r i b u t i o n o f t c s c o m p o u n d e v e n t s c 2 time t c 1 longitude u l a t i t u d e v c1 and c2 are bivariate archimedes copula functions table 2 u is the marginal distribution of longitude v is the marginal distribution of latitude and t is the marginal distribution of month 4 results 4 1 quantifying the potential of compound flood under different scenarios 4 1 1 bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 here we use the kendall tau value to quantify the compound flood potential under the bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 the distribution results of the compound flood potential in different scenarios are shown in fig 3 in the two scenarios am rt and am tr in which rainfall and storm surge are compounded regions with higher dependence were observed in the coastal areas of guangxi hainan northern fujian taiwan zhejiang and eastern shandong the overall dependence of the am tr scenario was higher than that of the am rt scenario fig 3a and d indicating that the occurrence of compound events in coastal areas of china are more affected by storm surge the difference in dependence between guangdong and jiangsu was the largest of these two scenarios in the two scenarios am rf and am fr where rainfall and river discharge are compounded the dependence was generally high and the distribution pattern was similar fig 3b and e this is to be expected given that rainfall is the main cause of river flooding however some rivers with larger discharge and larger upstream catchment areas had lower τ values such as the xijiang and beijiang of the pearl river and in the vicinity of the yangtze river estuary the lower dependence of these river grids indicates that higher river confluence discharge weaken the dependence between rainfall and river discharge in the two scenarios am tf and am ft where storm surge and river discharge are compounded the dependence was generally low high dependence was observed in hainan fujian taiwan zhejiang hebei and liaoning the am tf scenario showed higher dependence than the am ft scenario fig 3c and f which suggests that the occurrence of compound events in coastal areas are more affected by storm surge compound events caused by storm surge are easier to identify in general the coastal compound flood potential of southern china was higher than that of northern china under the bivariate scenarios of mechanisms 2 4 4 1 2 bivariate scenarios in mechanisms 1 in mechanism 1 we quantify the compound flood potential by counting the joint return period of historical compound events and the potential distribution is shown in fig 4 the distribution of mechanism 1 and mechanism 2 was similar the distribution of the compound events return period under the pot rt mechanism was similar to the distribution of dependence under the am rt and am tr mechanism larger values were observed in guangxi hainan zhejiang taiwan shandong and liaoning the return period of compound events under the pot rf mechanism was the same as that under the am rf and am fr scenarios the distribution of the compound events return period under the pot tf mechanism was quite different from that under the am tf mechanism the main difference lies in the high compound events return period and high dependence in the coastal areas of fujian and zhejiang overall the compound flood potential in the northern area under the bivariate scenario in mechanism 1 was higher than that in the coastal areas of south china which is inconsistent with the conclusions for mechanisms 2 4 we suspect that pot only calculates the compound flood potential under the simultaneous occurrence of different flood sources while the am method sampling mechanism 2 4 calculates the compound flood potential under both the consecutive and simultaneous occurrence scenarios at the same time in addition rainfall and river discharge are generally lower in the north than in the south which indicates that there is a closer connection between events wherein thresholds are exceeded in the northern threshold exceeding event and the weather system the higher compound flood potential in shandong hebei and liaoning might be related to temperate storm surge 4 1 3 multivariate scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 for the multivariate compound scenarios in mechanisms 2 4 we quantify compound flood potential by calculating the combined return period of once in a decade rainfall storm surge and river flooding with the help of a nested archimedes copula model fig 7 showed that the extreme compound events in the am rtf and am frt scenarios mainly occurred in hainan guangxi guangdong fujian taiwan zhejiang shandong and liaoning the compound flood potential was higher and more concentrated in liaoning for am trf the compound flood potential on the side close to the sea was greater than that on the other side which is related to the mechanism of storm surge in this scenario the compound events caused by storm surge are more likely to appear significantly higher compound flood potential was observed for hainan fujian zhejiang taiwan and shandong 4 1 4 regional and seasonal analysis to more clearly compare and analyze the compound flood potential of different scenarios in different regions under the four mechanisms we calculated the average τ value of different provinces and municipalities in mechanisms 2 4 under different scenarios and for different provinces and municipalities the proportion of historical compound events in different provinces and scenarios for mechanism 1 is shown in the heat map on the right side of fig 4 comparing the am tr and am rt scenarios in the heat map in fig 4 in most regions the high storm surge compound event is more dependent than the high rainfall compound event this regular also appears in the southern coastal areas of the am tf and am ft scenarios which once again proves that the generation of compound events in the southern region is greatly affected by tc however the highly similar dependencies in the am rf and am fr scenarios prove that the intra grid rainfall has a higher contribution to the intra grid channel flow thus leading to a tighter dependency between high rainfall and high river flow because no seasonality was detected for mechanisms 2 4 according to the τ value we only performed seasonal analysis for mechanism 1 line charts in fig 4a d show that historical compound events under different scenarios primarily occurred from june to september which coincided with most of the rainy season and the season for tcs 4 2 temporal changes in rank dependence and tail dependence between compound flood sources under different scenarios to better understand changes in the dependence of variables in different scenarios in china s coastal areas in recent decades we used the rolling window method to calculate the linear trend in changes in the τ value over the past 20 years fig 5 shows the pattern of dependence between variables in different scenarios over the past 20 years under the am rt scenario dependence increased in zhejiang shanghai southeastern jiangsu the leizhou peninsula of guangdong and the northeastern side of hainan under the am tr scenario an increase in dependence was observed in the guangxi the northwestern side of hainan and the coastal areas of guangdong fujian zhejiang shanghai the southeast side of jiangsu as well as hebei in the am rf and am fr scenarios increases in dependence were mainly observed in zhejiang fujian guangdong taiwan tianjin and hainan the patterns in the am tf and am tr scenarios were similar in the am ft scenario the dependence increased in the coastal areas of fujian zhejiang and taiwan comparison of figs 3 and 5 revealed that areas such as guangxi hainan zhejiang and shanghai had high τ values and these τ values were continuously increasing indicating that more frequent and more serious compound events are possible in the future no single correlation coefficient can reflect the correlation structure of the entire data set we thus used tail dependences to analyze the dependence of different scenarios the tail dependences in different scenarios were measured for mechanism 2 4 we were more focused on the dependence with the upper tail the probability of extreme compound events in areas with upper tail dependences is predicted to greatly increase fig 6 shows the distribution of tail dependence in different scenarios a positive value represents the upper tail dependence a negative value represents the lower tail dependence and the gray area represents no tail dependence 4 3 weather patterns of compound events under different scenarios we used tc path data to define tc compound events we counted the number of tc compound events in each grid cell in the coastal area of china over a 35 year sample the result was shown in fig 8 there is little difference between guangzhou and shanghai in social and economic conditions but there are great differences in climate meteorology and location characteristics by comparing the distribution characteristics of compound events in the two places the impact of climate meteorology and location factors on compound events can be well analyzed guangzhou is close to the estuary of the pearl river and shanghai is close to the estuary of the yangtze river the complex dynamic conditions of the river and the sea will cause serious flood losses we used grid data from guangzhou and shanghai the two location is shown as red dots in fig 1 to analyze the proportion of tc events in different scenarios and the weather patterns of tc compound events and non tc compound events under the am rtf scenario 13 out of 35 years of data in shanghai consisted of tc compound events and only 8 were detected in guangzhou however under the am trf scenario there were 17 tc compound events in shanghai and 29 tc compound events in guangzhou in the am frt scenario the number of tc compound events in shanghai and guangzhou was 8 and 5 respectively tc events were more likely to cause compound events in am trf scenarios followed by am rtf scenarios and the lowest number was observed for am frt scenarios the greater number of non tc events in guangzhou in the am rtf scenario may be caused by extreme rainfall which decreases the dependence between rainfall and storm surge nevertheless the potential for compound flooding cannot be ignored because 8 storm surge events were identified and all 8 storm surge events resulted in greater harm as shown in figs 9 and 10 we analyzed the climate patterns of the tc compound events and the non tc compound events by examining the pressure wind field and rainfall in the am rtf and am frt scenarios when non tc compound events occur the rainfall in both the local area and upstream areas is large non tc compound events in the am trf scenario were mainly caused by pronounced pressure gradients and strong winds for tc compound events we analyzed the correlation between different tc paths and different scenarios of compound events whether a tc makes landfall and its path and intensity before and after landfall affects the probability of tc compound events under different scenarios in different areas before and after the tc makes landfall it brings heavy rainfall and high storm surge to the area which is more likely to cause compound disasters under the am rtf scenario if the tc continues to advance it can cause compound disasters in downstream areas under the am frt scenario if the tc does not pass downstream and produces heavy rainfall upstream it can lead to compound events in downstream areas under the am frt scenario the wind speed in the right semicircle of a tc is higher than that in the left semicircle and the tide is highest in the right semicircle if the tc does not make landfall the coastal areas closest to the right half of the tcs experience stronger storm surge storm surge can also occur with rainfall in areas outside the tcs to cause a compound disaster under the am trf scenario 4 4 intensity distribution and possible contribution of compound events caused by tcs storm surge increases the likelihood of compound flooding in coastal areas of china we show the paths of all tcs recorded in the western pacific from 1980 to 2014 we used the tc and loss database identified in different compound scenarios to calculate the tc losses under different compound scenarios the results are shown in fig 11 using am sampling for mechanisms 2 4 we found that the compound events loss in the am rtf scenario caused by tcs was the highest using pot sampling for mechanism 1 we found that the disaster loss was the highest in the pot rt compound scenario and the disaster losses of pot tf and pot rt were almost the same because of the high dependence between rainfall and river discharge overall rainfall was the main reason for tc compound event loss and the tc compound event losses identified by am sampling and pot sampling were similar to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the compound flood potential associated with storm surge we used the nested archimedean copula model to analyze the latitude longitude and time of all tcs identified by mechanisms 1 4 comprehensively evaluating the spatial distribution of compound disasters caused by storm surge not only involves characterizing the frequency and intensity of storm surge we used the storm surge wind speed ratio to measure the storm surge compound flood potential to characterize variation in the storm surge compound flood potential for a location in different months we obtained the storm surge wind speed ratio distribution map based on the latitude and longitude results sampled in different months as we see in fig 12 tcs mainly occurred from july to september the compound flood potential was highest in july and lowest from april to may overall tc compound flood potential was mainly concentrated in waters near hainan and taiwan the center of tcs was in the northeastern part of hainan in june the northwestern part of hainan and the northwestern part of taiwan in july taiwan in august eastern hainan and taiwan in september and southwestern hainan from october to december because the intensity and duration of tcs decrease after they make landfall the center of a tc compound flood potential often occurs in the sea and they often bring compound events along the coast under am rtf and am trf scenarios tcs mostly made landfall from july to september tcs mostly made landfall in hainan taiwan zhejiang shanghai fujian and guangdong tcs made landfall in a greater variety of sites in august after a tc makes landfall the probability of flood disasters that involve rainfall storm surge and river discharge increases 5 conclusion in this study we constructed a framework for assessing compound flood potential in coastal areas taking china s coastal areas as an example this framework identifies compound events under different compound scenarios based on different sampling methods and definitions of compound mechanisms and quantifies the potential of compound floods based on the corresponding sampling results and the results of regional and interannual analysis show that in some places where the potential of compound flood is high the potential of compound flood is still increasing during this process we also analyzed that storm surge was the dominant driving factor leading to this compound event and typhoon was the main climate driving factor of the compound event subsequent in depth research on typhoon compound events has led us to find that the path and intensity of typhoons will affect compound events at the same time through disaster damage analysis we have determined that the main contributing factor to compound event damage is typhoon rain finally according to the spatial and temporal distribution model the intensity distribution map of typhoon complex events is drawn when formulating compound flood disaster prevention and mitigation policies local governments should focus on carrying out disaster prevention measures in areas with high potential for compound floods that have a potential upward trend the formulation of flood control standards should take into account the leading factors of compound events and the main contributing factors of compound event disaster losses when a typhoon comes relevant departments should keep alert and according to the predicted typhoon path and intensity prevent compound flood events in different areas and different scenarios the results of this compound flood potential assessment framework and corresponding control measures are largely depending on local conditions different conditions can affect the selection of sampling method the delimitation of compound areas and the influence of climate driving factors in the compound events sampled by the am method and the pot method in this paper the number of tc compound events is the same and the number of tcs identified is similar to the disaster losses caused by tc compound events there is a strong correlation between heavy rainfall and high river discharge in small watersheds and its impact on the results and solutions still need to be further studied the occurrence of compound events is associated with many weather systems and climate patterns the southeastern coast of china is affected by the subtropical high temperature monsoon chang et al 2000 and tc precipitation in the northwest pacific and the northern coast of china is affected by the temperate storm surge previous studies have shown that the el niño southern oscillation affects the dependence of compound events wu et al 2018 and that sea level rise associated with global warming can exacerbate compound events cazenave and cozannet 2014 moftakhari et al 2017 in this study we performed a spatiotemporal analysis of compound events caused by historical tcs and more research is needed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of other weather systems on compound events credit authorship contribution statement lele zhang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

2726,low lying coastal peatlands are unique ecosystems where water levels and salt input with seawater determine vegetation and greenhouse gas emissions while the export of nutrients and carbon via submarine groundwater discharge influences biogeochemical processes in shallow coastal sediments anthropogenic interferences like drainage and diking strongly impact the water flow this study aimed at understanding the hydrological system in a rewetted coastal fen typical for the southern baltic sea groundwater observation wells were installed both in the peat layer and underlying sands and continuous readings of water levels and specific conductivities were combined with groundwater dating and major ion composition analyses apparent tritium helium groundwater ages between 7 and more

in combination with water levels chloride concentrations showed a homogeneous fraction of 30 sea water throughout the aquifer despite differing groundwater ages drainage ditches still affect groundwater flow today depending on the peat and aquifer thickness both nutrient enriched brackish deeper groundwater and freshwater from the precipitation fed dune dike discharge to the sea we conclude that rewetting of coastal peatlands mainly affects the groundwater in the upper peat with little impact on the underlying aquifer and might revive submarine groundwater discharge and associated nutrient fluxes despite low hydraulic gradients keywords coastal peatland wetland submarine groundwater discharge apparent tritium helium groundwater ages nutrients groundwater flow paths

pointed out that mangroves and salt marshes may disproportionally contribute to sgd related biogeochemical inputs to oceans due to high carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations but are hitherto understudied coastal peatlands are comparable carbon rich low gradient systems and are likewise understudied the drainage of peatlands tremendously alters their hydrological conditions peatlands in europe have been drained extensively for agricultural purposes forestry or peat excavation joosten et al 2017 drainage and associated aeration and degradation of the peat results in land subsidence pronger et al 2014 peat compaction whittington and price 2006 increased co2 emissions erkens et al 2016 and loss in ecological diversity vasander et al 2003 joosten et al 2017 peat decomposition involves a decrease in pore size and a strong reduction of the hydraulic conductivity hallema et al 2015 tiemeyer et al 2017 leading to irreversible changes in the hydraulic properties of the peat and stronger water table fluctuations whittington and price 2006 changes in the hydrological regime and a lowering of the water table due to drainage can thus alter water flow patterns water composition and vegetation patterns siegel and glaser 1987 van loon et al 2009 kopp et al 2013 the socio economical value of coastal peatlands as flood retention areas and carbon sinks has been recognised and restoring previously drained peatlands has thus become an important measure expected ecosystem services after rewetting are most prominently decreased co2 emissions and an intensified carbon

the peatland and knowledge of the groundwater flow regime is essential for the success of peatland restoration although flow patterns and water fluxes in coastal peatlands are complex and their understanding is the basis for any biogeochemical or ecological interpretation field observations and investigations disentangling the hydraulic system are scarce this study aims at contributing towards filling this gap the peatland considered is a rewetted degraded coastal fen where both the ground and the surface water via a ditch system are hydraulically connected to the baltic sea the

vegetation succession due to seasonal water level changes koch et al 2017 are well studied however local differences in geochemical composition in the peat koebsch et al 2019 the varying thickness of the peat layer kolp 1957 dahms 1991 krüger 1995 and its extent into the baltic sea kreuzburg et al 2018 suggest a complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological system little is known about groundwater flow patterns and water quality in the shallow aquifer below the peat the specific aims of this study were i to identify groundwater flow patterns and related controls of water table fluctuations and ii to estimate groundwater discharge rates from the peatland to the sea forming a pathway for land derived solutes for this purpose sediment cores were taken and hydraulic heads and specific conductivities in the different hydrogeological units were monitored in addition the distributions of major ions nutrients doc and dic dissolved inorganic carbon in conjunction with apparent tritium helium ages were determined 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the study area and nature reserve heiligensee and hütelmoor is located in north eastern germany at the baltic sea coast near the city of rostock fig 1 the average annual precipitation at the weather station in rostock warnemünde at a distance of 6 km is 621 mm the average annual temperature is 9 2 c 1947 to 2018 dwd n d the area was shaped by the weichselian ice age kolp 1957 glacial till was deposited with the expansion of the glaciers with their retreat river valleys and deltas developed leading to the deposition of 2 5 to 15 m thick glacio fluvial fine sands on top of the till kolp 1957 which nowadays form a shallow aquifer the littorina transgression 8 000 1 200 bp entailed a continuous rise of the groundwater level resulting in the development of a paludification fen from around 7 000 years bp onwards kreuzburg et al 2018 when the sea level rise slowed down lampe 2002 gyttja developed first in depressions followed partly by peat consisting of wood kreuzburg et al 2018 the dominating peat type consists of moderately to strongly decomposed sedges carex and reed phragmites australis the surrounding forest grows on a slightly acidic podsol the peatland receives water from the surrounding forest before anthropogenic interference small creeks originating in the forest drained directly into the baltic sea moderate drainage of the peatland started in the 18th century hro 2017 by construction of a few ditches in 1976 a dense network of ditches that still exists today was built to enable use as grassland the ditch system originates from the surrounding forest and exits the peatland at its south eastern edge via the main ditch prahmgraben downstream the water runs through the nature reserve radelsee before entering the harbour area with connection to the warnow river and the baltic sea fig 1 extensive drainage of the peatland was performed through pumping via a pumping station from 1976 until 1991 and led to a compaction and degradation of the upper decimetres of the peat the elevation of the peatland nowadays is between 0 15 and 0 75 m a s l above sea level and peat thickness is up to 3 m in the central peatland near the coast and thins out towards the forest the size of the peatland is 350 ha renaturation started in december 2009 when the water table was raised by construction of a ground sill at the outlet of the ditch system at about 0 4 m a s l today the surface water catchment fig 1 of the peatland is 750 ha the size of the groundwater catchment of the peatland is unknown but reaches up to 15 km further inland lung 2016 the surface water level is balanced by the ditch system and is above ground surface in most parts of the peatland typically with a lowering of the water level in late summer and subsequent increase in winter miegel et al 2016 most of the groundwater in the surrounding elevated forest still drains into the ditch system and passes the peatland miegel et al 2016 reed rushes and sedges are the dominant plants within the peatland interrupted by areas of open surface water where hydrophytes expand koch et al 2017 the peatland adjoins the baltic sea along a 3 km long shoreline and is separated by an up to 40 m wide dune dike from the 50 m wide beach the dune dike was initially constructed in 1903 and heightened in 1963 and prevents the peatland from being flooded inundations occurred 1872 1904 1913 14 1949 and 1954 kolp 1957 afterwards only in 1995 a breach in the dune dike occurred in its northern part near the natural freshwater lake heiligensee causing inundation and salinization of the peatland maintenance of the dike was stopped in 2000 seawater can enter the peatland not only over the dune dike but also via the ditch system which occurs when the sea level exceeds the height of the ground sill about 0 4 m a s l and the water level of the peatland miegel et al 2017 selle et al 2016 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 geological investigations sixteen sediment cores were drilled down to a max depth of 15 m a s l with a percussion driller and open metal rods of 4 cm diameter fig 1 to assess the peat thickness in more detail peat probings were conducted hereby a 1 cm diameter metal rod is pushed through the peat until the resistance indicates the beginning of the sand layer in addition data on peat thickness from dahms 1991 and krüger 1995 were transferred into the current height reference system nhn 1992 and the peat depth distribution was interpolated for the whole peatland using kriging all drilling and probing locations as well as the ground sill were levelled with a digital level leica sprinter 250 m or real time kinematic and differential gps leica viva net rover the sediments in selected ditches were assessed using a sludge sampler furthermore the depth of ditches was measured using a plumb line from a boat the selected ditches were the main ditch over its full length and small ditches connected to the main ditch as well as the ditch at the border to the forest 2 2 2 field instrumentation a total of 14 groundwater observation wells were installed at 7 locations fig 1 observation wells are arranged as well nests in the following referred to as measuring points mp with filter screens in different geologic layers dune sand ds peat p and lower sand ls also referred to as aquifer in addition three wells were installed in ditches dctr in the central part of the peatland next to mp6 and dout1 and dout2 above and below the ground sill at the outlet of the surface water catchment respectively all 17 observation wells were equipped with data loggers to record pressure p temperature t and mostly electrical conductivity ec dipper ptec pt or apt seba hydrometrie in 15 minute intervals for further details see supplementary material s1 density was calculated internally from ec and temperature after fofonoff and millard 1983 and ec was converted to specific conductivity sc air pressure was measured at station mp2 the overall measurement error of the hydraulic heads is composed of the errors associated with levelling of the wells estimated to 0 2 cm for digital levelling and 2 cm for differential gps cable length of the data logger estimated to 0 5 cm the air pressure measurement 1 5 cm not for mp8 and 10 with relative pressure measurements and the accuracy of the logger s pressure transducer 0 5 cm it thus amounts to up to 2 7 cm for the wells levelled with a digital level mp6 10 dout1 2 and to up to 4 5 cm for the wells levelled with differential gps mp1 3 dctr whereby the error due to air pressure measurement is consistent between the wells the error in hydraulic head measurements has been reported to be typically within a few centimetres rau et al 2019 2 2 3 hydraulic conductivity falling head and rising head slug tests were performed in all wells the data was analysed with aqtesolv software provided by hydrosolve inc https www aqtesolv com using the kgs model kansas geological survey hyder et al 1994 to obtain radial hydraulic conductivity parameters for the wells installed in peat data from the permanently installed data loggers were used to evaluate the slug test due to the long recovery times of hours to days 2 2 4 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were obtained from all groundwater wells except for mp3 due to technical problems in august 2017 and in april 2018 before sampling water in the wells was pumped with a submersible pump until the in situ parameters sc ph temperature and oxygen stabilized in situ parameters were measured with a smartroll mp multiparameter probe in situ u s a the volume of water pumped out prior to sampling was at least twice the volume of the well surface water samples were taken manually in undisturbed water using a container the samples for analysis of cations and anions see below for details were filtered with 0 2 µm cellulose acetate syringe filters rotilabo germany that for phosphate and dissolved carbon with 0 45 polyether sulphone syringe filters sarstedt germany and then filled into 50 ml plastic bottles the filters were rinsed with 10 ml of sample water prior to use samples for analysis of cations were acidified with 100 µl methane sulfonic acid 99 extra pure the samples were cooled at 4 c if analysed within a few days or frozen at 20 c until the analysis additional samples for tritium helium analysis were taken according to sültenfuβ et al 2011 in the lower sand at observation wells 1ls 2ls 6ls 7ls and 9ls between 25th january and 7th february 2017 2 3 laboratory analyses 2 3 1 geochemistry the analysis of anions cl br so4 2 and cations mg2 ca2 na k nh4 was done with anion and cation chromatography dx320 and dx500 dionex u s a respectively the columns used were as11 hc for anion and cs16 for cation chromatography and the eluents applied were methane sulfonic acid 18 mm for analysis of anions and koh 18 mm for cations po4 3 was analysed using a continuous flow analyser seal analytical total dissolved carbon tc and dic were measured using the dimatoc 2000 dimatec analysentechnik gmbh germany and doc was subsequently calculated by subtracting dic from tc detection limits and uncertainties resulting from accuracy and precision of the applied methods are given in the supplementary material table s4 2 2 3 2 groundwater ages apparent piston flow groundwater ages were determined with the tritium helium method and called t 3he ages the samples were analysed at the bremen helium isotope lab sültenfuβ et al 2009 each sample was analysed twice for details see supplementary material s2 anthropogenic tritium 3h or t was emitted in large quantities into the stratosphere during over ground tests of hydrogen bombs between 1955 and 1963 solomon and cook 2000 it reacts to the water molecule hto and becomes part of the hydrological cycle radioactive 3h decays to 3he henceforth tritiogenic 3hetri with a half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 concentrations are given as a hydrogen isotope ratio called tritium unit tu one tu equals 10 18 3h 1h the tritiogenic 3he concentration converted to 1 tu equals 2 49x10 12 3hetri ccstp kg water stp standard temperature and pressure tritium enters the groundwater as recharge from precipitation the tritium concentration of precipitation in germany is measured since 1959 iaea gnip the method allows distinguishing between water that infiltrated before 1955 and therefore is almost tritium free and younger water with anthropogenic tritium where an apparent age can be calculated sometimes a water sample represents a mixture of water from before and after the bomb tests a sample with water from before the bomb tests has a tritium concentration of less than 0 15 tu from the leftover of about 5 tu natural tritium in precipitation in northern europe all recharge after roughly 1955 still has concentrations of 6 1 tu today iaea 2014 precipitation data from germany corrected for decay to 2015 the tritium helium clock for groundwater starts when the water reaches the saturated zone and the newly produced 3he cannot escape to the atmosphere anymore and accumulates in the water the tritiogenic3hetri must be separated from other sources of 3he in the groundwater the 3he equilibrium concentration 3heequi is determined by conditions of the atmosphere during recharge and is calculated here with the solubility function of weiss 1971 additional 3heexcess enters the groundwater through air bubbles which are assumed to fully dissolve to derive 3heexcess neon ne is measured which only originates from the atmosphere the deviation of the measured ne concentration from the air saturated equilibrium concentration is called δne from this the amount of excess 3he is calculated another source is 3he produced by subsurface nucleogenic processes this so called radiogenic 3herad appears in a fixed ratio to 4herad of about 2x10 8 in groundwater mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 two orders of magnitude lower than the atmospheric 3he 4he ratio the radiogenic 4he produced by alpha decay of u and th and their daughter products can be used as tracer to identify water with ages of more than several hundreds of years 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 equivalent freshwater heads to consider the influence of density equivalent freshwater heads h f i in m were calculated for each groundwater well screen or point i from the measured point water heads h i in m after post et al 2007 1 h f i ρ i ρ f h i ρ i ρ f ρ f z i with ρ i the measured density at poiit i kg m ρ f the freshwater density kg m and z i the elevation head m which is the difference between the reference datum mean sea level and the well screen depth the calculated freshwater heads differed not more than 0 01 m from the point water head except for well 1ls with 0 02 m this lies within the measurement error all calculations and graphs in the following use or show equivalent freshwater heads in the following hydraulic head refers to equivalent freshwater head 2 4 2 groundwater flow velocity and discharge the horizontal flow velocity in the aquifer within the peatland was calculated based on darcy s law using 2 v 1 n e k δ h l with v the flow velocity m s n e the effective porosity k the hydraulic conductivity m s δ h the hydraulic head differences m and l the distance m the average hydraulic gradient between the wells 7ls and 6ls was calculated for the period from february 2017 to june 2018 from the averaged hydraulic gradient measured hydraulic conductivity k 2 10 5 m s and effective porosity ne 0 1 value for silty fine sand taken from hölting and coldewey 2013 an average groundwater flow velocity was calculated if density effects on horizontal flow are considered as described in more detail in post et al 2007 one of the well screen depths has to be defined as the reference depth while the freshwater head of the second well has to be corrected to the reference depth of the first well further the effect of an averaged density between the two wells must be considered only then a hydraulic gradient between the two wells can be calculated this method was tested but the effect was negligible with less than a centimetre difference for the calculated freshwater head at reference depth this is due to very similar densities at 7ls and 6ls hence density effects were not considered in the final calculation 3 results 3 1 geological structure of the coastal peatland the general sequence of sediments found in the peatland is from bottom to top glacial till fine sands locally gyttja and peat fig 2 a however the sediment cores revealed a rather complex geological structure with varying depth and extent of peat and sands the base of the aquifer the glacial till was detected at depths between 3 4 and 14 m a s l a distinct valley structure was found below the beach at core b9 in fig 2b with the till at a depth of 14 m a s l we assume that this is part of an ancient glacial river valley that has been described east of the peatland with a depth of 15 m a s l by kolp 1957 for location see fig 1 hence the valley structure is expected to continue below the peatland the till layer is locally overlain by a few centi or decimetres of coarser sand and gravel sediments typical for riverbeds the fine sands forming the shallow aquifer are between 2 and 10 5 m thick a more than 2 m thick silt clay layer interpreted as lacustrine sediments kreuzburg et al 2018 was found in the area of lake heiligensee on top of the fine sand but also as thin outcropping layers within the sand fig 2b locally gyttja or lacustrine sediments of less than 0 1 m thickness were found the peat on top of the aquifer consists of medium to strongly decomposed sedges and reeds and in the lower part of wooden peat it reaches almost 3 m thickness in the central part of the study area between the coast and the main ditch fig 3 towards the forest the peat thickness decreases as the onset of peat growth started later offshore only thin peat layers remain depending on their elevation since the peat got eroded by sea level rise at the coast fig 2 and fig 3 below the beach the peat is 0 1 to 1 5 m thick but was eroded towards the southern borders mp3 and near lake heiligensee mp1 during storm surges kolp 1957 kreuzburg et al 2018 at the coast fine to medium dune sands and marine medium to coarse sands and sometimes larger pebbles were found on top of the peat the sequence found here with peat underlain by several meters of sands and glacial till at the basis is typical and can be found at several sections along the baltic sea coast of mecklenburg west pomerania the hydraulic conductivity k is distinctly lower in the peat than in the sand in the peat it varies between 1x10 6 m s in the upper decimetres at mp7 and 1x10 8 m s in 1 2 m depth at mp2 the sandy aquifer is rather homogeneous with k values around 2x10 5 m s at mp7 fig 2a and also at b4 fig 2b a lens of fine to coarse sand and gravel was found where k increases locally to 6x10 5 m s the lacustrine sediments have a very low k of 1x10 8 to 1x10 9 m s 3 2 hydraulic gradients in the coastal peatland 3 2 1 from land to sea the investigated years 2016 to 2018 were either very dry or very wet the annual precipitation in warnemünde was 480 mm in 2016 739 mm in 2017 with 40 of the precipitation in the summer months and only 437 mm in 2018 with lowest precipitation in autumn 15 of total precipitation dwd n d this precipitation pattern impacted on the groundwater levels measured in the peatland the high precipitation in 2017 led to an increased water retention in the peatland and hence to highest water levels in april 2018 followed by a drought whereby lowest water levels were reached in july 2018 fig 4 a hydraulic gradient from land to sea prevailed in general the groundwater level was highest in the forest with an average of 0 94 m a s l at 9ls range 0 00 to 1 32 m a s l the average water level in the peatland was 0 41 m a s l 7p range 0 45 to 0 75 m a s l resulting in a comparatively large hydraulic gradient of 0 003 in average between the forest and the peatland the hydraulic gradient between 7ls and 6ls in the central peatland in contrast was only 0 00002 the difference in water levels was within the measurement error an average hydraulic gradient of 0 002 within the aquifer established between the peatland 2ls and the coast the water levels in the forest and in the central peatland both within the peat 6p 7p in the aquifer 6ls 7ls and in the ditch dctr all followed the same trend fig 4 water levels in the aquifer along the coast in contrast correlated with the sea level see exemplarily for 2ls in fig 4 with the water level at 1ls northern corner of peatland being slightly higher than at 2ls and 3ls see supplementary material s3 1 spring and summer march to september 2017 and march to april 2018 were characterised by a high water level in the peatland and low sea level fluctuations and a stable hydraulic gradient from the peatland to the coast established in autumn and winter the sea level sometimes exceeded the water level in the peatland during storms briefly by up to several decimetres the same was observed in the unusually stormy summer 2017 the hydraulic gradient at the coast reversed when the water level on the landside was very low in autumn 2016 and in the very dry summer and autumn of 2018 respectively at the outlet of the peatland ditch system downstream of the ground sill dout2 the water level showed distinct peaks of high water levels that correlated with a high sea level fig s3 1 sometimes it even exceeded the water level in the central peatland resulting in an inflow of water into the peatland via the ditch system as has also been reported in miegel et al 2017 3 2 2 vertical gradients the vertical hydraulic gradients in the peatland varied both in direction and magnitude the water level in the peat was above the water level in the aquifer in winter during times of enhanced precipitation and low et fig 4 inducing downward directed flow with enhanced et in summer the water level in the peat decreased below the water level in the aquifer indicating a vertical flow reversal with upward directed flow from the aquifer at mp6 located near the main ditch water levels indicated a generally upward directed flow from the aquifer 6ls towards the ditch dctr during most of the year see supplementary material s3 1 only enhanced precipitation and a decreased discharge due to high water levels downstream of the ground sill dout2 as in spring 2018 led to a downward directed flow from the ditch towards the aquifer 3 3 distribution of specific conductivity and major ions in groundwater the measured sc in the groundwater showed a large variation at the study area from a minimum of 0 7 ms cm in the forest to a maximum of 13 ms cm near the coast at 1ls the baltic sea has an average sc of 21 ms cm near the study area as calculated from salinities measured during cruises 1996 2018 iow n d in the central peatland the average sc was 7 9 ms cm with slightly higher values in the peat than in the aquifer underneath fig 5 a near the coast at mp2 and mp3 sc was lower than in the central peatland it increased from 1 ms cm in the dune sand to 6 ms cm in the aquifer at mp2 and amounted to 4 ms cm at mp3 both in peat and aquifer see supplementary material s3 2 only at 1ls where several seawater breakthroughs occurred in the past and the dune dike is disappearing high values of up to 13 ms cm were measured chloride is common in sea water and is considered a conservative tracer for transport processes the chloride concentrations were highest both in the peat and aquifer at mp6 followed by mp7 and mp2 and lowest in the forest and the dune sands in general the chloride concentrations were slightly higher in the aquifer than in the peat fig 5b table 1 table a 2 sulphate was highest in the peatland with a maximum at mp7 that exceeded concentrations of the baltic sea by a factor of two the groundwater in the peatland was enriched in nutrients and dissolved carbon near the dune average concentrations of 4 mg nh4 l 2 mg po4 3 l 151 mg dic l and 52 mg doc l were found while the corresponding concentrations in the baltic sea were only 0 0 18 and 12 mg l respectively in the central peatland concentrations were even higher except for dic table 1 3 4 groundwater ages and travel times the apparent t 3he ages and proportions of tritium free groundwater increased from the forest towards the coast the groundwater in the forest close to the border of the peatland 9ls had an apparent t 3he age of 30 years and the older tritium free groundwater water portion accounted for up to 15 of the total sample fig 5c supplementary material s4 1 in the aquifer below the peat at 7ls the apparent t 3he age was 7 years and roughly one third of the water was tritium free water and hence older than 1955 at 6ls in the central peatland the apparent t 3he age was 56 years and the portion of water older than 1955 increased to about two thirds at 2ls near the coast the amount of tritium free water was about 95 hence no age could be determined analytical uncertainties of duplicates of this study were lower than 5 for tritium and less than 10 of the age value δne was 1 in the forest and decreased to 7 at 7ls 30 at 6ls and 40 at 2ls near the coast the 4herad concentration of only 1 6x10 5ccstp kg at 9ls pointed towards the lowest residence time in the forest at 7ls the concentration was 2 1x10 5ccstp kg and increased strongly to 2 1x10 4ccstp kg at 6ls hence confirming the increase in residence time towards the coast at 2ls the sample with the lowest tritium concentration the 4herad concentration was only 7 8x10 5ccstp kg the calculated lateral groundwater travel time based on current hydraulic gradients is approximately 7 200 years between 7ls and 6ls 4 discussion 4 1 drainage network in a rewetted coastal peatland the ditch system still impacts on groundwater flow in the peatland despite rewetting it is responsible both for the rather large and dynamic hydraulic gradient in the aquifer at the transition from forest to peatland and for the low hydraulic gradient in and below the peatland the ditches continue to drain the peatland during a large part of the year except for droughts or high sea levels when the surface water level in the peatland is higher than the ground sill selle et al 2016 showed that water exchange is faster close to ditches than in areas between ditches at the study site the ditches thus impact on groundwater flow in the peat and aquifer an effect that might be noticeable even centuries after damming of ditches young et al 2017 the impact however depends on the hydraulic properties and thickness fig 3 of the peat layer the low hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer either degraded peat or lacustrine sediment can reduce the impact of drainage on the aquifer local difference of k in the peat layer were observed k reduces upon degradation of the peat following drainage hyväluoma et al 2020 a process aggravated by compaction underneath the dune dike thus mainly the ditches that cut into the aquifer may enhance drainage just as they promote groundwater exfiltration from the underlying aquifer under opposite gradients rossi et al 2012 this is the case where the peat layer becomes thinner than the depths of drainage ditches less than 1 m for most ditches namely in the area close to the forest fig 3 only the central main ditch cuts down to 1 5 m a s l and hence is assumed to affect the aquifer in the central peatland it was however found that the main ditch is covered with an organic layer of 0 1 m thickness in average indicating a low permeability of the ditch bed today the peat thickness distribution hence indicates areas where the aquifer is impacted by drainage occasionally during storm surges when the water level downstream the ground sill connected to the baltic sea is higher than in the peatland the ditch system also routes saltwater into the peatland and eases fast spreading of solutes schreiber et al 2021 this effect was demonstrated by the distribution of the sc in ditches and surface water shortly after a storm surge see supplementary material s5 the seawater reached the central peatland within less than a day at this event miegel et al 2017 a similarly short time lag has also been observed for a later storm surge see supplementary material s3 2 nov 19th 2017 the role of ditches as conduits for seawater flooding has also been pointed out for non tidal wetlands by poulter et al 2008 and will gain in importance with a rising sea water level 4 2 groundwater ages and flow patterns the apparent groundwater age in the aquifer increases with increasing thickness of the overlying peat layer near the border of the peatland at mp7 the young age of 7 years together with a third of tritium free water indicates mixing of very old with very young water components the peat layer is only 0 9 m thick here and interspersed with rhizomes in times of drainage possibly also shrinkage cracks constituting potential preferential flow pathways the rewetting of the peatland seven years before sampling resulted in an enhanced infiltration of surface water explaining the young age in general we assume that the groundwater is strongly stratified in age and that pumping during sampling from the 1 m long filter screen led to a broad spectrum of ages in one sample in the central peatland and near the coast where the peat thickness today is 1 8 and 2 4 m respectively the groundwater is distinctly older it was recharged before the intense drainage of the peatland demonstrating a distinct legacy effect the observed ne and 4herad concentrations emphasise that the groundwater in the aquifer has recharged via the peat layer a ne concentration less than the equilibrium value δne 0 as observed in all samples but the forest indicates degassing of the water a possible process typical for peatlands is the massive production of gases like ch4 and the subsequent formation of bubbles in the subsurface stanley et al 2019 into which ne exsolves sültenfuβ et al 2011 the increasing magnitude of δne from forest to coast suggests increasing degassing which might be caused by a longer residence time in the peat and again coincides with an increasing thickness of the peat layer here the 4herad concentration is used as a qualitative indicator for the contact time of water with the mineral matrix i e the residence time in the aquifer in alluvial sediments near the coast 2ls the rather low 4herad concentration together with the negative δne supports the assumption that most water originates from recharge through the peat and not from the mineral aquifer the flow of water in the peat layer where not influenced by ditches is mainly in downward direction we deduce the downward directed flow from the isotope distribution and prevailing hydraulic gradients it must be noted though that the differences of measured water levels between the peat and aquifer at mp7 and mp6 are often very low and within the measurement accuracy the downward directed flow is a consequence of the positive climatic water balance and the retention of surface water in the peatland the sc distribution further supports this assumption pore water profiles of the upper 60 cm of the peat measured by koebsch et al 2019 showed fresh water in the first 20 cm and more saline water further downwards indicating a freshening of the groundwater from the soil surface in periods without seawater inundations in the deeper peat the soil sc shows a similar trend with a nearly linear increase from 0 4 to 1 8 m depth at mp6 see supplementary material s6 in the aquifer underneath the peatland we assume from water level measurements in vertical direction and 4herad concentrations that water movement is directed towards the ditches that cut into the aquifer for example at 6ls near the main ditch where a high 4herad concentration indicates a longer residence time in the mineral aquifer drainage might have led to an upward directed flow of old groundwater in the past due to the upward directed vertical gradient in the aquifer the groundwater surface water interaction near the ditches is mainly governed by the water level in the ditch system i e the rate of surface water discharge only near the coast slow horizontal water fluxes towards the sea occur following the gradient between peatland and sea and eventually discharging upward to the sea as has been demonstrated in numerical simulations racasa et al 2021 local recharge in the dune area indicated by high water levels and low sc values of 1 ms cm causes additional sgd close to the shoreline in summary we assume that input of water into the peatland is mainly through infiltration of surface water ponding at the surface either fresh or brackish while the inflowing fresh groundwater from the forest is mostly diverted by ditches surrounding and crossing the peatland fig 6 flow fields in the peatland are dominated by an overall downward directed flow and local discharge towards the nearest ditch or coast where the aquifer is deep and the peat thick enough to inhibit the discharge function of the ditches e g in the ancient glacial river valley a deep lateral flow towards the coast might establish 4 3 implications for sgd as potential nutrient source the low but nearly permanent hydraulic gradient pointing from the peatland towards the baltic sea induces terrestrial sgd the average sgd at the study site calculated by different studies yielded values between 75 and 130 l d m 1 ibenthal 2020 racasa et al 2021 schreiber et al 2021 of which 13 to 26 l d m 1 originated from the aquifer miegel et al 2016 ibenthal 2020 racasa et al 2021 and the remaining part from the dune this land derived sgd is expected to transport nutrients and doc into the baltic sea as has been observed e g by szymczycha et al 2012 and andersen et al 2007 in the bay of puck and the danish north sea respectively the origin of the discharging water determines its composition while the water from the rain fed dune is fresh with low ion concentrations that from the aquifer is brackish with high concentrations of nh4 and dic in average groundwater nutrient and doc concentrations near the coast are lower than in the central peatland groundwater in front of lake heiligensee is especially rich in dic due to the occurrence of carbonate lacustrine sediments cf fig 2 dissolved organic carbon is abundant in all these waters and enhanced methane concentrations observed in the northern part of the coast between b4 and b5 where the peat crops out near the shore were attributed to doc input with pore water jurasinski et al 2018 concentrations in the peatland may reach up to 490 mg doc l racasa et al 2021 the land derived compounds e g nh4 doc dic will undergo and affect biogeochemical processes in the marine sediment especially when in contact with the peat layer that serves as an additional carbon source kreuzburg et al 2020 the low hydraulic gradient and hence slow groundwater fluxes with at the same time high loads of land derived compounds increases the time for biogeochemical reactions moore 1999 robinson et al 2018 low terrestrial sgd rates are typically associated with a larger dispersion zone where terrestrial and sea water mix smith 2004 4 4 sea water as origin of groundwater in the peatland high cl concentrations in the peatland reveal that the groundwater partly originates from the baltic sea chloride is considered a conservative tracer allowing to track saltwater jones et al 1999 a comparison of the chloride concentrations in aquifer and peat with the current chloride concentration in the baltic sea fig 5 supplementary material s4 1 indicates that 24 4 average standard deviation of all samples from 2p 6p 7p of the water in the peat and 30 3 samples from 2ls 6ls 7ls of water in the shallow aquifer consist of seawater the increased cl concentrations cannot be caused by et since the climatic water balance is positive sc monitoring has not shown any long term increase and pore water profiles from koebsch et al 2019 reveal freshwater in the upper 20 cm hence the cl concentrations in the peat observation wells can be regarded a mixture of young fresh water and older brackish water in the dune sands the sc was in average 1 0 ms cm 2ds demonstrating freshwater recharge in the dune dike furthermore koebsch et al 2019 showed by means of stable isotope analysis that the source of sulphur in the central peatland is the baltic sea further they showed that sulphur reducing bacteria depleted the sulphate pool at some spots while a spot near mp7 indicated elevated amounts of iron in the form of labile iron minerals and dissolved ferrous iron the comparison of molar so42 cl ratios in the groundwater with the current ratio from the baltic sea indicates that sulphate has been enriched at 7ls slightly reduced at 6ls and almost completely reduced at 2ls which affects the measured sc the process leading to an enrichment of so42 at 7ls needs further investigation and is beyond the scope of this study we assume inundations as the main pathway of the seawater into the peatland both directly from the sea in past times and via the ditch network since rewetting subsurface intrusion of saltwater the other possible pathway is unlikely the cl concentrations decrease from the central peatland towards the coast fig 5b and the soil sc measured in the sediment cores at the beach did not increase with depth disproving the existence of a saltwater wedge in the aquifer supplementary material s6 only close to the shoreline at 1ls where several seawater breakthroughs occurred in the past and the dune dike is disappearing high cl concentrations as well as observed rises in sc after storm surges demonstrate intrusion of seawater in the subsurface under the dune the rather homogeneous distribution of cl in peat and aquifer despite different groundwater ages suggests that floods occurred regularly in the past 4 5 vertical flow reversals the direction of the vertical water flow in the peat switches depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions when precipitation is high and et low as typically during winter time the vertical hydraulic gradients indicate a downward directed flow with enhanced et in summer the water level in the peat decreases below the water level in the aquifer indicating a flow reversal with upward directed flow from the aquifer as in summer 2017 however when the water level in the forest dropped drastically in late summer 2018 due to unusually low precipitation and high et the inflow of surface and groundwater from the forest to the peatland decreased the hydraulic head in the aquifer dropped accordingly and no upward directed flow in the peatland was visible in the water levels hence recharge downward flow occurs during times with precipitation and small et while discharge upward flow occurs during times with enhanced et and sufficient groundwater inflow from the larger groundwater catchment as has been described in several studies for inland peatlands e g siegel and glaser 1987 devito et al 1997 drexler et al 1999 fraser et al 2001 kopp et al 2013 the flow direction may vary spatially within the peat depending on factors such as a local anisotropy of k drexler et al 1999 local high specific storage reeve et al 2006 methane production romanowicz et al 1993 and the transpiration rate of the vegetation type drexler et al 1999 which varies in the study area between reeds submerged aquatic species in shallow open water and sedges in dryer areas koch et al 2017 the oscillation of downward and upward water movement will enhance vertical mixing in the peat column reeve et al 2006 and thus affect geochemical profiles fraser et al 2001 another indicator for a switching vertical flow direction is the temporal variability of the sc in typical years a seasonal cycle of sc can be observed in the peat with a higher sc during summer due to enhanced et and dilution during winter as a result of precipitation selle et al 2016 the amplitude of the sc was largest where the well filter screen was located in the upper meter of the peat 7p 3p smaller at around 1 m depth 6p and the sc was constant at a depth of 2 m 2p fig 5a and supplementary material fig s3 2 these observations indicate that the intensity of flow reversals in the peat decreases with depth specific conductivity fluctuations behaved accordingly in the aquifer below hence they were more pronounced where the peat layer above the aquifer is thinner 5 conclusions in the coastal fen heiligensee and hütelmoor hydrological conditions have changed over time following anthropogenic interferences drainage dike construction rewetting the groundwater system was assessed by the distributions of hydraulic heads sc and major ions apparent tritium helium groundwater ages δne and 4herad concentrations were successfully used as proxies to identify mixing of water from different sources in the aquifer underlying the peat slow downward flow years to decades of surface water through the peat into the aquifer was identified as the major source of groundwater which mixes there with older upward flowing groundwater today despite rewetting local groundwater flow fields are determined by the location of ditches with upward flow towards the ditches or the sea and infiltration into the peat in areas in between the peat thickness determines the water exchange between surface water and groundwater in the peat and aquifer seen in increased apparent groundwater ages with increased peat thickness the deduced flow patterns are transferable to other coastal peatlands typically experiencing the same sequence of anthropogenic influences these flow patterns determine the distribution of salts and other compounds in the peat and aquifer which crucially affect biogeochemical processes such as methane production the wide range of groundwater ages and a mostly homogeneous distribution of chloride concentrations in the aquifer indicate that brackish conditions have prevailed over decades and possibly even centuries rewetting and preceding drainage of coastal fens is concluded to have limited impact on deeper groundwater and to mainly influence the upper peat at the coastal interface rewetting revives submarine groundwater discharge and associated solute fluxes despite low hydraulic gradients with a potential impact on marine biogeochemistry credit authorship

2726,low lying coastal peatlands are unique ecosystems where water levels and salt input with seawater determine vegetation and greenhouse gas emissions while the export of nutrients and carbon via submarine groundwater discharge influences biogeochemical processes in shallow coastal sediments anthropogenic interferences like drainage and diking strongly impact the water flow this study aimed at understanding the hydrological system in a rewetted coastal fen typical for the southern baltic sea groundwater observation wells were installed both in the peat layer and underlying sands and continuous readings of water levels and specific conductivities were combined with groundwater dating and major ion composition analyses apparent tritium helium groundwater ages between 7 and more than 60 years in the shallow aquifer below the peat revealed a long memory of the system recharge through the peat layer was identified as a major source of groundwater from neon and helium isotopes in combination with water levels chloride concentrations showed a homogeneous fraction of 30 sea water throughout the aquifer despite differing groundwater ages drainage ditches still affect groundwater flow today depending on the peat and aquifer thickness both nutrient enriched brackish deeper groundwater and freshwater from the precipitation fed dune dike discharge to the sea we conclude that rewetting of coastal peatlands mainly affects the groundwater in the upper peat with little impact on the underlying aquifer and might revive submarine groundwater discharge and

hydraulic gradients waddington and roulet 1997 balliston et al 2018 the discharge of solutes from the peatland on the other hand affects the marine biogeochemistry the adjacent sea may receive water

pointed out that mangroves and salt marshes may disproportionally contribute to sgd related biogeochemical inputs to oceans due to high carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations but are hitherto understudied coastal peatlands are comparable carbon rich low gradient systems and are likewise understudied the drainage of peatlands tremendously alters their hydrological conditions peatlands in europe have been drained extensively for agricultural purposes forestry or peat excavation joosten et al 2017 drainage and associated aeration and degradation of the peat results in land subsidence pronger et al 2014 peat compaction whittington and price 2006 increased co2 emissions erkens et al 2016 and loss in ecological diversity vasander et al 2003 joosten et al 2017 peat decomposition involves a decrease in pore size and a strong reduction of the hydraulic conductivity hallema et al 2015 tiemeyer et al 2017 leading to irreversible changes in the hydraulic properties of the peat and stronger water table fluctuations whittington and price 2006 changes in the hydrological regime and a lowering of the water table due to drainage can thus alter water flow patterns water composition and vegetation patterns siegel and glaser 1987 van loon et al 2009 kopp et al 2013 the socio economical value of coastal peatlands as flood retention areas and carbon sinks has been recognised and restoring previously drained peatlands has thus become an important measure expected ecosystem services after rewetting are most prominently decreased co2 emissions and an intensified carbon sequestration wilson et al 2016 decreased ch4 emissions minick et al 2019 as well as an improved water storage upon rainfall events menberu et al 2018 rewetting alters the hydrological functioning of the peatland and knowledge of the groundwater flow regime is essential for the success of peatland restoration although flow patterns and water fluxes in coastal peatlands are complex and their understanding is the basis for any biogeochemical or ecological interpretation field observations and investigations disentangling the hydraulic system are scarce this study aims at contributing towards filling this gap the peatland considered is a rewetted degraded coastal fen where both the ground and the surface water via a ditch system are hydraulically connected to the baltic sea the

vegetation succession due to seasonal water level changes koch et al 2017 are well studied however local differences in geochemical composition in the peat koebsch et al 2019 the varying thickness of the peat layer kolp 1957 dahms 1991 krüger 1995 and its extent into the baltic sea kreuzburg et al 2018 suggest a complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological system little is known about groundwater flow patterns and water quality in the shallow aquifer below the peat the specific aims of this study were i to identify groundwater flow patterns and related controls of water table fluctuations and ii to estimate groundwater discharge rates from the peatland to the sea forming a pathway for land derived solutes for this purpose sediment cores were taken and hydraulic heads and specific conductivities in the different hydrogeological units were monitored in addition the distributions of major ions nutrients doc and dic dissolved inorganic carbon in conjunction with apparent tritium helium ages were determined 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the study area and nature reserve heiligensee and hütelmoor is located in north eastern germany at the baltic sea coast near the city of rostock fig 1 the average annual precipitation at the weather station in rostock warnemünde at a distance of 6 km is 621 mm the average annual temperature is 9 2 c 1947 to 2018 dwd n d the area was shaped by the weichselian ice age kolp 1957 glacial till was deposited with the expansion of the glaciers with their retreat river valleys and deltas developed leading to the deposition of 2 5 to 15 m thick glacio fluvial fine sands on top of the till kolp 1957 which nowadays form a shallow aquifer the littorina transgression 8 000 1 200 bp entailed a continuous rise of the groundwater level resulting in the development of a paludification fen from around 7 000 years bp onwards kreuzburg et al 2018 when the sea level rise slowed down lampe 2002 gyttja developed first in depressions followed partly by peat consisting of wood kreuzburg et al 2018 the dominating peat type consists of moderately to strongly decomposed sedges carex and reed phragmites australis the surrounding forest grows on a slightly acidic podsol the peatland receives water from the surrounding forest before anthropogenic interference small creeks originating in the forest drained directly into the baltic sea moderate drainage of the peatland started in the 18th century hro 2017 by construction of a few ditches in 1976 a dense network of ditches that still exists today was built to enable use as grassland the ditch system originates from the surrounding forest and exits the peatland at its south eastern edge via the main ditch prahmgraben downstream the water runs through the nature reserve radelsee before entering the harbour area with connection to the warnow river and the baltic sea fig 1 extensive drainage of the peatland was performed through pumping via a pumping station from 1976 until 1991 and led to a compaction and degradation of the upper decimetres of the peat the elevation of the peatland nowadays is between 0 15 and 0 75 m a s l above sea level and peat thickness is up to 3 m in the central peatland near the coast and thins out towards the forest the size of the peatland is 350 ha renaturation started in december 2009 when the water table was raised by construction of a ground sill at the outlet of the ditch system at about 0 4 m a s l today the surface water catchment fig 1 of the peatland is 750 ha the size of the groundwater catchment of the peatland is unknown but reaches up to 15 km further inland lung 2016 the surface water level is balanced by the ditch system and is above ground surface in most parts of the peatland typically with a lowering of the water level in late summer and subsequent increase in winter miegel et al 2016 most of the groundwater in the surrounding elevated forest still drains into the ditch system and passes the peatland miegel et al 2016 reed rushes and sedges are the dominant plants within the peatland interrupted by areas of open surface water where hydrophytes expand koch et al 2017 the peatland adjoins the baltic sea along a 3 km long shoreline and is separated by an up to 40 m wide dune dike from the 50 m wide beach the dune dike was initially constructed in 1903 and heightened in 1963 and prevents the peatland from being flooded inundations occurred 1872 1904 1913 14 1949 and 1954 kolp 1957 afterwards only in 1995 a breach in the dune dike occurred in its northern part near the natural freshwater lake heiligensee causing inundation and salinization of the peatland maintenance of the dike was stopped in 2000 seawater can enter the peatland not only over the dune dike but also via the ditch system which occurs when the sea level exceeds the height of the ground sill about 0 4 m a s l and the water level of the peatland miegel et al 2017 selle et al 2016 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 geological investigations sixteen sediment cores were drilled down to a max depth of 15 m a s l with a percussion driller and open metal rods of 4 cm diameter fig 1 to assess the peat thickness in more detail peat probings were conducted hereby a 1 cm diameter metal rod is pushed through the peat until the resistance indicates the beginning of the sand layer in addition data on peat thickness from dahms 1991 and krüger 1995 were transferred into the current height reference system nhn 1992 and the peat depth distribution was interpolated for the whole peatland using kriging all drilling and probing locations as well as the ground sill were levelled with a digital level leica sprinter 250 m or real time kinematic and differential gps leica viva net rover the sediments in selected ditches were assessed using a sludge sampler furthermore the depth of ditches was measured using a plumb line from a boat the selected ditches were the main ditch over its full length and small ditches connected to the main ditch as well as the ditch at the border to the forest 2 2 2 field instrumentation a total of 14 groundwater observation wells were installed at 7 locations fig 1 observation wells are arranged as well nests in the following referred to as measuring points mp with filter screens in different geologic layers dune sand ds peat p and lower sand ls also referred to as aquifer in addition three wells were installed in ditches dctr in the central part of the peatland next to mp6 and dout1 and dout2 above and below the ground sill at the outlet of the surface water catchment

and 2 cm for differential gps cable length of the data logger estimated to 0 5 cm the air pressure measurement 1 5 cm not for mp8 and 10 with relative pressure measurements and the accuracy of the logger s pressure transducer 0 5 cm it thus amounts to up to 2 7 cm for the wells levelled with a digital level mp6 10 dout1 2 and to up to 4 5 cm for the wells levelled with differential gps mp1 3 dctr whereby the error due to air pressure measurement is consistent between the wells the error in hydraulic head measurements has been reported to be typically within a few centimetres rau et al 2019 2 2 3 hydraulic conductivity falling head and rising head slug tests were performed in all wells the data was analysed with aqtesolv software provided by hydrosolve inc https www aqtesolv com using the kgs model kansas geological survey hyder et al 1994 to obtain radial hydraulic conductivity parameters for the wells installed in peat data from the permanently installed data loggers were used to evaluate the slug test due to the long recovery times of hours to days 2 2 4 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were obtained from all groundwater wells except for mp3 due to technical problems in august 2017 and in april 2018 before sampling water in the wells was pumped with a submersible pump until the in situ parameters sc ph temperature and oxygen stabilized in situ parameters were measured with a smartroll mp multiparameter probe in situ u s a the volume of water pumped out prior to sampling was at least twice the volume of the well surface water samples were taken manually in undisturbed water using a container the samples for analysis of cations and anions see below for details were filtered with 0 2 µm cellulose acetate syringe filters rotilabo germany that for phosphate and dissolved carbon with 0 45 polyether sulphone syringe filters sarstedt germany and then filled into 50 ml plastic bottles the filters were rinsed with 10 ml of sample water prior to use samples for analysis of cations were acidified with 100 µl methane sulfonic acid 99 extra pure the samples were cooled at 4 c if analysed within a few days or frozen at 20 c until the analysis additional samples for tritium helium analysis were taken according to sültenfuβ et al 2011 in the lower sand at observation wells 1ls 2ls 6ls 7ls and 9ls between 25th january and 7th february 2017 2 3 laboratory analyses 2 3 1 geochemistry the analysis of anions cl br so4 2 and cations mg2 ca2 na k nh4 was done with anion and cation chromatography dx320 and dx500 dionex u s a respectively the

subtracting dic from tc detection limits and uncertainties resulting from accuracy and precision of the applied methods are given in the supplementary material table s4 2 2 3 2 groundwater ages apparent piston flow groundwater ages were determined with the tritium helium method and called t 3he ages the samples were analysed at the bremen helium isotope lab sültenfuβ et al 2009 each sample was analysed twice for details see supplementary material s2 anthropogenic tritium 3h or t was emitted in large quantities into the stratosphere during over ground tests of hydrogen bombs between 1955 and 1963 solomon and cook 2000 it reacts to the water molecule hto and becomes part of the hydrological cycle radioactive 3h decays to 3he henceforth tritiogenic 3hetri with a half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 concentrations are given as a hydrogen isotope ratio called tritium unit tu one tu equals 10 18 3h 1h the tritiogenic 3he concentration converted to 1 tu equals 2 49x10 12 3hetri ccstp kg water stp standard temperature and pressure tritium enters the groundwater as recharge from precipitation the tritium concentration of precipitation in germany is measured since 1959 iaea gnip the method allows distinguishing between water that infiltrated before 1955 and therefore is almost tritium free and younger water with anthropogenic tritium where an apparent age can be calculated sometimes a water sample represents a mixture of water from before and after the bomb tests a sample with water from before the bomb tests has a tritium concentration of less than 0 15 tu from the leftover of about 5 tu natural tritium in precipitation in northern europe all recharge after roughly 1955 still has concentrations of 6 1 tu today iaea 2014 precipitation data from germany corrected for decay to 2015 the tritium helium clock for groundwater starts when the water reaches the saturated zone and the newly produced 3he cannot escape to the atmosphere anymore and accumulates in the water the tritiogenic3hetri must be separated from other sources of 3he in the groundwater the 3he equilibrium concentration 3heequi is determined by conditions of the atmosphere during recharge and is calculated here with the solubility function of weiss 1971 additional 3heexcess enters the groundwater through air bubbles which are assumed to fully dissolve to derive 3heexcess neon ne is measured which only originates from the atmosphere the deviation of the measured ne concentration from the air saturated equilibrium concentration is called δne from this the amount of excess 3he is calculated another source is 3he produced by subsurface nucleogenic processes this so called radiogenic 3herad appears in a fixed ratio to 4herad of about 2x10 8 in groundwater mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 two orders of magnitude lower than the atmospheric 3he 4he ratio the radiogenic 4he produced by alpha decay of u and th and their daughter products can be used as tracer to identify water with ages of more than several hundreds of years 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 equivalent freshwater heads to consider the influence of density equivalent freshwater heads h f i in m were calculated for each groundwater well screen or point i from the measured point water heads h i in m after post et al 2007 1 h f i ρ i ρ f h i ρ i ρ f ρ f z i with ρ i the measured density at poiit i kg m ρ f the freshwater density kg m and z i the elevation head m which is the difference between the reference datum mean sea level and the well screen depth the calculated freshwater heads differed not more than 0 01 m from the point water head except for well 1ls with 0 02 m this lies within the measurement error all calculations and graphs in the following use or show equivalent freshwater heads in the following hydraulic head refers to equivalent freshwater head 2 4 2 groundwater flow velocity and discharge the horizontal flow velocity in the aquifer within the peatland was calculated based on darcy s law using 2 v 1 n e k δ h l with v the flow velocity m s n e the effective porosity k the hydraulic conductivity m s δ h the hydraulic head differences m and l the distance m the average hydraulic gradient between the wells 7ls and 6ls was calculated for the period from february 2017 to june 2018 from the averaged hydraulic gradient measured hydraulic conductivity k 2 10 5 m s and effective porosity ne 0 1 value for silty fine sand taken from hölting and coldewey 2013 an average groundwater flow velocity was calculated if density effects on horizontal flow are considered as described in more detail in post et al 2007 one of the well screen depths has to be defined as the reference depth while the freshwater head of the second well has to be corrected to the reference depth of the first well further the effect of an averaged density between the two wells must be considered only then a hydraulic gradient between the two wells can be calculated this method was tested but the effect was negligible with less than a centimetre difference for the calculated freshwater head at reference depth this is due to very similar densities at 7ls and 6ls hence density effects were not considered in the final calculation 3 results 3 1 geological structure of the coastal peatland the general sequence of sediments found in the peatland is from bottom to top glacial till fine sands locally gyttja and peat fig 2 a however the sediment cores revealed a rather complex geological structure with varying depth and extent of peat and sands the base of the aquifer the glacial till was detected at depths between 3 4 and 14 m a s l a distinct valley structure was found below the beach at core b9 in fig 2b with the till at a depth of 14 m a s l we assume that this is part of an ancient glacial river valley that has been described east of the peatland with a depth of 15 m a s l by kolp 1957 for location see fig 1 hence the valley structure is expected to continue below the peatland the till layer is locally overlain by a few centi or decimetres of coarser sand and gravel sediments typical for riverbeds the fine sands forming the shallow aquifer are between 2 and 10 5 m thick a more than 2 m thick silt clay layer interpreted as lacustrine sediments kreuzburg et al 2018 was found in the area of lake heiligensee on top of the fine sand but also as thin outcropping layers within the sand fig 2b locally gyttja or lacustrine sediments of less than 0 1 m thickness were found the peat on top of the aquifer consists of medium to strongly decomposed sedges and reeds and in the lower part of wooden peat it reaches almost 3 m thickness in the central part of the study area between the coast and the main ditch fig 3 towards the forest the peat thickness decreases as the onset of peat growth started later offshore only thin peat layers remain depending on their elevation since the peat got eroded by sea level rise at the coast fig 2 and fig 3 below the beach the peat is 0 1 to 1 5 m thick but was eroded towards the southern borders mp3 and near lake heiligensee mp1 during storm surges kolp 1957 kreuzburg et al 2018 at the coast fine to medium dune sands and marine medium to coarse sands and sometimes larger pebbles were found on top of the peat the sequence found here with peat underlain by several meters of sands and glacial till at the basis is typical and can be found at several sections along the baltic sea coast of mecklenburg west pomerania the hydraulic conductivity k is distinctly lower in the peat than in the sand in the peat it varies between 1x10 6 m s in the upper decimetres at mp7 and 1x10 8 m s in 1 2 m depth at mp2 the sandy aquifer is rather homogeneous with k values around 2x10 5 m s at mp7 fig 2a and also at b4 fig 2b a lens of fine to coarse sand and gravel was found where k increases locally to 6x10 5 m s the lacustrine sediments have a very low k of 1x10 8 to 1x10 9 m s 3 2 hydraulic gradients in the coastal peatland 3 2 1 from land to sea the investigated years 2016 to 2018 were either very dry or very wet the annual precipitation in warnemünde was 480 mm in 2016 739 mm in 2017 with 40 of the precipitation in the summer months and only 437 mm in 2018 with lowest precipitation in autumn 15 of total precipitation dwd n d this precipitation pattern impacted on the groundwater levels measured in the peatland the high precipitation in 2017 led to an increased water retention in the peatland and hence to highest water levels in april 2018 followed by a drought whereby lowest water levels were reached in july 2018 fig 4 a hydraulic gradient from land to sea prevailed in general the groundwater level was highest in the forest with an average of 0 94 m a s l at 9ls range 0 00 to 1 32 m a s l the average water level in the peatland was 0 41 m a s l 7p range 0 45 to 0 75 m a s l resulting in a comparatively large hydraulic gradient of 0 003 in average between the forest and the peatland the hydraulic gradient between 7ls and 6ls in the central peatland in contrast was only 0 00002 the difference in water levels was within the measurement error an average hydraulic gradient of 0 002 within the aquifer established between the peatland 2ls and the coast the water levels in the forest and in the central peatland both within the peat 6p 7p in the aquifer 6ls 7ls and in the ditch dctr all followed the same trend fig 4 water levels in the aquifer along the coast in contrast correlated with the sea level see exemplarily for 2ls in fig 4 with the water level at 1ls northern corner of peatland being slightly higher than at 2ls and 3ls see supplementary material s3 1 spring and summer march to september 2017 and march to april 2018 were characterised by a high water level in the peatland and low sea level fluctuations and a stable hydraulic gradient from the peatland to the coast established in autumn and winter the sea level sometimes exceeded the water level in the peatland during storms briefly by up to several decimetres the same was observed in the unusually stormy summer 2017 the hydraulic gradient at the coast reversed when the water level on the landside was very low in autumn 2016 and in the very dry summer and autumn of 2018 respectively at the outlet of the peatland ditch system downstream of the ground sill dout2 the water level showed distinct peaks of high water levels that correlated with a high sea level fig s3 1 sometimes it even exceeded the water level in the central peatland resulting in an inflow of water into the peatland via the ditch system as has also been reported in miegel et al 2017 3 2 2 vertical gradients the vertical hydraulic gradients in the peatland varied both in direction and magnitude the water level in the peat was above the water level in the aquifer in winter during times of enhanced precipitation and low et fig 4 inducing downward directed flow with enhanced et in summer the water level in the peat decreased below the water level in the aquifer indicating a vertical flow reversal with upward directed flow from the aquifer at mp6 located near the main ditch water levels indicated a generally upward directed flow from the aquifer 6ls towards the ditch dctr during most of the year see supplementary material s3 1 only enhanced precipitation and a decreased discharge due to high water levels downstream of the ground sill dout2 as in spring 2018 led to a downward directed flow from the ditch towards the aquifer 3 3 distribution of specific conductivity and major ions in groundwater the measured sc in the groundwater showed a large variation at the study area from a minimum of 0 7 ms cm in the forest to a maximum of 13 ms cm near the coast at 1ls the baltic sea has an average sc of 21 ms cm near the study area as calculated from salinities measured during cruises 1996 2018 iow n d in the central peatland the average sc was 7 9 ms cm with slightly higher values in the peat than in the aquifer underneath fig 5 a near the coast at mp2 and mp3 sc was lower than in the central peatland it increased from 1 ms cm in the dune sand to 6 ms cm in the aquifer at mp2 and amounted to 4 ms cm at mp3 both in peat and aquifer see supplementary material s3 2 only at 1ls where several seawater breakthroughs occurred in the past and the dune dike is disappearing high values of up to 13 ms cm were measured chloride is common in sea water and is considered a conservative tracer for transport processes the chloride concentrations were highest both in the peat and aquifer at mp6 followed by mp7 and mp2 and lowest in the forest and the dune sands in general the chloride concentrations were slightly higher in the aquifer than in the peat fig 5b table 1 table a 2 sulphate was highest in the peatland with a maximum at mp7 that exceeded concentrations of the baltic sea by a factor of two the groundwater in the peatland was enriched in nutrients and dissolved carbon near the dune average concentrations of 4 mg nh4 l 2 mg po4 3 l 151 mg dic l and 52 mg doc l were found while the corresponding concentrations in the baltic sea were only 0 0 18 and 12 mg l respectively in the central peatland concentrations were even higher except for dic table 1 3 4 groundwater ages and travel times the apparent t 3he ages and proportions of tritium free groundwater increased from the forest towards the coast the groundwater in the forest close to the border of the peatland 9ls had an apparent t 3he age of 30 years and the older tritium free groundwater water portion accounted for up to 15 of the total sample fig 5c supplementary material s4 1 in the aquifer below the peat at 7ls the apparent t 3he age was 7 years and roughly one third of the water was tritium free water and hence older than 1955 at 6ls in the central peatland the apparent t 3he age was 56 years and the portion of water older than 1955 increased to about two thirds at 2ls near the coast the amount of tritium free water was about 95 hence no age could be determined analytical uncertainties of duplicates of this study were lower than 5 for tritium and less than 10 of the age value δne was 1 in the forest and decreased to 7 at 7ls 30 at 6ls and 40 at 2ls near the coast the 4herad concentration of only 1 6x10 5ccstp kg at 9ls pointed towards the lowest residence time in the forest at 7ls the concentration was 2 1x10 5ccstp kg and increased strongly to 2 1x10 4ccstp kg at 6ls hence confirming the increase in residence time towards the coast at 2ls the sample with the lowest tritium concentration the 4herad concentration was only 7 8x10 5ccstp kg the calculated lateral groundwater travel time based on current hydraulic gradients is approximately 7 200 years between 7ls and 6ls 4 discussion 4 1 drainage network in a rewetted coastal peatland the ditch system still impacts on groundwater flow in the peatland despite rewetting it is responsible both for the rather large and dynamic hydraulic gradient in the aquifer at the transition from forest to peatland and for the low hydraulic gradient in and below the peatland the ditches continue to drain the peatland during a large part of the year except for droughts or high sea levels when the surface water level in the peatland is higher than the ground sill selle et al 2016 showed that water exchange is faster close to ditches than in areas between ditches at the study site the ditches thus impact on groundwater flow in the peat and aquifer an effect that might be noticeable even centuries after damming of ditches young et al 2017 the impact however depends on the hydraulic properties and thickness fig 3 of the peat layer the low hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer either degraded peat or lacustrine sediment can reduce the impact of drainage on the aquifer local difference of k in the peat layer were observed k reduces upon degradation of the peat following drainage hyväluoma et al 2020 a process aggravated by compaction underneath the dune dike thus mainly the ditches that cut into the aquifer may enhance drainage just as they promote groundwater exfiltration from the underlying aquifer under opposite gradients rossi et al 2012 this is the case where the peat layer becomes thinner than the depths of drainage ditches less than 1 m for most ditches namely in the area close to the forest fig 3 only the central main ditch cuts down to 1 5 m a s l and hence is assumed to affect the aquifer in the central peatland it was however found that the main ditch is covered with an organic layer of 0 1 m thickness in average indicating a low permeability of the ditch bed today the peat thickness distribution hence indicates areas where the aquifer is impacted by drainage occasionally during storm surges when the water level downstream the ground sill connected to the baltic sea is higher than in the peatland the ditch system also routes saltwater into the peatland and eases fast spreading of solutes schreiber et al 2021 this effect was demonstrated by the distribution of the sc in ditches and surface water shortly after a storm surge see supplementary material s5 the seawater reached the central peatland within less than a day at this event miegel et al 2017 a similarly short time lag has also been observed for a later storm surge see supplementary material s3 2 nov 19th 2017 the role of ditches as conduits for seawater flooding has also been pointed out for non tidal wetlands by poulter et al 2008 and will gain in importance with a rising sea water level 4 2 groundwater ages and flow patterns the apparent groundwater age in the aquifer increases with increasing thickness of the overlying peat layer near the border of the peatland at mp7 the young age of 7 years together with a third of tritium free water indicates mixing of very old with very young water components the peat layer is only 0 9 m thick here and interspersed with rhizomes in times of drainage possibly also shrinkage cracks constituting potential preferential flow pathways the rewetting of the peatland seven years before sampling resulted in an enhanced infiltration of surface water explaining the young age in general we assume that the groundwater is strongly stratified in age and that pumping during sampling from the 1 m long filter screen led to a broad spectrum of ages in one sample in the central peatland and near the coast where the peat thickness today is 1 8 and 2 4 m respectively the groundwater is distinctly older it was recharged before the intense drainage of the peatland demonstrating a distinct legacy effect the observed ne and 4herad concentrations emphasise that the groundwater in the aquifer has recharged via the peat layer a ne concentration less than the equilibrium value δne 0 as observed in all samples but the forest indicates degassing of the water a possible process typical for peatlands is the massive production of gases like ch4 and the subsequent formation of bubbles in the subsurface stanley et al 2019 into which ne exsolves sültenfuβ et al 2011 the increasing magnitude of δne from forest to coast suggests increasing degassing which might be caused by a longer residence time in the peat and again coincides with an increasing thickness of the peat layer here the 4herad concentration is used as a qualitative indicator for the contact time of water with the mineral matrix i e the residence time in the aquifer in alluvial sediments near the coast 2ls the rather low 4herad concentration together with the negative δne supports the assumption that most water originates from recharge through the peat and not from the mineral aquifer the flow of water in the peat layer where not influenced by ditches is mainly in downward direction we deduce the downward directed flow from the isotope distribution and prevailing hydraulic gradients it must be noted though that the differences of measured water levels between the peat and aquifer at mp7 and mp6 are often very low and within the measurement accuracy the downward directed flow is a consequence of the positive climatic water balance and the retention of surface water in the peatland the sc distribution further supports this assumption pore water profiles of the upper 60 cm of the peat measured by koebsch et al 2019 showed fresh water in the first 20 cm and more saline water further downwards indicating a freshening of the groundwater from the soil surface in periods without seawater inundations in the deeper peat the soil sc shows a similar trend with a nearly linear increase from 0 4 to 1 8 m depth at mp6 see supplementary material s6 in the aquifer underneath the peatland we assume from water level measurements in vertical direction and 4herad concentrations that water movement is directed towards the ditches that cut into the aquifer for example at 6ls near the main ditch where a high 4herad concentration indicates a longer residence time in the mineral aquifer drainage might have led to an upward directed flow of old groundwater in the past due to the upward directed vertical gradient in the aquifer the groundwater surface water interaction near the ditches is mainly governed by the water level in the ditch system i e the rate of surface water discharge only near the coast slow horizontal water fluxes towards the sea occur following the gradient between peatland and sea and eventually discharging upward to the sea as has been demonstrated in numerical simulations racasa et al 2021 local recharge in the dune area indicated by high water levels and low sc values of 1 ms cm causes additional sgd close to the shoreline in summary we assume that input of water into the peatland is mainly through infiltration of surface water ponding at the surface either fresh or brackish while the inflowing fresh groundwater from the forest is mostly diverted by ditches surrounding and crossing the peatland fig 6 flow fields in the peatland are dominated by an overall downward directed flow and local discharge towards the nearest ditch or coast where the aquifer is deep and the peat thick enough to inhibit the discharge function of the ditches e g in the ancient glacial river valley a deep lateral flow towards the coast might establish 4 3 implications for sgd as potential nutrient source the low but nearly permanent hydraulic gradient pointing from the peatland towards the baltic sea induces terrestrial sgd the average sgd at the study site calculated by different studies yielded values between 75 and 130 l d m 1 ibenthal 2020 racasa et al 2021 schreiber et al 2021 of which 13 to 26 l d m 1 originated from the aquifer miegel et al 2016 ibenthal 2020 racasa et al 2021 and the remaining part from the dune this land derived sgd is expected to transport nutrients and doc into the baltic sea as has been observed e g by szymczycha et al 2012 and andersen et al 2007 in the bay of puck and the danish north sea respectively the origin of the discharging water determines its composition while the water from the rain fed dune is fresh with low ion concentrations that from the aquifer is brackish with high concentrations of nh4 and dic in average groundwater nutrient and doc concentrations near the coast are lower than in the central peatland groundwater in front of lake heiligensee is especially rich in dic due to the occurrence of carbonate lacustrine sediments cf fig 2 dissolved organic carbon is abundant in all these waters and enhanced methane concentrations observed in the northern part of the coast between b4 and b5 where the peat crops out near the shore were attributed to doc input with pore water jurasinski et al 2018 concentrations in the peatland may reach up to 490 mg doc l racasa et al 2021 the land derived compounds e g nh4 doc dic will undergo and affect biogeochemical processes in the marine sediment especially when in contact with the peat layer that serves as an additional carbon source kreuzburg et al 2020 the low hydraulic gradient and hence slow groundwater fluxes with at the same time high loads of land derived compounds increases the time for biogeochemical reactions moore 1999 robinson et al 2018 low terrestrial sgd rates are typically associated with a larger dispersion zone where terrestrial and sea water mix smith 2004 4 4 sea water as origin of groundwater in the peatland high cl concentrations in the peatland reveal that the groundwater partly originates from the baltic sea chloride is considered a conservative tracer allowing to track saltwater jones et al 1999 a comparison of the chloride concentrations in aquifer and peat with the current chloride concentration in the baltic sea fig 5 supplementary material s4 1 indicates that 24 4 average standard deviation of all samples from 2p 6p 7p of the water in the peat and 30 3 samples from 2ls 6ls 7ls of water in the shallow aquifer consist of seawater the increased cl concentrations cannot be caused by et since the climatic water balance is positive sc monitoring has not shown any long term increase and pore water profiles from koebsch et al 2019 reveal freshwater in the upper 20 cm hence the cl concentrations in the peat observation wells can be regarded a mixture of young fresh water and older brackish water in the dune sands the sc was in average 1 0 ms cm 2ds demonstrating freshwater recharge in the dune dike furthermore koebsch et al 2019 showed by means of stable isotope analysis that the source of sulphur in the central peatland is the baltic sea further they showed that sulphur reducing bacteria depleted the sulphate pool at some spots while a spot near mp7 indicated elevated amounts of iron in the form of labile iron minerals and dissolved ferrous iron the comparison of molar so42 cl ratios in the groundwater with the current ratio from the baltic sea indicates that sulphate has been enriched at 7ls slightly reduced at 6ls and almost completely reduced at 2ls which affects the measured sc the process leading to an enrichment of so42 at 7ls needs further investigation and is beyond the scope of this study we assume inundations as the main pathway of the seawater into the peatland both directly from the sea in past times and via the ditch network since rewetting subsurface intrusion of saltwater the other possible pathway is unlikely the cl concentrations decrease from the central peatland towards the coast fig 5b and the soil sc measured in the sediment cores at the beach did not increase with depth disproving the existence of a saltwater wedge in the aquifer supplementary material s6 only close to the shoreline at 1ls where several seawater breakthroughs occurred in the past and the dune dike is disappearing high cl concentrations as well as observed rises in sc after storm surges demonstrate intrusion of seawater in the subsurface under the dune the rather homogeneous distribution of cl in peat and aquifer despite different groundwater ages suggests that floods occurred regularly in the past 4 5 vertical flow reversals the direction of the vertical water flow in the peat switches depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions when precipitation is high and et low as typically during winter time the vertical hydraulic gradients indicate a downward directed flow with enhanced et in summer the water level in the peat decreases below the water level in the aquifer indicating a flow reversal with upward directed flow from the aquifer as in summer 2017 however when the water level in the forest dropped drastically in late summer 2018 due to unusually low precipitation and high et the inflow of surface and groundwater from the forest to the peatland decreased the hydraulic head in the aquifer dropped accordingly and no upward directed flow in the peatland was visible in the water levels hence recharge downward flow occurs during times with precipitation and small et while discharge upward flow occurs during times with enhanced et and sufficient groundwater inflow from the larger groundwater catchment as has been described in several studies for inland peatlands e g siegel and glaser 1987 devito et al 1997 drexler et al 1999 fraser et al 2001 kopp et al 2013 the flow direction may vary spatially within the peat depending on factors such as a local anisotropy of k drexler et al 1999 local high specific storage reeve et al 2006 methane production romanowicz et al 1993 and the transpiration rate of the vegetation type drexler et al 1999 which varies in the study area between reeds submerged aquatic species in shallow open water and sedges in dryer areas koch et al 2017 the oscillation of downward and upward water movement will enhance vertical mixing in the peat column reeve et al 2006 and thus affect geochemical profiles fraser et al 2001 another indicator for a switching vertical flow direction is the temporal variability of the sc in typical years a seasonal cycle of sc can be observed in the peat with a higher sc during summer due to enhanced et and dilution during winter as a result of precipitation selle et al 2016 the amplitude of the sc was largest where the well filter screen was located in the upper meter of the peat 7p 3p smaller at around 1 m depth 6p and the sc was constant at a depth of 2 m 2p fig 5a and supplementary material fig s3 2 these observations indicate that the intensity of flow reversals in the peat decreases with depth specific conductivity fluctuations behaved accordingly in the aquifer below hence they were more pronounced where the peat layer above the aquifer is thinner 5 conclusions in the coastal fen heiligensee and hütelmoor hydrological conditions have changed over time following anthropogenic interferences drainage dike construction rewetting the groundwater system was assessed by the distributions of hydraulic heads sc and major ions apparent tritium helium groundwater ages δne and 4herad concentrations were successfully used as proxies to identify mixing of water from different sources in the aquifer underlying the peat slow downward flow years to decades of surface water through the peat into the aquifer was identified as the major source of groundwater which mixes there with older upward flowing groundwater today despite rewetting local groundwater flow fields are determined by the location of ditches with upward flow towards the ditches or the sea and infiltration into the peat in areas in between the peat thickness determines the water exchange between surface water and groundwater in the peat and aquifer seen in increased apparent groundwater ages with increased peat thickness the deduced flow patterns are transferable to other coastal peatlands typically experiencing the same sequence of anthropogenic influences these flow patterns determine the distribution of salts and other compounds in the peat and aquifer which crucially affect biogeochemical processes such as methane production the wide range of groundwater ages and a mostly homogeneous distribution of chloride concentrations in the aquifer indicate that brackish conditions have prevailed over decades and possibly even centuries rewetting and preceding drainage of coastal fens is concluded to have limited impact on deeper groundwater and to mainly influence the upper peat at the coastal interface rewetting revives submarine groundwater discharge and associated solute fluxes despite low hydraulic gradients with a potential impact on marine biogeochemistry credit authorship

2727,confidence in the simulation of hydrological models to accurately represent the inherent variability of a watershed is dependent on proper calibration calibration of hydrological models using streamflow and actual evapotranspiration aet data which the latter has a remarkable spatial and temporal distribution in the watershed scale gives more confidence on the partitioning of water between soil storage and aquifer recharge therefore this study aims to improve hydrological response of the agricultural based neishaboor watershed located at the northeast of iran using the soil water assessment tool swat to this end monthly streamflow data at three hydrometric stations 1997 2010 and monthly aet values computed by sebal surface energy balance algorithm for land algorithm using modis products 2001 2010 were employed for the swat hybrid calibration and validation the results showed that rchrg dp sol awc esco epco and canmx are the most sensitive parameters to aet estimation the proposed hybrid calibration method had reasonable performance on aet estimation in which ns and rmse values varied between 0 7 0 88 and 7 89 9 96 mm month 1 in calibration and 0 86 0 93 and 6 79 7

the swat model for the calibration average rmse 17 18 and validation average rmse 9 44 periods was obtained in the range of measured aet values which were higher than 50 mm month 1 in the watershed scale the calibrated swat model with the proposed hybrid calibration method provides efficient tool for hydrological monitoring especially in arid and semi arid regions keywords hybrid calibration hydrological monitoring sebal based aet swat data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the comprehensive recognition of surface water balance components especially in arid and semi arid areas has an important influence on sustainable watershed development watersheds in these regions are characterized by relatively larger extremes for hydrological components like low annual precipitation with high intensity storms and high potential evapotranspiration pet pilgrim et al 1988 beven 2002 niraula et al 2012 models have been widely used for the assessments and estimation of surface water balance components best management practices and land use changes swat arnold et al 1998 is one of these hydrological models that is widely employed in various hydrological applications e g narasimhan et al 2005 ghoraba 2015 jang et al 2018 valeh et al 2021 swat was originally developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in large and complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over a long period of time at a daily time step it also has the capability to evaluate the relative effects of different management scenarios on water quality sediment and agricultural chemical yield in large un gauged basins neitsch et al 2009 in recent years many efforts have been made to improve swat performance which generally can be classified into two groups the first one is the studies that strive to improve some parts of the hydrological components computationally xiong et al 2019 athira 2021 for instance the effects of two modification scenarios related to percolation rate swat ml and crack flow module swat cf were discussed on streamflow crop yield and aet simulation eini et al 2020 swat ml and swat cf outperformed compared to the standard swat model for the estimation of streamflow the second group is the studies which enhance the swat performance merely by focusing on the model calibration methods becker et al 2019 azimi et al 2020 due to the lack of high quality input data and conceptual simplification of the hydrological processes hydrological models need to be calibrated beven 2006 gupta et al 2008 srinivasan et al 2010 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 dile et al 2020 indeed the calibration process should be rigorously employed in the development and application of these models precise consideration should be taken into account during the model calibration as results may vary widely based on the applied calibration method to understand the dynamic of processes the selected variables for the model calibration should demonstrate spatial and temporal changes in the watershed scale generally streamflow data in the outlet of watersheds is widely used for swat calibration e g wu and johnston 2007 li et al 2010 ficklin and barnhart 2014 worqlul et al 2018 cong et al 2020 models calibrated only based on the streamflow data may produce less accurate results for various land uses and subbasins within the watershed abbaspour et al 2007 in fact calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model against streamflow alone may not provide sufficient confidence for all components of the surface water balance faramarzi et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 furthermore streamflow data may not represent the natural characteristics of the system in watersheds which influenced by anthropogenic activities extensively immerzeel and droogers 2008 for these reasons hybrid calibration is suggested by abbaspour et al 2007 for a better characterization of different components and as a way of dealing with the uncertainty problem in watersheds because of the direct relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration jensen 1968 fao food and agriculture organization 1986 swat calibration using crop yield along with streamflow may improve the swat performance e g baumgart 2005 hu et al 2007 luo et al 2008 akhavana et al 2010 nair et al 2011 however crop yield cannot properly reflect the changes of the evapotranspiration during the growth season therefore aet which has a significant spatial and temporal distribution with noticeable effects on surface water balance especially in arid and semi arid areas plays a key role in the accurate calibration of the hydrological models therefore this study aimed to improve the swat model calibration through the hybrid application of multi ground based streamflow data and remotely sensed sebal based aet data observations the hybrid calibration method is applied to the neishaboor watershed located at the northeast of iran wherein intense groundwater abstraction occurs for irrigation practices in which aet has a crucial effect on surface water balance and water management sustainability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data collection neishaboor watershed is located between 35 40 n to 36 39 n latitude and 58 17 e to 59 30 e longitude in the northeast of iran fig 1 total area is 9158 km2 including 4241 km2 mountainous terrains and 4917 km2 of plain maximum elevation is located in binalood mountains 3300 m and minimum elevation is at the outlet of the watershed hoseinabad 1050 m average daily streamflow value at hoseinabad station is 0 36 m3s 1 for the period of 1997 2012 with a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 16 m3s 1 the study area has a semi arid to arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 261 mm that varies from one year to another coefficient variation cv 20 9 mean annual temperature changes from 12 9 c bar station mountainous area to 14 7 c fedisheh station plain area the annual pet is about 2335 mm basic components of a surface water conceptual model for developing a swat framework include sources and sinks of water the physical boundaries land use and soil maps and crop management practices in the region the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem grid cell 90 m 90 m was selected as the base elevation model the stream network map produced by the national cartographic center ncc at a scale of 1 25 000 was used both of soil and land use maps at scale of 1 100 000 prepared by khorasan razavi regional water authority were employed records from 23 precipitation four air temperature and three solar radiation gauges over a period of 14 years 1997 2010 were used in swat the wxgen weather generator model sharpley and williams 1990 which is incorporated in swat was used to generate data for relative humidity and wind speed parameters the solar radiation was calculated using the angstrom prescott equation angstrom 1924 detailed descriptive statistics for rainfall temperature and runoff parameters are given in the supplementary material sm monthly sebal based aet values during 2001 2010 were used for hybrid calibration of swat which will describe in section 2 4 2 2 streamflow calibration as it is mentioned before a hybrid calibration method was implemented to improve the swat performance we used the calibrated swat model based on streamflow izady et al 2015 in this model the simulation period was 1997 2010 calibration oct 2000 to sep 2007 validation oct 2007 to sep 2010 in which the first 3 years were used as a warm up period to mitigate the impact of unknown initial conditions and were excluded from the analysis the neishaboor watershed was subdivided into 248 subbasins precipitation and temperature lapse rate values were estimated to be 160 mm km and 6 c km respectively and five elevation bands were considered in each subbasin the pet was computed using the hargreaves method in which minimum and maximum daily temperature are the only required parameters also the variable storage method was used for channel routing manual irrigation method was selected for the crop management based on planted crops irrigated winter wheat and corn silage and groundwater extraction data irrigation depths were computed for each subbasin to do this agriculture wells were firstly overlaid on the swat delineated subbasins then knowing the number of agriculture wells in each subbasin the total discharge was calculated for each subbasin finally a uniform irrigation rate for each subbasin was calculated by dividing total discharge by planted area of the subbasin moreover a depth for each irrigation event was calculated based on each crop s irrigation interval which is collected through the field trips the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 uncertainty analysis algorithm was used for calibration abbaspour et al 2007 a comprehensive and detailed description of the procedure employed to develop the surface water conceptual and numerical models based on streamflow data is given by izady et al 2014 2015 2 3 sebal algorithm sebal calculates the aet as a residual term of the surface energy balance as 1 λet r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g and h are the soil and sensible heat fluxes w m 2 respectively each of the terms in the right side of eq 1 are computed through a series of computations net radiation rn is computed by subtracting all outgoing radiation fluxes from all incoming radiation fluxes soil heat flux g is empirically calculated as a g r n fraction using vegetation indices land surface temperature and surface albedo sensible heat flux h was computed using wind speed measurements surface roughness and difference between land surface to air temperature dt bastiaanssen et al 1998 the last mentioned component is driven using a linear relation between dt and land surface temperature in hot and cold pixels more details are given in bastiaanssen et al 1998 using modis images during 2001 to 2010 in the days realized clear sky without any cloud the images of each components including rn g and h was separately computed and finally aet values for the entire study area were obtained through sebal algorithm eq 1 2 4 hybrid calibration as neishaboor watershed is an irrigated agriculture based watershed the processes affecting the water balance are highly influenced by aet on the other hand calibration of a model only based on streamflow values cannot consider the hydrological processes in the watershed scale completely for this purpose the final ranges of the swat model which was calibrated based on streamflow data were used as initial ranges for model calibration based on aet values hybrid calibration out of 248 subbasins 26 subbasins with main characteristics listed in table 1 were selected for the hybrid calibration to achieve this aim the aet images for 26 selected subbasins were extracted from the entire watershed aet images and then the average of aet values in each subbasin was considered for swat calibration and validation in monthly scale aet values from may 2001 to dec 2006 and may 2007 to aug 2010 were used for hybrid calibration and validation periods respectively due to the scarcity of measured aet data and considering the size of study area the values estimated using the swat model were compared with those obtained from sebal algorithm as benchmarks different evaluation criteria were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the model these include p factor r factor coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the last two indices are defined as follows 2 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 3 ns 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o avg 2 where n is the number of values pi oi and oavg are predicted sebal based and average of sebal based aet values respectively ns ranges between and 1 0 with ns 1 being the optimal value 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow estimation table 2 shows the statistical indices of the swat model which is calibrated based on streamflow data izady et al 2015 and hybrid method both of streamflow and aet in the case of calibration based on streamflow ns values ranged between 0 54 0 91 and 0 55 0 84 at calibration and validation respectively the corresponding values for the hybrid calibration method were obtained 0 81 0 87 and 0 87 0 9 respectively examination of the results showed that the lowest and highest decreases in rmse for the hybrid calibration method in comparison to the calibration method based on only streamflow data were approximately 8 calibration phase of hossein abad station and 70 validation phase of kharvm station respectively according to the results both calibration methods had appropriate performance for estimating streamflow although the hybrid calibration method significantly improved the accuracy of the swat model azimi et al 2020 investigated the capability of three satellite based soil moisture data including smap ascat and scatsar swi products on daily swat discharge simulation in italy according to the results a general improvement in discharge simulation is observed for all the three mentioned products especially for smap in term of low flows hydrological responses to land use changes using an improved swat model calibrated based on modis lai data was investigated by zhang et al 2020 in australia improved model enhanced monthly streamflow simulation by assigning values of ns 0 92 and r2 0 94 compared to ns 0 9 and r2 0 9 for default swat model figs 2 to 4 show the streamflow calibration results in three selected hydrometric stations as well as precipitation values measured versus predicted values of streamflow data are also represented in fig 5 3 2 aet estimation fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of monthly aet values for the study area e g 19 june 2007 which is computed by sebal algorithm eq 1 aet values vary between 0 and 251 mm with higher values in the irrigated subbasins the aet were computed for the period of 2001 2010 in monthly scale and then the aet values were extracted from these images for 26 selected subbasins subbasins with high irrigated practices and consequently significant aet values were considered finally the average of monthly aet values in each subbasin were considered in the swat model under hybrid calibration method 3 3 hybrid calibration and uncertainty analysis the calibrated parameters based on streamflow and aet values are listed in table 3 according to the results streamflow such as trnsrch and cn2 evapotranspiration such as sol awc and esco snowmelt such as smfmn and smfmx and groundwater flow parameters such as rchrg dp and gw revap ahmadi et al 2012 2015 are sensitive to hybrid calibration method the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp and soil available water storage capacity sol awc were the most sensitive parameters during the hybrid calibration since the land use in the central part of the neishaboor watershed is predominantly agricultural intense groundwater pumping occurs for irrigation practices because of this irrigation return flow is crucial to groundwater recharge in this part of the watershed moreover the capacity of soil for water storage is high in this part of the watershed due to intensive irrigation activities the fact that these two parameters are the most sensitive reveals how critical groundwater recharge and soil water capacity are to accurately partitioning soil water among soil storage evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge immerzeel and droogers 2008 is reported that the sol awc as one of the most effective parameters in swat calibration based on evapotranspiration values so that it s addition to the set of parameters improved the calibration coefficient from 0 4 to 0 49 the results of table 3 also shows that soil evaporation compensation factor esco had important role on evapotranspiration prediction which is well reported in the literature li et al 2010 parajuli et al 2018 shah et al 2021 esco is a parameter which determines the role of surface and deep layers in providing the moisture required for the evaporation process the higher this parameter the more prominent the role of surface layers in providing that moisture evaporation from soil surface is a function of thickness of the evaporation layer and the energy required to perform the evaporation process due to the low groundwater level in the study area the thickness of evaporation layer in this area is not large enough to provide water from underlying layers for the evaporation process the epco parameter controls the evapotranspiration process via plant uptake and higher epco values indicate that the deeper layers play a larger role in this upward flow of water depth of the root system plant demand for transpiration and water content of the soil are among the most important factors determining epco since the selected subbasins in calibration phase are selected from mostly irrigated agricultural lands the main source of water supply during april to september months with high evapotranspiration is irrigation water which is primarily stored in surface layers of the soil and therefore these layers play an important role in providing water for plant uptake it should be noted that in the swat model the default value for this coefficient is 1 i e maximum contribution of underlying layers to plant uptake however it was adjusted in the present study according to the conditions of the study area 0 63 epco 0 72 wu and johnston 2007 reported epco as an effective parameter and resulted in values of 0 7 in their arid climate area which is similar to the range obtained in table 2 0 7 to 0 74 canmx is the maximum amount of water that can be trapped in the canopy which forms one of the terms for aet calculation in swat and thus canopy can play a significant role in transpiration infiltration or surface runoff the impact of canopy on these processes is of course a function of vegetation density and plant species morphology considering the importance of rainfall the role of this parameter in evapotranspiration process can be justified total available water which can be used in the transpiration process is a function of volumetric moisture at field capacity and permanent wilting point which can be calculated using bulk density represented as sol bd in the swat model taw θfc θpwp bd soil temperature is also one of the main parameters influencing plant growth and physical chemical and biological activities in the soil which directly affects the calculation of damping depth and indirectly affects the evapotranspiration process in the swat model soil temperature is calculated in swat in the form of a time series concept and using sol bd due to the seasonality of the rivers in the region most of the losses occurs through stream bed infiltration therefore runoff is controlled by the reach transmission loss which helps to partition the soil water to evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge accurately swat calculates the amount of water moving from one layer to the underlying layer using storage routing methodology which is a function of drainable volume and travel time for percolation the latter of which is obtained based on saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k therefore having a high value for the sol k parameter will affect percolation and consequently the parallel flows feeding the streamflow network and otherwise this parameter will affect the evapotranspiration process by retaining water in the surface layers one way of calculating runoff in swat is to use the scs method which is based on infiltration curve number the curve number itself is a function of land use and hydrological soil group the values of which are provided on the basis of nrcs classification curve number is ultimately adjusted in the swat model based on soil moisture content where the use of cn 2 means average moisture condition of soil thus the role of this parameter in formation of surface runoff and streamflow feeding or its role in plant covered agricultural lands the role of vegetation in increasing moisture retention and transfer of the surface runoff formed to soil surface layers in the evapotranspiration process can be analyzed snow parameters were also among sensitive parameters the reason for the sensitivities of the snow parameters is that eastern part of the neishaboor watershed is mountainous and snowmelt controls baseflow of this part the effective hydraulic conductivity ch k2 and manning s n value ov n are effective parameters in infiltration process from the streambed which control the loss of water through the streambed although about 20 parameters have been introduced as effective parameters in calibration and sensitivity analysis of the swat model the first approximately 10 parameters have had the largest role in determining the hydrological behavior of the basin with their behavior partially analyzed above the point should be emphasized here is that determination of the precise effects of the specific variables on main hydrological components runoff evapotranspiration and deep percolation seems to be complex in the hydrological models especially in the watershed scale because of the interaction of the model parameters however using aet against streamflow data in the form of hybrid calibration method helps to consider these interactions more accurately model uncertainty indices related to aet prediction including p factor and r factor are listed in table 4 in three subbasins according to results of table 4 almost same values of p factor is obtained for the calibration and validation phases p factor value for subbasin no 9 is slightly higher than three other subbasins which caused a higher value of r factor in the mentioned subbasin comparing the results of r factor showed that in all four subbasins aet prediction uncertainty is decreased from calibration to validation phase with the lowest and highest percent equal to 5 3 subbasin no 14 and 19 subbasin no 20 another point is that the range of r factor variation in validation phase 0 19 is less than the calibration phase 0 27 uncertainties about aet can be discussed in two different parts the first one is particularly related to the aet itself given the aim of this work and the higher level of aet in irrigated farmlands the authors tried to choose subbasins used for cropping and particularly irrigated ones for modeling therefore the area in each subbasin which belongs to the agricultural landuse controls the results precision another source of uncertainties is referred to the irrigation scheduling in each subbasin the more accuracy of the estimation of amount and time of irrigation in each subbasin the more reliable aet prediction apart from the aet prediction by itself the uncertainties related to prediction of runoff and other terms of water balance equation in each subbasin is efficacious on aet prediction a statistical comparison between two types of the swat calibration methods used for estimating aet values is presented in table 5 based on the recommended threshold values of 0 4 and 0 5 for ns and r2 respectively by green and griensven 2008 or value of 0 5 for ns by moriasi et al 2007 the results of mentioned indices are reasonable for both calibration and validation periods according to table 5 the values of r2 ranged between 0 77 and 0 93 whereas the same values were resulted approximately 0 4 to 0 81 by immerzeel and droogers 2008 for swat calibration based on aet values according to the results of table 5 the hybrid calibration method outperformed in comparison with calibration method only based on streamflow for estimating aet so that the rmse in the calibration phase and for subbasins no 14 no 20 and 25 is decreased about 41 24 and 33 respectively in the validation period for subbasins no 14 9 20 and 25 the corresponding values were obtained about 58 36 40 and 47 respectively capability of remotely sensed hydrological information including daily et estimates cmirset and soil moisture values amsr e to calibrate a simplified australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l for estimating streamflow in 11 catchments eastern australia was discussed by kunnath poovakka et al 2016 their results revealed that applying rs derived et product can improve streamflow estimation especially in catchment with low average runoff values to address how remotely sensed et data can influence the water balance component rajib et al 2018 used four different configuration of swat calibration including m1 only streamflow data m2 m1 and biophysical parameters m3 lumped et values and m4 spatial et values in a large watershed in the united states the results indicated an improvement in the model accuracy based on m2 in comparison with m1 a distinct improvement for estimating et values and a decrement in water yield estimation uncertainty is also reported by replacing m3 by m4 kge values for the m1 m2 m3 and m4 configurations in model verification period 2009 2013 is obtained 0 5 0 63 0 7 and 0 75 respectively parajuli et al 2018 evaluated different type of the swat calibration methods for estimating aet in mississippi and reported the values of 0 56 and 0 34 for r2 and ns respectively at calibration and 0 5 and 0 38 at validation phase swat model calibrated based on streamflow the corresponding values for the swat model which is calibrated based on both streamflow and aet values were obtained 0 68 and 0 5 at calibration and 0 72 and 0 6 at validation using small scale and diverse cropping patterns becker et al 2019 proposed a modified remote sensing rs derived aet data for improving aet simulation rmse 26 7 compared to unmodified data rmse 32 7 examining the results of two schemes scheme 1 swat calibration based on streamflow data and scheme 2 swat calibration based on both streamflow and rs based aet data for estimating monthly aet values at the subbasin level showed a slightly better performance of scheme 2 shah et al 2021 in scheme 1 r2 and ns values ranged between 0 72 0 86 and 0 29 0 65 respectively whereas the corresponding values in the scheme 2 were obtained between 0 74 0 86 and 0 33 0 7 time series of sebal based aet values predicted values by swat hybrid method and 95 ppu in four selected subbasins for both calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 7 and 8 which indicate proper results of the swat performance fig 9 also depicts sebal based aet versus predicted values by the swat model through hybrid calibration method fig 10 illustrates the difference between aet values predicted by sebal algorithm and swat model over various aet intervals in 4 subbasins numbers 14 9 20 and 25 according to the results the majority of the points are concentrated within a 0 40 mm interval in general however with increasing the aet values differences between sebal based and swat aet values are increased although the mentioned trend is more evidence in the calibration set compared to the validation set in calibration set absolute value of the largest differences between aet values predicted by sebal and those by swat in the four aforementioned subbasins are approximately 36 mm subbasin 14 sep 2005 60 80 mm interval of aet values 32 mm subbasin 9 aug 2008 60 80 mm interval of aet values and 24 mm subbasin 20 july 2006 60 80 mm interval of aet values and 27 mm subbasin 25 aug 2004 60 80 mm interval of aet values respectively in validation set corresponding values are respectively about 20 mm subbasin 14 sep 2007 40 60 mm interval of aet values 31 mm subbasin 9 march 2008 20 40 mm interval of aet values 22 mm subbasin 20 march 2008 20 40 mm interval of aet values and 27 mm subbasin 25 aug 2008 60 80 mm interval of aet values parajuli et al 2018 employed flow and modis based aet data for better hydrological simulation of big sunflower river watershed mississippi using swat model in contrast to our results their findings indicated a general over prediction tendency by swat 16 5 over prediction 3 4 hybrid method performance in selected intervals in order to more accurate analysis of the swat model results its performance was examined at various intervals of measured aet values fig 11 based on data distribution in fig 9 swat performance in predicting aet values in subbasins 14 and 20 was analyzed at three intervals of measured aet values including lower than 20 mm 20 50 mm and higher than 50 mm for subbains 9 and 25 the first and second intervals were changed to lower than 10 mm and 10 50 mm respectively based on the results depicted in fig 11 and at calibration phase of hybrid method higher intervals of measured aet were accompanied by increased prediction errors in all four subbasins with the highest errors occurred in the third interval higher than 50 mm incidentally the lowest number of data points measured aet values in the four subbasins is also observed in this interval the minimum and maximum aet prediction errors at this phase calibration were approximately 3 13 and 20 74 mm month 1 respectively both in subbasin 9 in subbasin 14 prediction error increased from the first 20 mm to the second 20 50 mm interval and from the second to the third 50 mm interval by about 48 and 136 respectively whereas the corresponding values were respectively about 215 and 110 for subbasin 9 154 and 20 for subbasin 20 and 89 and 140 6 for subbasin 25 in contrast to the calibration set the highest prediction error in subbasins 14 and 9 at validation phase was observed at the second interval 20 50 mm for subbasin 14 and 10 50 mm for subbasin 9 in subbasin 20 the highest error occurred at the third interval rmse 9 71 although it was barely different from the error rate at the second interval rmse 9 57 in subbasin 25 compared to the first rmse 4 99 and second interval rmse 5 86 the highest error also occurred at the third interval rmse 13 86 the results also show that the most uniform performance of the swat model in predicting aet values in the four subbasins between calibration and validation phases has occurred at the second interval of subbasin 9 with the lowest rmse decrement equal to approximately 2 4 similar to calibration set for subbasins 14 20 and 25 there was only subbasin 25 an inverse relationship between the number of measured data points in each interval and the error rate occurring in that same interval at swat validation phase at this phase validation the minimum and maximum aet prediction errors were 2 39 and 13 86 mm month 1 in subbasins 9 and 25 and at the first and the last intervals of measured aet values respectively fig 11 4 conclusion accurate knowledge of hydrological components is essential for sustainable water development with reasonable calibration swat model is capable to simulate hydrological responses in the watershed scale literature review shows that streamflow data is widely used for calibration however it may not represent properly the hydrological processes in the watershed hence using aet data which has reasonable spatial watershed area and temporal various stages of plant growth distribution along with the streamflow data lead to improve the swat performance in the present study monthly sebal based aet values 2001 2010 were used to re calibrate a calibrated swat model based on streamflow data with varying the statistical indices of three selected subbasins in the range of ns 0 7 0 88 r2 0 77 0 93 rmse 7 89 9 96 at calibration and ns 0 86 0 93 r2 0 86 0 94 rmse 6 79 7 91 at validation phases the performance of the swat model under proposed hybrid calibration was evaluated quite satisfactory in aet estimation in comparison to the sebal based aet a general under prediction behavior was proved by the swat model under the proposed method highest error rate of the swat was obtained in the range of measured aet values which were higher than 50 mm month 1 for both calibration average rmse 17 18 and validation average rmse 9 44 periods respectively the proposed hybrid calibration method although requires different types of reliable data could be applied for implementing management practices and other water related decision

low annual precipitation with high intensity storms and high potential evapotranspiration pet pilgrim et al 1988 beven 2002 niraula et al 2012 models have been widely used for the assessments and estimation of surface water balance components best management practices and land use changes swat arnold et al 1998 is one of these hydrological models that is widely employed in various hydrological applications e g narasimhan et al 2005 ghoraba 2015 jang et al 2018 valeh et al 2021 swat was originally developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in large and complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over a long period of time at a daily time step it also has the capability to evaluate the relative effects of different management scenarios on water quality sediment and agricultural chemical yield in large un gauged basins neitsch et al 2009 in recent years many efforts have been made to improve swat performance which generally can be classified into two groups the first one is the studies that strive to improve some parts of the hydrological components computationally xiong et al 2019 athira 2021 for instance the effects of two modification scenarios related to percolation rate swat ml and crack flow module swat cf were discussed on streamflow crop yield and aet simulation eini et al 2020 swat ml and swat cf outperformed compared to the standard swat model for the estimation of streamflow the second group is the studies which enhance the swat performance merely by focusing on the model calibration methods becker et al 2019 azimi et al 2020 due to the lack of high quality input data and conceptual simplification of the hydrological processes hydrological models need to be calibrated beven 2006 gupta et al 2008 srinivasan et al 2010 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 dile et al 2020 indeed the calibration process should be rigorously employed in the development and application of these models precise consideration should be taken into account during the model calibration as results may vary widely based on the applied calibration method to understand the dynamic of processes the selected variables for the model calibration should demonstrate spatial and temporal changes in the watershed scale generally streamflow data in the outlet of watersheds is widely used for swat calibration e g wu and johnston 2007 li et al 2010 ficklin and barnhart 2014 worqlul et al 2018 cong et al 2020 models calibrated only based on the streamflow data may produce less accurate results for various land uses and subbasins within the watershed abbaspour et al 2007 in fact calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model against streamflow alone may not provide sufficient confidence for all components of the surface water balance faramarzi et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 furthermore streamflow data may not represent the natural characteristics of the system in watersheds which influenced by anthropogenic activities extensively immerzeel and droogers 2008 for these reasons hybrid calibration is suggested by abbaspour et al 2007 for a better characterization of different components and as a way of dealing with the uncertainty problem in watersheds because of the direct relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration jensen 1968 fao food and agriculture organization 1986 swat calibration using crop yield along with streamflow may improve the swat performance e g baumgart 2005 hu et al 2007 luo et al 2008 akhavana et al 2010 nair et al 2011 however crop yield cannot properly reflect the changes of the evapotranspiration during the growth season therefore aet which has a significant spatial and temporal distribution with noticeable effects on surface water balance especially in arid and semi arid areas plays a key role in the accurate calibration of the hydrological models therefore this study aimed to improve the swat model calibration through the hybrid application of multi ground based streamflow data and remotely sensed sebal based aet data observations the hybrid calibration method is applied to the neishaboor watershed located at the northeast of iran wherein intense groundwater abstraction occurs for irrigation practices in which aet has a crucial effect on surface water balance and water management sustainability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data collection neishaboor watershed is located between 35 40 n to 36 39 n latitude and 58 17 e to 59 30 e longitude in the northeast of iran fig 1 total area is 9158 km2 including 4241 km2 mountainous terrains and 4917 km2 of plain maximum elevation is located in binalood mountains 3300 m and minimum elevation is at the outlet of the watershed hoseinabad 1050 m average daily streamflow value at hoseinabad station is 0 36 m3s 1 for the period of 1997 2012 with a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 16 m3s 1 the study area has a semi arid to arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 261 mm that varies from one year to another coefficient variation cv 20 9 mean annual temperature changes from 12 9 c bar station mountainous area to 14 7 c fedisheh station plain area the annual pet is about 2335 mm basic components of a surface water conceptual model for developing a swat framework include sources and sinks of water the physical boundaries land use and soil maps and crop management practices in the region the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem grid cell 90 m 90 m was selected as the base elevation model the stream network map produced by the national cartographic center ncc at a scale of 1 25 000 was used both of soil and land use maps at scale of 1 100 000 prepared by khorasan razavi regional water authority were employed records from 23 precipitation four air temperature and three solar radiation gauges over a period of 14 years 1997 2010 were used in swat the wxgen weather generator model sharpley and williams 1990 which is incorporated in swat was used to generate data for relative humidity and wind speed parameters the solar radiation was calculated using the angstrom prescott equation angstrom 1924 detailed descriptive statistics for rainfall temperature and runoff parameters are given in the supplementary material sm monthly sebal based aet values during 2001 2010 were used for hybrid calibration of swat which will describe in section 2 4 2 2 streamflow calibration as it is mentioned before a hybrid calibration method was implemented to improve the swat performance we used the calibrated swat model based on streamflow izady et al 2015 in this model the simulation period was 1997 2010 calibration oct 2000 to sep 2007 validation oct 2007 to sep 2010 in which the first 3 years were used as a warm up period to mitigate the impact of unknown initial conditions and were excluded from the analysis the neishaboor watershed was subdivided into 248 subbasins precipitation and temperature lapse rate values were estimated to be 160 mm km and 6 c km respectively and five elevation bands were considered in each subbasin the pet was computed using the hargreaves method in which minimum and maximum daily temperature are the only required parameters also the variable storage method was used for channel routing manual irrigation method was selected for the crop management based on planted crops irrigated winter wheat and corn silage and groundwater extraction data irrigation depths were computed for each subbasin to do this agriculture wells were firstly overlaid on the swat delineated subbasins then knowing the number of agriculture wells in each subbasin the total discharge was calculated for each subbasin finally a uniform irrigation rate for each subbasin was calculated by dividing total discharge by planted area of the subbasin moreover a depth for each irrigation event was calculated based on each crop s irrigation interval which is collected through the field trips the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 uncertainty analysis algorithm was used for calibration abbaspour et al 2007 a comprehensive and detailed description of the procedure employed to develop the surface water conceptual and numerical models based on streamflow data is given by izady et al 2014 2015 2 3 sebal algorithm sebal calculates the aet as a residual term of the surface energy balance as 1 λet r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g and h are the soil and sensible heat fluxes w m 2 respectively each of the terms in the right side of eq 1 are computed through a series of computations net radiation rn is computed by subtracting all outgoing radiation fluxes from all incoming radiation fluxes soil heat flux g is empirically calculated as a g r n fraction using vegetation indices land surface temperature and surface albedo sensible heat flux h was computed using wind speed measurements surface roughness and difference between land surface to air temperature dt bastiaanssen et al 1998 the last mentioned component is driven using a linear relation between dt and land surface temperature in hot and cold pixels more details are given in bastiaanssen et al 1998 using modis images during 2001 to 2010 in the days realized clear sky without any cloud the images of each components including rn g and h was separately computed and finally aet values for the entire study area were obtained through sebal algorithm eq 1 2 4 hybrid calibration as neishaboor watershed is an irrigated agriculture based watershed the processes affecting the water balance are highly influenced by aet on the other hand calibration of a model only based on streamflow values cannot consider the hydrological processes in the watershed scale completely for this purpose the final ranges of the swat model which was calibrated based on streamflow data were used as initial ranges for model calibration based on aet values hybrid calibration out of 248 subbasins 26 subbasins with main characteristics listed in table 1 were selected for the hybrid calibration to achieve this aim the aet images for 26 selected subbasins were extracted from the entire watershed aet images and then the average of aet values in each subbasin was considered for swat calibration and validation in monthly scale aet values from may 2001 to dec 2006 and may 2007 to aug 2010 were used for hybrid calibration and validation periods respectively due to the scarcity of measured aet data and considering the size of study area the values estimated using the swat model were compared with those obtained from sebal algorithm as benchmarks different evaluation criteria were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the model these include p factor r factor coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the last two indices are defined as follows 2 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 3 ns 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o avg 2 where n is the number of values pi oi and oavg are predicted sebal based and average of sebal based aet values respectively ns ranges between and 1 0 with ns 1 being the optimal value 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow estimation table 2 shows the statistical indices of the swat model which is calibrated based on streamflow data izady et al 2015 and hybrid method both of streamflow and aet in the case of calibration based on streamflow ns values ranged between 0 54 0 91 and 0 55 0 84 at calibration and validation respectively the corresponding values for the hybrid calibration method were obtained 0 81 0 87 and 0 87 0 9 respectively examination of the results showed that the lowest and highest decreases in rmse for the hybrid calibration method in comparison to the calibration method based on only streamflow data were approximately 8 calibration phase of hossein abad station and 70 validation phase of kharvm station respectively according to the results both calibration methods had appropriate performance for estimating streamflow although the hybrid calibration method significantly improved the accuracy of the swat model azimi et al 2020 investigated the capability of three satellite based soil moisture data including smap ascat and scatsar swi products on daily swat discharge simulation in italy according to the results a general improvement in discharge simulation is observed for all the three mentioned products especially for smap in term of low flows hydrological responses to land use changes using an improved swat model calibrated based on modis lai data was investigated by zhang et al 2020 in australia improved model enhanced monthly streamflow simulation by assigning values of ns 0 92 and r2 0 94 compared to ns 0 9 and r2 0 9 for default swat model figs 2 to 4 show the streamflow calibration results in three selected hydrometric stations as well as precipitation values measured versus predicted values of streamflow data are also represented in fig 5 3 2 aet estimation fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of monthly aet values for the study area e g 19 june 2007 which is computed by sebal algorithm eq 1 aet values vary between 0 and 251 mm with higher values in the irrigated subbasins the aet were computed for the period of 2001 2010 in monthly scale and then the aet values were extracted from these images for 26 selected subbasins subbasins with high irrigated practices and consequently significant aet values were considered finally the average of monthly aet values in each subbasin were considered in the swat model under hybrid calibration method 3 3 hybrid calibration and uncertainty analysis the calibrated parameters based on streamflow and aet values are listed in table 3 according to the results streamflow such as trnsrch and cn2 evapotranspiration such as sol awc and esco snowmelt such as smfmn and smfmx and groundwater flow parameters such as rchrg dp and gw revap ahmadi et al 2012 2015 are sensitive to hybrid calibration method the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp and soil available water storage capacity sol awc were the most sensitive parameters during the hybrid calibration since the land use in the central part of the neishaboor watershed is predominantly agricultural intense groundwater pumping occurs for irrigation practices because of this irrigation return flow is crucial to groundwater recharge in this part of the watershed moreover the capacity of soil for water storage is high in this part of the watershed due to intensive irrigation activities the fact that these two parameters are the most sensitive reveals how critical groundwater recharge and soil water capacity are to accurately partitioning soil water among soil storage evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge immerzeel and droogers 2008 is reported that the sol awc as one of the most effective parameters in swat calibration based on evapotranspiration values so that it s addition to the set of parameters improved the calibration coefficient from 0 4 to 0 49 the results of table 3 also shows that soil evaporation compensation factor esco had important role on evapotranspiration prediction which is well reported in the literature li et al 2010 parajuli et al 2018 shah et al 2021 esco is a parameter which determines the role of surface and deep layers in providing the moisture required for the evaporation process the higher this parameter the more prominent the role of surface layers in providing that moisture evaporation from soil surface is a function of thickness of the evaporation layer and the energy required to perform the evaporation process due to the low groundwater level in the study area the thickness of evaporation layer in this area is not large enough to provide water from underlying layers for the evaporation process the epco parameter controls the evapotranspiration process via plant uptake and higher epco values indicate that the deeper layers play a larger role in this upward flow of water depth of the root system plant demand for transpiration and water content of the soil are among the most important factors determining epco since the selected subbasins in calibration phase are selected from mostly irrigated agricultural lands the main source of water supply during april to september months with high evapotranspiration is irrigation water which is primarily stored in surface layers of the soil and therefore these layers play an important role in providing water for plant uptake it should be noted that in the swat model the default value for this coefficient is 1 i e maximum contribution of underlying layers to plant uptake however it was adjusted in the present study according to the conditions of the study area 0 63 epco 0 72 wu and johnston 2007 reported epco as an effective parameter and resulted in values of 0 7 in their arid climate area which is similar to the range obtained in table 2 0 7 to 0 74 canmx is the maximum amount of water that can be trapped in the canopy which forms one of the terms for aet calculation in swat and thus canopy can play a significant role in transpiration infiltration or surface runoff the impact of canopy on these processes is of course a function of vegetation density and plant species morphology considering the importance of rainfall the role of this parameter in evapotranspiration process can be justified total available water which can be used in the transpiration process is a function of volumetric moisture at field capacity and permanent wilting point which can be calculated using bulk density represented as sol bd in the swat model taw θfc θpwp bd soil temperature is also one of the main parameters influencing plant growth and physical chemical and biological activities in the soil which directly affects the calculation of damping depth and indirectly affects the evapotranspiration process in the swat model soil temperature is calculated in swat in the form of a time series concept and using sol bd due to the seasonality of the rivers in the region most of the losses occurs through stream bed infiltration therefore runoff is controlled by the reach transmission loss which helps to partition the soil water to evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge accurately swat calculates the amount of water moving from one layer to the underlying layer using storage routing methodology which is a function of drainable volume and travel time for percolation the latter of which is obtained based on saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k therefore having a high value for the sol k parameter will affect percolation and consequently the parallel flows feeding the streamflow network and otherwise this parameter will affect the evapotranspiration process by retaining water in the surface layers one way of calculating runoff in swat is to use the scs method which is based on infiltration curve number the curve number itself is a function of land use and hydrological soil group the values of which are provided on the basis of nrcs classification curve number is ultimately adjusted in the swat model based on soil moisture content where the use of cn 2 means average moisture condition of soil thus the role of this parameter in formation of surface runoff and streamflow feeding or its role in plant covered agricultural lands the role of vegetation in increasing moisture retention and transfer of the surface runoff formed to soil surface layers in the evapotranspiration process can be analyzed snow parameters were also among sensitive parameters the reason for the sensitivities of the snow parameters is that eastern part of the neishaboor watershed is mountainous and snowmelt controls baseflow of this part the effective hydraulic conductivity ch k2 and manning s n value ov n are effective parameters in infiltration process from the streambed which control the loss of water through the streambed although about 20 parameters have been introduced as effective parameters in calibration and sensitivity analysis of the swat model the first approximately 10 parameters have had the largest role in determining the hydrological behavior of the basin with their behavior partially analyzed above the point should be emphasized here is that determination of the precise effects of the specific variables on main hydrological components runoff evapotranspiration and deep percolation seems to be complex in the hydrological models especially in the watershed scale because of the interaction of the model parameters however using aet against streamflow data in the form of hybrid calibration method helps to consider these interactions more accurately model uncertainty indices related to aet prediction including p factor and r factor are listed in table 4 in three subbasins according to results of table 4 almost same values of p factor is obtained for the calibration and validation phases p factor value for subbasin no 9 is slightly higher than three other subbasins which caused a higher value of r factor in the mentioned subbasin comparing the results of r factor showed that in all four subbasins aet prediction uncertainty is decreased from calibration to validation phase with the lowest and highest percent equal to 5 3 subbasin no 14 and 19 subbasin no 20 another point is that the range of r factor variation in validation phase 0 19 is less than the calibration phase 0 27 uncertainties about aet can be discussed in two different parts the first one is particularly related to the aet itself given the aim of this work and the higher level of aet in irrigated farmlands the authors tried to choose subbasins used for cropping and particularly irrigated ones for modeling therefore the area in each subbasin which belongs to the agricultural landuse controls the results precision another source of uncertainties is referred to the irrigation scheduling in each subbasin the more accuracy of the estimation of amount and time of irrigation in each subbasin the more reliable aet prediction apart from the aet prediction by itself the uncertainties related to prediction of runoff and other terms of water balance equation in each subbasin is efficacious on aet prediction a statistical comparison between two types of the swat calibration methods used for estimating aet values is presented in table 5 based on the recommended threshold values of 0 4 and 0 5 for ns and r2 respectively by green and griensven 2008 or value of 0 5 for ns by moriasi et al 2007 the results of mentioned indices are reasonable for both calibration and validation periods according to table 5 the values of r2 ranged between 0 77 and 0 93 whereas the same values were resulted approximately 0 4 to 0 81 by immerzeel and droogers 2008 for swat calibration based on aet values according to the results of table 5 the hybrid calibration method outperformed in comparison with calibration method only based on streamflow for estimating aet so that the rmse in the calibration phase and for subbasins no 14 no 20 and 25 is decreased about 41 24 and 33 respectively in the validation period for subbasins no 14 9 20 and 25 the corresponding values were obtained about 58 36 40 and 47 respectively capability of remotely sensed hydrological information including daily et estimates cmirset and soil moisture values amsr e to calibrate a simplified australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l for estimating streamflow in 11 catchments eastern australia was discussed by kunnath poovakka et al 2016 their results revealed that applying rs derived et product can improve streamflow estimation especially in catchment with low average runoff values to address how remotely sensed et data can influence the water balance component rajib et al 2018 used four different configuration of swat calibration including m1 only streamflow data m2 m1 and biophysical parameters m3 lumped et values and m4 spatial et values in a large watershed in the united states the results indicated an improvement in the model accuracy based on m2 in comparison with m1 a distinct improvement for estimating et values and a decrement in water yield estimation uncertainty is also reported by replacing m3 by m4 kge values for the m1 m2 m3 and m4 configurations in model verification period 2009 2013 is obtained 0 5 0 63 0 7 and 0 75 respectively parajuli et al 2018 evaluated different type of the swat calibration methods for estimating aet in mississippi and reported the values of 0 56 and 0 34 for r2 and ns respectively at calibration and 0 5 and 0 38 at validation phase swat model calibrated based on streamflow the corresponding values for the swat model which is calibrated based on both streamflow and aet values were obtained 0 68 and 0 5 at calibration and 0 72 and 0 6 at validation using small scale and diverse cropping patterns becker et al 2019 proposed a modified remote sensing rs derived aet data for improving aet simulation rmse 26 7 compared to unmodified data rmse 32 7 examining the results of two schemes scheme 1 swat calibration based on streamflow data and scheme 2 swat calibration based on both streamflow and rs based aet data for estimating monthly aet values at the subbasin level showed a slightly better performance of scheme 2 shah et al 2021 in scheme 1 r2 and ns values ranged between 0 72 0 86 and 0 29 0 65 respectively whereas the corresponding values in the scheme 2 were obtained between 0 74 0 86 and 0 33 0 7 time series of sebal based aet values predicted values by swat hybrid method and 95 ppu in four selected subbasins for both calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 7 and 8 which indicate proper results of the swat performance fig 9 also depicts sebal based aet versus predicted values by the swat model through hybrid calibration method fig 10 illustrates the difference between aet values predicted by sebal algorithm and swat model over various aet intervals in 4 subbasins numbers 14 9 20 and 25 according to the results the majority of the points are concentrated within a 0 40 mm interval in general however with increasing the aet values differences between sebal based and swat aet values are increased although the mentioned trend is more evidence in the calibration set compared to the validation set in calibration set absolute value of the largest differences between aet values predicted by sebal and those by swat in the four aforementioned subbasins are approximately 36 mm subbasin 14 sep 2005 60 80 mm interval of aet values 32 mm subbasin 9 aug 2008 60 80 mm interval of aet values and 24 mm subbasin 20 july 2006 60 80 mm interval of aet values and 27 mm subbasin 25 aug 2004 60 80 mm interval of aet values respectively in validation set corresponding values are respectively about 20 mm subbasin 14 sep 2007 40 60 mm interval of aet values 31 mm subbasin 9 march 2008 20 40 mm interval of aet values 22 mm subbasin 20 march 2008 20 40 mm interval of aet values and 27 mm subbasin 25 aug 2008 60 80 mm interval of aet values parajuli et al 2018 employed flow and modis based aet data for better hydrological simulation of big sunflower river watershed mississippi using swat model in contrast to our results their findings indicated a general over prediction tendency by swat 16 5 over prediction 3 4 hybrid method performance in selected intervals in order to more accurate analysis of the swat model results its performance was examined at various intervals of measured aet values fig 11 based on data distribution in fig 9 swat performance in predicting aet values in subbasins 14 and 20 was analyzed at three intervals of measured aet values including lower than 20 mm 20 50 mm and higher than 50 mm for subbains 9 and 25 the first and second intervals were changed to lower than 10 mm and 10 50 mm respectively based on the results depicted in fig 11 and at calibration phase of hybrid method higher intervals of measured aet were accompanied by increased prediction errors in all four subbasins with the highest errors occurred in the third interval higher than 50 mm incidentally the lowest number of data points measured aet values in the four subbasins is also observed in this interval the minimum and maximum aet prediction errors at this phase calibration were approximately 3 13 and 20 74 mm month 1 respectively both in subbasin 9 in subbasin 14 prediction error increased from the first 20 mm to the second 20 50 mm interval and from the second to the third 50 mm interval by about 48 and 136 respectively whereas the corresponding values were respectively about 215 and 110 for subbasin 9 154 and 20 for subbasin 20 and 89 and 140 6 for subbasin 25 in contrast to the calibration set the highest prediction error in subbasins 14 and 9 at validation phase was observed at the second interval 20 50 mm for subbasin 14 and 10 50 mm for subbasin 9 in subbasin 20 the highest error occurred at the third interval rmse 9 71 although it was barely different from the error rate at the second interval rmse 9 57 in subbasin 25 compared to the first rmse 4 99 and second interval rmse 5 86 the highest error also occurred at the third interval rmse 13 86 the results also show that the most uniform performance of the swat model in predicting aet values in the four subbasins between calibration and validation phases has occurred at the second interval of subbasin 9 with the lowest rmse decrement equal to approximately 2 4 similar to calibration set for subbasins 14 20 and 25 there was only subbasin 25 an inverse relationship between the number of measured data points in each interval and the error rate occurring in that same interval at swat validation phase at this phase validation the minimum and maximum aet prediction errors were 2 39 and 13 86 mm month 1 in subbasins 9 and 25 and at the first and the last intervals of measured aet values respectively fig 11 4 conclusion accurate knowledge of hydrological components is essential for sustainable water development with reasonable calibration swat model is capable to simulate hydrological responses in the watershed scale literature review shows that streamflow data is widely used for calibration however it may not represent properly the hydrological processes in the watershed hence using aet data which has reasonable spatial watershed area and temporal various stages of plant growth distribution along with the streamflow data lead to improve the swat performance in the present study monthly sebal based aet values 2001 2010 were used to re calibrate a calibrated swat model based on streamflow data with varying the statistical indices of three selected subbasins in the range of ns 0 7 0 88 r2 0 77 0 93 rmse 7 89 9 96 at calibration and ns 0 86 0 93 r2 0 86 0 94 rmse 6 79 7 91 at validation phases the performance of the swat model under proposed hybrid calibration was evaluated quite satisfactory in aet estimation in comparison to the sebal based aet a general under prediction behavior was proved by the swat model under the proposed method highest error rate of the swat was obtained in the range of measured aet values which were higher than 50 mm month 1 for both calibration average rmse 17 18 and validation average rmse 9 44 periods respectively the proposed hybrid calibration method although requires different types of reliable data could be applied for implementing management practices and other water related decision

2728,the large amount of residual soil ammonium nitrogen nh4 n after in situ leaching is a legacy environmental issue for ionic rare earth mines understanding and mitigating the associated risk to the aquatic ecosystems of the mining as well as its downstream areas would benefit from a quantitative description and prediction of nh4 n transformation and transport during and after in situ leaching up to date studies related to the transport and leaching characteristics of residual soil nh4 n have been mostly limited to laboratory experiments few field process based studies of the transport behaviors of residual leaching agents in rare earth mines have been conducted partially because of their remote locations restricted accessibility and scarce background data based on field investigations at a remote hilly rare earth mine in ganzhou city southern china we established a hydrus 2d model to simulate the transport and transformation of soil nh4 n in the mine throughout in situ leaching flushing and subsequent rainwater leaching though subjected to conceptual generalization and limited background data the established hydrus 2d model was able to satisfactorily simulate the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n profiles at the top middle and bottom of the hill in march 2021 with r2 ranging from 0 71 to 0 89 for soil nh4 n and 0 69 to 0 86 for soil no3 n further analysis of the hydrus simulation results revealed a much different spatiotemporal distribution pattern between soil nh4 n and no3 n throughout the simulation period for soil nh4 n the shape and spatial extent of its distribution was largely determined by in situ leaching whereas flushing and rainwater leaching slowly pushed its spatial extent further downward and to a less extent downslope to the right flushing and five years of rainwater leaching could merely remove around 10 of residual soil nh4 n from the hill unlike nh4 n the spatial distribution pattern of soil no3 n varied considerably among various phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching soil water movement affected the spatial distribution of soil no3 n considerably which was especially evident from its significant buildup near surface at the bottom of the hill overall our study results have revealed the critical role of continuous water movement and solute transport in shaping the distribution patterns of residual leaching agents in rare earth mining regions the proposed hydrus model may serve as a promising framework for investigating the transport and spatiotemporal distribution of in situ leaching agent in rare earth mining regions with scarce background data it also has great potentials in facilitating the development of more effective in situ leaching programs and the design of suitable water pollution control and ecological remediation measures keywords rare earth mine residual leaching agent numerical simulation spatiotemporal distribution hydrus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction regarded as strategic resources worldwide medium and heavy rare earth elements rees have

rare earth resources are distributed in seven southern provinces jiangxi fujian guangdong yunnan hunan guangxi and zhejiang of china in the regions rees are mostly found in the weathered crust elution deposited ores also known as ion adsorption rare earth ores where they are adsorbed to clay minerals weathered from mother rocks in the form of hydrated ions or hydroxyl hydrated ions and can be recovered through ion interaction with electrolyte solution jha et al 2016 luo et al 2022 currently in situ leaching via ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 has become one widely employed method for mining ion

average ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of the 28 monitoring sites during the low medium and high flow period was respectively 6 02 6 07 and 6 28 mg l far surpassing the category v the worst water quality category limit of 2 mg l specified in china s surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 meanwhile maximum nh4 n concentration of the two rivers reached a high value of 28 20 mg l highlighting the serious environmental aftermath caused by in situ leaching in rare earth mining regions shi et al 2020 in view of the serious environmental pollution caused by in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 much research has been devoted to identifying alternative leaching agents for extracting rees barnett et al 2018 lai et al 2018a moldoveanu and papangelakis 2021 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 as well as effective leaching agents to remove residual nh4 n from ore bodies huang et al 2022 huang et al 2021a so far many indoor column leaching tests have been conducted to investigate the mineral properties of ionic rare earth ores jin et al 2021 wang et al 2020 as well as their leaching characteristics and mechanisms under the application of different types of leaching agents hu et al 2017 qiao et al 2020 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 however besides leaching agent types the effectiveness of leaching process could be affected by a variety of factors such as leaching agent injection characteristics in terms of its injection concentration rate and duration hydro climatic and geological conditions of the ore body and various mass transfer processes chen et al 2020a luo et al 2022 unable to fully reflect the complexity of field conditions indoor soil column studies may provide some support but far from sufficing the need to guide the real world ree mining and ensuing ecological remediation practices up to date there have been few field studies investigating the transport behaviors and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of residual leaching agents in rare earth mines zhang et al 2020 their remote locations restricted accessibility scarce background data and limited historical records and field observations all posed great challenges to conduct studies of the kind in rare earth mines a few recent studies have investigated the spatial distribution of residual nh4 n in rare earth tailings based on analyzing soil samples of various depth along several drilled soil cores thereby could only present several isolated snapshots of its vertical content distribution at the time of drilling in addition these studies have attributed the observed vertical nh4 n content distribution mostly to static environmental factors such as soil particle size distribution clay mineral types and soil ph while neglecting the critical role of continuous pore water movement and solute transport fan et al 2021 huang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 furthermore besides excessive amount of residual nh4 n nitrate pollution is another serious environmental concern in rare earth mining regions zhang et al 2022 for example found that nitrate concentration of 35 of their collected surface water samples and 53 3 of groundwater samples exceeded the world health organization who standard of 50 mg l in the surveyed rare earth mining watershed at longnan county in southern jiangxi province they estimated that about 70 of nitrate originated from mine drainage and soil nitrogen in the rare earth mining area zhang et al 2022 to the best knowledge of the authors however no study has been conducted to investigate the production transformation and migration of nitrate nor its spatiotemporal distribution in rare earth mines after in situ leaching developed by the u s salinity laboratory the hydrus model solves water movement and solute transport equations in one two and three dimensional variably saturated system with varying degrees of complexity based on the finite element method simunek et al 2018 simunek et al 2008 covering a variety of linear nonlinear and equilibrium non equilibrium reaction processes among solid liquid and gaseous phases hydrus has been used to simulate the movement of water fields et al 2020 as well as the transport of salt kanzari et al 2018 szymkiewicz et al 2018 heavy metal aghili et al 2018 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 nitrogen compounds matteau et al 2019 nuclides nguyen et al 2021 herbicides de oliveira et al 2019 bacteria ning et al 2019 and many other substances barrios et al 2021 li et al 2021 lim et al 2020 across porous media however because solving richards equation to simulate water movement requires relatively fine spatial discretization especially in the presence of large pressure head gradients field scale hydrus applications under variable hydro climatic conditions often lead to a sharp increase in the number of finite elements which may overwhelm computing capabilities simunek et al 2016 therefore previous hydrus studies have mostly focused on simulating water movement and solute transport across short laboratory soil columns balkhair 2017 stein et al 2021 or soil profiles of a few meters deep chen et al 2020b sakaguchi et al 2019 whereas much fewer studies applied it to the field scale of dozens or hundreds of meters lai et al 2020 lai et al 2018b in view of the aforementioned research gaps this study established a field scale hydrus 2d model to simulate the transformation and transport of soil nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n across a hill in a remote rare earth mine which underwent in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 in 2016 hydrus simulation results were used to analyze the transport mechanisms and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n content within the hill throughout the phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching knowledge of which are vital not only to the design of more scientific in situ leaching practice but also to the development of effective water pollution control and ecological remediation programs after mine closure 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description located at the southern tip of jiangxi province dingnan county 24 35 n 25 05 n 114 40 e 115 25 e is one critical region for mining ion adsorption rare earth in china at its lingbei town alone there are more than thirty ion adsorption rare earth mines pool leaching had been the most widely adopted method for extracting rare earth elements in the region before 2001 whereas in situ leaching was increasingly used afterwards and has currently become the dominant rare earth mining technology at the muzishan mine of dingnan county a typical hill rich in rare earth elements which went through in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 was chosen for field survey monitoring and in situ leaching agent transport modeling fig 1 in 2016 nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body to leach out rare earth elements for around four months before the entire muzishan mine was shut down by local government at the end of the year due to environmental concerns however monitoring results showed that a large amount of residual nh4 n had kept migrating from the mine to ambient water environment since its closure causing serious water quality deterioration and ecological hazard in the region located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone cfa under köppen classification dingnan county has a generally mild climate characterized with four distinct seasons prevailing winter and summer monsoons abundant heat and plentiful rainfall that is mostly concentrated in spring and summer historical weather observations at the dingnan county weather station between 2016 and 2021 for example showed that annual average precipitation amounted to 1 553 mm during the six year period 74 6 of which was concentrated in spring and summer meanwhile annual average temperature during the period was 21 4 c with monthly average temperature peaked at 29 5 c in july and bottomed at 11 8 c in january fig 1 2 2 soil core drilling in march 2021 three soil cores were obtained through mechanical drilling at the top middle and base of the hill respectively the upper two soil cores were drilled till bedrock whereas the lowest one was drilled until it was too wet to drill further from top to bottom of the hill the three drilled soil cores respectively measured 37 5 m 38 4 m and 25 2 m in length fig 1 examination of the drilled soil cores revealed that soils of the hill could be characterized as fully or semi weathered medium grained porphyritic biotite granite with a loose sandy soil structure at the three drilling sites from top to bottom of the hill the fully weathered soil layer respectively spanned 17 4 m 11 2 m and 10 9 m in thickness compared to 18 6 m 26 4 m and 14 3 m of the semi weathered layer the fully weathered layer was composed of clay minerals quartz and parent rock residues which accounted for about 50 35 and 15 respectively in the semi weathered layer clay mineral content decreased gradually with depth the bedrock displayed a porphyry like structure with phenocryst of potassium feldspar measuring 5 to15 mm in size meanwhile the bedrock matrix mainly consisted of feldspar quartz and a small amount of scale like biotite 2 3 soil nitrogen content analysis soil samples of both fully and semi weathered layers at top middle and bottom of the hill were all obtained from the three drilled soil cores at an interval of around 1 m to measure their soil nh4 n and no3 n content for each soil sample 50 ml of 1 mol l potassium chloride kcl solution was added to 10 g of soil in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle after being shaken at the speed of 180r min for 2 h in a constant temperature water bath shaker at 25 0 2 c the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min after the sample extract was filtered through the 0 22 μm membrane nh4 n and no3 n concentration of the supernatant was measured with the uv spectrometer which was then used to calculate soil nh4 n and no3 n content 2 4 in situ leaching

and modeled within hydrus 2d with an average slope of around 27 the vertical and horizontal distance between the top and bottom of the hill measured 26 7 m and 58 8 m respectively with a diameter of 30 cm and a depth of 1 5 m leaching agent injection holes extended from hilltop to 13 5 m above the bottom at an interval of around 3 m at a distance of about 10 m away from the bottom of the hill one small river which respectively measured 2 m and 0 5 m in width and depth flowed through the model border was extended further to the right by 50 m from the right bank of the river to minimize the potential influence of model boundary conditions on the simulation of water movement and solute transport within the hill fig 2 2 model layers and boundary conditions the hill was divided into three zones in the hydrus 2d model which respectively represented the top middle and bottom of the hill within each zone three vertical layers were then delineated based on soil core drilling results including two fully weathered soil layers respectively with nitrification and denitrification and one semi weathered soil layer with denitrification in addition two more vertical layers were delineated adjacent to the hill respectively representing unconfined aquifer layers with nitrification and denitrification in total 11 model layers were delineated and they were numbered sequentially from higher i e ground surface to lower elevation i e deep soil and from left i e hilltop to right i e unconfined aquifer fig 2 in simulating water movement the following boundary conditions were defined in the hydrus 2d model both the left boundary at the top of the hill and the bottom boundary along the bedrock were defined as the no flow boundary the upper boundary along the hillslope except the injection holes which were defined as the specified flux boundary was defined as the atmospheric boundary cross section of the river as well as its riparian region adjacent to the lowest injection hole was defined as the seepage face boundary the right boundary was defined as the specified head boundary with a pressure head of 1 m and the bottom boundary below the river and riparian region was defined as the deep drainage boundary fig 2 in the simulation of solute transport the previously defined specified flux seepage face and specified head boundaries were defined as the third type solute boundary whereas the others as no flux boundary the hydrus 2d model was used to simulate the transformation and transport of both nh4 n and no3 n across the hill throughout in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching over six years from 2016 to 2021 in the simulation of in situ leaching in 2016 1 2 nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body through injection holes at a rate of 0 5 m d for 120 days followed by water injection through injection holes at a rate of 0 5 m d for another 120 days to simulate flushing in simulating the subsequent rainwater leaching local daily precipitation observations were used as inputs to the atmospheric boundary condition to simulate the transformation and transport of residual nh4 n and no3 n under natural hydro climatic conditions between january 2017 and december 2021 in view of their rapid change in soil moisture and solute concentration especially during in situ leaching the mesh element size was defined as 10 cm for the upmost layers of both the hill and its adjacent unconfined aquifer whereas 30 cm for the remaining layers in total 34 097 nodes and 66 848 2d elements were defined in the hydrus 2d model 3 model parameter calibration to obtain the initial water movement and solute transport parameter values of the hydrus 2d model we respectively conducted indoor soil column experiments on tracer kcl movement in situ nh4 2so4 leaching and rainwater leaching using soils collected from the study region detailed descriptions of the indoor soil column experiments were included in the supplementary file a series of hydrus 1d models were then established to simulate tracer movement as well as the transport of nh4 n during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching the inverse solution module of hydrus was used to derive the optimal estimates of key parameters based on the measured changes in the concentrations of tracer and nh4 n at the observation points along the soil column the soil column experiments and hydrus simulation results concluded an optimal estimate of 0 5 cm for dispersivity d and a large difference in distribution coefficient kd between in situ leaching 0 07 cm3 g and rainwater leaching 1 21 cm3 g table 1 gao 2022 for dispersivity our lab estimate was in the same order of magnitude as that derived by hou et al 2018 0 16 cm 1 50 cm shaygan et al 2018 1 cm and pan et al 2021 0 50 cm for ammonium adsorption previous hydrus studies have mostly focused on nitrogen pollution due to fertilizer use landfill leakage and on site wastewater treatment these studies have reported a relatively wide range of kd values for nh4 such as 1 0 1 8 cm3 g in a rice field experiment in eastern china li et al 2015 1 cm3 g at an experimental soil plot with urea application in eastern china li et al 2017 0 78 cm3 g in a column experiment with sandy soil taken from a pilot wastewater land treatment plant in tunisia jellali et al 2010 and 3 9 cm3 g in a field experiment of subsurface drainage in huaibei plain china tao et al 2021 while our lab estimate of kd value during rainwater leaching fell in the range of the above reported kd values our estimate of kd during in situ leaching was considerably lower during in situ leaching high concentration of nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body at a fast rate which inevitably led to the rapid outflow of a large amount of nh4 due to its lack of sufficient contact with soil matrix consequently this caused a much smaller ratio between absorbed and liquid nh4 concentration i e the kd value during in situ leaching than the other circumstances with much lower amount of nh4 inflow in addition potential soil nitrification rate of eleven soil samples collected from the hill under study were determined through indoor incubation experiments at a constant temperature of 25 detailed descriptions of the indoor incubation experiments were included in the supplementary file the average potential soil nitrification rate was determined to be 0 0026 d 1 with a standard deviation of 0 0034 d 1 table 1 gao 2022 so far few studies have reported soil nitrification rates in rare earth mining areas compared to our estimate previous studies have mostly reported higher soil nitrification rates for farmland such as a range of 0 03 0 11 d 1 at an experimental paddy field in hubei province china tan et al 2015 and a range of 0 002 0 080 d 1 at a farmland in southern china tao et al 2021 soil nitrification can be influenced by a variety of factors such as climate soil properties and microbial activity low soil ph high soil acidity and lack of microbial activity in rare earth mining areas could inhibit soil nitrification and thereby leading to a lower soil nitrification rate as observed in our indoor experiment li et al 2020 using estimates derived from indoor soil column and soil incubation experiments as initial values we calibrated the key parameters of the hydrus 2d model by trial and error through comparing simulated soil nh4 n and no3 n content in march 2021 with measured values along the three drilled soil cores which included longitudinal and transverse dispersivity d distribution coefficients kd during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching nitrification rates of upmost soil layers and denitrification rates of the other layers simulation performance of the hydrus 2d model at the three drilling sites was evaluated with two commonly used statistics namely root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which were respectively calculated as following 6 r 2 i 1 n y i o y o y i s y s 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i s y s 2 7 rmse i 1 n y i s y i o 2 n where n is the number of the simulated and observed data pairs y i s and y i o denote the ith simulated and observed amount respectively y s and y o are the mean of the simulated and observed data respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of residual leaching agent 3 1 1 soil nh4 n content fig 3 showed the vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content at the top middle and bottom of the hill respectively as seen from the figure in situ leaching had caused a tremendous amount of accumulation of nh4 n throughout the hill maximum soil nh4 n content for example all approached 600 mg kg at the three drilling locations the clustering of exceedingly high residual soil nh4 n content at the depth of several to 10 m from ground surface in the rare earth mining hill was also observed by fan et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020 whose soil core drilling depth both fell short of 16 m however distribution of residual nh4 n in the hill also exhibited considerable spatial variation at hilltop vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content was characterized with the presence of a 16 m wide plateau soil nh4 n content first increased fast and steadily from 5 mg kg near ground surface to the peak of 547 mg kg at the depth of 3 5 m and then kept fluctuating between 385 mg kg and 545 mg kg till reaching the depth of 19 m afterwards it decreaed steeply by 360 mg kg to a low level of 33 mg kg within a short distance of 5 m and stayed below 30 mg kg thereafter at the middle of the hill soil nh4 n content increased quickly from 5 mg kg near surface to the first peak of 495 mg kg at the depth of 3 m followed by a steep drop to 145 mg kg within the next 1 m it then increased continuosly till reaching the second peak of 562 mg kg at 8 m before dropping again rapidly to 106 mg kg at 15 m and stayed below 100 mg kg afterwards unlike the other two drilling sites vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content at the bottom of the hill contained a single sharp peak it increased rapidly from 2 mg kg near surface to the peak of 598 mg kg at the depth of 5 m followed by a sharp decrease of 500 mg kg within the next 1 m after fluctuating between 90 and 210 mg kg for 4 more meters it dropped further to 50 mg kg at 11 m and down to zero at 14 m 3 1 2 soil no3 n content fig 4 compared the vertical distribution of soil no3 n at the top middle and bottom of the hill respectively although previous studies assumed that soil nitrification at the rare earth mining hill may be negligible because high concentrations of nh4 2so4 could cause nitrifying bacteria to perish or stop their metabolic activities zhang et al 2020 our field monitoring results suggested otherwise as shown in fig 4 though soil no3 n content in the hill was much lower than that of nh4 n it surpassed the background level significantly especially at the bottom of the hill suggesting the presence of ongoing nitrification process similar to soil nh4 n distribution of soil no3 n content varied noticeably across the hill at the top of the hill soil no3 n content fluctuated within a low range of 6 30 mg l before reaching the depth of 15 m after which it remained below 5 mg l at the middle soil no3 n content increased rapidly from nearly zero at the ground surface to 43 mg kg at the depth of 3 m but then dived fast to 22 mg kg at 4 m after fluctuating between 10 and 25 mg kg for 3 more meters soil no3 n content dropped further to 5 mg kg and mostly remained at the same low level thereafter at the bottom soil no3 n content experienced a substantial accumulation in the upper soil layer it increased quickly from nearly zero at the surface to 150 mg kg within a short distance of 2 m however after staying above 100 mg kg for 2 m it dropped abruptly to 20 mg kg at the depth of 6 m and mostly stayed at the low level afterwards 3 2 hydrus 2d model parameter calibration 3 2 1 soil particle size distribution and hydraulic parameters soil samples corresponding to different model layers were obtained from three drilled soil cores whose particle size distribution was then determined with the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 3000 and aggregated to calculate their clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm content table 2 compared the average percentages of clay silt and sand content of the 11 delineated model layers as seen from table 2 soil particle size distribution was quite heterogeneous across the hill i e model layer 1 to 9 for example although it mostly accounted for the highest proportion silt content varied considerably from 42 4 to 81 2 within the hill meanwhile sand content of the upmost layers was both below 7 at the top and bottom of the hill whereas it increased dramatically with depth respectively reaching 34 0 and 47 9 in the lowest semi weathered layers in contrast sand content at the middle fluctuated around a high value of 30 across the depth as to clay its content respectively reached the highest 21 5 and lowest 8 9 amount in the upper two layers at the bottom of the hill compared to the hill clay content of the unconfined aquifer layers i e model layer 10 to 11 was much higher in fact clay consistently accounted for the highest proportion in the two aquifer layers the average percentages of sand silt and clay content of the 11 model layers were respectively used to estimate their soil hydraulic parameters using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 results of which were also listed in table 2 3 2 2 solute transport parameters by comparing between simulated and observed soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the three drilling sites during march 2021 four key solute transport parameters of various model layers were calibrated including longitudinal and transverse dispersivity d distribution coefficients kd during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching and soil nitrification denitrification rate table 3 gave the hydrus 2d model parameter calibration results 3 2 3 hydrus 2d model performance assessment fig 3 and fig 4 gave the curves of simulated change in soil nh4 n and no3 n content in march 2021 with depth from surface by the hydrus 2d model at the three drilling sites respectively despite its some under estimation of soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the top and middle of the hill hydrus 2d model was able to reflect well the general pattern of vertical changes in both soil nh4 n and no3 n content at all three drilling sites in simulating soil nh4 n content hydrus 2d model performed the best at hilltop its r2 approached 0 90 at hilltop whereas dropped to 0 71 at the other two sites meanwhile rmse at hilltop was 9 0 and 28 5 lower than that at the middle and bottom of the hill respectively previous studies have largely attributed the observed wide variability in the spatial distribution of soil nh4 n in rare earth mining regions to heterogeneous soil properties and environmental conditions fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the satisfactory simulation performance of the hydrus 2d model however suggested that long term continuous water movement and solute transport in the hill had played a critical role in shaping the overall soil nh4 n distribution patterns the hydurs model s performance in simulating vertical soil no3 n distribution was somewhat different its r2 reached the highest value of 0 85 at the bottom whereas dropped to 0 75 at the middle and further to 0 69 at the top of the hill rmse at the bottom however was twice more than that at the top and middle likely due to the much higher soil no3 n content at the location 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of residual leaching agent in view of its satisfactory performance in simulating the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the three drilling sites in march 2021 simulation results of the hydrus 2d model were used to analyze the transformation and transport of residual in situ leaching agent as well as the spatiotemporal patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n distribution over the six year simulation period 3 3 1 soil nh4 n 1 transport of soil nh4 n within the hill fig 5 showed the spatial distribution of simulated soil nh4 n content after the finishing of in situ leaching and flushing as well as at the end of each year during five year rainwater leaching as seen from the figure in situ leaching caused a tremendous amount of nh4 n accumulation mostly in the fully weathered layers of the hill whose maximum concentration reached as high as 1298 mg kg at the end despite some local variations soil nh4 n content mostly decreased with depth across the hill for example soil nh4 n content exceeding 1000 mg kg was mostly limited to the depth of 0 4 m while the content of 800 1000 mg kg mostly between 4 and 12 m at hilltop and 4 9 m at the middle and bottom in the hilltop zone nh4 n in liquid phase mainly moved in a vertically downward direction driving the front of soil nh4 n distribution to a depth of nearly 19 m in the other two zones the impact of slope on solute transport became much more apparent accordingly nh4 n moved downward as well as downslope to the right causing relatively less accumulation of nh4 n directly below the injection holes but more accumulation downslope fig 5 a flushing caused a significant reduction in soil nh4 n content especially in the upper layer with a depth of 4 m from surface as a result proportion of area with soil nh4 n content exceeding 1000 mg kg decreased by 60 4 whereas proportions of 800 1000 mg kg and 600 800 mg kg respectively increased by 9 0 and 35 8 during flushing meanwhile flushing also drove the distribution of soil nh4 n to move further downward as well as downslope to the right at hilltop for example the front of nh4 n distribution now reached the depth of around 20 m the simulated dominance of downward movement of soil nh4 n during flushing is consistent with zhang et al 2020 which observed nh4 n enrichment reached the depth of 15 5 m at sites with tailing soil washing whereas only 7 5 m at sites without washing in addition a large amount of nh4 n transport downslope led to an obvious accumulation to the right of the lowest injection hole fig 5 b fig 5 h in total about 2 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching was washed out of the hill through flushing in the subsequent five years of rainwater leaching from 2017 to 2021 although its volume became much smaller the long term water inflow drove the slow but continuous transport of nh4 n not only causing the dilution in high soil nh4 n content region but also pushing the front of soil nh4 n distribution downward and to a lesser extent downslope to the right fig 5 c fig 5 g consequently proportion of higher soil nh4 n content in the category of 1000 mg kg and 800 1000 mg kg decreased steadily throughout the rainwater leaching period respectively from 0 4 to zero and 11 1 to 7 9 meanwhile proportion of lower soil nh4 n content in the category of 400 600 mg kg 200 400 mg kg and 1 200 mg kg all steadily increased respectively from 7 5 to 8 5 5 1 to 8 2 and 12 2 to 16 6 furthermore the movement of the front of soil nh4 n distribution caused the proportion of area with little nh4 n i e the category of 0 1 mg kg to decrease from 49 3 to 44 2 fig 5 h in total 8 1 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching was washed out of the hill through rainwater leaching from 2017 to 2021 2 change in soil nh4 n content within three zones in view of the relatively slow soil nh4 n transport due to its adsorption to soil particles fig 6 further examined the changes in residual soil nh4 n content at a 4 m vertical interval within the top middle and bottom zone in the top zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 900 mg kg 700 mg kg and 300 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m 4 12 m and 12 16 m whereas it plunged to 10 mg kg at further depth flushing and subsequent rainwater leaching caused a significant decrease in soil nh4 n content in the upper layers whereas much increase in the deeper layers average soil nh4 n content of 0 4 m and 4 8 m both decreased throughout the simulation period though at different rates at the depth of 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content decreased by 34 0 during flushing and another 39 9 after 5 year rainwater leaching at the depth of 4 8 m however flushing merely caused a slight decrease of 5 mg kg in soil nh4 n content followed by a much larger decrease of 231 mg kg during rainwater leaching between 8 and 12 m average soil nh4 n content experienced both a modest increase during flushing and a modest decrease in rainwater leaching causing little change overall unlike the other upper layers downward movement of soil nh4 n caused its average content at 12 16 m and 16 20 m to increase consistently throughout the simulation period at the end of rainwater leaching in 2021 average soil nh4 n content respectively dropped to 300 mg kg and 600 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m and 4 8 m whereas increased to 700 mg kg and 300 mg kg at the depth of 12 16 m and 16 20 m fig 6 a in the middle zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 800 mg kg and 400 mg kg at the depth of 0 8 m and 8 12 m then decreased rapidly in deeper layers at 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content dropped significantly during both flushing and rainwater leaching respectively by 35 6 and 45 5 at 4 8 m it changed little during flushing but decreased by 25 4 during rainwater leaching at both 8 12 m and 12 16 m it increased consistently throughout the simulation period at the end of 2021 average soil nh4 n content respectively fell to158 mg kg and 635 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m and 4 8 m whereas increased to 741 mg kg and 297 mg kg at 12 16 m and 16 20 m fig 6 b in the bottom zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 700 mg kg and 200 mg kg at the depth of 0 8 m and 8 12 m and fell to nearly zero in the next 4 m at 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content fell by a modest 8 7 during artificial water rinsing and nearly 40 during rainwater leaching at 4 8 m it changed little throughout the simulation period at 8 12 m it increased considerably instead respectively by 23 6 during flushing and 52 2 during rainwater leaching at the end of 2021 average soil nh4 n content fell considerably to 391 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m whereas it increased to a similar level of 401 mg kg at 8 12 m fig 6 c 3 change in proportion of soil nh4 n content of the three zones fig 7 showed the change in the percentage of total soil nh4 n content retained in the hill over time since the end of in situ leaching and the proportion respectively accounted by the top middle and bottom zone at each time period as seen from the figure flushing and five years of rainwater leaching merely removed around 10 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching from the hill on the whole proportion of total soil nh4 n content accounted by the top middle and bottom zone changed little throughout the simulation period for instance residual soil nh4 n content in the top middle and bottom zone respectively accounted for 45 6 27 8 and 26 6 at the end of in situ leaching compared to 46 7 26 5 and 26 8 at the end of rainwater leaching in 2021 fig 8 further compared the change in proportion of total soil nh4 n content at a 4 m vertical interval within the top middle and bottom zone in the top zone flushing and rainwater leaching reduced its residual soil nh4 n content by 8 0 at the end of in situ leaching proportion of total nh4 n content decreased consistently with depth from 33 8 at 0 4 m to 0 3 at 16 20 m flushing and rainwater leaching caused soil nh4 n content of the upmost 0 4 m layer to decrease significantly to the second lowest 9 6 in 2021 soil nh4 n content at 4 8 m also decreased but to a lesser degree from 27 6 to 20 6 meanwhile soil nh4 n content at 8 20 m increased throughout the period at the end of 2021 proportions of the 8 12 m and 12 16 m both increased to the highest amount of 29 whereas 16 20 m increased to 12 fig 8 a in the middle zone total soil nh4 n content fell by 14 2 after flushing and rainwater leaching at the end of in situ leaching proportion of total nh4 n content decreased consistently with depth from both nearly 40 at 0 4 m and 4 8 m to 0 1 at 16 20 m after flushing and rainwater leaching the proportion decreased to 10 at 0 4 m compared to 32 8 at 4 8 m meanwhile proportion of 8 12 m increased significantly from 20 2 to the highest 38 3 while the two deeper layers also experienced various degrees of increase in their proportion fig 8 b in the bottom zone total soil nh4 n content decreased by 9 4 at the end of rainwater leaching similar to the other two zones proportion of total nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching decreased consistently with depth in fact the upper 0 4 m and 4 8 m layers alone could account for 87 2 of total soil nh4 n content after flushing and rainwater leaching proportion of 0 4 m decreased continuously to the second highest amount of 26 6 in 2021 whereas that of 4 8 m increased instead to the highest 46 2 in addition the proportion increased considerably to 24 8 at 8 12 m and slightly to 2 4 at 12 16 m fig 8 c 3 3 2 soil no3 n fig 9 showed the change in the spatial distribution of simulated soil no3 n content after the finishing of in situ leaching and flushing as well as at the end of each year during rainwater leaching during in situ leaching the incessant inflow of large amount of nh4 2so4 led to the generation and accumulation of much nitrate in the upmost layer due to nitrification whose maximum concentration eventually reached 201 mg kg similar to nh4 n soil no3 n content mostly decreased with depth across the hill for example soil no3 n content exceeding 100 mg kg was primarily limited to the depth of 0 5 m in the top zone soil no3 n mostly moved in a vertically downward direction whereas the impact of slope on nitrate transport became much more apparent at the middle and bottom driving its transport both downward and downslope to the right due to the absence of soil particle adsorption soil no3 n could migrate more quickly than nh4 n within the hill during in situ leaching however soil adsorption did not significantly limit the spatial extent of soil nh4 n transport due to its low kd values accordingly the spatial extent of soil no3 n only expanded modestly compared to that of nh4 n at hilltop for instance the front of soil no3 n content in the category of 0 1 mg kg reached a depth of around 20 m compared to 19 m for soil nh4 n fig 9 a the impact of faster transport of soil no3 n than nh4 n became much more apparent during flushing which caused a significant expansion in the spatial extent of soil no3 n as well as a reduction in its content as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg 100 150 mg kg and 60 100 mg kg respectively decreased from 1 1 3 5 8 8 to 0 1 0 4 and 4 4 meanwhile proportion of lower soil no3 n content in the category of 30 60 mg kg 10 30 mg kg and 1 10 mg kg respectively increased from 15 8 10 7 5 8 to 19 2 19 1 and 12 0 in addition the spatial expansion of soil no3 n distribution caused a substantial shrinkage in the proportion of 0 1 mg kg from 54 3 to 44 9 the much slower water inflow from natural raining in 2017 compared to flushing enabled soil no3 n to accumulate more in the upmost layer while migrating downward slowly to deeper areas in the meantime denitrification in deeper regions led to a sizable decrease in its soil no3 n content as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg 100 150 mg kg 60 100 mg kg respectively decreased to 0 0 2 and 1 8 while proportion of 30 60 mg kg and 10 30 mg kg also decreased to 6 2 and 15 5 in addition its slow downward expansion caused a large decrease in the proportion of 0 1 mg kg from 44 9 to 26 4 as a result 1 10 mg kg was the sole category experiencing a significant increase in 2017 from 12 0 to 49 9 the trend of slow soil no3 n accumulation in the upmost layer and reduction in deeper layers continued in 2018 since 2019 however there had been less soil no3 n accumulation in the upmost layer between hilltop and the lowest injection hole probably due to the decreasing soil nh4 n content near the surface over time and consequently less amount of nitrate generated through nitrification meanwhile soil no3 n decreased in both its content and spatial extent in deeper layers due to less incoming nitrate transport from the upmost layer and continuous reduction via denitrification as a result proportion of soil no3 n content in all four categories between 1 and 100 mg kg decreased considerably at the end of 2021 compared to that in 2017 in addition one particularly interesting phenomenon that could be observed was the consistent and significant buildup of soil no3 n in the upper layer below the lowest injection hole this was mainly due to the presence of lateral flow and with it a steady supply of nitrate to the region throughout the rainfall leaching period as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg and 100 150 mg kg respectively bounced back to 1 1 and 0 5 at the end of 2021 3 4 assessment of future change in soil nh4 n distribution to assess the future change in residual soil nh4 n content within the hill under rainwater leaching the established hydrus 2d model was run for ten years from 2022 to 2031 by assuming daily rainfall between 2022 and 2026 as well as between 2027 and 2031 were the same as that between 2017 and 2021 fig 10 showed the spatial distribution of simulated soil nh4 n content at the end of rainwater leaching in 2022 2025 2028 and 2031 as seen from fig 10 the impact of ten years of natural rainfall leaching between 2022 and 2031 mostly lay in pushing the spatial extent of soil nh4 n distribution further downward and to a lesser extent downslope to the right in the top zone for example the depth with the presence of soil nh4 n in the category of 1 200 mg kg was projected to exceed 27 m in 2031 compared to 24 m 25 m and 26 m in 2022 2025 and 2028 meanwhile rain water leaching could reduce the proportions of the two highest soil nh4 n content categories considerably including the elimination of the category of exceeding 1000 mg kg in 2025 and a decrease of the 800 1000 mg kg category from 7 5 in 2022 to 3 4 in 2031 correspondingly proportion of the 600 800 mg kg category was projected to increase from 14 8 in 2022 to 18 0 in 2031 on the whole the ten years of rainwater leaching did not seem to be able to remove much soil nh4 n from the hill it was projected that 85 4 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching would remain in the hill in 2031 compared to 89 1 87 3 and 86 2 in 2022 2025 and 2028 4 conclusion the large amount of residual nh4 n in rare earth mines after in situ leaching has imposed significantly adverse impact on the local environment and ecosystem integrity development of effective environmental remediation programs requires a deep understanding of the transport mechanism as well as the spatiotemporal distribution of residual soil nh4 n and no3 n in rare earth mines however relevant knowledge has so far been very limited consequently determination of the amount and duration of in situ leaching agent application has mostly relied upon previous experience and subjective judgement in view of the gaps we established a hydurs 2d model to simulate the transport and transformation of in situ leaching agent nh4 2so4 within a hill in the remote muzishan rare earth mine under in situ leaching flushing and five years of natural rainwater leaching though built upon a simple conceptual framework with generalization and limited background data and subjected to uncertainty in terms of model structure data availability and parameter calibration the established hydrus 2d model was able to satisfactorily simulate the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the top middle and bottom of the hill in march 2021 simulation results of the hydrus 2d model could help provide much insight into the spatiotemporal patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n distribution across the entire hill and the underlying driving mechanisms as expected soil nh4 n and no3 n exhibited a much different spatiotemporal distribution pattern throughout the simulation period for soil nh4 n the shape and spatial extent of its distribution was largely determined during the stage of in situ leaching thereby affected not only by the hydrogeological properties of the hill but also the characteristics of in situ leaching agent application including its concentration injection rate and duration pushing the spatial extent of soil nh4 n to slowly expand downward and to a less extent downslope to the right the combination of flushing and five years of rainwater leaching was only able to remove around 10 of residual soil nh4 n from the hill this indicates that leaching of residual soil nh4 n into the ambient environment and the associated adverse impacts would remain as a long term environmental concern of the region under natural hydro climatic conditions the impact of flushing and rainwater leaching was more apparent in changing the vertical distribution of soil nh4 n by causing a decrease of its content in the upper layers whereas an increase in deeper layers unlike nh4 n the spatial pattern of soil no3 n distribution differed significantly among the various phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching soil water movement played an important role in shaping its spatial distribution pattern which was especially evident in the significant build up of soil no3 n near surface at the bottom of the hill though no3 n is currently not included in china s surface water quality standards the high possibility of its migration from the bottom of the hill to nearby surface water bodies deserves attention from local authorities overall this study presented a promising modeling framework for investigating the transport and distribution of in situ leaching agent in the rare earth mines with scarce background data and field observations the established hydrus modeling framework may be beneficial to rare earth mining and the subsequent pollution control and ecological remediation in multiple ways for example it may be used to simulate different scenarios of in situ leaching so as to determine the best strategy for improving leaching efficiency and minimizing residual soil nh4 n accumulation similarly it can also be used to assess the potential effectiveness of different strategies in injecting eluents for removing residual nh4 n from the hill in addition capable of generating flux estimates for water as well as various solutes the hydrus model may be coupled with other models to achieve the simulation of pollutant transformation and transport across environmental systems of larger scales in the rare earth mining regions for instance the hydrus model may be coupled with hydrological models to simulate the superimposed impact of soil nh4 n and no3 n leaching from scattered ore bodies on the quality of the ambient water environment and facilitate the development of suitable mining watershed pollution control and ecological remediation programs

2728,the large amount of residual soil ammonium nitrogen nh4 n after in situ leaching is a legacy environmental issue for ionic rare earth mines understanding and mitigating the associated risk to the aquatic ecosystems of the mining as well as its downstream areas would benefit from a quantitative description and prediction of nh4 n transformation and transport during and after in situ leaching up to date studies related to the transport and leaching characteristics of residual soil nh4 n have been mostly limited to laboratory experiments few field process based studies of the transport behaviors of residual leaching agents in rare earth mines have been conducted partially because of their remote locations restricted accessibility and scarce background data based on field investigations at a remote hilly rare earth mine in ganzhou city southern china we established a hydrus 2d model to simulate the transport and transformation of soil nh4 n in the mine throughout in situ leaching flushing and subsequent rainwater leaching though subjected to conceptual generalization and limited background data the established hydrus 2d model was able to satisfactorily simulate the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n profiles at the top middle and bottom of the hill in march 2021 with r2 ranging from 0 71 to 0 89 for soil nh4 n and 0 69 to 0 86 for soil no3 n further analysis of the hydrus simulation results revealed a much different spatiotemporal distribution pattern between soil nh4 n and no3 n throughout the simulation period for soil nh4 n the shape and spatial extent of its distribution was largely determined by in situ leaching whereas flushing and rainwater leaching slowly pushed its spatial extent further downward and to a less extent downslope to the right flushing and five years of rainwater leaching could merely remove around 10 of residual soil nh4 n from the hill unlike nh4 n the spatial distribution pattern of soil no3 n varied considerably among various phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching soil water movement affected the spatial distribution of soil no3 n considerably which was especially evident from its significant buildup near surface at the bottom of the hill overall our study results have revealed the critical role of continuous water movement and solute transport in shaping the distribution patterns of residual leaching agents in rare earth mining regions the proposed hydrus model may serve as a promising framework for investigating the transport and spatiotemporal distribution of in situ leaching agent in rare earth mining regions with scarce background data it also has great potentials in facilitating the development of more effective in situ leaching programs and the design of suitable water pollution control and ecological remediation measures keywords rare earth mine residual leaching agent numerical simulation spatiotemporal distribution hydrus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction regarded as strategic resources worldwide medium and heavy rare earth elements rees have played a pivotal role in various high tech industry such as synthesis of new materials aerospace and national defense edahbi et al 2019 golev et al 2014 more than70 of the world s medium and heavy rare earth resources are distributed in seven southern provinces jiangxi fujian guangdong yunnan hunan guangxi and zhejiang of china in the regions rees are mostly found in the weathered crust elution deposited ores also known as ion adsorption rare earth ores where they are adsorbed to clay minerals weathered from mother rocks in the form of hydrated ions or hydroxyl hydrated ions and can be recovered through ion interaction with electrolyte solution jha et al 2016 luo et al 2022 currently in situ leaching via ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 has become one widely employed method for mining ion adsorption rare earth ores during the process nh4 2so4 solution is vertically injected through injection holes at the top and permeates through the fully and partially weathered layers of the ore body rees then exchange with the more active nh4 cations desorb from soil and enter rare earth mother liquid for subsequent collection and refinement moldoveanu and papangelakis 2013 nie et al 2020 meanwhile a tremendous amount of nh4 cations remains in the tailings which keeps moving with pore water and enters surrounding water bodies even long after mine closure causing serious water pollution and ecological hazard jing et al 2017 for example a recent survey of water quality of two tributaries flowing through the ion adsorption rare earth mining area in southern jiangxi province found that average ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of the 28 monitoring sites during the low medium and high flow period was respectively 6 02 6 07 and 6 28 mg l far surpassing the category v the worst water quality category limit of 2 mg l specified in china s surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 meanwhile maximum nh4 n concentration of the two rivers reached a high value of 28 20 mg l highlighting the serious environmental aftermath caused by in situ leaching in rare earth mining regions shi et al 2020 in view of the serious environmental pollution caused by in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 much research has been devoted to identifying alternative leaching agents for extracting rees barnett et al 2018 lai et al 2018a moldoveanu and papangelakis 2021 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 as well as effective leaching agents to remove residual nh4 n from ore bodies huang et al 2022 huang et al 2021a so far many indoor column leaching tests have been conducted to investigate the mineral properties of ionic rare earth ores jin et al 2021 wang et al 2020 as well as their leaching characteristics and mechanisms under the application of different types of leaching agents hu et al 2017 qiao et al 2020 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 however besides leaching agent types the effectiveness of leaching process could be affected by a variety of factors such as leaching agent injection characteristics in terms of its injection concentration rate and duration hydro climatic and geological conditions of the ore body and various mass transfer processes chen et al 2020a luo et al 2022 unable to fully reflect the complexity of field conditions indoor soil column studies may provide some support but far from sufficing the need to guide the real world ree mining and ensuing ecological remediation practices up to date there have been few field studies investigating the transport behaviors and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of residual leaching agents in rare earth mines zhang et al 2020 their remote locations restricted accessibility scarce background data and limited historical records and field observations all posed great challenges to conduct studies of the kind in rare earth mines a few recent studies have investigated the spatial distribution of residual nh4 n in rare earth tailings based on analyzing soil samples of various depth along several drilled soil cores thereby could only present several isolated snapshots of its vertical content distribution at the time of drilling in addition these studies have attributed the observed vertical nh4 n content distribution mostly to static environmental factors such as soil particle size distribution clay mineral types and soil ph while neglecting the critical role of continuous pore water movement and solute transport fan et al 2021 huang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 furthermore besides excessive amount of residual nh4 n nitrate pollution is another serious environmental concern in rare earth mining regions zhang et al 2022 for example found that nitrate concentration of 35 of their collected surface water samples and 53 3 of groundwater samples exceeded the world health organization who standard of 50 mg l in the surveyed rare earth mining watershed at longnan county in southern jiangxi province they estimated that about 70 of nitrate originated from mine drainage and soil nitrogen in the rare earth mining area zhang et al 2022 to the best knowledge of the authors however no study has been conducted to investigate the production transformation and migration of nitrate nor its spatiotemporal distribution in rare earth mines after in situ leaching developed by the u s salinity laboratory the hydrus model solves water movement and solute transport equations in one two and three dimensional variably saturated system with varying degrees of complexity based on the finite element method simunek et al 2018 simunek et al 2008 covering a variety of linear nonlinear and equilibrium non equilibrium reaction processes among solid liquid and gaseous phases hydrus has been used to simulate the movement of water fields et al 2020 as well as the transport of salt kanzari et al 2018 szymkiewicz et al 2018 heavy metal aghili et al 2018 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 nitrogen compounds matteau et al 2019 nuclides nguyen et al 2021 herbicides de oliveira et al 2019 bacteria ning et al 2019 and many other substances barrios et al 2021 li et al 2021 lim et al 2020 across porous media however because solving richards equation to simulate water movement requires relatively fine spatial discretization especially in the presence of large pressure head gradients field scale hydrus applications under variable hydro climatic conditions often lead to a sharp increase in the number of finite elements which may overwhelm computing capabilities simunek et al 2016 therefore previous hydrus studies have mostly focused on simulating water movement and solute transport across short laboratory soil columns balkhair 2017 stein et al 2021 or soil profiles of a few meters deep chen et al 2020b sakaguchi et al 2019 whereas much fewer studies applied it to the field scale of dozens or hundreds of meters lai et al 2020 lai et al 2018b in view of the aforementioned research gaps this study established a field scale hydrus 2d model to simulate the transformation and transport of soil nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n across a hill in a remote rare earth mine which underwent in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 in 2016 hydrus simulation results were used to analyze the transport mechanisms and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n content within the hill throughout the phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching knowledge of which are vital not only to the design of more scientific in situ leaching practice but also to the development of effective water pollution control and ecological remediation programs after mine closure 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description located at the southern tip of jiangxi province dingnan county 24 35 n 25 05 n 114 40 e 115 25 e is one critical region for mining ion adsorption rare earth in china at its lingbei town alone there are more than thirty ion adsorption rare earth mines pool leaching had been the most widely adopted method for extracting rare earth elements in the region before 2001 whereas in situ leaching was increasingly used afterwards and has currently become the dominant rare earth mining technology at the muzishan mine of dingnan county a typical hill rich in rare earth elements which went through in situ leaching with nh4 2so4 was chosen for field survey monitoring and in situ leaching agent transport modeling fig 1 in 2016 nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body to leach out rare earth elements for around four months before the entire muzishan mine was shut down by local government at the end of the year due to environmental concerns however monitoring results showed that a large amount of residual nh4 n had kept migrating from the mine to ambient water environment since its closure causing serious water quality deterioration and ecological hazard in the region located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone cfa under köppen classification dingnan county has a generally mild climate characterized with four distinct seasons prevailing winter and summer monsoons abundant heat and plentiful rainfall that is mostly concentrated in spring and summer historical weather observations at the dingnan county weather station between 2016 and 2021 for example showed that annual average precipitation amounted to 1 553 mm during the six year period 74 6 of which was concentrated in spring and summer meanwhile annual average temperature during the period was 21 4 c with monthly average temperature peaked at 29 5 c in july and bottomed at 11 8 c in january fig 1 2 2 soil core drilling in march 2021 three soil cores were obtained through mechanical drilling at the top middle and base of the hill respectively the upper two soil cores were drilled till bedrock whereas the lowest one was drilled until it was too wet to drill further from top to bottom of the hill the three drilled soil cores respectively measured 37 5 m 38 4 m and 25 2 m in length fig 1 examination of the drilled soil cores revealed that soils of the hill could be characterized as fully or semi weathered medium grained porphyritic biotite granite with a loose sandy soil structure at the three drilling sites from top to bottom of the hill the fully weathered soil layer respectively spanned 17 4 m 11 2 m and 10 9 m in thickness compared to 18 6 m 26 4 m and 14 3 m of the semi weathered layer the fully weathered layer was composed of clay minerals quartz and parent rock residues which accounted for about 50 35 and 15 respectively in the semi weathered layer clay mineral content decreased gradually with depth the bedrock displayed a porphyry like structure with phenocryst of potassium feldspar measuring 5 to15 mm in size meanwhile the bedrock matrix mainly consisted of feldspar quartz and a small amount of scale like biotite 2 3 soil nitrogen content analysis soil samples of both fully and semi weathered layers at top middle and bottom of the hill were all obtained from the three drilled soil cores at an interval of around 1 m to measure their soil nh4 n and no3 n content for each soil sample 50 ml of 1 mol l potassium chloride kcl solution was added to 10 g of soil in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle after being shaken at the speed of 180r min for 2 h in a constant temperature water bath shaker at 25 0 2 c the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min after the sample extract was filtered through the 0 22 μm membrane nh4 n and no3 n concentration of the supernatant was measured with the uv spectrometer which was then used to calculate soil nh4 n and no3 n content 2 4 in situ leaching

30 cm and a depth of 1 5 m leaching agent injection holes extended from hilltop to 13 5 m above the bottom at an interval of around 3 m at a distance of about 10 m away from the bottom of the hill one small river which respectively measured 2 m and 0 5 m in width and depth flowed through the model border was extended further to the right by 50 m from the right bank of the river to minimize the potential influence of model boundary conditions on the simulation of water movement and solute transport within the hill fig 2 2 model layers and boundary conditions the hill was divided into three zones in the hydrus 2d model which respectively represented the top middle and bottom of the hill within each zone three vertical layers were then delineated based on soil core drilling results including two fully weathered soil layers respectively with nitrification and denitrification and one semi weathered soil layer with denitrification in addition two more vertical layers were delineated adjacent to the hill respectively representing unconfined aquifer layers with nitrification and denitrification in total 11 model layers were delineated and they were numbered sequentially from higher i e ground surface to lower elevation i e deep soil and from left i e hilltop to right i e unconfined aquifer fig 2 in simulating water movement the following boundary conditions were defined in the hydrus 2d model both the left boundary at the top of the hill and the bottom boundary along the bedrock were defined as the no flow boundary the upper boundary along the hillslope except the injection holes which were defined as the specified flux boundary was defined as the atmospheric boundary cross section of the river as well as its riparian region adjacent to the lowest injection hole was defined as the seepage face boundary the right boundary was defined as the specified head boundary with a pressure head of 1 m and the bottom boundary below the river and riparian region was defined as the deep drainage boundary fig 2 in the simulation of solute transport the previously defined specified flux seepage face and specified head boundaries were defined as the third type solute boundary whereas the others as no flux boundary the hydrus 2d model was used to simulate the transformation and transport of both nh4 n and no3 n across the hill throughout in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching over six years from 2016 to 2021 in the simulation of in situ leaching in 2016 1 2 nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body through injection holes at a rate of 0 5 m d for 120 days followed by water injection through injection holes at a rate of 0 5 m d for another 120 days to simulate flushing in simulating the subsequent rainwater leaching local daily precipitation observations were used as inputs to the atmospheric boundary condition to simulate the transformation and transport of residual nh4 n and no3 n under natural hydro climatic conditions between january 2017 and december 2021 in view of their rapid change in soil moisture and solute concentration especially during in situ leaching the mesh element size was defined as 10 cm for the upmost layers of both the hill and its adjacent unconfined aquifer whereas 30 cm for the remaining layers in total 34 097 nodes and 66 848 2d elements were defined in the hydrus 2d model 3 model parameter calibration to obtain the initial water movement and solute transport parameter values of the hydrus 2d model we respectively conducted indoor soil column experiments on tracer kcl movement in situ nh4 2so4 leaching and rainwater leaching using soils collected from the study region detailed descriptions of the indoor soil column experiments were included in the supplementary file a series of hydrus 1d models were then established to simulate tracer movement as well as the transport of nh4 n during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching the inverse solution module of hydrus was used to derive the optimal estimates of key parameters based on the measured changes in the concentrations of tracer and nh4 n at the observation points along the soil column the soil column experiments and hydrus simulation results concluded an optimal estimate of 0 5 cm for dispersivity d and a large difference in distribution coefficient kd between in situ leaching 0 07 cm3 g and rainwater leaching 1 21 cm3 g table 1 gao 2022 for dispersivity our lab estimate was in the same order of magnitude as that derived by hou et al 2018 0 16 cm 1 50 cm shaygan et al 2018 1 cm and pan et al 2021 0 50 cm for ammonium adsorption previous hydrus studies have mostly focused on nitrogen pollution due to fertilizer use landfill leakage and on site wastewater treatment these studies have reported a relatively wide range of kd values for nh4 such as 1 0 1 8 cm3 g in a rice field experiment in eastern china li et al 2015 1 cm3 g at an experimental soil plot with urea application in eastern china li et al 2017 0 78 cm3 g in a column experiment with sandy soil taken from a pilot wastewater land treatment plant in tunisia jellali et al 2010 and 3 9 cm3 g in a field experiment of subsurface drainage in huaibei plain china tao et al 2021 while our lab estimate of kd value during rainwater leaching fell in the range of the above reported kd values our estimate of kd during in situ leaching was considerably lower during in situ leaching high concentration of nh4 2so4 was injected into the ore body at a fast rate which inevitably led to the rapid outflow of a large amount of nh4 due to its lack of sufficient contact with soil matrix consequently this caused a much smaller ratio between absorbed and liquid nh4 concentration i e the kd value during in situ leaching than the other circumstances with much lower amount of nh4 inflow in addition potential soil nitrification rate of eleven soil samples collected from the hill under study were determined through indoor incubation experiments at a constant temperature of 25 detailed descriptions of the indoor incubation experiments were included in the supplementary file the average potential soil nitrification rate was determined to be 0 0026 d 1 with a standard deviation of 0 0034 d 1 table 1 gao 2022 so far few studies have reported soil nitrification rates in rare earth mining areas compared to our estimate previous studies have mostly reported higher soil nitrification rates for farmland such as a range of 0 03 0 11 d 1 at an experimental paddy field in hubei province china tan et al 2015 and a range of 0 002 0 080 d 1 at a farmland in southern china tao et al 2021 soil nitrification can be influenced by a variety of factors such as climate soil properties and microbial activity low soil ph high soil acidity and lack of microbial activity in rare earth mining areas could inhibit soil nitrification and thereby leading to a lower soil nitrification rate as observed in our indoor experiment li et al 2020 using estimates derived from indoor soil column and soil incubation experiments as initial values we calibrated the key parameters of the hydrus 2d model by trial and error through comparing simulated soil nh4 n and no3 n content in march 2021 with measured values along the three drilled soil cores which included longitudinal and transverse dispersivity d distribution coefficients kd during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching nitrification rates of upmost soil layers and denitrification rates of the other layers simulation performance of the hydrus 2d model at the three drilling sites was evaluated with two commonly used statistics namely root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which were respectively calculated as following 6 r 2 i 1 n y i o y o y i s y s 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i s y s 2 7 rmse i 1 n y i s y i o 2 n where n is the number of the simulated and observed data pairs y i s and y i o denote the ith simulated and observed amount respectively y s and y o are the mean of the simulated and observed data respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of residual leaching agent 3 1 1 soil nh4 n content fig 3 showed the vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content at the top middle and bottom of the hill respectively as seen from the figure in situ leaching had caused a tremendous amount of accumulation of nh4 n throughout the hill maximum soil nh4 n content for example all approached 600 mg kg at the three drilling locations the clustering of exceedingly high residual soil nh4 n content at the depth of several to 10 m from ground surface in the rare earth mining hill was also observed by fan et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020 whose soil core drilling depth both fell short of 16 m however distribution of residual nh4 n in the hill also exhibited considerable spatial variation at hilltop vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content was characterized with the presence of a 16 m wide plateau soil nh4 n content first increased fast and steadily from 5 mg kg near ground surface to the peak of 547 mg kg at the depth of 3 5 m and then kept fluctuating between 385 mg kg and 545 mg kg till reaching the depth of 19 m afterwards it decreaed steeply by 360 mg kg to a low level of 33 mg kg within a short distance of 5 m and stayed below 30 mg kg thereafter at the middle of the hill soil nh4 n content increased quickly from 5 mg kg near surface to the first peak of 495 mg kg at the depth of 3 m followed by a steep drop to 145 mg kg within the next 1 m it then increased continuosly till reaching the second peak of 562 mg kg at 8 m before dropping again rapidly to 106 mg kg at 15 m and stayed below 100 mg kg afterwards unlike the other two drilling sites vertical distribution of soil nh4 n content at the bottom of the hill contained a single sharp peak it increased rapidly from 2 mg kg near surface to the peak of 598 mg kg at the depth of 5 m followed by a sharp decrease of 500 mg kg within the next 1 m after fluctuating between 90 and 210 mg kg for 4 more meters it dropped further to 50 mg kg at 11 m and down to zero at 14 m 3 1 2 soil no3 n content fig 4 compared the vertical distribution of soil no3 n at the top middle and bottom of the hill respectively although previous studies assumed that soil nitrification at the rare earth mining hill may be negligible because high concentrations of nh4 2so4 could cause nitrifying bacteria to perish or stop their metabolic activities zhang et al 2020 our field monitoring results suggested otherwise as shown in fig 4 though soil no3 n content in the hill was much lower than that of nh4 n it surpassed the background level significantly especially at the bottom of the hill suggesting the presence of ongoing nitrification process similar to soil nh4 n distribution of soil no3 n content varied noticeably across the hill at the top of the hill soil no3 n content fluctuated within a low range of 6 30 mg l before reaching the depth of 15 m after which it remained below 5 mg l at the middle soil no3 n content increased rapidly from nearly zero at the ground surface to 43 mg kg at the depth of 3 m but then dived fast to 22 mg kg at 4 m after fluctuating between 10 and 25 mg kg for 3 more meters soil no3 n content dropped further to 5 mg kg and mostly remained at the same low level thereafter at the bottom soil no3 n content experienced a substantial accumulation in the upper soil layer it increased quickly from nearly zero at the surface to 150 mg kg within a short distance of 2 m however after staying above 100 mg kg for 2 m it dropped abruptly to 20 mg kg at the depth of 6 m and mostly stayed at the low level afterwards 3 2 hydrus 2d model parameter calibration 3 2 1 soil particle size distribution and hydraulic parameters soil samples corresponding to different model layers were obtained from three drilled soil cores whose particle size distribution was then determined with the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 3000 and aggregated to calculate their clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm content table 2 compared the average percentages of clay silt and sand content of the 11 delineated model layers as seen from table 2 soil particle size distribution was quite heterogeneous across the hill i e model layer 1 to 9 for example although it mostly accounted for the highest proportion silt content varied considerably from 42 4 to 81 2 within the hill meanwhile sand content of the upmost layers was both below 7 at the top and bottom of the hill whereas it increased dramatically with depth respectively reaching 34 0 and 47 9 in the lowest semi weathered layers in contrast sand content at the middle fluctuated around a high value of 30 across the depth as to clay its content respectively reached the highest 21 5 and lowest 8 9 amount in the upper two layers at the bottom of the hill compared to the hill clay content of the unconfined aquifer layers i e model layer 10 to 11 was much higher in fact clay consistently accounted for the highest proportion in the two aquifer layers the average percentages of sand silt and clay content of the 11 model layers were respectively used to estimate their soil hydraulic parameters using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 results of which were also listed in table 2 3 2 2 solute transport parameters by comparing between simulated and observed soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the three drilling sites during march 2021 four key solute transport parameters of various model layers were calibrated including longitudinal and transverse dispersivity d distribution coefficients kd during in situ leaching and rainwater leaching and soil nitrification denitrification rate table 3 gave the hydrus 2d model parameter calibration results 3 2 3 hydrus 2d model performance assessment fig 3 and fig 4 gave the curves of simulated change in soil nh4 n and no3 n content in march 2021 with depth from surface by the hydrus 2d model at the three drilling sites respectively despite its some under estimation of soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the top and middle of the hill hydrus 2d model was able to reflect well the general pattern of vertical changes in both soil nh4 n and no3 n content at all three drilling sites in simulating soil nh4 n content hydrus 2d model performed the best at hilltop its r2 approached 0 90 at hilltop whereas dropped to 0 71 at the other two sites meanwhile rmse at hilltop was 9 0 and 28 5 lower than that at the middle and bottom of the hill respectively previous studies have largely attributed the observed wide variability in the spatial distribution of soil nh4 n in rare earth mining regions to heterogeneous soil properties and environmental conditions fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the satisfactory simulation performance of the hydrus 2d model however suggested that long term continuous water movement and solute transport in the hill had played a critical role in shaping the overall soil nh4 n distribution patterns the hydurs model s performance in simulating vertical soil no3 n distribution was somewhat different its r2 reached the highest value of 0 85 at the bottom whereas dropped to 0 75 at the middle and further to 0 69 at the top of the hill rmse at the bottom however was twice more than that at the top and middle likely due to the much higher soil no3 n content at the location 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of residual leaching agent in view of its satisfactory performance in simulating the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the three drilling sites in march 2021 simulation results of the hydrus 2d model were used to analyze the transformation and transport of residual in situ leaching agent as well as the spatiotemporal patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n distribution over the six year simulation period 3 3 1 soil nh4 n 1 transport of soil nh4 n within the hill fig 5 showed the spatial distribution of simulated soil nh4 n content after the finishing of in situ leaching and flushing as well as at the end of each year during five year rainwater leaching as seen from the figure in situ leaching caused a tremendous amount of nh4 n accumulation mostly in the fully weathered layers of the hill whose maximum concentration reached as high as 1298 mg kg at the end despite some local variations soil nh4 n content mostly decreased with depth across the hill for example soil nh4 n content exceeding 1000 mg kg was mostly limited to the depth of 0 4 m while the content of 800 1000 mg kg mostly between 4 and 12 m at hilltop and 4 9 m at the middle and bottom in the hilltop zone nh4 n in liquid phase mainly moved in a vertically downward direction driving the front of soil nh4 n distribution to a depth of nearly 19 m in the other two zones the impact of slope on solute transport became much more apparent accordingly nh4 n moved downward as well as downslope to the right causing relatively less accumulation of nh4 n directly below the injection holes but more accumulation downslope fig 5 a flushing caused a significant reduction in soil nh4 n content especially in the upper layer with a depth of 4 m from surface as a result proportion of area with soil nh4 n content exceeding 1000 mg kg decreased by 60 4 whereas proportions of 800 1000 mg kg and 600 800 mg kg respectively increased by 9 0 and 35 8 during flushing meanwhile flushing also drove the distribution of soil nh4 n to move further downward as well as downslope to the right at hilltop for example the front of nh4 n distribution now reached the depth of around 20 m the simulated dominance of downward movement of soil nh4 n during flushing is consistent with zhang et al 2020 which observed nh4 n enrichment reached the depth of 15 5 m at sites with tailing soil washing whereas only 7 5 m at sites without washing in addition a large amount of nh4 n transport downslope led to an obvious accumulation to the right of the lowest injection hole fig 5 b fig 5 h in total about 2 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching was washed out of the hill through flushing in the subsequent five years of rainwater leaching from 2017 to 2021 although its volume became much smaller the long term water inflow drove the slow but continuous transport of nh4 n not only causing the dilution in high soil nh4 n content region but also pushing the front of soil nh4 n distribution downward and to a lesser extent downslope to the right fig 5 c fig 5 g consequently proportion of higher soil nh4 n content in the category of 1000 mg kg and 800 1000 mg kg decreased steadily throughout the rainwater leaching period respectively from 0 4 to zero and 11 1 to 7 9 meanwhile proportion of lower soil nh4 n content in the category of 400 600 mg kg 200 400 mg kg and 1 200 mg kg all steadily increased respectively from 7 5 to 8 5 5 1 to 8 2 and 12 2 to 16 6 furthermore the movement of the front of soil nh4 n distribution caused the proportion of area with little nh4 n i e the category of 0 1 mg kg to decrease from 49 3 to 44 2 fig 5 h in total 8 1 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching was washed out of the hill through rainwater leaching from 2017 to 2021 2 change in soil nh4 n content within three zones in view of the relatively slow soil nh4 n transport due to its adsorption to soil particles fig 6 further examined the changes in residual soil nh4 n content at a 4 m vertical interval within the top middle and bottom zone in the top zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 900 mg kg 700 mg kg and 300 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m 4 12 m and 12 16 m whereas it plunged to 10 mg kg at further depth flushing and subsequent rainwater leaching caused a significant decrease in soil nh4 n content in the upper layers whereas much increase in the deeper layers average soil nh4 n content of 0 4 m and 4 8 m both decreased throughout the simulation period though at different rates at the depth of 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content decreased by 34 0 during flushing and another 39 9 after 5 year rainwater leaching at the depth of 4 8 m however flushing merely caused a slight decrease of 5 mg kg in soil nh4 n content followed by a much larger decrease of 231 mg kg during rainwater leaching between 8 and 12 m average soil nh4 n content experienced both a modest increase during flushing and a modest decrease in rainwater leaching causing little change overall unlike the other upper layers downward movement of soil nh4 n caused its average content at 12 16 m and 16 20 m to increase consistently throughout the simulation period at the end of rainwater leaching in 2021 average soil nh4 n content respectively dropped to 300 mg kg and 600 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m and 4 8 m whereas increased to 700 mg kg and 300 mg kg at the depth of 12 16 m and 16 20 m fig 6 a in the middle zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 800 mg kg and 400 mg kg at the depth of 0 8 m and 8 12 m then decreased rapidly in deeper layers at 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content dropped significantly during both flushing and rainwater leaching respectively by 35 6 and 45 5 at 4 8 m it changed little during flushing but decreased by 25 4 during rainwater leaching at both 8 12 m and 12 16 m it increased consistently throughout the simulation period at the end of 2021 average soil nh4 n content respectively fell to158 mg kg and 635 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m and 4 8 m whereas increased to 741 mg kg and 297 mg kg at 12 16 m and 16 20 m fig 6 b in the bottom zone average soil nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching respectively exceeded 700 mg kg and 200 mg kg at the depth of 0 8 m and 8 12 m and fell to nearly zero in the next 4 m at 0 4 m average soil nh4 n content fell by a modest 8 7 during artificial water rinsing and nearly 40 during rainwater leaching at 4 8 m it changed little throughout the simulation period at 8 12 m it increased considerably instead respectively by 23 6 during flushing and 52 2 during rainwater leaching at the end of 2021 average soil nh4 n content fell considerably to 391 mg kg at the depth of 0 4 m whereas it increased to a similar level of 401 mg kg at 8 12 m fig 6 c 3 change in proportion of soil nh4 n content of the three zones fig 7 showed the change in the percentage of total soil nh4 n content retained in the hill over time since the end of in situ leaching and the proportion respectively accounted by the top middle and bottom zone at each time period as seen from the figure flushing and five years of rainwater leaching merely removed around 10 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching from the hill on the whole proportion of total soil nh4 n content accounted by the top middle and bottom zone changed little throughout the simulation period for instance residual soil nh4 n content in the top middle and bottom zone respectively accounted for 45 6 27 8 and 26 6 at the end of in situ leaching compared to 46 7 26 5 and 26 8 at the end of rainwater leaching in 2021 fig 8 further compared the change in proportion of total soil nh4 n content at a 4 m vertical interval within the top middle and bottom zone in the top zone flushing and rainwater leaching reduced its residual soil nh4 n content by 8 0 at the end of in situ leaching proportion of total nh4 n content decreased consistently with depth from 33 8 at 0 4 m to 0 3 at 16 20 m flushing and rainwater leaching caused soil nh4 n content of the upmost 0 4 m layer to decrease significantly to the second lowest 9 6 in 2021 soil nh4 n content at 4 8 m also decreased but to a lesser degree from 27 6 to 20 6 meanwhile soil nh4 n content at 8 20 m increased throughout the period at the end of 2021 proportions of the 8 12 m and 12 16 m both increased to the highest amount of 29 whereas 16 20 m increased to 12 fig 8 a in the middle zone total soil nh4 n content fell by 14 2 after flushing and rainwater leaching at the end of in situ leaching proportion of total nh4 n content decreased consistently with depth from both nearly 40 at 0 4 m and 4 8 m to 0 1 at 16 20 m after flushing and rainwater leaching the proportion decreased to 10 at 0 4 m compared to 32 8 at 4 8 m meanwhile proportion of 8 12 m increased significantly from 20 2 to the highest 38 3 while the two deeper layers also experienced various degrees of increase in their proportion fig 8 b in the bottom zone total soil nh4 n content decreased by 9 4 at the end of rainwater leaching similar to the other two zones proportion of total nh4 n content at the end of in situ leaching decreased consistently with depth in fact the upper 0 4 m and 4 8 m layers alone could account for 87 2 of total soil nh4 n content after flushing and rainwater leaching proportion of 0 4 m decreased continuously to the second highest amount of 26 6 in 2021 whereas that of 4 8 m increased instead to the highest 46 2 in addition the proportion increased considerably to 24 8 at 8 12 m and slightly to 2 4 at 12 16 m fig 8 c 3 3 2 soil no3 n fig 9 showed the change in the spatial distribution of simulated soil no3 n content after the finishing of in situ leaching and flushing as well as at the end of each year during rainwater leaching during in situ leaching the incessant inflow of large amount of nh4 2so4 led to the generation and accumulation of much nitrate in the upmost layer due to nitrification whose maximum concentration eventually reached 201 mg kg similar to nh4 n soil no3 n content mostly decreased with depth across the hill for example soil no3 n content exceeding 100 mg kg was primarily limited to the depth of 0 5 m in the top zone soil no3 n mostly moved in a vertically downward direction whereas the impact of slope on nitrate transport became much more apparent at the middle and bottom driving its transport both downward and downslope to the right due to the absence of soil particle adsorption soil no3 n could migrate more quickly than nh4 n within the hill during in situ leaching however soil adsorption did not significantly limit the spatial extent of soil nh4 n transport due to its low kd values accordingly the spatial extent of soil no3 n only expanded modestly compared to that of nh4 n at hilltop for instance the front of soil no3 n content in the category of 0 1 mg kg reached a depth of around 20 m compared to 19 m for soil nh4 n fig 9 a the impact of faster transport of soil no3 n than nh4 n became much more apparent during flushing which caused a significant expansion in the spatial extent of soil no3 n as well as a reduction in its content as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg 100 150 mg kg and 60 100 mg kg respectively decreased from 1 1 3 5 8 8 to 0 1 0 4 and 4 4 meanwhile proportion of lower soil no3 n content in the category of 30 60 mg kg 10 30 mg kg and 1 10 mg kg respectively increased from 15 8 10 7 5 8 to 19 2 19 1 and 12 0 in addition the spatial expansion of soil no3 n distribution caused a substantial shrinkage in the proportion of 0 1 mg kg from 54 3 to 44 9 the much slower water inflow from natural raining in 2017 compared to flushing enabled soil no3 n to accumulate more in the upmost layer while migrating downward slowly to deeper areas in the meantime denitrification in deeper regions led to a sizable decrease in its soil no3 n content as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg 100 150 mg kg 60 100 mg kg respectively decreased to 0 0 2 and 1 8 while proportion of 30 60 mg kg and 10 30 mg kg also decreased to 6 2 and 15 5 in addition its slow downward expansion caused a large decrease in the proportion of 0 1 mg kg from 44 9 to 26 4 as a result 1 10 mg kg was the sole category experiencing a significant increase in 2017 from 12 0 to 49 9 the trend of slow soil no3 n accumulation in the upmost layer and reduction in deeper layers continued in 2018 since 2019 however there had been less soil no3 n accumulation in the upmost layer between hilltop and the lowest injection hole probably due to the decreasing soil nh4 n content near the surface over time and consequently less amount of nitrate generated through nitrification meanwhile soil no3 n decreased in both its content and spatial extent in deeper layers due to less incoming nitrate transport from the upmost layer and continuous reduction via denitrification as a result proportion of soil no3 n content in all four categories between 1 and 100 mg kg decreased considerably at the end of 2021 compared to that in 2017 in addition one particularly interesting phenomenon that could be observed was the consistent and significant buildup of soil no3 n in the upper layer below the lowest injection hole this was mainly due to the presence of lateral flow and with it a steady supply of nitrate to the region throughout the rainfall leaching period as a result proportion of higher soil no3 n content in the category of 150 mg kg and 100 150 mg kg respectively bounced back to 1 1 and 0 5 at the end of 2021 3 4 assessment of future change in soil nh4 n distribution to assess the future change in residual soil nh4 n content within the hill under rainwater leaching the established hydrus 2d model was run for ten years from 2022 to 2031 by assuming daily rainfall between 2022 and 2026 as well as between 2027 and 2031 were the same as that between 2017 and 2021 fig 10 showed the spatial distribution of simulated soil nh4 n content at the end of rainwater leaching in 2022 2025 2028 and 2031 as seen from fig 10 the impact of ten years of natural rainfall leaching between 2022 and 2031 mostly lay in pushing the spatial extent of soil nh4 n distribution further downward and to a lesser extent downslope to the right in the top zone for example the depth with the presence of soil nh4 n in the category of 1 200 mg kg was projected to exceed 27 m in 2031 compared to 24 m 25 m and 26 m in 2022 2025 and 2028 meanwhile rain water leaching could reduce the proportions of the two highest soil nh4 n content categories considerably including the elimination of the category of exceeding 1000 mg kg in 2025 and a decrease of the 800 1000 mg kg category from 7 5 in 2022 to 3 4 in 2031 correspondingly proportion of the 600 800 mg kg category was projected to increase from 14 8 in 2022 to 18 0 in 2031 on the whole the ten years of rainwater leaching did not seem to be able to remove much soil nh4 n from the hill it was projected that 85 4 of soil nh4 n accumulated during in situ leaching would remain in the hill in 2031 compared to 89 1 87 3 and 86 2 in 2022 2025 and 2028 4 conclusion the large amount of residual nh4 n in rare earth mines after in situ leaching has imposed significantly adverse impact on the local environment and ecosystem integrity development of effective environmental remediation programs requires a deep understanding of the transport mechanism as well as the spatiotemporal distribution of residual soil nh4 n and no3 n in rare earth mines however relevant knowledge has so far been very limited consequently determination of the amount and duration of in situ leaching agent application has mostly relied upon previous experience and subjective judgement in view of the gaps we established a hydurs 2d model to simulate the transport and transformation of in situ leaching agent nh4 2so4 within a hill in the remote muzishan rare earth mine under in situ leaching flushing and five years of natural rainwater leaching though built upon a simple conceptual framework with generalization and limited background data and subjected to uncertainty in terms of model structure data availability and parameter calibration the established hydrus 2d model was able to satisfactorily simulate the observed distinctively different vertical soil nh4 n and no3 n content at the top middle and bottom of the hill in march 2021 simulation results of the hydrus 2d model could help provide much insight into the spatiotemporal patterns of soil nh4 n and no3 n distribution across the entire hill and the underlying driving mechanisms as expected soil nh4 n and no3 n exhibited a much different spatiotemporal distribution pattern throughout the simulation period for soil nh4 n the shape and spatial extent of its distribution was largely determined during the stage of in situ leaching thereby affected not only by the hydrogeological properties of the hill but also the characteristics of in situ leaching agent application including its concentration injection rate and duration pushing the spatial extent of soil nh4 n to slowly expand downward and to a less extent downslope to the right the combination of flushing and five years of rainwater leaching was only able to remove around 10 of residual soil nh4 n from the hill this indicates that leaching of residual soil nh4 n into the ambient environment and the associated adverse impacts would remain as a long term environmental concern of the region under natural hydro climatic conditions the impact of flushing and rainwater leaching was more apparent in changing the vertical distribution of soil nh4 n by causing a decrease of its content in the upper layers whereas an increase in deeper layers unlike nh4 n the spatial pattern of soil no3 n distribution differed significantly among the various phases of in situ leaching flushing and rainwater leaching soil water movement played an important role in shaping its spatial distribution pattern which was especially evident in the significant build up of soil no3 n near surface at the bottom of the hill though no3 n is currently not included in china s surface water quality standards the high possibility of its migration from the bottom of the hill to nearby surface water bodies deserves attention from local authorities overall this study presented a promising modeling framework for investigating the transport and distribution of in situ leaching agent in the rare earth mines with scarce background data and field observations the established hydrus modeling framework may be beneficial to rare earth mining and the subsequent pollution control and ecological remediation in multiple ways for example it may be used to simulate different scenarios of in situ leaching so as to determine the best strategy for improving leaching efficiency and minimizing residual soil nh4 n accumulation similarly it can also be used to assess the potential effectiveness of different strategies in injecting eluents for removing residual nh4 n from the hill in addition capable of generating flux estimates for water as well as various solutes the hydrus model may be coupled with other models to achieve the simulation of pollutant transformation and transport across environmental systems of larger scales in the rare earth mining regions for instance the hydrus model may be coupled with hydrological models to simulate the superimposed impact of soil nh4 n and no3 n leaching from scattered ore bodies on the quality of the ambient water environment and facilitate the development of suitable mining watershed pollution control and ecological remediation programs

2729,glacier hydrology has profound implications for socio economic development and nature conservation in arid central asia process based hydrological models which are the traditional tools used to simulate glacier melting have made considerable contributions to advance our understanding of glacio hydrology simultaneously deep learning dl models have achieved excellent performance in many complex tasks and provide high accuracy however it is uncertain whether glacio hydrological studies can benefit from the application of dl models in this study to help us assess water resource change for glacier influenced regions we used dl models to simulate glacio hydrological processes in the urumqi glacier no 1 in northwest china first we proposed a newly dl model called exogenous regularization network ernet which focuses on the relationship between exogenous temperature and precipitation and endogenous runoff variables balancing the roles of different variables in the simulation process second we compared ernet with a stacked long short term memory lstm model and a process based glacio hydrology model flex g experiments showed that compared with the other two models ernet not only performed well in runoff and peak flow simulations but also displayed superior transferability third given that the dl model is data driven we experimentally compared the importance of air temperature and precipitation to glacial runoff processes the results show that air temperature plays a dominant role in glacier runoff generation we believe that the proposed model provides a useful predictive tool and that the results shed light on the future implication in cold region hydrology keywords flexg model glacio hydrology long short term memory runoff simulation urumqi glacier no 1 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction glaciers play a vital role in the arid high mountainous asia hma glacial rivers supply abundant water resources for human socioeconomic and ecosystem development liu et al 2015 huss and hock 2018 pritchard 2019 however a large amount of glacial melting in a short time can pose a great threat to local and downstream residents and infrastructures ding et al 2020 yang et al 2022 therefore simulating glacier runoff in the context of climate change is important for regional development and nature conservation in central asia seibert et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 with the advantages of explicitly describing and quantifying hydrological processes and the water balance hundecha and bárdossy 2004 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2021 process based models have played a dominant role in practical glacio hydrology simulations in recent years yang and musiake 2003 fenicia et al 2011 du et al 2022 these process based models can be categorized into two classes temperature index models and energy balance models temperature index models use air temperature which is directly related to glacier melting as the main input ohmura 2001 zhang et al 2007 kääb et al 2018 temperature index models are simple and robust but mostly empirically based and depend heavily on parameter calibration wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 nagy et al 2016 energy balance models follow the principles of energy and mass conservation making them more physically sound martinec and rango 1986 rounce et al 2015 ding et al 2017 however these models require more data inputs information and prior knowledge which hinders their implementation in dominant glacier catchments fox et al 2008 kumar et al 2013 wu et al 2021 the flex g g means glacier model gao et al 2017a was a process based glacio hydrology model developed under the umbrella of the flexible modelling framework fenicia et al 2011 gao et al 2014 based on the specific hydrological characteristics in glacierized high mountain asia hma basins the flex g explicitly considers not only glacier and snow melting rainfall runoff and evaporation processes but also the impacts of topography on the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation gao et al 2017b the realism of the flex g model was vigorously tested based on observed hydrographs and multi sources data from field measurements and remote sensing e g snow coverage huang et al 2017 snow water equivalent che et al 2014 glacier mass balance and equilibrium contours immerzeel et al 2015 and even water stable isotopes he et al 2021 the flex g model can effectively simulate long term runoff and reproduce variations in glaciers and snow cover but this type of process based model strongly depends on domain knowledge of the hydrology and glaciology of the study catchment savenije 2010 clark et al 2015 recently deep learning dl models have attracted considerable attention because they can process complex tasks in various fields without domain knowledge an increasing number of studies have applied dl models for hydrological forecasting and these models can be divided into three main categories multilayer perceptron mlp convolutional neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn mlp based models are generally characterized by a large number of calculations and easily fall to local minima compared with mlp based models cnn based models require fewer parameters but the ineffectiveness of addressing the context of temporal features is a shortcoming of cnns lara benítez et al 2021 with the advantage of the recurrent structure rnn based models have achieved great success in time series forecasting including in runoff simulation tian et al 2018 cho and kim 2022 the most common approach is introducing traditional methods into long short term memory lstm model for data pre processing such as through wavelet transform ni et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 empirical mode decomposition an et al 2020 additionally many studies have focused on enhancing the ability of models to capture long term features by introducing new neural components such as attention mechanisms chen et al 2020 alizadeh et al 2021 and encoder decoder structures xiang et al 2020 jardani et al 2022 etc the development of above models has greatly promoted runoff prediction in the field of hydrology while dl may enhance our ability to predict glacio hydrological variables there are some associated challenges such as the difficulty of continuously obtaining relevant data in multi scale glacier catchments in this study we conducted a preliminary analysis of a dl application in glacier hydrology based on available meteorological data e g temperature and precipitation we designed detailed experiments to explore the performance of dl models in glacio hydrology simulations the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows considering the actual simulation scenario we propose a multi task learning model called the exogenous regularization network ernet the model emphasizes the relationships between exogenous temperature and participation and endogenous runoff variables and introduces corresponding regularization terms into the loss function to improve the robustness we compared ernet with the basic stacked lstms model and the process based flex g model experiments showed that ernet compared with the other two models performed well in runoff and peak flow simulation and displayed superior capability in transferability tests considering the data driven nature of dl models we compared the importance of air temperature and precipitation in runoff simulations the results indicated that temperature plays a dominant role in predicting river runoff which is also consistent with the finding of previous studies according to the experimental results we provided some practical suggestions for the usage of dl models in glacier hydrology simulations in the next section the study site and dataset are introduced sections 3 and 4 describe the three models that we utilized and our experimental design in detail respectively in section 5 the performance of different models in experiments is assessed section 6 presents our discussions about experiments the conclusions are given in 7 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study catchment the urumqi river is an inland river in the middle of the northern slope of the tianshan mountains in central asia this river is fed by glacier and snow meltwater precipitation and groundwater moreover it is the head water for agricultural irrigation and domestic water in the region the urumqi no 1 glacier is located at the source of the urumqi river and it is also a representative glacier in central asia as denoted by the world glacier monitoring service wgms therefore studies of the no 1 glacier are of great societal significance glacier no 1 is a valley glacier with eastern and western branches ye et al 2005 the two branches have a combined area of approximately 1 84 km 2 are approximately 2 2 km long and are located between approximately 3740 and 4490 m a s l no 1 runoff station no 1 was established 200 m downstream from the end of the glacier at 3689 m a s l with a basin area of 3 34 km 2 and a glacier coverage rate of 52 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zong kong zk is another runoff gauge station located downstream of the no 1 runoff station it controls a basin area of 28 9 km 2 and the glacier coverage rate is 19 4 land cover in non glacial areas is predominantly bare soil rock and sparse grass which are seasonally covered by snow li et al 2010 gao et al 2014 fig 1 presents the basin maps and topography analyses of the two catchments where the two stations are located 2 2 datasets we collected daily meteorological and hydrological data from 1985 to 2005 temperature and precipitation were observed at the da xi gou dxg meteorological station which records the weather data for the urumqi river area the long term daily average temperature at dxg ranges from 5 1 c and 20 c in winter from june to august the temperature is higher than 0 c more than 90 of rainfall occurs from april to september runoff was gauged at both the no 1 and zk hydrological stations catchments the distance between dxg and two runoff stations is less than 3 km so we can use the data observed from dxg observations as the meteorological input for two runoff stations the topography data from a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dataset glacial area and distribution data were obtained from china s second glacier inventory liu et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 the stacked lstms model 3 1 1 the components of lstm during the training of traditional rnns as the training time and the number of network layers increase the exploding or vanishing gradient problem can easily occur which makes models unable to capture long term dependencies long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special variant of rnns that can effectively solve the above problems given a sequence of time series x t x 1 x 2 x 3 x t 2 x t 1 x t where x i r n lstm continuously process time series data by recurrent function f and generates the corresponding hidden state h t and cell state c t as 1 h t c t f h t 1 c t 1 x t which is specifically defined by the following equations 2 i t s i g m o i d w x i x t w h i h t 1 b i f t s i g m o i d w x f x t w h f h t 1 b f o t s i g m o i d w x o x t w h o h t 1 b o c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w x c x t w h c h t 1 b c h t o t tanh c t where i t f t o t and c t r m w x i w x f w x o and w x g r m n w x i w x f w x o and w h g r m m and denotes element wise multiplication fig 2 a shows an intuitive understanding of lstm cell see fig 2 3 1 2 the stacked lstms model the depth of the network is regarded as one of the important reasons for the success of deep neural networks pascanu et al 2013 increasing the number of layers not only enriches the temporal flow of the model but also adds levels of abstraction for input observations over time brownlee 2017 in this study we adopted a stacked lstms model as the basic dl model for runoff simulation specifically a stacked lstm architecture can be defined as a model comprised of multiple lstm layers the hidden state of each step of the lstm layer below is fed into the lstm layer above and the final output is generated by the top lstm layer fig 2 b presents a stacked lstms model that includes two stacked layers we explore the effect of the number of stacked layers on model performance in section 4 1 1 3 2 exogenous regularization network ernet however it was not sufficient to simply apply basic dl models to glacio hydrology simulations we would like to build an efficient powerful and easy to understand model 3 2 1 the structure of parallel branch in the forecasting tasks exogenous variables are not affected by other factors in the system and are imposed in the model as inputs in contrast endogenous variables are those that are determined varian and varian 1992 for example in our forecasting scenario air temperature and precipitation are exogenous variables and runoff is the endogenous variable the difficulty in handling this type of task is that models need to simulate not only the auto correlation of every variable but also the temporal cross correlations between pairs of variables in this study we propose a new multi task learning mtl model called exogenous regularization network ernet which can simultaneously predict temperature precipitation and runoff as shown in parts b e of fig 3 ernet adopts a parallel dual branch structure and exogenous variables are separately input into independent branches to extract their temporal features since both branches employ the same processing approach we use x t i x t l 1 i x t l 2 i x t 1 i x t i to present inputting variables and i 1 or 2 3 x t 1 n i f c i l s t m i x t i where x t 1 n i denotes the output of part e and l s t m i and f c i denote the lstm and fully connected layers in part c and part e respectively in the final stage of ernet we utilize a fully connected layer to combine the outputs of two sublayers to generate the runoff simulation as shown in parts f g of fig 3 the model simultaneously generates the predictions for three variables in other words the forecasts for air temperature and precipitation are also incorporated into the model s optimization goals we present the specific optimization details in section 3 2 4 loss function from the task driven perspective ruder 2017 ernet provides an expansion from a single task model to a multi task model 3 2 2 autoregression effectively cope with peak values peak prediction or scale insensitivity is a common problem for neural networks due to the nonlinearity of recurrent components lai et al 2017 the routine solution is to decompose model into a linear part i e the autoregressive ar shumway et al 2000 and a non linear part i e neural network lai et al 2017 specifically the values of the input variable from a few previous steps are added through the ar model and the result is then input into the neural network through the highway srivastava et al 2015 we implement the ar model based on two exogenous variables as shown in part d of fig 3 the calculation process is as follows 4 x t 1 l i k 0 3 w i k a r x t k i b i a r x t 1 i x t 1 l i x t 1 n i where w a r r 3 and b a r r are the coefficients of the ar model in our case we chose the last three steps in the ar model and marked them with red rectangles in fig 3 the introduction of the ar model has three advantages by adding the nearest original input model can strengthen the memory of the latest short term trend in cases where there is a correlation between meteorological data and runoff if we can predict better meteorological trends it is bound for model to help predict runoff more accurate auxiliary task prediction would drop the weight of auxiliary tasks in the loss function prompting the model to pay more attention to the runoff prediction we do not fuse the temporal features of two branches until the results of the ar model are added as shown in fig 3 5 y t 1 f c c o n c a t x t 1 1 x t 1 2 where c o n c a t and f c denotes the vector concatenate and fully connected layer respectively in parts f g 3 2 3 the utilization of activation function considering the real situation we need to consider the following two points runoff and precipitation are nonnegative thus we must ensure that the simulation results of the model do not include negative values however the dl modelling process is implicit and the ultimate goal of optimization is to minimize the loss function in other words without appropriate constraints activation functions regularization etc as long as the total loss function decreases a dl model does not pay attention to the specific predicted value we solve the above problem by introducing the rectified linear unit relu function 6 f x x x 0 0 x 0 as shown in eq 6 the relu function is actually a piecewise linear function that converts all negative values to zero while positive values remain unchanged agarap 2018 we applied the relu function to the runoff and participation outputs to eliminate negative values 7 x ˆ t 1 1 r e l u x t 1 1 y ˆ t 1 r e l u y t 1 where x ˆ t 1 1 and y ˆ t 1 are the final predictions of precipitation and runoff respectively there is no threshold limit for the value of air temperature colder winters and hotter summers are possible in the future if we apply the relu function to air temperature it is equivalent to setting a minimum threshold for air temperature negative to zero which is obviously unreasonable the leaky relu agarap 2018 function is a variant of relu that assigns a nonzero slope α 0 01 to all negative values 8 f x x x 0 x α x 0 leaky relu inherits the advantages of relu in terms of feature sparsity and computational efficiency we applied the leaky relu to the air temperature output 9 x ˆ t 1 2 r e l u x t 1 2 where x ˆ t 1 2 is the final predictions of air temperature why is the relu function not directly applied in the stacked lstms the disadvantage of the relu function is that it is prone to the dead relu problem specifically when most neurons return an output of zero the gradients fail to flow during backpropagation and the weights are not updated ultimately a large part of the network becomes inactive and it is unable to learn agarap 2018 the stacked lstms model is a single output model with only one path used to update the gradient especially encountering the freezing period with zero runoff the model parameters and gradients are easily changes to zero once the gradient of the output is zero the entire network cannot be updated again in contrast ernet is an mtl model with a parallel branch structure which means that ernet has more paths to ensure the overall framework is updated we performed repeated experiments on the stacked lstms with the addition of relu function some of them did avoid negative values but others paralysed the model we also explored different ways to address the model instability such as decreasing learning rates and performing xavier initialization but both of these approaches only alleviated and could not eradicate the issue a good dl model should be stable but the stacked lstms model with the relu function fails to meet this requirement we also need to note that the combination of stacked lstms and relu function has very strong modelling capabilities just in our task scenario this combination cannot exert its true strength due to the long freezing period 3 2 4 new loss function e r l o s s in many forecasting tasks l 2 l o s s has been the preferred loss function used in the neural networks lara benítez et al 2021 as documented in eq 10 10 l 2 l o s s 1 t n 1 t y n y ˆ n 2 x n 1 x ˆ n 1 2 x n 2 x ˆ n 2 2 where y and x i denotes the ground truth and y ˆ and x ˆ i are the predicted value the disadvantage of l 2 l o s s is that there is that the three subtasks are assigned the same weight in parameter updating in other words the modelling ability of the network is evenly distributed over the three tasks however our main task is accurate runoff prediction therefore we propose a newly modified loss function that emphasizes the priority of tasks called e r l o s s 11 e r l o s s 1 t n 1 t y n y ˆ n 2 α x n 1 x ˆ n 1 2 β x n 2 x ˆ n 2 2 where α and β are the hyper parameters with α β 1 we determined the values of α and β by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient shumway et al 2000 12 ρ 1 i 1 t x i 1 x 1 y i y i 1 t x i 1 x 1 2 i 1 t y i y 2 ρ 2 i 1 t x i 2 x 2 y i y i 1 t x i 2 x 2 2 i 1 t y i y 2 α ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 β ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the coefficient between two input variables and runoff respectively such a design has the following benefits by incorporating input variables into loss functions we can enhance the extraction of temporal meteorological features with the network extracting meteorological features directly is challenging because runoff prediction involves the use of meteorological features in a complex way in contrast these features are easy to learn in auxiliary tasks because such tasks are directly responsible for meteorological prediction through mtl the main task can utilize the meteorological features extracted by the auxiliary tasks to help better simulate runoff ruder 2017 the auxiliary tasks act as additional regularization processes by introducing inductive bias ruder 2017 which can help ernet converge towards solutions that can explain multiple tasks at the same time and reduce the risk of overfitting this generalization capability also helps ernet better adapt to different catchments in transferability tests the loss function directly affects the parameter updating of the neural network goodfellow et al 2016 by weighting the loss items α and β of exogenous variables we can limit the effect of auxiliary tasks on the gradient descent process thus avoiding interference with the main task overall er loss can better balance the main task and auxiliary tasks 3 3 process based model flex g the flex g model has three modules including topography discretization and meteorological forcing interpolation module snow and glacier module and rainfall runoff module in the non glacial area the runoff from both glacial areas and non glacial areas is added to simulated runoff for the urumqi no 1 glacier basin 3 3 1 topography discretization and meteorological forcing interpolation module topographical factors have significant impacts on the distribution of glaciers and the corresponding energy budgets barry 1992 for example elevation and aspect can directly impact solar radiation which has the first order influence on the melting of ice and snow hock 2005 at different elevations and aspects the solar radiation area snow accumulation amount and meltwater volume also vary therefore we first discretized two nested catchments to perform the elevation classification the basins were divided into different elevation zones with 50 metre intervals in this study the no 1 and zk catchments were discretized into 16 and 21 evaluation bands respectively subsequently we further divided each elevation band into three different facing aspects north 315 45 south 135 225 and east west 45 135 and 225 315 aspects as shown in fig 1 in addition we considered the different runoff generation mechanisms of glacial and non glacial areas the no 1 and zk catchments were divided into 96 and 128 hydrological units respectively the lapse rates of air temperature and precipitation were set as 0 7 c 100 m and 5 100 m respectively which were used to interpolate the meteorological observations at 3539 m to different elevation zones 3 3 2 snow and glacier module 3 3 2 1 snowfall and rainfall separation and snowfall correction according to whether the daily air average temperature t is higher or lower than the threshold temperature t t c the precipitation is regarded as snowfall p s or rainfall p l eqs 13 and 14 chuntan et al 2010 13 p s p t t t 0 t t t 14 p l p t t t 0 t t t t t is a vital parameter for calibration berghuijs et al 2016 as it is directly used for the division of rainfall and snowfall according to gao et al 2017b we establish a wide range of t t 2 5 to 5 c for calibration snowfall measurement is affected by various systematic errors such as wind and evaporation loss goodison et al 1998 yang et al 2001 based on the field observations daqing et al 1988 concluded that for a given amount of snowfall the observed value is 0 765 times the true value in the urumqi no 1 glacier basin therefore the value of observed snowfall should be multiplied by 1 3 to correct the underestimation issue 3 3 2 2 snow and glacier melt simulation snow cover is considered a porous medium that can hold liquid meltwater rainfall the liquid water may be re frozen into ice therefore in the modelling process we conceptualized the solid snowpack s w and the liquid water inside the snowpack s w l into two separate reservoirs eqs 15 16 represent the water balance of s w and s w l reservoirs r r f mm d 1 indicates the refreezing water from s w l to s w and m s mm d 1 is the snowmelt p e mm d 1 is the effective precipitation from snowpack to the soil layer the calculation formula of these three variables is shown in eq 16 18 seibert et al 2018 gao et al 2020 f d d mm c d 1 is the degree day factor that is applied to calculate meltwater eqs 17 and 19 c w h is a certain fraction between s w l and s w below which threshold all meltwater is held in snowpack without runoff generation eq 17 f r r is a correction factor to model liquid water refreezing when the air temperature is below t t eq 19 since glaciers have a smaller albedo and larger amount of melt than snow even with the same air temperature glacier has larger degree day factor we utilized a correction factor c g to simulate the glacier melt m g 15 d s w d t p s r r f m s 16 d s w l d t p 1 m s r r f p e 17 m s f d d t t t t t t 0 t t t 18 p e d s w l d t c w h d s w d t s w l c w h s w 0 s w l c w h s w 19 r r f f d d f r r

t p e e a r u where e a mm d 1 is the actual evaporation which we treat as potential evaporation in this cold region where energy rather than water is the constraint for evaporation kang et al 2002 and r u mm d 1 is the streamflow generated from the unsaturated reservoir eq 21 we applied the xinanjiang curve to further separate p e into retained water in s u and r u as shown in eq 22 zhao 1992 s u m a x mm means the unsaturated storage capacity and β indicates the shape parameter 22 r u p e 1 1 s u 1 β s u m a x β 3 3 3 2 response routines in the nonglacial area we divided the r u into two fluxes r f and r s and into two response reservoirs s f and s s the subscripts f and s represent two fast and slow hydrography responses processes respectively q f mm d 1 and q s mm d 1 are fast response and slow response respectively 23 d s f d t r f q f 24 d s s d t r s q s 25 q f s f k f 26 q s s s k s where k f d and k s d are the recession parameter of two linear reservoirs 4 experimental design we designed three major groups of experiments a comparison between dl lstm and ernet models and a process based flex g model an analysis of the importance of input variables model transferability testing experiments for all experiments we divided the first 50 of the data as a training set 1985 1995 and the remaining 50 of the data as a test set 1995 2005 some time periods in the test dataset have missing data 2000 2001 in no 1 1996 in zk and we excluded these abnormal data from the evaluation 4 1 group 1 comparison between dl models and process based model in this group of experiments we compared the performance of three models that use precipitation and temperature as inputs to simulate runoff in both the no 1 and zk catchments flex g also used the topographical data 4 1 1 hyper parameter configuration of the data driven models 4 1 1 1 problem formulation in previous big data studies kratzert et al 2019 feng et al 2020a b the inputs to lstm included time series of atmospheric inputs and static basin attributes for data collected from hundreds of basins however there is no large dataset such as catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels to adequately describe the behaviours and characteristics of various glaciers the existing data for the urumqi glacier were the culmination of the hard work of generations of scientists under very difficult situations considering the availability of data and the concept of fair comparison with flex g the only viable option was to use air temperature and precipitation to simulate the river runoff given two sets of input time series x i x 1 i x 2 i x t 1 i x t i x k i r i 1 o r 2 we aimed to predict output series y y 1 y 2 y t 1 y t y t r through x i in a moving simulating fashion specifically to predict y t 1 we assume x t i x t l 1 i x t l 2 i x t i are available and l represents the length of moving window likewise if we predict the value of y t 2 we assume x t 1 i x t l 2 i x t l 3 i x t 1 i are available fig 4 graphically illustrates the problem formulation 4 1 1 2 length of input window selecting the right window size is vital but difficult for forecasting models especially for dl models hewamalage et al 2021 the stacked lstms model in this study was constructed with a hybrid input approach without subbranches therefore we need to achieve a compromise between the window sizes of the two variables to ensure that the input lengths of the variables are consistent we calculated the temporal lagged cross correlation tlcc which measures the relationship between the input and target variable in two stations boyd 2001 podobnik et al 2010 according to table 1 we found that except for the precipitation in no 1 the other three results all show that the cross correlation with runoff is highest when the lag is zero we also calculated the partial auto correlation function pacf of input variables as shown in fig 5 the pacf measures the relationship between x t 1 i and x t i in the case of removing lag 1 2 l 1 s effect on x t i considering the synchronization between x i and y we argue that if x t l i has an effect on the x t i x t l i also has an effect on y t considering the tlcc and pacf confidence interval 95 simultaneously we chose the 10 and 12 days as the window sizes for the no 1 and zk stations respectively for the convenience of comparison although ernet supports input variables with different window sizes with its parallel structure we adopted the same window size setting for ernet as used for the stacked lstms model to ensure the fairness of comparison 4 1 1 3 optimization of network structure network structure such as hidden layers and neurons has an important impact on the experimental performance greff et al 2016 according to brownlee 2017 the stacked lstms model only needs 1 3 layers to show powerful performance and too many parameters can easily lead to overfitting we performed a grid search goodfellow et al 2016 to determine the optimal structure of the stacked lstms and the performances with different structures are shown in table 2 to avoid overreliance on the results of one experiment we repeated the experiment ten times and selected the best metrics as the final experimental result there are two notable points to our approach 1 we chose adam optimizer for optimization bianchi et al 2017 and 2 we chose the min max scaler for the normalization function 27 min max x x min x max x min x similarly we also did a grid search for ernet the best configuration of hyper parameters about lstm and ernet can be found in table 3 4 1 2 experimental setup of flex g model we employed precipitation temperature and topography as the input forcing of the flex g model which has 13 free parameters to be calibrated we applied the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 2014 to calibrate parameters by data from calibrating sets as shown in table 4 to ensure accurate and efficient modelling we also set a prior range of parameters for monte carlo sampling in glue method with reference to gao et al 2017a glue runs the flex g model 200 000 times on training sets and we selected the parameters from the top one percentile sets as behavioural parameters 200 parameter sets based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse then we applied the 200 parameter sets in the model and ran the test sets to obtain the simulated hydrological output finally we weighed the four metrics namely the pearson correlation coefficient corr root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nse and obtained the best testing results 4 2 group 2 experimental analysis of the importance of input variable in this group of experiments to explore the relationship among precipitation air temperature and runoff we added two experiments based on stacked lstms using precipitation as an input to simulate runoff denoted as lstms p and using temperature as an input to simulate runoff denoted as lstms t we adjusted the hidden dimensions of the two models so that they had similar numbers of parameters as did the stacked lstms the time window sizes for precipitation at the two stations were 10 and 12 days respectively and the time window sizes for air temperature at the two stations were 10 days 4 3 group 3 model transferability test experiments in this group of experiments we tested the transferability of the three models our experimental design motivations are described as follows transfer learning which transfers the model that is trained based on a source to a new task is one of the frontiers in dl limited by climatic geographical and historical conditions it is difficult and expensive to conduct long term observational surveys in a glacierized basins many regions or basins do not have enough historical observation data to train dl models therefore in this case the transferability test is particularly important for studying poorly unmeasured or ungauged basins transferring the model trained with information from data rich regions into other regions can alleviate the problem caused by data shortages the transferability of hydrological models has been regarded as a major challenge for the hydrological community hrachowitz et al 2013 biondi and de luca 2017 according to gao et al 2017a b the calibrated flex g model can be robustly transferred and up scaled to a larger catchment without re calibration this powerful transfer modelling capability has become one the key advantages of the flex g model hence for comparison dl models should be designed with similar transferability tests for comparison we utilized the model trained based on zk to predict the runoff value for no 1 additionally the model trained based on no 1 was transferred to predict runoff for zk as the two catchments utilized the same meteorological data it would be unreasonable to conduct transferability tests for dl models based on group 1 if these tests were to be conducted the forecasted runoff of the dl models trained based on no 1 and tested at zk would actually be the forecasted runoff at no 1 rather than zk therefore we designed a new set of experiments for the dl models using precipitation temperature and runoff to predict runoff thus we can ensure that the parameters of the model are trained based on the unique characteristics of the catchment we denoted the experiments as lstms and ernet respectively the transferability experiments are described as follows 6 lstms t the transferability test of lstm based on lstms 7 ernet t the transferability test of ernet based on ernet and 8 flex g t the transferability test of flex g based on flex g in group 1 we organized the eight experiments in a tabular format for a clear understanding of the experimental design as shown in table 5 4 4 performance metrics we used four performance metrics to evaluate the quality of the simulation results and these metrics are defined as follows pearson correlation coefficient corr 28 r i 1 t y i y y ˆ i y ˆ i 1 t y i y 2 i 1 t y ˆ i y ˆ 2 root mean square error rmse 29 r m s e 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 mean absolute error mae 30 m a e 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 31 n s e 1 i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 t y i y 2 where y and y ˆ are the ground truth and predicted value respectively y is the average of the data set for rmse and mae the lower the value is the better performance is in contrast for corr and nse the higher the value the better performance is and the more accurate y ˆ predicted runoff is 5 results 5 1 comparisons with performance metrics in section 5 1 1 first we compare the performance of three models in group 1 second we discuss the importance of the input variables in group 2 experiments involving group 3 which involves transferability tests are presented in section 5 1 3 5 1 1 comparison between three models in this section we evaluated the results of the training and testing sets to reveal more details table 6 shows how the three models performed for the training and testing sets we have plotted the overall prediction results for the testing set in fig 6 to assess the performance of the three models several important observations are worth highlighting first the performances of the three models based on the testing set can be ranked as follows ernet blue lines flex g green lines stacked lstms orange lines especially for the two metrics used to measure simulation error rmse and mae the newly proposed ernet had some advantages the stacked lstm model even predicted negative streamflow fig 6 a i which does not exist in the real world in contrast our newly proposed ernet not only avoided negative values but also performed better notably it correctly predicted the runoff during the freezing periods as zero while flex g predicted some very small positive values furthermore to statistically assess the validity of ernet we applied the rmse as the sample indicator and performed a two sample t test between ernet and the other two models at the 5 significance level the testing results and small p values indicated that ernet achieved statistically significant improvements over the stacked lstms and flex g in addition overall the three models performed better for the training set than for the testing set we can explain the difference in the performance of the dl model on the training and testing sets from the perspective of distribution in dl models ideally both the training sets and testing sets should obey the same data distribution that is 32 x t r a i n y t r a i n x t e s t y t e s t i i d f x y based on this assumption dl models learn the joint probability distribution from the training set and apply it to the testing set 33 p t r a i n x y p t r a i n x p t r a i n y x p t e s t x y p t r a i n x y p t e s t x however in reality changes in various factors in the external environment may cause this hypothesis to be invalid especially when the training set consists of past data and the test set consists of current data due to this temporal difference the sets may not have the same distribution p t r a i n x p t e s t x b u t p t r a i n x p t e s t x thus the dl model does not perform as well for the test set as it does for the training set we also observed that stacked lstms performed best for the training set but worst for the test set this difference can also be explained from the perspective of distribution in our simulation scenario the amount of data used in the training set was not large data spanning only 3835 days with this amount of data the distribution of the training set may not fully reflect the true distribution the distribution of the test set when the stacked lstms overlearned the distribution of the training set it was far from the distribution of the test set resulting in inaccurate predictions the design of ernet can compensate for this shortcoming two auxiliary tasks can be seen as two regularizations penalties that constrain the network and avoid network overlearning for training sets thereby improving the generalization ability of the model therefore ernet displayed average performance for the training set but it performed the best for the test set flex g adds some physical constraints to ensure that the model can be generalized when possible changes occur from this perspective the approach adopted in flex g and ernet is essentially the same they are better constrained and better suited for this limited data scenario in addition flex g model is based on explicit physical processes and mathematical derivations while dl models simulate a complex non linear function based on an implicit black box process however in some transitions between thawing and freezing periods as shown in the green dotted boxes of fig 6 b i the three models yield almost identical simulations of trends this similarity illustrates that although the concepts of the two types of models are different the functions simulated by dl models may be consistent with the functions that we constructed based on expert knowledge during some periods model interpretability has always been the focus of dl exploration and these small details are helpful for us to further assessing dl models in future studies considering the effect of the simulations in the freezing period on the evaluation metrics we have also performed the predictive comparison of the three models regarding the ablation periods including two comparison schemes first referring to the true freezing periods we set the corresponding parts of the predicted values of the three models to zero and re evaluated the predictions as recorded in table 7 after assuming that all models can simulate the freezing period correctly the evaluation metrics of the three experiments improved to varying degrees but the order of predictive performance for the three models did not change whether for the freezing period or the thawing period ernet s predictions are better than those of the other two models the gap between the stacked lstm and flex g narrowed but overall flex g still performed better than the stacked lstm second we presented the forecasted and observed daily runoff in the thawing period through scatter plots fig 7 by performing simple linear regression overall the ernet model still performed best with the blue line plotting closest to the red line flex g performed slightly better than the stacked lstm however in fig 7 we can observe that it is easy for ernet to directly predict some small positive runoff values as zero values especially at the zk station we think this issue may be related to the relu function but it is difficult to fully understand why we will try to compensate for this shortcoming in future work 5 1 2 the importance of forcing variables a comparison of stacked lstms in group 2 was conducted and the performance was ranked as follows lstms p precipitation as the input lstms t temperature as the input lstms precipitation and temperature as inputs this ranking illustrates that the choice of forcing variables is important for dl models according to the knowledge of glacier hydrology and table 1 we know that both precipitation and temperature are positively correlated with runoff the used of more effective variables usually results in the inclusion more information and more accurate forecasting results therefore it is reasonable that the lstms model performs than lstms p and lstms t the respective runoff simulation obtained with the two meteorological variables are more noteworthy compared with the lstms p the nse of the lstms t increased by 263 84 and 64 40 in the two stations which indicates that the air temperature data are more important for predicting runoff than are the precipitation data the tlcc values in table 1 also confirm this finding notably at the two stations the correlation coefficient of temperature is much higher than that of precipitation as shown in fig 8 the results of lstms p cyan lines are quite different from the true values in terms of the overall numerical interval and trend while lstms t dark magenta lines can roughly simulate the true value trend especially in certain transition periods between freezing and ablation lstms and lstms t exhibit the same trend this result suggests that changes in temperature can lead to changes in glacier melt which in turn affects the runoff of the urumqi river this conclusion is consistent with those of previous researchers who analysed the hydrological characteristics of the urumqi river in alpine glacier regions the increase in temperature has a major effect on the variation in glacier melt runoff wu et al 2006 through the conclusions regarding the importance of variables we can explain why the corr and nse results obtained for the no 1 catchment are better than those for the zk catchment while the rmse and mae values are higher than those in the zk catchment as shown in table 6 rmse and mae are related to the availability of catchment data as noted in section 2 1 the glacier area in the no 1 catchment is larger than that in the zk catchment no 1 55 vs zk 21 as we previously mentioned temperature has a direct effect on glacial meltwater thus the temperature has a more significant impact on the no 1 runoff simulation and leads to greater runoff 5 1 3 comparison of the model transferability the results of transferability test are illuminating compared with those for the lstms and ernet the forecasting results of the lstms and ernet are significantly improved the prediction results of the model are related not only to the ability of the model itself but also to the input of the model proper input and appropriate operation can make the model s predictions more accurate and effective in addition the forecasting results of ernet especially for corr also show the effectiveness of the structural design of the ernet model we calculated the percentage drop in model prediction performance before and after the transfer rather than by directly comparing the original values as shown in table 8 we discovered that after the transferability test the forecasting results of the three models declined to varying degrees the decline in performance of the models is explainable for both catchments the joint distributions learned by the models are different p t r a i n n o 1 x y p t r a i n z k x y as the runoff topography data for two catchments are different p t r a i n n o 1 y x p t r a i n z k y x if the models are employed for the transferability test it is equivalent to 34 p t e s t n o 1 y x p t r a i n z k x y p t e s t n o 1 x p t e s t z k y x p t r a i n n o 1 x y p t e s t z k x hence the accuracy of the model results declined in the transferability test although flex g is a process based model that uses parameters with clear physical meaning in essence the calibration of these parameters is still based on the training data therefore the above reasons given for the decline in the dl results from the perspective of conditional probability are also applicable for flex g taking the nse as an example the forecasting results of stacked lstms ernet and flex g for no 1 decreased by 4 75 1 27 and 2 69 respectively and those for zk decreased by 7 73 3 00 and 3 50 respectively according to the percentage decrease in nse from small to large the order is ernet flex g stacked lstms because the inputs to the models are slightly different during transfer testing we cannot directly assert that the transferability of ernet is necessarily better than that of flex g but at the least these models achieve a significant improvement compared to the stacked lstms the reason why ernet is more robust than stacked lstms is the extension of the multitask model and the modification of the loss function specifically ernet adopts a parallel branching structure for the input of the network which means the feature extraction of variables is independent thus although the branch responsible for runoff may not be able to adequately adapt to new runoff the two branches responsible for meteorology are still feasible in contrast stacked lstms have only a single path and the model parameters are trained based on mixed input variables therefore the transfer of runoff has a greater impact on the performance of the stacked lstms in addition the loss function of ernet includes penalty terms for exogenous variables which effectively improves the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model 5 1 4 forecasting errors of peak flow forecasting peak flow is important in runoff prediction glacial melting and heavy rain in a short period of time can cause peak flow based on group 1 we identified the top 12 days with the largest runoff in each year in the testing set and showed the results in the table 9 we adopted absolute relative error are as the main metric to evaluate the performance of the two models 35 a r e y ˆ y y where y and y ˆ are the true value and predicted value respectively of the dataset considering the mean are as the indicator flex g displayed the best fitting in the no 1 catchment flex g 5 vs ernet 4 ernet displayed the best performance in the zk catchment but its superiority was not as significant as observed for flex g in no 1 ernet 6 flex g 2 and stacked lstms 2 according to the are results ernet and flex g are comparable in terms of capturing peaks and significantly outperform the stacked lstm model the input of a large amount of training data can ensure that the models correctly predict the overall trend and seasonal trends but a sudden change in the data cannot be well captured from the perspective of the gaussian distribution peak values are usually plotted to the left of the distribution which means that the corresponding probability is low this is largely why peak flow is difficult to simulate in the forecasting problems peak forecasting is usually classified as the problem of scale insensitivity which means that neural networks cannot effectively capture the scales of output changes especially for the task of predicting endogenous variables by exogenous variables scale capturing would become more difficult as shown in the grey dotted box of fig 6 b ii the stacked lstms simulation orange line scale is larger than the real value range i e the peak flow simulation is larger than the real value and the low flow prediction is smaller than the real value however our newly proposed ernet blue line is better adapted to scale changes than lstm this result is also shown in fig 7 especially in regard to the no 1 catchment compared with the other models the prediction of the stacked lstms model is significantly more concentrated in the area of y x we marked them with a brown box in contrast ernet obtains a better forecasting result of peak values which proves that the synergy of multi task and autoregression in ernet is effective 5 2 comparison of time consumption the goal of our comparison among the three models is to create practical applications for runoff simulation in cases with glacial rivers therefore the time required for the training and analysis of the three models is also something that we need to consider all flex g models were run on a workstation with an intel r xeon r cpu e5 1620 v4 3 5 ghz with 16 0 gb ram the experimental result obtained was the result over 200 000 iterations which required an hour and a half to complete we also conducted dl experiments on the same cpu for stacked lstms each epoch took only 0 782 s to process and model convergence was achieved after 300 epochs the entire training and testing process for one model took 235 s although the ernet model is more complex than the other models the total time required to achieve model convergence was only approximately 245 s the dl results in table 5 were the best results obtained over ten repeated experiments which took less than 40 min in total if a gpu were used to accelerate the running of dl models the time required for model training and testing would be reduced overall dl models require less time than flex g models 6 discussion 6 1 the discussion of models performance the performance of all models was encouraging and in terms of model performance ernet flex g lstm in this section we discuss the performance of the models and the causes of differences in performance first we argue that compared with the stacked lstms the effectiveness of ernet is due to the following three points the extension of the single task model to a multi task model by introducing exogenous variables into the prediction task loss function the model is incentivized to better extract the temporal characteristics of exogenous variables the modification of the loss function by weighting the sub loss functions of different tasks the primary and secondary tasks are clarified this approach not only balances the role of exogenous variables in the prediction task but also alleviates the overfitting problem that is prone to occur in small data scenarios the utilization of the activation function considering the real world conditions we add different activation functions at the output thus avoiding some unreasonable situations such as negative runoff second although the ernet model performs better than flex g this does not mean that process based models such as flex g are obsolete through this work we discover that data driven and process based models have distinct advantages in applications in the field of glacier hydrology flex g and other process based models are established based on field investigations scientific analyses and objective summaries by many scientific predecessors compared with dl models process based models are more explanatory and each step in the models has clear physical meaning this is of great reference significance for future improvements to dl models finally the stacked lstm model displayed inferior performance in the glacio hydrology simulation comparison but we need to clarify the following two points we cannot arbitrarily attribute this inferior performance to the capability of the stacked lstm model in fact some studies have revealed that even simple stacked lstms can handle many complex tasks greff et al 2016 as we mentioned above the performance of the stacked lstm model may be related to the model overfitting caused by the small data volume although ernet adopts a branch structure each branch is still based on stacked lstms thus stacked lstms are powerful for feature extraction as shown in table 8 if mitigate the limitations of flexg and add runoff as an input the forecasting results of the stacked lstms are quite good this finding indicates that stacked lstms can perform well with the appropriate inputs in short if researchers are familiar with dl models they can be effectively modified according to the needs of specific tasks and applied otherwise process based models may be more suitable for researchers if researchers do not know much about dl or glacial hydrology a stacked lstm as a basic dl model is a good choice 6 2 limitations and future study we observed that regardless of the model there was a certain delay in the prediction especially in some transitions between thawing and freezing periods for example as presented in fig 6 a ii and fig 6 b i although the runoff true value had changed obviously there was a corresponding lag in recognition in the model on the scale of a few days in other words these models are insensitive to the seasonal changes we initially believe that this may be related to the size of the sliding time window in the model the relationship between air temperature and runoff and other factors these speculations require extensive and detailed experiments to demonstrate and we will further analyse them in future studies in addition determining how to use spatial data is also our focus in the future the topographic data that flexg utilizes or that we currently have are very sparse point like data representing elevation and orientation in the two catchments in other words these data can be considered constant factors for each catchment we have not developed a feasible way to integrate them into dl models at present utilizing long term satellite images may be a viable approach to represent dynamically changing topography and dynamic glacier data in addition if we compile a database for the world s glaciers there is a high likelihood that model performance could be enhanced through a data synergy effect fang et al 2021 dl models can be pretrained with information from data intensive regions and then transferred to data scarce regions to improve dl models can be pretrained with information from data intensive regions and then transferred to data scarce regions to improve modelling performance this approach is better than only training a model with local data in data scarce regions finally textbfa hybrid model incorporating a process based model and deep learning model is likely promising for further improving model predictions and the overall understanding of glacierized basins in some fields work has been performed to introduce physical processes into deep learning models such as the solving differential equations sde lu et al 2019 physics informed neural networks pinns meng et al 2020 and decent results have been achieved if some explanatory physical processes can be incorporated into dl the results of glacier simulations could be improved 7 conclusions in this paper we pioneer the application of dl models in the field of glacio hydrology a robust multi task learning model is developed and applied to simulate the glacial meltwater ernet utilizes a parallel recurrent component to process exogenous variables respectively and modifies the loss function to balance the roles of different variables the ernet model is verified for daily runoff forecasting at two stations on the urumqi no 1 glacier we compared the ernet model with a basic dl model stacked lstms and a process based hydrological model flex g in daily runoff simulation the experimental results indicate that the ernet model performs well in base flow prediction peak capturing and transferability test between different stations especially in the comparison of the first two terms ernet performs better than the other two models the key to ernet s success stems from the exploitation the correlations between exogenous and endogenous variables and a subsequent balanced weighting approach proper input and appropriate operations can enhance model effectiveness and accuracy since there are many similar simulation scenarios in the hydrological community researchers can also use the parallel branch and multi task concepts similar to those applied in ernet to build their own models and handle related tasks finally ernet still has room for improvement such as in terms of seasonal insensitivity utilization of spatial data and integration of physical processes we will try to address these issues in future studies credit authorship

2729,glacier hydrology has profound implications for socio economic development and nature conservation in arid central asia process based hydrological models which are the traditional tools used to simulate glacier melting have made considerable contributions to advance our understanding of glacio hydrology simultaneously deep learning dl models have achieved excellent performance in many complex tasks and provide high accuracy however it is uncertain whether glacio hydrological studies can benefit from the application of dl models in this study to help us assess water resource change for glacier influenced regions we used dl models to simulate glacio hydrological processes in the urumqi glacier no 1 in northwest china first we proposed a newly dl model called exogenous regularization network ernet which focuses on the relationship between exogenous temperature and precipitation and endogenous runoff variables balancing the roles of different variables in the simulation process second we compared ernet with a stacked long short term memory lstm model and a process based glacio hydrology model flex g experiments showed that compared with the other two models ernet not only performed well in runoff and peak flow simulations but also displayed superior transferability third given that the dl model is data driven we experimentally compared the importance of air temperature and precipitation to glacial runoff processes the results show that air temperature plays a dominant role in glacier runoff generation we believe that the proposed model provides a useful predictive tool and that the results shed light on the future implication in cold region hydrology keywords flexg model glacio hydrology long short term memory runoff simulation urumqi glacier no 1 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction glaciers play a vital role in the arid high mountainous asia hma glacial rivers supply abundant water resources for human socioeconomic and ecosystem development liu et al 2015 huss and hock 2018 pritchard 2019 however a large amount of glacial melting in a short time can pose a great threat to local and downstream residents and infrastructures ding et al 2020 yang et al 2022 therefore simulating glacier runoff in the context of climate change is important for regional development and nature conservation in central asia seibert et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 with the advantages of explicitly describing and quantifying hydrological processes and the water balance hundecha and bárdossy 2004 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2021 process based models have played a dominant role in practical glacio hydrology simulations in recent years yang and musiake 2003 fenicia et al 2011 du et al 2022 these process based models can be categorized into two classes temperature index models and energy balance models temperature index models use air temperature which is directly related to glacier melting as the main input ohmura 2001 zhang et al 2007 kääb et al 2018 temperature index models are simple and robust but mostly empirically based and depend heavily on parameter calibration wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 nagy et al 2016 energy balance models follow the principles of energy and mass conservation making them more physically sound martinec and rango 1986 rounce et al 2015 ding et al 2017 however these models require more data inputs information and prior knowledge which hinders their implementation in dominant glacier catchments fox et al 2008 kumar et al 2013 wu et al 2021 the flex g g means glacier model gao et al 2017a was a process based glacio hydrology model developed under the umbrella of the flexible modelling framework fenicia et al 2011 gao et al 2014 based on the specific hydrological characteristics in glacierized high mountain asia hma basins the flex g explicitly considers not only glacier and snow melting rainfall runoff and evaporation processes but also the impacts of topography on the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation gao et al 2017b the realism of the flex g model was vigorously tested based on observed hydrographs and multi sources data from field measurements and remote sensing e g snow coverage huang et al 2017 snow water equivalent che et al 2014 glacier mass balance and equilibrium contours immerzeel et al 2015 and even water stable isotopes he et al 2021 the flex g model can effectively simulate long term runoff and reproduce variations in glaciers and snow cover but this type of process based model strongly depends on domain knowledge of the hydrology and glaciology of the study catchment savenije 2010 clark et al 2015 recently deep learning dl models have attracted considerable attention because they can process complex tasks in various fields without domain knowledge an increasing number of studies have applied dl models for hydrological forecasting and these models can be divided into three main categories multilayer perceptron mlp convolutional neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn mlp based models are generally characterized by a large number of calculations and easily fall to local minima compared with mlp based models cnn based models require fewer parameters but the ineffectiveness of addressing the context of temporal features is a shortcoming of cnns lara benítez et al 2021 with the advantage of the recurrent structure rnn based models have achieved great success in time series forecasting including in runoff simulation tian et al 2018 cho and kim 2022 the most common approach is introducing traditional methods into long short term memory lstm model for data pre processing such as through wavelet transform ni et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 empirical mode decomposition an et al 2020 additionally many studies have focused on enhancing the ability of models to capture long term features by introducing new neural components such as attention mechanisms chen et al 2020 alizadeh et al 2021 and encoder decoder structures xiang et al 2020 jardani et al 2022 etc the development of above models has greatly promoted runoff prediction in the field of hydrology while dl may enhance our ability to predict glacio hydrological variables there are some associated challenges such as the difficulty of continuously obtaining relevant data in multi scale glacier catchments in this study we conducted a preliminary analysis of a dl application in glacier hydrology based on available meteorological data e g temperature and precipitation we designed detailed experiments to explore the performance of dl models in glacio hydrology simulations the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows considering the actual simulation scenario we propose a multi task learning model called the exogenous regularization network ernet the model emphasizes the relationships between exogenous temperature and participation and endogenous runoff variables and introduces corresponding regularization terms into the loss function to improve the robustness we compared ernet with the basic stacked lstms model and the process based flex g model experiments showed that ernet compared with the other two models performed well in runoff and peak flow simulation and displayed superior capability in transferability tests considering the data driven nature of dl models we compared the importance of air temperature and precipitation in runoff simulations the results indicated that temperature plays a dominant role in predicting river runoff which is also consistent with the finding of previous studies according to the experimental results we provided some practical suggestions for the usage of dl models in glacier hydrology simulations in the next section the study site and dataset are introduced sections 3 and 4 describe the three models that we utilized and our experimental design in detail respectively in section 5 the performance of different models in experiments is assessed section 6 presents our discussions about experiments the conclusions are given in 7 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study catchment the urumqi river is an inland river in the middle of the northern slope of the tianshan mountains in central asia this river is fed by glacier and snow meltwater precipitation and groundwater moreover it is the head water for agricultural irrigation and domestic water in the region the urumqi no 1 glacier is located at the source of the urumqi river and it is also a representative glacier in central asia as denoted by the world glacier monitoring service wgms therefore studies of the no 1 glacier are of great societal significance glacier no 1 is a valley glacier with eastern and western branches ye et al 2005 the two branches have a combined area of approximately 1 84 km 2 are approximately 2 2 km long and are located between approximately 3740 and 4490 m a s l no 1 runoff station no 1 was established 200 m downstream from the end of the glacier at 3689 m a s l with a basin area of 3 34 km 2 and a glacier coverage rate of 52 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zong kong zk is another runoff gauge station located downstream of the no 1 runoff station it controls a basin area of 28 9 km 2 and the glacier coverage rate is 19 4 land cover in non glacial areas is predominantly bare soil rock and sparse grass which are seasonally covered by snow li et al 2010 gao et al 2014 fig 1 presents the basin maps and topography analyses of the two catchments where the two stations are located 2 2 datasets we collected daily meteorological and hydrological data from 1985 to 2005 temperature and precipitation were observed at the da xi gou dxg meteorological station which records the weather data for the urumqi river area the long term daily average temperature at dxg ranges from 5 1 c and 20 c in winter from june to august the temperature is higher than 0 c more than 90 of rainfall occurs from april to september runoff was gauged at both the no 1 and zk hydrological stations catchments the distance between dxg and two runoff stations is less than 3 km so we can use the data observed from dxg observations as the meteorological input for two runoff stations the topography data from a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dataset glacial area and distribution data were obtained from china s second glacier inventory liu et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 the stacked lstms model 3 1 1 the components of lstm during the training of traditional rnns as the training time and the number of network layers increase the exploding or vanishing gradient problem can easily occur which makes models unable to capture long term dependencies long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special variant of rnns that can effectively solve the above problems given a sequence of time series x t x 1 x 2 x 3 x t 2 x t 1 x t where x i r n lstm continuously process time series data by recurrent function f and generates the corresponding hidden state h

r m m and denotes element wise multiplication fig 2 a shows an intuitive understanding of lstm cell see fig 2 3 1 2 the stacked lstms model the depth of the network is regarded as one of the important reasons for the success of deep neural networks pascanu et al 2013 increasing the number of layers not only enriches the temporal flow of the model but also adds levels of abstraction for input observations over time brownlee 2017 in this study we adopted a stacked lstms model as the basic dl model for runoff simulation specifically a stacked lstm architecture can be defined as a model comprised of multiple lstm layers the hidden state of each step of the lstm layer below is fed into the lstm layer above and the final output is generated by the top lstm layer fig 2 b presents a stacked lstms model that includes two stacked layers we explore the effect of the number of stacked layers on model performance in section 4 1 1 3 2 exogenous regularization network ernet however it was not sufficient to simply apply basic dl models to glacio hydrology simulations we would like to build an efficient powerful and easy to understand model 3 2 1 the structure of parallel branch in the forecasting tasks exogenous variables are not affected by other factors in the system and are imposed in the model as inputs in contrast endogenous variables are those that are determined varian and varian 1992 for example in our forecasting scenario air temperature and precipitation are exogenous variables and runoff is the endogenous variable the difficulty in handling this type of task is that models need to simulate not only the auto correlation of every variable but also the temporal cross correlations between pairs of variables in this study we propose a new multi task learning mtl model called exogenous regularization network ernet which can simultaneously predict temperature precipitation and runoff as shown in parts b e of fig 3 ernet adopts a parallel dual branch structure and exogenous variables are separately input into independent branches to extract their temporal features since both branches employ the same processing approach we use x t i x t l 1 i x t l 2 i x t 1 i x t i to present inputting variables and i 1 or 2 3 x t 1 n i f c i l s t m i x t i where x t 1 n i denotes the output of part e and l s t m i and f c i denote the lstm and fully connected layers in part c and part e respectively in the final stage of ernet we utilize a fully connected layer to combine the outputs of two sublayers to generate the runoff simulation as shown in parts f g of fig 3 the model simultaneously generates the predictions for three variables in other words the forecasts for air temperature and precipitation are also incorporated into the model s optimization goals we present the specific optimization details in section 3 2 4 loss function from the task driven perspective ruder 2017 ernet provides an expansion from a single task model to a multi task model 3 2 2 autoregression effectively cope with peak values peak prediction or scale insensitivity is a common problem for neural networks due to the nonlinearity of recurrent components lai et al 2017 the routine solution is to decompose model into a linear part i e the autoregressive ar shumway et al 2000 and a non linear part i e neural network lai et al 2017 specifically the values of the input variable from a few previous steps are added through the ar model and the result is then input into the neural network through the highway srivastava et al 2015 we implement the ar model based on two exogenous variables as shown in part d of fig 3 the calculation process is as follows 4 x t 1 l i k 0 3 w i k a r x t k i b i a r x t 1 i x t 1 l i x t 1 n i where w a r r 3 and b a r r are the coefficients of the ar model in our case we chose the last three steps in the ar model and marked them with red rectangles in fig 3 the introduction of the ar model has three advantages by adding the nearest original input model can strengthen the memory of the latest short term trend in cases where there is a correlation between meteorological data and runoff if we can predict better meteorological trends it is bound for model to help predict runoff more accurate auxiliary task prediction would drop the weight of auxiliary tasks in the loss function prompting the model to pay more attention to the runoff prediction we do not fuse the temporal features of two branches until the results of the ar model are added as shown in fig 3 5 y t 1 f c c o n c a t x t 1 1 x t 1 2 where c o n c a t and f c denotes the vector concatenate and fully connected layer respectively in parts f g 3 2 3 the utilization of activation function considering the real situation we need to consider the following two points runoff and precipitation are nonnegative thus we must ensure that the simulation results of the model do not include negative values however the dl modelling process is implicit and the ultimate goal of optimization is to minimize the loss function in other words without appropriate constraints activation functions regularization etc as long as the total loss function decreases a dl model does not pay attention to the specific predicted value we solve the above problem by introducing the rectified linear unit relu function 6 f x x x 0 0 x 0 as shown in eq 6 the relu function is actually a piecewise linear function that converts all negative values to zero while positive values remain unchanged agarap 2018 we applied the relu function to the runoff and participation outputs to eliminate negative values 7 x ˆ t 1 1 r e l u x t 1 1 y ˆ t 1 r e l u y t 1 where x ˆ t 1 1 and y ˆ t 1 are the final predictions of precipitation and runoff respectively there is no threshold limit for the value of air temperature colder winters and hotter summers are possible in the future if we apply the relu function to air temperature it is equivalent to setting a minimum threshold for air temperature negative to zero which is obviously unreasonable the leaky relu agarap 2018 function is a variant of relu that assigns a nonzero slope α 0 01 to all negative values 8 f x x x 0 x α x 0 leaky relu inherits the advantages of relu in terms of feature sparsity and computational efficiency we applied the leaky relu to the air temperature output 9 x ˆ t 1 2 r e l u x t 1 2 where x ˆ t 1 2 is the final predictions of air temperature why is the relu function not directly applied in the stacked lstms the disadvantage of the relu function is that it is prone to the dead relu problem specifically when most neurons return an output of zero the gradients fail to flow during backpropagation and the weights are not updated ultimately a large part of the network becomes inactive and it is unable to learn agarap 2018 the stacked lstms model is a single output model with only one path used to update the gradient especially encountering the freezing period with zero runoff the model parameters and gradients are easily changes to zero once the gradient of the output is zero the entire network cannot be updated again in contrast ernet is an mtl model with a parallel branch structure which means that ernet has more paths to ensure the overall framework is updated we performed repeated experiments on the stacked lstms with the addition of relu function some of them did avoid negative values but others paralysed the model we also explored different ways to address the model instability such as decreasing learning rates and performing xavier initialization but both of these approaches only alleviated and could not eradicate the issue a good dl model should be stable but the stacked lstms model with the relu function fails to meet this requirement we also need to note that the combination of stacked lstms and relu function has very strong modelling capabilities just in our task scenario this combination cannot exert its true strength due to the long freezing period 3 2 4 new loss function e r l o s s in many forecasting tasks l 2 l o s s has been the preferred loss function used in the neural networks lara benítez et al 2021 as documented in eq 10 10 l 2 l o s s 1 t n 1 t y n y ˆ n 2 x n 1 x ˆ n 1 2 x n 2 x ˆ n 2 2 where y and x i denotes the ground truth and y ˆ and x ˆ i are the predicted value the disadvantage of l 2 l o s s is that there is that the three subtasks are assigned the same weight in parameter updating in other words the modelling ability of the network is evenly distributed over the three tasks however our main task is accurate runoff prediction therefore we propose a newly modified loss function that emphasizes the priority of tasks called e r l o s s 11 e r l o s s 1 t n 1 t y n y ˆ n 2 α x n 1 x ˆ n 1 2 β x n 2 x ˆ n 2 2 where α and β are the hyper parameters with α β 1 we determined the values of α and β by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient shumway et al 2000 12 ρ 1 i 1 t x i 1 x 1 y i y i 1 t x i 1 x 1 2 i 1 t y i y 2 ρ 2 i 1 t x i 2 x 2 y i y i 1 t x i 2 x 2 2 i 1 t y i y 2 α ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 β ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the coefficient between two input variables and runoff respectively such a design has the following benefits by incorporating input variables into loss functions we can enhance the extraction of temporal meteorological features with the network extracting meteorological features directly is challenging because runoff prediction involves the use of meteorological features in a complex way in contrast these features are easy to learn in auxiliary tasks because such tasks are directly responsible for meteorological prediction through mtl the main task can utilize the meteorological features extracted by the auxiliary tasks to help better simulate runoff ruder 2017 the auxiliary tasks act as additional regularization processes by introducing inductive bias ruder 2017 which can help ernet converge towards solutions that can explain multiple tasks at the same time and reduce the risk of overfitting this generalization capability also helps ernet better adapt to different catchments in transferability tests the loss function directly affects the parameter updating of the neural network goodfellow et al 2016 by weighting the loss items α and β of exogenous variables we can limit the effect of auxiliary tasks on the gradient descent process thus avoiding interference with the main task overall er loss can better balance the main task and auxiliary tasks 3 3 process based model flex g the flex g model has three modules including topography discretization and meteorological forcing interpolation module snow and glacier module and rainfall runoff module in the non glacial area the runoff from both glacial areas and non glacial areas is added to simulated runoff for the urumqi no 1 glacier basin 3 3 1 topography discretization and meteorological forcing interpolation module topographical factors have significant impacts on the distribution of glaciers and the corresponding energy budgets barry 1992 for example elevation and aspect can directly impact solar radiation which has the first order influence on the melting of ice and snow hock 2005 at different elevations and aspects the solar radiation area snow accumulation amount and meltwater volume also vary therefore we first discretized two nested catchments to perform the elevation classification the basins were divided into different elevation zones with 50 metre intervals in this study the no 1 and zk catchments were discretized into 16 and 21 evaluation bands respectively subsequently we further divided each elevation band into three different facing aspects north 315 45 south 135 225 and east west 45 135 and 225 315 aspects as shown in fig 1 in addition we considered the different runoff generation mechanisms of glacial and non glacial areas the no 1 and zk catchments were divided into 96 and 128 hydrological units respectively the lapse rates of air temperature and precipitation were set as 0 7 c 100 m and 5 100 m respectively which were used to interpolate the meteorological observations at 3539 m to different elevation zones 3 3 2 snow and glacier module 3 3 2 1 snowfall and rainfall separation and snowfall correction according to whether the daily air average temperature t is higher or lower than the threshold temperature t t c the precipitation is regarded as snowfall p s or rainfall p l eqs 13 and 14 chuntan et al 2010 13 p s p t t t 0 t t t 14 p l p t t t 0 t t t t t is a vital parameter for calibration berghuijs et al 2016 as it is directly used for the division of rainfall and snowfall according to gao et al 2017b we establish a wide range of t t 2 5 to 5 c for calibration snowfall measurement is affected by various systematic errors such as wind and evaporation loss goodison et al 1998 yang et al 2001 based on the field observations daqing et al 1988 concluded that for a given amount of snowfall the observed value is 0 765 times the true value in the urumqi no 1 glacier basin therefore the value of observed snowfall should be multiplied by 1 3 to correct the underestimation issue 3 3 2 2 snow and glacier melt simulation snow cover is considered a porous medium that can hold liquid meltwater rainfall the liquid water may be re frozen into ice therefore in the modelling process we conceptualized the solid snowpack s w and the liquid water inside the snowpack s w l into two separate reservoirs eqs 15 16 represent the water balance of s w and s w l reservoirs r r f mm d 1 indicates the refreezing water from s w l to s w and m s mm d 1 is the snowmelt p e mm d 1 is the effective precipitation from snowpack to the soil layer the calculation formula of these three variables is shown in eq 16 18 seibert et al 2018 gao et al 2020 f d d mm c d 1 is the degree day factor that is applied to calculate meltwater eqs 17 and 19 c w h is a certain fraction between s w l and s w below which threshold all meltwater is held in snowpack without runoff generation eq 17 f r r is a correction factor to model liquid water refreezing when the air temperature is below t t eq 19 since glaciers have a smaller albedo and larger amount of melt than snow even with the same air temperature glacier has larger degree day factor we utilized a correction factor c g to simulate the

and r u mm d 1 is the streamflow generated from the unsaturated reservoir eq 21 we applied the xinanjiang curve to further separate p e into retained water in s u and r u as shown in eq 22 zhao 1992 s

response and slow response respectively 23 d s f d t r f q f 24 d s s d t r s q s 25 q f s f k f 26 q s s s k s where k f d and k s d are the recession parameter of two linear reservoirs 4 experimental design we designed three major groups of experiments a comparison between dl lstm and ernet models and a process based flex g model an analysis of the importance of input variables model transferability testing experiments for all experiments we divided the first 50 of the data as a training set 1985 1995 and the remaining 50 of the data as a test set 1995 2005 some time periods in the test dataset have missing data 2000 2001 in no 1 1996 in zk and we excluded these abnormal data from the evaluation 4 1 group 1 comparison between dl models and process based model in this group of experiments we compared the performance of three models that use precipitation and temperature as inputs to simulate runoff in both the no 1 and zk catchments flex g also used the topographical data 4 1 1 hyper parameter configuration of the data driven models 4 1 1 1 problem formulation in previous big data studies kratzert et al 2019 feng et al 2020a b the inputs to lstm included time series of atmospheric inputs and static basin attributes for data collected from hundreds of basins however there is no large dataset such as catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels to adequately describe the behaviours and characteristics of various glaciers the existing data for the urumqi glacier were the culmination of the hard work of generations of scientists under very difficult situations considering the availability of data and the concept of fair comparison with flex g the only viable option was to use air temperature and precipitation to simulate the river runoff given two sets of input time series x i x 1 i x 2 i x t 1 i x t i x k i r i 1 o r 2 we aimed to predict output series y y 1 y 2 y t 1 y t y t r through x i in a moving simulating fashion specifically to predict y t 1 we assume x t i x t l 1 i x t l 2 i x t i are available and l represents the length of moving window likewise if we predict the value of y t 2 we assume x t 1 i x t l 2 i x t l 3 i x t 1 i are available fig 4 graphically illustrates the problem formulation 4 1 1 2 length of input window selecting the right window size is vital but difficult for forecasting models especially for dl models hewamalage et al 2021 the stacked lstms model in this study was constructed with a hybrid input approach without subbranches therefore we need to achieve a compromise between the window sizes of the two variables to ensure that the input lengths of the variables are consistent we calculated the temporal lagged cross correlation tlcc which measures the relationship between the input and target variable in two stations boyd 2001 podobnik et al 2010 according to table 1 we found that except for the precipitation in no 1 the other three results all show that the cross correlation with runoff is highest when the lag is zero we also calculated the partial auto correlation function pacf of input variables as shown in fig 5 the pacf measures the relationship between x t 1 i and x t i in the case of removing lag 1 2 l 1 s effect on x t i considering the synchronization between x i and y we argue that if x t l i has an effect on the x t i x t l i also has an effect on y t considering the tlcc and pacf confidence interval 95 simultaneously we chose the 10 and 12 days as the window sizes for the no 1 and zk stations respectively for the convenience of comparison although ernet supports input variables with different window sizes with its parallel structure we adopted the same window size setting for ernet as used for the stacked lstms model to ensure the fairness of comparison 4 1 1 3 optimization of network structure network structure such as hidden layers and neurons has an important impact on the experimental performance greff et al 2016 according to brownlee 2017 the stacked lstms model only needs 1 3 layers to show powerful performance and too many parameters can easily lead to overfitting we performed a grid search goodfellow et al 2016 to determine the optimal structure of the stacked lstms and the performances with different structures are shown in table 2 to avoid overreliance on the results of one experiment we repeated the experiment ten times and selected the best metrics as the final experimental result there are two notable points to our approach 1 we chose adam optimizer for optimization bianchi et al 2017 and 2 we chose the min max scaler for the normalization function 27 min max x x min x max x min x similarly we also did a grid search for ernet the best configuration of hyper parameters about lstm and ernet can be found in table 3 4 1 2 experimental setup of flex g model we employed precipitation temperature and topography as the input forcing of the flex g model which has 13 free parameters to be calibrated we applied the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 2014 to calibrate parameters by data from calibrating sets as shown in table 4 to ensure accurate and efficient modelling we also set a prior range of parameters for monte carlo sampling in glue method with reference to gao et al 2017a glue runs the flex g model 200 000 times on training sets and we selected the parameters from the top one percentile sets as behavioural parameters 200 parameter sets based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse then we applied the 200 parameter sets in the model and ran the test sets to obtain the simulated hydrological output finally we weighed the four metrics namely the pearson correlation coefficient corr root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nse and obtained the best testing results 4 2 group 2 experimental analysis of the importance of input variable in this group of experiments to explore the relationship among precipitation air temperature and runoff we added two experiments based on stacked lstms using precipitation as an input to simulate runoff denoted as lstms p and using temperature as an input to simulate runoff denoted as lstms t we adjusted the hidden dimensions of the two models so that they had similar numbers of parameters as did the stacked lstms the time window sizes for precipitation at the two stations were 10 and 12 days respectively and the time window sizes for air temperature at the two stations were 10 days 4 3 group 3 model transferability test experiments in this group of experiments we tested the transferability of the three models our experimental design motivations are described as follows transfer learning which transfers the model that is trained based on a source to a new task is one of the frontiers in dl limited by climatic geographical and historical conditions it is difficult and expensive to conduct long term observational surveys in a glacierized basins many regions or basins do not have enough historical observation data to train dl models therefore in this case the transferability test is particularly important for studying poorly unmeasured or ungauged basins transferring the model trained with information from data rich regions into other regions can alleviate the problem caused by data shortages the transferability of hydrological models has been regarded as a major challenge for the hydrological community hrachowitz et al 2013 biondi and de luca 2017 according to gao et al 2017a b the calibrated flex g model can be robustly transferred and up scaled to a larger catchment without re calibration this powerful transfer modelling capability has become one the key advantages of the flex g model hence for comparison dl models should be designed with similar transferability tests for comparison we utilized the model trained based on zk to predict the runoff value for no 1 additionally the model trained based on no 1 was transferred to predict runoff for zk as the two catchments utilized the same meteorological data it would be unreasonable to conduct transferability tests for dl models based on group 1 if these tests were to be conducted the forecasted runoff of the dl models trained based on no 1 and tested at zk would actually be the forecasted runoff at no 1 rather than zk therefore we designed a new set of experiments for the dl models using precipitation temperature and runoff to predict runoff thus we can ensure that the parameters of the model are trained based on the unique characteristics of the catchment we denoted the experiments as lstms and ernet respectively the transferability experiments are described as follows 6 lstms t the transferability test of lstm based on lstms 7 ernet t the transferability test of ernet based on ernet and 8 flex g t the transferability test of flex g based on flex g in group 1 we organized the eight experiments in a tabular format for a clear understanding of the experimental design as shown in table 5 4 4 performance metrics we used four performance metrics to evaluate the quality of the simulation results and these metrics are defined as follows pearson correlation coefficient corr 28 r i 1 t y i y y ˆ i y ˆ i 1 t y i y 2 i 1 t y ˆ i y ˆ 2 root mean square error rmse 29 r m s e 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 mean absolute error mae 30 m a e 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 31 n s e 1 i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 t y i y 2 where y and y ˆ are the ground truth and predicted value respectively y is the average of the data set for rmse and mae the lower the value is the better performance is in contrast for corr and nse the higher the value the better performance is and the more accurate y ˆ predicted runoff is 5 results 5 1 comparisons with performance metrics in section 5 1 1 first we compare the performance of three models in group 1 second we discuss the importance of the input variables in group 2 experiments involving group 3 which involves transferability tests are presented in section 5 1 3 5 1 1 comparison between three models in this section we evaluated the results of the training and testing sets to reveal more details table 6 shows how the three models performed for the training and testing sets we have plotted the overall prediction results for the testing set in fig 6 to assess the performance of the three models several important observations are worth highlighting first the performances of the three models based on the testing set can be ranked as follows ernet blue lines flex g green lines stacked lstms orange lines especially for the two metrics used to measure simulation error rmse and mae the newly proposed ernet had some advantages the stacked lstm model even predicted negative streamflow fig 6 a i which does not exist in the real world in contrast our newly proposed ernet not only avoided negative values but also performed better notably it correctly predicted the runoff during the freezing periods as zero while flex g predicted some very small positive values furthermore to statistically assess the validity of ernet we applied the rmse as the sample indicator and performed a two sample t test between ernet and the other two models at the 5 significance level the testing results and small p values indicated that ernet achieved statistically significant improvements over the stacked lstms and flex g in addition overall the three models performed better for the training set than for the testing set we can explain the difference in the performance of the dl model on the training and testing sets from the perspective of distribution in dl models ideally both the training sets and testing sets should obey the same data distribution that is 32 x t r a i n y t r a i n x t e s t y t e s t i i d f x y based on this assumption dl models learn the joint probability distribution from the training set and apply it to the testing set 33 p t r a i n x y p t r a i n x p t r a i n y x p t e s t x y p t r a i n x y p t e s t x however in reality changes in various factors in the external environment may cause this hypothesis to be invalid especially when the training set consists of past data and the test set consists of current data due to this temporal difference the sets may not have the same distribution p t r a i n x p t e s t x b u t p t r a i n x p t e s t x thus the dl model does not perform as well for the test set as it does for the training set we also observed that stacked lstms performed best for the training set but worst for the test set this difference can also be explained from the perspective of distribution in our simulation scenario the amount of data used in the training set was not large data spanning only 3835 days with this amount of data the distribution of the training set may not fully reflect the true distribution the distribution of the test set when the stacked lstms overlearned the distribution of the training set it was far from the distribution of the test set resulting in inaccurate predictions the design of ernet can compensate for this shortcoming two auxiliary tasks can be seen as two regularizations penalties that constrain the network and avoid network overlearning for training sets thereby improving the generalization ability of the model therefore ernet displayed average performance for the training set but it performed the best for the test set flex g adds some physical constraints to ensure that the model can be generalized when possible changes occur from this perspective the approach adopted in flex g and ernet is essentially the same they are better constrained and better suited for this limited data scenario in addition flex g model is based on explicit physical processes and mathematical derivations while dl models simulate a complex non linear function based on an implicit black box process however in some transitions between thawing and freezing periods as shown in the green dotted boxes of fig 6 b i the three models yield almost identical simulations of trends this similarity illustrates that although the concepts of the two types of models are different the functions simulated by dl models may be consistent with the functions that we constructed based on expert knowledge during some periods model interpretability has always been the focus of dl exploration and these small details are helpful for us to further assessing dl models in future studies considering the effect of the simulations in the freezing period on the evaluation metrics we have also performed the predictive comparison of the three models regarding the ablation periods including two comparison schemes first referring to the true freezing periods we set the corresponding parts of the predicted values of the three models to zero and re evaluated the predictions as recorded in table 7 after assuming that all models can simulate the freezing period correctly the evaluation metrics of the three experiments improved to varying degrees but the order of predictive performance for the three models did not change whether for the freezing period or the thawing period ernet s predictions are better than those of the other two models the gap between the stacked lstm and flex g narrowed but overall flex g still performed better than the stacked lstm second we presented the forecasted and observed daily runoff in the thawing period through scatter plots fig 7 by performing simple linear regression overall the ernet model still performed best with the blue line plotting closest to the red line flex g performed slightly better than the stacked lstm however in fig 7 we can observe that it is easy for ernet to directly predict some small positive runoff values as zero values especially at the zk station we think this issue may be related to the relu function but it is difficult to fully understand why we will try to compensate for this shortcoming in future work 5 1 2 the importance of forcing variables a comparison of stacked lstms in group 2 was conducted and the performance was ranked as follows lstms p precipitation as the input lstms t temperature as the input lstms precipitation and temperature as inputs this ranking illustrates that the choice of forcing variables is important for dl models according to the knowledge of glacier hydrology and table 1 we know that both precipitation and temperature are positively correlated with runoff the used of more effective variables usually results in the inclusion more information and more accurate forecasting results therefore it is reasonable that the lstms model performs than lstms p and lstms t the respective runoff simulation obtained with the two meteorological variables are more noteworthy compared with the lstms p the nse of the lstms t increased by 263 84 and 64 40 in the two stations which indicates that the air temperature data are more important for predicting runoff than are the precipitation data the tlcc values in table 1 also confirm this finding notably at the two stations the correlation coefficient of temperature is much higher than that of precipitation as shown in fig 8 the results of lstms p cyan lines are quite different from the true values in terms of the overall numerical interval and trend while lstms t dark magenta lines can roughly simulate the true value trend especially in certain transition periods between freezing and ablation lstms and lstms t exhibit the same trend this result suggests that changes in temperature can lead to changes in glacier melt which in turn affects the runoff of the urumqi river this conclusion is consistent with those of previous researchers who analysed the hydrological characteristics of the urumqi river in alpine glacier regions the increase in temperature has a major effect on the variation in glacier melt runoff wu et al 2006 through the conclusions regarding the importance of variables we can explain why the corr and nse results obtained for the no 1 catchment are better than those for the zk catchment while the rmse and mae values are higher than those in the zk catchment as shown in table 6 rmse and mae are related to the availability of catchment data as noted in section 2 1 the glacier area in the no 1 catchment is larger than that in the zk catchment no 1 55 vs zk 21 as we previously mentioned temperature has a direct effect on glacial meltwater thus the temperature has a more significant impact on the no 1 runoff simulation and leads to greater runoff 5 1 3 comparison of the model transferability the results of transferability test are illuminating compared with those for the lstms and ernet the forecasting results of the lstms and ernet are significantly improved the prediction results of the model are related not only to the ability of the model itself but also to the input of the model proper input and appropriate operation can make the model s predictions more accurate and effective in addition the forecasting results of ernet especially for corr also show the effectiveness of the structural design of the ernet model we calculated the percentage drop in model prediction performance before and after the transfer rather than by directly comparing the original values as shown in table 8 we discovered that after the transferability test the forecasting results of the three models declined to varying degrees the decline in performance of the models is explainable for both catchments the joint distributions learned by the models are different p t r a i n n o 1 x y p t r a i n z k x y as the runoff topography data for two catchments are different p t r a i n n o 1 y x p t r a i n z k y x if the models are employed for the transferability test it is equivalent to 34 p t e s t n o 1 y x p t r a i n z k x y p t e s t n o 1 x p t e s t z k y x p t r a i n n o 1 x y p t e s t z k x hence the accuracy of the model results declined in the transferability test although flex g is a process based model that uses parameters with clear physical meaning in essence the calibration of these parameters is still based on the training data therefore the above reasons given for the decline in the dl results from the perspective of conditional probability are also applicable for flex g taking the nse as an example the forecasting results of stacked lstms ernet and flex g for no 1 decreased by 4 75 1 27 and 2 69 respectively and those for zk decreased by 7 73 3 00 and 3 50 respectively according to the percentage decrease in nse from small to large the order is ernet flex g stacked lstms because the inputs to the models are slightly different during transfer testing we cannot directly assert that the transferability of ernet is necessarily better than that of flex g but at the least these models achieve a significant improvement compared to the stacked lstms the reason why ernet is more robust than stacked lstms is the extension of the multitask model and the modification of the loss function specifically ernet adopts a parallel branching structure for the input of the network which means the feature extraction of variables is independent thus although the branch responsible for runoff may not be able to adequately adapt to new runoff the two branches responsible for meteorology are still feasible in contrast stacked lstms have only a single path and the model parameters are trained based on mixed input variables therefore the transfer of runoff has a greater impact on the performance of the stacked lstms in addition the loss function of ernet includes penalty terms for exogenous variables which effectively improves the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model 5 1 4 forecasting errors of peak flow forecasting peak flow is important in runoff prediction glacial melting and heavy rain in a short period of time can cause peak flow based on group 1 we identified the top 12 days with the largest runoff in each year in the testing set and showed the results in the table 9 we adopted absolute relative error are as the main metric to evaluate the performance of the two models 35 a r e y ˆ y y where y and y ˆ are the true value and predicted value respectively of the dataset considering the mean are as the indicator flex g displayed the best fitting in the no 1 catchment flex g 5 vs ernet 4 ernet displayed the best performance in the zk catchment but its superiority was not as significant as observed for flex g in no 1 ernet 6 flex g 2 and stacked lstms 2 according to the are results ernet and flex g are comparable in terms of capturing peaks and significantly outperform the stacked lstm model the input of a large amount of training data can ensure that the models correctly predict the overall trend and seasonal trends but a sudden change in the data cannot be well captured from the perspective of the gaussian distribution peak values are usually plotted to the left of the distribution which means that the corresponding probability is low this is largely why peak flow is difficult to simulate in the forecasting problems peak forecasting is usually classified as the problem of scale insensitivity which means that neural networks cannot effectively capture the scales of output changes especially for the task of predicting endogenous variables by exogenous variables scale capturing would become more difficult as shown in the grey dotted box of fig 6 b ii the stacked lstms simulation orange line scale is larger than the real value range i e the peak flow simulation is larger than the real value and the low flow prediction is smaller than the real value however our newly proposed ernet blue line is better adapted to scale changes than lstm this result is also shown in fig 7 especially in regard to the no 1 catchment compared with the other models the prediction of the stacked lstms model is significantly more concentrated in the area of y x we marked them with a brown box in contrast ernet obtains a better forecasting result of peak values which proves that the synergy of multi task and autoregression in ernet is effective 5 2 comparison of time consumption the goal of our comparison among the three models is to create practical applications for runoff simulation in cases with glacial rivers therefore the time required for the training and analysis of the three models is also something that we need to consider all flex g models were run on a workstation with an intel r xeon r cpu e5 1620 v4 3 5 ghz with 16 0 gb ram the experimental result obtained was the result over 200 000 iterations which required an hour and a half to complete we also conducted dl experiments on the same cpu for stacked lstms each epoch took only 0 782 s to process and model convergence was achieved after 300 epochs the entire training and testing process for one model took 235 s although the ernet model is more complex than the other models the total time required to achieve model convergence was only approximately 245 s the dl results in table 5 were the best results obtained over ten repeated experiments which took less than 40 min in total if a gpu were used to accelerate the running of dl models the time required for model training and testing would be reduced overall dl models require less time than flex g models 6 discussion 6 1 the discussion of models performance the performance of all models was encouraging and in terms of model performance ernet flex g lstm in this section we discuss the performance of the models and the causes of differences in performance first we argue that compared with the stacked lstms the effectiveness of ernet is due to the following three points the extension of the single task model to a multi task model by introducing exogenous variables into the prediction task loss function the model is incentivized to better extract the temporal characteristics of exogenous variables the modification of the loss function by weighting the sub loss functions of different tasks the primary and secondary tasks are clarified this approach not only balances the role of exogenous variables in the prediction task but also alleviates the overfitting problem that is prone to occur in small data scenarios the utilization of the activation function considering the real world conditions we add different activation functions at the output thus avoiding some unreasonable situations such as negative runoff second although the ernet model performs better than flex g this does not mean that process based models such as flex g are obsolete through this work we discover that data driven and process based models have distinct advantages in applications in the field of glacier hydrology flex g and other process based models are established based on field investigations scientific analyses and objective summaries by many scientific predecessors compared with dl models process based models are more explanatory and each step in the models has clear physical meaning this is of great reference significance for future improvements to dl models finally the stacked lstm model displayed inferior performance in the glacio hydrology simulation comparison but we need to clarify the following two points we cannot arbitrarily attribute this inferior performance to the capability of the stacked lstm model in fact some studies have revealed that even simple stacked lstms can handle many complex tasks greff et al 2016 as we mentioned above the performance of the stacked lstm model may be related to the model overfitting caused by the small data volume although ernet adopts a branch structure each branch is still based on stacked lstms thus stacked lstms are powerful for feature extraction as shown in table 8 if mitigate the limitations of flexg and add runoff as an input the forecasting results of the stacked lstms are quite good this finding indicates that stacked lstms can perform well with the appropriate inputs in short if researchers are familiar with dl models they can be effectively modified according to the needs of specific tasks and applied otherwise process based models may be more suitable for researchers if researchers do not know much about dl or glacial hydrology a stacked lstm as a basic dl model is a good choice 6 2 limitations and future study we observed that regardless of the model there was a certain delay in the prediction especially in some transitions between thawing and freezing periods for example as presented in fig 6 a ii and fig 6 b i although the runoff true value had changed obviously there was a corresponding lag in recognition in the model on the scale of a few days in other words these models are insensitive to the seasonal changes we initially believe that this may be related to the size of the sliding time window in the model the relationship between air temperature and runoff and other factors these speculations require extensive and detailed experiments to demonstrate and we will further analyse them in future studies in addition determining how to use spatial data is also our focus in the future the topographic data that flexg utilizes or that we currently have are very sparse point like data representing elevation and orientation in the two catchments in other words these data can be considered constant factors for each catchment we have not developed a feasible way to integrate them into dl models at present utilizing long term satellite images may be a viable approach to represent dynamically changing topography and dynamic glacier data in addition if we compile a database for the world s glaciers there is a high likelihood that model performance could be enhanced through a data synergy effect fang et al 2021 dl models can be pretrained with information from data intensive regions and then transferred to data scarce regions to improve dl models can be pretrained with information from data intensive regions and then transferred to data scarce regions to improve modelling performance this approach is better than only training a model with local data in data scarce regions finally textbfa hybrid model incorporating a process based model and deep learning model is likely promising for further improving model predictions and the overall understanding of glacierized basins in some fields work has been performed to introduce physical processes into deep learning models such as the solving differential equations sde lu et al 2019 physics informed neural networks pinns meng et al 2020 and decent results have been achieved if some explanatory physical processes can be incorporated into dl the results of glacier simulations could be improved 7 conclusions in this paper we pioneer the application of dl models in the field of glacio hydrology a robust multi task learning model is developed and applied to simulate the glacial meltwater ernet utilizes a parallel recurrent component to process exogenous variables respectively and modifies the loss function to balance the roles of different variables the ernet model is verified for daily runoff forecasting at two stations on the urumqi no 1 glacier we compared the ernet model with a basic dl model stacked lstms and a process based hydrological model flex g in daily runoff simulation the experimental results indicate that the ernet model performs well in base flow prediction peak capturing and transferability test between different stations especially in the comparison of the first two terms ernet performs better than the other two models the key to ernet s success stems from the exploitation the correlations between exogenous and endogenous variables and a subsequent balanced weighting approach proper input and appropriate operations can enhance model effectiveness and accuracy since there are many similar simulation scenarios in the hydrological community researchers can also use the parallel branch and multi task concepts similar to those applied in ernet to build their own models and handle related tasks finally ernet still has room for improvement such as in terms of seasonal insensitivity utilization of spatial data and integration of physical processes we will try to address these issues in future studies credit authorship
