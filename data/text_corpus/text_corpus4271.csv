asymmetrical actuator saturation and unknown dynamics first some control preliminaries and assumptions along with auv kinematic kinetic models and trajectory tracking problems are elaborated secondly the tracking error model and tracking guidance law are derived based on the theory of relative motion and the principle of approach angle respectively then the kinematic controller is designed by using the backstepping technique and lyapunov theory similarly auv kinetic controller is designed by using the nn compensation and adaptive estimation techniques which is termed as nn based adaptive controller nnac pertinently a novel bounded saturation function has been developed to describe the unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation the nn is adopted to approximate the complex auv hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities the bound of the generalized disturbance which is composed of nn approximation error and ocean disturbances are approximated based on the adaptive estimation technique to analyze the stability of the developed nnac lyapunov theory and backstepping technique are utilized by considering the control actions on different saturation sections finally effectiveness and superiority of the proposed nnac are validated through two sets of comparative simulation studies keywords trajectory tracking under actuated auv adaptive neural network control asymmetrical actuator saturation approach angle 1 introduction in the past several decades auvs have become the effective tools for ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific defense commercial applications such as oil gas exploration marine geosciences and offshore industry shi et al 2017 zereik et al 2018 however there is much work still to be done to develop the smarter auvs by addressing the complexities related to the internal electromechanical systems unpredictable oceanic environment where these auvs can move flexibly and acquire requisite scientific data precisely on both temporal and spatial scales lapierre and soetanto 2007 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 yu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 motion control of the underactuated auvs become more challenging due to the unpredictable complex oceanic environment and auvs complex electromechanical systems shi et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which mainly includes 1 highly nonlinear and inherently coupled dynamics 2 parametric uncertainties caused by poor knowledge of the hydrodynamic coefficients 3 unpredictable external disturbances 4 underactuation of the vehicle except the underactuated characteristics of vehicles the above mentioned challenges can be broadly categorized as uncertainties and nonlinearities additionally dead zone selmic and lewis 2000 time delay huang and lewis 2003 saturation zheng and feroskhan 2017 li et al 2019 and unknown dynamics von ellenrieder 2019 yu et al 2020 as type of uncertainties and nonlinearities for the actuators of auv are also required to be addressed in order to address these challenges various neural network based control schemes have been proposed with respective specific applications and assumptions in handling uncertainties and nonlinearities neural network and fuzzy logic system with the ability of universal approximation for unknown dynamics and functions wang and mendel 1992 park and sandberg 1991 have shown excellent performance for development of motion control system of auvs peng et al 2015 li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in particular the practicability of neural network in auvs motion control has already been validated experimentally lorentz and yuh 1996 in chen et al 2014 for a class of uncertain strict feedback nonlinear systems a dynamic surface control scheme is designed by using the radial basis function rbf neural network to approximate the unknown system function a reinforcement learning based control scheme is designed in cui et al 2017 for discrete evaluation functions moreover an adaptive neural network control scheme is designed for multiple agents to synchronize trajectory tracking cui et al 2012 a projection neural network is employed in peng et al 2019 to optimize the reference governor in real time which bridges the kinematic guidance loop and kinetic control loop by computing optimal guidance signals within the velocity and input constraints a new recurrent neural network predictive feedback control structure is designed in huang and lewis 2003 for a class of uncertain nonlinear dynamic time delay systems where the recurrent neural network is adopted to approximate the dynamics of the time delay free nonlinear plant a neural networks based compensation scheme is designed for a general nonlinear actuator with unknown dead zone width selmic and lewis 2000 in which two different neural networks have been employed to construct the compensators i e one is used to estimate the unknown dead zone and the other is used to provide adaptive compensation in the feed forward channel actuator saturation as one of the typical nonlinearities can affect the control system s performance and even result in overall system s instability therefore actuator saturation has attained significant attention from the researchers and thorough literature review reveals that there are two major available schemes to address this nonlinearity i e saturated function approximation and the other is nonlinearity compensation for the former method the logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent t a n h functions namely s functions are widely applied to approximate the symmetrical non smooth saturation in wen et al 2011 for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems a smooth t a n h function is adopted to approximate the non smooth function and the bound of saturation is known a t a n h based saturation function is designed in rezazadegan et al 2015 to keep control signals bounded for the latter method a fuzzy logic system and neural networks are applicable to compensate for the saturation in yu et al 2020 an adaptive fuzzy compensator is introduced to compensate control truncation between the unsaturated and saturated inputs most of the above control schemes are proposed based on two critical assumptions which are symmetrical actuator saturation and given bounds of the saturation for auvs actuated with stern control fins such as cross type and x type rudders the actuating mechanism of control fins can interfere with each other and may result in asymmetrical actuators saturation moreover the asymmetric saturation may also be encountered when the actuators have partial loss of effectiveness failures chu et al 2020 in zheng et al 2017 a trajectory tracking control scheme for a marine surface vessel with asymmetric actuators saturation is designed by constructing a asymmetric smooth function based on the known upper and lower bounds underactuation is a common research topic for path following and trajectory tracking of under actuated marine vehicles which includes auvs surface vehicles and others trajectory tracking problem is different from path following as specific temporal specification is required for trajectory tracking lapierre and soetanto 2007 zheng et al 2017 guidance law plays an important role in dealing with the underactuated problems line of sight los is one of the most popular method and there are various derivatives of guidance law which are based on conventional los guidance law borhaug et al 2008 liu et al 2017 integral los ilos was proposed to counteract constant and irrotational ocean currents in the kinematic level borhaug et al 2008 further the concept of ilos is widely used in different underwater vehicles with experimental validations caharija et al 2016 kelasidi et al 2017 types of modified guidance laws is designed for surface vehicles to compensate the ocean currents by estimating the sideslip angle liu et al 2017 miao et al 2017 yu et al 2019 in liu et al 2017 a reduced order extended state observer is designed to identify the sideslip angle caused by constant oceanic disturbances which is applied to revise conventional los guidance law moreover in yu et al 2019 extended state observers are applied to estimate the surge and sway velocities to indirectly identify the side slip angle which is utilized to compensate the los guidance law the side slip angle compensation based los guidance law is applicable for surface vehicles due to that the position signal can be obtained precisely with low coast sensors the concept of approach angle was first proposed on unicycle type and two steering wheels mobile robots and transferred to deal with the path following problem of underactuated auvs in lapierre and soetanto 2007 this paper presents an adaptive neural network based control scheme for diving trajectory tracking of underactuated auv subject to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and environment disturbances to the best of author s knowledge based on extensive literature review the contributions of this work can be divided into following three parts 1 a new saturation function restricted in 0 1 is constructed to describe the asymmetrical actuator saturation with unknown bounds the proposed saturated control scheme can efficiently deal with the interference design and partial failure of actuation mechanisms 2 to address the chattering of control behavior which resulted from complex high order derivative calculation a nn based control law is proposed to online approximate kinetic parameters and high order differentials the proposed control scheme does not require any knowledge of auv parameters 3 the bound of the generalized disturbance is compensated with the adaptive estimation technique which ensures that the related tracking errors converge to zero the generalized disturbance is composed of oceanic disturbance nn approximation error and un modeled dynamics the layout of this paper is organized as under in section 2 some control preliminaries notations and assumptions are explained additionally auvs modeling asymmetrical actuator saturation trajectory tracking mission have also been illustrated in this section in section 3 the framework of the trajectory tracking control scheme is introduced where the diving trajectory tracking error model is derived based on the theory of relative motion afterwards the kinematic controller is designed by using the backstepping technique which is followed by the design of kinetic pitch and surge controllers by considering the unknown asymmetrical saturated actuator dynamics and unknown external disturbance in section 4 the pseudo code of the proposed control scheme and simulation environment are explained two sets of comparative numerical studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed trajectory tracking control scheme concluding remarks are summarized in section 5 2 preliminaries and problem statement 2 1 preliminaries and notations lemma 1 barbalat s

defined as 2 w arg min sup w t ξ x f x 2 2 problem formulation for underactuated auvs which are actuated with main propeller and stern control fins the kinematic and kinetic equations in the vertical profile can be formulated as 3 η r θ υ m υ c υ d υ g υ τ τ e with auv position and posture vector η x z θ t velocity vector υ u w q t and transformation matrix r θ cos θ sin θ 0 sin θ cos θ 0 0 0 1 the vector τ e τ d u τ d w τ d q t represent the external disturbances force and moments the inertial matrix m coriolis centripetal matrix c damping matrix d and hydrostatic force vector g are given

remark a the kinetic model in eq 3 can be rewritten as 5 u f u g u n p 2 d u w f w g w δ s d w q f q g q δ s d q where f u f w and f q are smooth functions depending on auv hydrodynamics d u d w and d

the above functions and parameters are unknown so as to get rid of the dependence on the accurate auv kinetic model remark b by considering the additional effect of control surfaces on surge direction the nominal surge control force should be modified as τ u f p x u u δ s δ s u u δ s 2 taking the delphine2 auv as an example tanakitkorn et al 2017 a set of comparative cases is shown in table 1 in

required to be equal under unknown position restriction cases remark d let us define a reference trajectory which is propagated based on a time dependent variable ϖ t and denote the virtual tracking target on the path as o p x p z p the reference route angle can be denoted as 7 θ p arctan z p x p with δ d δ ϖ t d t and δ x p z p and it is noted that the velocity of the virtual tracking point can be expressed as u p x p 2 z p 2 as shown in fig 2 the vectorial tracking error between auv and the virtual target o p in the serret frenet frame x s f o p z s f can be deducted as 8 d v x e z e θ e r z θ p x x p z z p θ v θ d with matrix r z θ p cos θ p sin θ p 0 sin θ p cos θ p 0 0 0 1 and elevation angle θ v θ α with the angle of attack α tan 1 w u where the position error in vertical profile is defined as d x e z e 0 t the control objective in this paper is to design protocols n p δ s for main propeller and stern control fins with respect to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and

weight w is bounded and the approximation error is bounded with unknown bound d ε 0 namely ε x d ε 3 main results the structure of the neural network based trajectory tracking control scheme is depicted in fig 1 the proposed nnac scheme consists of two parts kinematic control scheme and kinetic control scheme the detailed design of the trajectory tracking control scheme is described in the following subsections 3 1 tracking error coordinates to describe the vehicle motion in different coordinates we define coordinate frames in vertical profile as shown in fig 2 and table 2 the serret frenet frame defines the virtual tracking point on the reference trajectory as its origin where the position tracking error vector is expressed with d as shown in fig 2 for conventional los guidance law taking the case of vertical profile example the desired heading of the vehicle can be described as 9 θ l o s tan 1 z e δ where the looking ahead distance δ 0 is constant z e is the cross tracking error and θ l o s π 2 π 2 a desired approach angle based guidance law is introduced into path tracking lapierre and soetanto 2007 10 θ a p p θ a e k θ z e 1 e k θ z e 1 where θ a 0 π 2 is the maximal approach angle and k θ 0 is a constant to determine the approaching speed it is noted that z e θ a p p z e 0 for all z e r and θ a p p θ a θ a from the relative motion theory the absolute velocity of the auv in i can be derived as 11 d o b d t i d o p d t i i f r 1 d d d t f w f d where the first term on the right side represent the relative velocity of the vectorial target o p in i the last term is the relative velocity of the auv in f the rotation transformation matrix from i to f is defined as i f r r o p θ p the absolute velocity of d can be synthesized as 12 d d d t i d o b d t i d o f d

kinematic model of auv in eq 3 and corresponding tracking errors in eqs 8 16 under approach angle based guidance law in eq 10 kinematic control law in eq 17 drive tracking error d v asymptotically to 0 proof consider a candidate lyapunov function as 18 v s y s a p p 1 2 θ e θ a p p 2 then 19 v s y s a p p θ e θ a p p θ e θ a p p by substituting eqs 16 17 into above equation one can obtains 20 v s y s a p p k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 0 since θ e and θ a p p are bounded and v s y s a p p is positive and monotonically decreasing therefore lim t v s y s a p p t exists and is finite moreover since v s y s a p p 2 k 1 v s y s a p p 4 k 1 2 v s y s a p p thus v s y s a p p exists and is finite and v s y s a p p is uniformly continuous then an application of barbalat s lemma allows for the conclusion that lim t v s y s a p p t 0 the system is asymptotically converging to a compact set e defined by v s y s a p p 0 consequently variables z e and θ e are bounded then choose a new lyapunov function candidate as follows 21 v s y s 1 v s y s a p p 1 2 x e 2 z e 2 by differentiating v s y s 1 one can obtain 22 v s y s 1 k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 x e x e z e z e by substituting eqs 16 17 into above equation one can obtains 23 v s y s 1 k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 k 2 x e 2 v t z e sin θ a p p it is noted that z e sin θ a p p 0 z e r arranging eq 23 yields 24 v s y s 1 0 considering the differential of v s y s 1 in eq 23 v s y s 1 is bounded then barbalat s lemma allows for the conclusion that lim t v s y s 1 t 0 this in turn implies that all trajectories in the compact set e satisfy lim t x e z e θ e 0 we now apply lasalle s invariance principle let ω r 2 be a compact set the validation on the lyapunov function candidate v s y s a p p shown that every solution starting in ω asymptotically converge to the compact set e the validation on v s y s 1 shown that the largest invariant set of e is m x e z e θ e 0 then every bounded solution starting in ω converges to 0 as t hence based on the guidance law and kinematics controller in eqs 10 17 we have lim t x e z e θ e 0 3 3 kinetic pitch controller redefine the saturation function as follows 25 υ δ s s a t δ s δ s δ s u δ s δ s u δ s 1 δ s l δ s δ s u δ s

therefore the kinematic and kinetic tracking errors are asymptotically stable namely lim t d v 0 and lim t q e 0 3 4 kinetic surge controller by defining the surge velocity error as u e u d u design

firstly the pseudo code of the nnac controller auv model parameters and reference trajectory have been provided secondly for the first comparative study the vehicle is desired to depart from different initial position with unknown asymmetrical saturations thirdly for the second comparative study the performance of the sliding mode controller smc without saturation model based indirect fuzzy logical controller and the proposed nnac controller with saturations are compared 4 1 implementation of trajectory tracking algorithm according to the trajectory tracking control block diagram in fig 1 kinematic and kinetic control schemes in section 3 the trajectory tracking control algorithm in vertical profile can be implemented as shown in table 3 it is noted that the state vector η and ν can be obtained from the on board navigation system x p ϖ and z p ϖ are predefined functions of reference trajectory in addition some constants in controller have not been listed in the table specifically certain calculations such as partial integration have not been included the model of the remus auv in tanakitkorn et al 2017 is utilized in the subsequent numerical studies where the model

main propeller measured in r e v s the propeller speed n p is converted to control force τ u by τ u k p n p 2 where k p is a constant depends on shape parameters of the propeller and water density the kinetic surge model in eq 5 can be described as u f u g u τ u d u where g u represent unknown constant depends on auv hydrodynamic parameters and propeller model for the following two numerical studies the curvilinear reference trajectory is given as x p 1 54 t z p 20 1 5 sin 0 1 t the control scheme in table 3 is applied to control the auv some key parameters are given as follows θ a π 3 k

tracking error z e by increasing the value of k θ and k 1 and the rapidity of dynamic response of δ s to q e can be directly improved by increasing k 3 ξ η s and ξ d s however too large control parameters will cause chattering of δ s the control parameters ξ η s and ξ d s can be tuned by giving different external disturbance and saturation bound respectively the parameter k 2 which

used in simulation radial basis function is given as s x e x p x c 2 2 b 2 the center and width vectors should be selected to cover the potential approximation targets the parameter ξ w s can be adjusted based on the approximation rate and errors the kinetic control parameters in surge and pitch directions are tuned based on the same principle it is noted that the control parameters listed herein are just used in simulation case 1 and 2 and the tracking performance can be improved by further tuning control parameters 4 2 numerical cases with unknown asymmetrical saturations for four simulation cases the initial position of auv under four cases are given by η 1 0 m 12 m 0 rad η 2 5 m 16 m 0 rad η 3 0 m 24 m 0 rad and η 4 5 m 28 m 0 rad respectively the initial velocities are given by v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 1 25 m s 0 0 and the asymmetrical saturations are set as τ u 6 48 n 5 n and δ s 25 30 respectively the model of slowly time varying ocean disturbance for four cases are given as follows 55 τ d u 0 15 d m x u τ d w 0 15 d m z w τ d q 0 15 d i y y m q with d 1 0 1 sin 0 25 t the simulation results of the four cases is shown in fig 3 the proposed nnac controller successfully steers the auv asymptotically converge to the reference trajectory in the presence different initial errors time varying ocean disturbance and unknown asymmetrical saturations in the tracking process the pitch angle θ angle of attack α flight angle θ α and the approach guidance angle θ a p p are depicted in fig 4 the trajectory angle are represented with red line in the first and the third subfigures of fig 4 it is noted that there are time varying errors between the pitch angle and the trajectory angle in the steady process however the flight angle present perfect tracking performance for the trajectory angle it is caused by the resistance effect of the auv to the unknown ocean disturbance fig 5 shows the velocities of the auv in tracking process where the surge velocities approaches to and converges to the smaller neighboring reference velocities of the virtual target which is around 1 54 m s fig 6 shows the along tracking error x e cross tracking error z e and the error of tracking angle θ e the result shows that tracking errors asymptotically converge to the 0 fig 7 shows the generalized control forces and stern fin angles all control signals take values within the asymmetrical saturations sections and the bounds of which are unknown in the control algorithm solving process it is noted that for the surge control force τ u the slight skips around τ u 0 are caused by the s i g n function in eq 52 4 3 comparative analysis with model based saturated adaptive control schemes the second numerical study compares the proposed nnac control scheme with model

ocean disturbance model are given as follows 56 τ d u 0 1 m x u 0 5 0 1 μ 1 sin 0 25 t τ d w 0 1 m z w 0 5 0 1 μ 2 sin 0 25 t τ d q 0 1 i y y m q 0 5 0 1 μ 3 sin 0 25 t where μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are gaussian noises based on the principle of smc control method the model based smc controller without actuator saturations is designed in the following way 57 τ u s m c 1 g u u d f u k 1 s u e x e cos θ

compensate the truncation errors by actuator saturations by using the feedback linearization technique the model based fuzzy compensation control scheme can be designed as 58 τ u f u z z y 1 g u u d f

functions which are composed of vehicle model parameters the stability analysis of the fuzzy compensation controller can be referred in the literature yu et al 2020 2018b the three simulation are implemented with the same simulation environment the initial position and velocity vector are give as η 0 m 15 m 0 rad and v 1 25 m s 0 0 for both cases the ocean disturbance are given in eq 55 the numerical tracking results in vertical profile are shown in fig 8 it can be found that three controllers successfully steer the auv asymptotically converge to the desired trajectory in the presence of same initial states and ocean environment it is noted that the convergence speed is faster for the fuzzy controller and nnac controller as compared to the smc controller the auv angles path angle and guidance angles are shown in fig 9 the approach angle parameter θ a is given as 60 due to the time varying ocean disturbance the dynamic angle of attack α is to compensate the influence of disturbance it can be observed that there are dynamic and bounded errors between the pitch angle and the path angle whereas the flight angle θ α shows robust tracking performance for the path angle fig 10 shows the surge heave and pitch velocities in the tracking process whereas the surge velocities can be converged to the reference velocity around 1 54 m s due to the existence of dynamic angle of attack α the heave velocities are dynamic and bounded fig 11 presents the along tracking errors x e cross tracking errors z e and errors of tracking angles θ e for the control parameters selection the nnac control scheme have present better tracking performance the comparative surge control force and stern angles are shown in fig 12 the external disturbance force and moments are shown in fig 13 for the fuzzy controller and nnac controller the symmetrical saturation is given as τ u 6 48 n 6 48 n and δ s 30 30 the control force and stern angle for smc control scheme have greatly exceed the saturations it is observed that the nnac control schemes have smaller output jitters as compared to the fuzzy compensation controller it is noted that for the surge control force τ u under nnac control scheme the waves around τ u 0 are small when compared with four cases in fig 7 the scale of the waves can be regulated with control parameters ξ w u and k 4 fig 14 shows the neural network approximation results for surge and pitch terms respectively the approximation targets are given as f u f u u d and f q f q q d it can be observed that the neural network systems are able to capture the unknown and time varying functions in the steady state in addition the approximation performance including converge speed and approximation errors are acceptable at the initial stage consequently the control signals of nnac in fig 12 results in better actuator performance with reasonable amplitude and less chattering 5 conclusion the research work in this paper was focused on the design of a neural network based adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme for underactuated auvs which are subjected to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and unknown dynamics the auv kinematic and kinetic models trajectory tracking problem control preliminaries and notations have been identified to facilitate the design of kinematic and kinetic control schemes subsequently the approach angle based guidance law and the tracking error coordinates have been derived then the kinematic control scheme is built on the backstepping technique and lyapunov theory additionally a novel approach has been opted to deal with the saturation problem which is realized by constructing a bounded function to describe the unknown asymmetrical non smooth actuator saturation neural network compensation and adaptive estimation techniques have been exploited to get rid of the dependence on auv model parameters and the complex differential calculation to analyze the stability of the developed nnac lyapunov theory have been used considering the different control actions on various saturation sections in order to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme the first set of simulation have been carried with unknown asymmetrical saturations and different initial auv states moreover the efficacy of the proposed nnac has also been established by comparing with commonly used sliding mode control

finally effectiveness and superiority of the proposed nnac are validated through two sets of comparative simulation studies keywords trajectory tracking under actuated auv adaptive neural network control asymmetrical actuator saturation approach angle 1 introduction in the past several decades auvs have become the effective tools for ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific defense commercial applications such as oil gas exploration marine geosciences and offshore industry shi et al 2017 zereik et al 2018 however there is much work still to be done to develop the smarter auvs by addressing the complexities related to the internal electromechanical systems unpredictable oceanic environment where these auvs can move flexibly and acquire requisite scientific data precisely on both temporal and spatial scales lapierre and soetanto 2007 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 yu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 motion control of the underactuated auvs become more challenging due to the unpredictable complex oceanic environment and auvs complex electromechanical systems shi et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which mainly includes 1 highly nonlinear and inherently coupled dynamics 2 parametric uncertainties caused by poor knowledge of the hydrodynamic coefficients 3 unpredictable external disturbances 4 underactuation of the vehicle except the underactuated characteristics of vehicles the above mentioned challenges can be broadly categorized as uncertainties and nonlinearities additionally dead zone selmic and lewis 2000 time delay huang and lewis 2003 saturation zheng and feroskhan 2017 li et al 2019 and unknown dynamics von ellenrieder 2019 yu et al 2020 as type of uncertainties and nonlinearities for the actuators of auv are also required to be addressed in order to address these challenges various neural network based control schemes have been proposed with respective specific applications and assumptions in handling uncertainties and nonlinearities neural network and fuzzy logic system with the ability of universal approximation for unknown dynamics and functions wang and mendel 1992 park and sandberg 1991 have shown excellent performance for development of motion control system of auvs peng et al 2015 li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in particular the practicability of neural network in auvs motion control has already been validated experimentally lorentz and yuh 1996 in chen et al 2014 for a class of uncertain strict feedback nonlinear systems a dynamic surface control scheme is designed by using the radial basis function rbf neural network to approximate the unknown system function a reinforcement learning based control scheme is designed in cui et al 2017 for discrete evaluation functions moreover an adaptive neural network control scheme is designed for multiple agents to synchronize trajectory tracking cui et al 2012 a projection neural network is employed in peng et al 2019 to optimize the reference governor in real time which bridges the kinematic guidance loop and kinetic control loop by computing optimal guidance signals within the velocity and input constraints a new recurrent neural network predictive feedback control structure is designed in huang and lewis 2003 for a class of uncertain nonlinear dynamic time delay systems where the recurrent neural network is adopted to approximate the dynamics of the time delay free nonlinear plant a neural networks based compensation scheme is designed for a general nonlinear actuator with unknown dead zone width selmic and lewis 2000 in which two different neural networks have been employed to construct the compensators i e one is used to estimate the unknown dead zone and the other is used to provide adaptive compensation in the feed forward channel actuator saturation as one of the typical nonlinearities can affect the control system s performance and even result in overall system s instability therefore actuator saturation has attained significant attention from the researchers and thorough literature review reveals that there are two major available schemes to address this nonlinearity i e saturated function approximation and the other is nonlinearity compensation for the former method the logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent t a n h functions namely s functions are widely applied to approximate the symmetrical non smooth saturation in wen et al 2011 for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems a smooth t a n h function is adopted to approximate the non smooth function and the bound of saturation is known a t a n h based saturation function is designed in rezazadegan et al 2015 to keep control signals bounded for the latter method a fuzzy logic system and neural networks are applicable to compensate for the saturation in yu et al 2020 an adaptive fuzzy compensator is introduced to compensate control truncation between the unsaturated and saturated inputs most of the above control schemes are proposed based on two critical assumptions which are symmetrical actuator saturation and given bounds of the saturation for auvs actuated with stern control fins such as cross type and x type rudders the actuating mechanism of control fins can interfere with each other and may result in asymmetrical actuators saturation moreover the asymmetric saturation may also be encountered when the actuators have partial loss of effectiveness failures chu et al 2020 in zheng et al 2017 a trajectory tracking control scheme for a marine surface vessel with asymmetric actuators saturation is designed by constructing a asymmetric smooth function based on the known upper and lower bounds underactuation is a common research topic for path following and trajectory tracking of under actuated marine vehicles which includes auvs surface vehicles and others trajectory tracking problem is different from path following as specific temporal specification is required for trajectory tracking lapierre and soetanto 2007 zheng et al 2017 guidance law plays an important role in dealing with the underactuated problems line of sight los is one of the most popular method and there are various derivatives of guidance law which are based on conventional los guidance law borhaug et al 2008 liu et al 2017 integral los ilos was proposed to counteract constant and irrotational ocean currents in the kinematic level borhaug et al 2008 further the concept of ilos is widely used in different underwater vehicles with experimental validations caharija et al 2016 kelasidi et al 2017 types of modified guidance laws is designed for surface vehicles to compensate the ocean currents by estimating the sideslip angle liu et al 2017 miao et al 2017 yu et al 2019 in liu et al 2017 a reduced order extended state observer is designed to identify the sideslip angle caused by constant oceanic disturbances which is applied to revise conventional los guidance law moreover in yu et al 2019 extended state observers are applied to estimate the surge and sway velocities to indirectly identify the side slip angle which is utilized to compensate the los guidance law the side slip angle compensation based los guidance law is applicable for surface vehicles due to that the position signal can be obtained precisely with low coast sensors the concept of approach angle was first proposed on unicycle type and two steering wheels mobile robots and transferred to deal with the path following problem of underactuated auvs in lapierre and soetanto 2007 this paper presents an adaptive neural network based control scheme for diving trajectory

control scheme is introduced where the diving trajectory tracking error model is derived based on the theory of relative motion afterwards the kinematic controller is designed by using the backstepping technique which is followed by the design of kinetic pitch and surge controllers by considering the unknown asymmetrical saturated actuator dynamics and unknown external disturbance in section 4 the pseudo code of the proposed control scheme and simulation environment are explained two sets of comparative numerical studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and

depicted in fig 1 the proposed nnac scheme consists of two parts kinematic control scheme and kinetic control scheme the detailed design of the trajectory tracking control scheme is described in the following subsections 3 1 tracking error coordinates to describe the vehicle motion in different coordinates we define coordinate frames in vertical profile as shown in fig 2 and table 2 the serret frenet frame defines the virtual tracking point on the reference trajectory as its origin where the position tracking error vector is expressed with d as shown in fig 2 for conventional los guidance law taking the case of vertical profile example the desired heading of the vehicle can be described as 9 θ l o s tan 1 z e δ where the looking ahead distance δ 0 is constant z e is the cross tracking error and θ l o s π 2 π 2 a desired approach angle based guidance law is introduced into path tracking lapierre and soetanto 2007 10 θ a p p θ a e k θ z e 1 e k θ z e 1 where θ a 0 π 2 is the maximal approach angle and k θ 0 is a constant to determine the approaching speed it is noted that z e θ a p p z e 0 for all z e r and θ a p p θ a θ a from the relative motion theory the absolute velocity of the auv in i can be derived as 11 d o b d t i d o p d t i i f r 1 d d d t f w f d where the first term on the right side represent the relative velocity of the vectorial target o p in i the last term is the relative velocity of the auv in f the rotation transformation matrix from i to f is defined as i f r r o p θ p the absolute velocity of d can be synthesized as 12 d d d t i d o b d t i d o f d

kinematic model of auv in eq 3 and corresponding tracking errors in eqs 8 16 under approach angle based guidance law in eq 10 kinematic control law in eq 17 drive tracking error d v asymptotically to 0 proof consider a candidate lyapunov function as 18 v s y s a p p 1 2 θ e θ a p p 2 then 19 v s y s a p p θ e θ a p p θ e θ a p p by substituting eqs 16 17 into above equation one can obtains 20 v s y s a p p k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 0 since θ e and θ a p p are bounded and v s y s a p p is positive and monotonically decreasing therefore lim t v s y s a p p t exists and is finite moreover since v s y s a p p 2 k 1 v s y s a p p 4 k 1 2 v s y s a p p thus v s y s a p p exists and is finite and v s y s a p p is uniformly continuous then an application of barbalat s lemma allows for the conclusion that lim t v s y s a p p t 0 the system is asymptotically converging to a compact set e defined by v s y s a p p 0 consequently variables z e and θ e are bounded then choose a new lyapunov function candidate as follows 21 v s y s 1 v s y s a p p 1 2 x e 2 z e 2 by differentiating v s y s 1 one can obtain 22 v s y s 1 k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 x e x e z e z e by substituting eqs 16 17 into above equation one can obtains 23 v s y s 1 k 1 θ e θ a p p 2 k 2 x e 2 v t z e sin θ a p p it is noted that z e sin θ a p p 0 z e r arranging eq 23 yields 24 v s y s 1 0 considering the differential of v s y s 1 in eq 23 v s y s 1 is bounded then barbalat s lemma allows for the conclusion that lim t v s y s 1 t 0 this in turn implies that all trajectories in the compact set e satisfy lim t x e z e θ e 0 we now apply lasalle s invariance principle let ω r 2 be a compact set the validation on the lyapunov function candidate v s y s a p p shown that every solution starting in ω asymptotically converge to the compact set e the validation on v s y s 1 shown that the largest invariant set of e is m x e z e θ e 0 then every bounded solution starting in ω converges to 0 as t hence based on the guidance law and kinematics controller in eqs 10 17 we have lim t x e z e θ e 0 3 3 kinetic pitch controller redefine the saturation function as follows 25 υ δ s s a t δ s δ s δ s u δ s δ s u δ s 1 δ s l δ s δ s u δ s

controller proposition 3 can be proved δ δ δ 4 numerical examples and discussion this section illustrates the performance of the proposed nnac controller with two sets of numerical simulation studies firstly the pseudo code of the nnac controller auv model parameters and reference trajectory have been provided secondly for the first comparative study the vehicle is desired to depart from different initial position with unknown asymmetrical saturations thirdly for the second comparative study the performance of the sliding mode controller smc without saturation model based indirect fuzzy logical controller and the proposed nnac controller with saturations are compared 4 1 implementation of trajectory tracking algorithm according to the trajectory tracking control block diagram in fig 1 kinematic and kinetic control schemes in section 3 the trajectory tracking control algorithm in vertical profile can be implemented as shown in table 3 it is noted that the state vector η and ν can be obtained from the on board navigation system x p ϖ and z p ϖ are predefined functions of reference trajectory in addition some constants in controller have not been listed in the table specifically certain calculations such as partial integration have not been included the model of the remus auv in tanakitkorn et al 2017 is utilized in the subsequent numerical studies where the model coefficients have been listed in table 4 it is noted that inherent saturation constraints of actuators are given as τ u 6 48 n 6 48 n and δ s 30 30 the kinetic surge controller in eq 52 is design for main propeller measured in r e v s the propeller speed n p is converted to control force τ u by τ u k p n p 2 where k p is a constant depends on shape parameters of the propeller and water density the kinetic surge model in eq 5 can be described as u f u g u τ u d u where g u represent unknown constant depends on auv hydrodynamic parameters and propeller model for the following two numerical studies the curvilinear reference trajectory is given as x p 1 54 t z p 20 1 5 sin 0 1 t the control scheme in table 3 is applied to control the auv some key parameters are given as follows θ a π 3 k θ 0 5 k 1 1 k 2 10 k 3 1 k 4 5 ξ d s 0 1 ξ w s 0 1 ξ η s 0 5 ξ d u 0 1 ξ w u 0 5 ξ η u 0 1 the parameter θ a determines the allowed biggest pitch angle control action δ s will be more sensitive to tracking error z e by increasing the value of k θ and k 1 and the rapidity of dynamic response of δ s to q e can be directly improved by increasing k 3 ξ η s and ξ d s however too large control parameters will cause chattering of δ s the control parameters ξ η s and ξ d s can be tuned by giving different external disturbance and saturation bound respectively the parameter k 2 which determines the responsiveness of tracking velocity to x e should satisfy k 2 x p 2 z p 2 where the latter term is the tracking target velocity for the rbf nn approximation seven hidden layer nodes are used in simulation radial basis function is given as s x e x p x c 2 2 b 2 the center and width vectors should be selected to cover the potential approximation targets the parameter ξ w s can be adjusted based on the approximation rate and errors the kinetic control parameters in surge and pitch directions are tuned based on the same principle it is noted that the control parameters listed herein are just used in simulation case 1 and 2 and the tracking performance can be improved by further tuning control parameters 4 2 numerical cases with unknown asymmetrical saturations for four simulation cases the initial position of auv under four cases are given by η 1 0 m 12 m 0 rad η 2 5 m 16 m 0 rad η 3 0 m 24 m 0 rad and η 4 5 m 28 m 0 rad respectively the initial velocities are given by v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 1 25 m s 0 0 and the asymmetrical saturations are set as τ u 6 48 n 5 n and δ s 25 30 respectively the model of slowly time varying ocean disturbance for four cases are given as follows 55 τ d u 0 15 d m x u τ d w 0 15 d m z w τ d q 0 15 d i y y m q with d 1 0 1 sin 0 25 t the simulation results of the four cases is shown in fig 3 the proposed nnac controller successfully steers the auv asymptotically converge to the reference trajectory in the presence different initial errors time varying ocean disturbance and unknown asymmetrical saturations in the tracking process the pitch angle θ angle of attack α flight angle θ α and the approach guidance angle θ a p p are depicted in fig 4 the trajectory angle are represented with red line in the first and the third subfigures of fig 4 it is noted that there are time varying errors between the pitch angle and the trajectory angle in the steady process however the flight angle present perfect tracking performance for the trajectory angle it is caused by the resistance effect of the auv to the unknown ocean disturbance fig 5 shows the velocities of the auv in tracking process where the surge velocities approaches to and converges to the smaller neighboring reference velocities of the virtual target which is around 1 54 m s fig 6 shows the along tracking error x e cross tracking error z e and the error of tracking angle θ e the result shows that tracking errors asymptotically converge to the 0 fig 7 shows the generalized control forces and stern fin angles all control signals take values within the asymmetrical saturations sections and the bounds of which are unknown in the control algorithm solving process it is noted that for the surge control force τ u the slight skips around τ u 0 are caused by the s i g n function in eq 52 4 3 comparative analysis with model based saturated adaptive control schemes the second numerical study compares the proposed nnac control scheme with model based sliding mode controller smc without saturations and indirect adaptive fuzzy controller with saturations to further verify the robustness and illustrate the superiority of the proposed nnac the ocean disturbance model are given as follows 56 τ d u 0 1 m x u 0 5 0 1 μ 1 sin 0 25 t τ d w 0 1 m z w 0 5 0 1 μ 2 sin 0 25 t τ d q 0 1 i y y m q 0 5 0 1 μ 3 sin 0 25 t where μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are gaussian noises based on the principle of smc control method the model based smc controller without actuator saturations is designed in the following way 57 τ u s m c 1 g u u d f u k 1 s u e x e cos θ e cos α k 2 s sgn u e τ q s m c 1 g q q d f q k 3 s q e θ e θ l o s k 4 s sgn q e where k 1 s k 2 s k 3 s and k 4 s are positive constants the indirect fuzzy logical method is utilized here to compensate the truncation errors by actuator saturations by using the feedback linearization technique the model based fuzzy compensation control scheme can be designed as 58 τ u f u z z y 1 g u u d f u k 1 f u e x e cos θ e cos α k 2 f sgn u e ϱ ˆ u τ q f u z z y 1 g q q d f q k 3 f q e θ e θ l o s k 4 f sgn q e ϱ ˆ q where the fuzzy approximation terms ϱ ˆ u w ˆ u t ς u and ϱ ˆ q w ˆ q t ς q the update law for weight vectors are given as 59 w ˆ u 1 γ u g u u e ς u w ˆ q 1 γ q g q q e ς q where k 1 f k 2 f k 3 f k 4 f γ u and γ q 0 are constant control gains f u f q g u and g q are known functions which are composed of vehicle model parameters the stability analysis of the fuzzy compensation controller can be referred in the literature yu et al 2020 2018b the three simulation are implemented with the same simulation environment the initial position and velocity vector are give as η 0 m 15 m 0 rad and v 1 25 m s 0 0 for both cases the ocean disturbance are given in eq 55 the numerical tracking results in vertical profile are shown in fig 8 it can be found that three controllers successfully steer the auv asymptotically converge to the desired trajectory in the presence of same initial states and ocean environment it is noted that the convergence speed is faster for the fuzzy controller and nnac controller as compared to the smc controller the auv angles path angle and guidance angles are shown in fig 9 the approach angle parameter θ a is given as 60 due to the time varying ocean disturbance the dynamic angle of attack α is to compensate the influence of disturbance it can be observed that there are dynamic and bounded errors between the pitch angle and the path angle whereas the flight angle θ α shows robust tracking performance for the path angle fig 10 shows the surge heave and pitch velocities in the tracking process whereas the surge velocities can be converged to the reference velocity around 1 54 m s due to the existence of dynamic angle of attack α the heave velocities are dynamic and bounded fig 11 presents the along tracking errors x e cross tracking errors z e and errors of tracking angles θ e for the control parameters selection the nnac control scheme have present better tracking performance the comparative surge control force and stern angles are shown in fig 12 the external disturbance force and moments are shown in fig 13 for the fuzzy controller and nnac controller the symmetrical saturation is given as τ u 6 48 n 6 48 n and δ s 30 30 the control force and stern angle for smc control scheme have greatly exceed the saturations it is observed that the nnac control schemes have smaller output jitters as compared to the fuzzy compensation controller it is noted that for the surge control force τ u under nnac control scheme the waves around τ u 0 are small when compared with four cases in fig 7 the scale of the waves can be regulated with control parameters ξ w u and k 4 fig 14 shows the neural network approximation results for surge and pitch terms respectively the approximation targets are given as f u f u u d and f q f q q d it can be observed that the neural network systems are able to capture the unknown and time varying functions in the steady state in addition the approximation performance including converge speed and approximation errors are acceptable at the initial stage consequently the control signals of nnac in fig 12 results in better actuator performance with reasonable amplitude and less chattering 5 conclusion the research work in this paper was focused on the design of a neural network based adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme for underactuated auvs which are subjected to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and unknown dynamics the auv kinematic and kinetic models trajectory tracking problem control preliminaries and notations have been identified to facilitate the design of kinematic and kinetic control schemes subsequently the approach angle based guidance law and the tracking error coordinates have been derived then the kinematic control scheme is built on the backstepping technique and lyapunov theory additionally a novel approach has been opted to deal with the saturation problem which is realized by constructing a bounded function to describe the unknown asymmetrical non smooth actuator saturation neural network compensation and adaptive estimation techniques have been exploited to get rid of the dependence on auv model parameters and the complex differential calculation to analyze the stability of the developed nnac lyapunov theory have been used considering the different control actions on various saturation sections in order to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme the first set of simulation have been carried with unknown asymmetrical saturations and different initial auv states moreover the efficacy of the proposed nnac has also been established by comparing with commonly used sliding mode control and fuzzy control schemes thus the proposed controller is found to be more efficient and robust for the control of an underactuated auv experiencing unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and

21356,free hanging is vulnerable to dynamic motion at the top end inducing axial compression at the touchdown point numerical approaches in consideration with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear drag force have been succeeded at evaluating dynamic characteristics of free hanging slender structures accurately on the other hand analytical investigations into the mechanism determining dynamic tension and how design parameters affect dynamic tension based on sufficient reasoning are yet to be fully developed in this paper we aim for establishing a linear lumped mass model that gives sufficient explanations of the basic mechanism determining dynamic tension of free hanging slender structure the established model analytically describes how the key parameters namely the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle contribute to the dynamic tension behavior in addition we verify the results of the linear analytical model by orcaflex calculations in the time domain we illustrate the contribution of nonlinear force on dynamic tension by introducing the ratio of the nonlinear force to the gravity force keywords slender structures axial compression lumped mass model dynamic tension free hanging 1 introduction slender structures including flexible risers mooring lines and umbilical cables are an important element of ocean development their role is to connect a floating structure on the sea surface to the seabed the floating structure is exposed to waves and wind on the sea surface and easily moves the motion of the floating structure is transmitted to the slender structure connected to the floating structure and induces the dynamic tension of the slender structure the dynamic tension of the slender structure induces many failures drumond et al 2018 in the short term it induces lateral buckling and over bending of slender structures due to over axial compression the axial compression is known as one of the representative cause of riser failures o brien and picksley 2001 and leads to snap loads on mooring lines hsu et al 2017 in the long term repetitive dynamic tension induces fatigue failures of slender structures hence the failure of the slender structure due to dynamic tension leads to the fatal accident and significantly increases the total cost of the project on the other hand undue safety factor can make the project cost huge the conventional design approach of slender structures according to an industrial standard is shown in fig 1 the motion of slender structures in the water is a problem with nonlinear drag forces and multi degrees of freedom therefore the design approach consists of iterations of time consuming finite element method fem calculations in the time domain american petroleum institute 2002 det norske veritas dnv 2010 numerical methods in consideration with multi degrees of freedom problem and nonlinear force have been succeeded at evaluating dynamic characteristics of slender structures quite adequately on the other hand the analytical investigation into the basic mechanism determining dynamic characteristics of slender structures is yet to be fully understood better analytical understanding of dynamic tension without significant dependence on numerical calculations would have the following contributions if the result of fem calculation in the time domain ends up with axial compression analytical explicit solutions give valuable insights on how we should update design parameters based on sufficient reasoning analytical explicit solutions based on sufficient reasoning give better understanding of the effect of each design parameter separately this would give better explanation and reasonable verification of numerical calculations in this paper we aim for establishing a linear lumped mass model that gives sufficient explanations of the basic mechanism determining the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures the introduced lumped mass model reveals how well known key parameters in the industry are reproduced analytically and contributes to better analytical understanding of the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension the objective of this study is not to surrogate replace conventional numerical calculation but to establish basic understanding explaining the result of numerical calculation we address how reasonable the established analytical model is with comprehensive numerical fem calculations in addition the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is discussed in detail to explain the role of linear inertia force and nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension as we ignore nonlinear force in the formulation of the introduced lumped mass model the analytical model in this study is an extension of the authors previous work kanazawa et al 2018 this study focuses on free hanging that is the most simple configuration of slender structures in order to expand our results to the other configurations in the future starting with simple discussion in addition free hanging is a worth thinking example to investigate the core mechanisms because it is a representative configuration well known for vulnerability to the dynamic motion at the top end hill et al n d this study illustrates the occurrence of the axial compression to discuss the characteristics of dynamic tension this means we do not go into detail about the following discussions estimation of maximum tension of slender structures structural local nonlinearity of slender structures we introduce explicit analytical solutions on dynamic tension successfully owing to narrowing down a target to dynamic tension note that comprehensive estimation of dynamic characteristics including minimum bending radius and deformation of slender structures is the biggest advantage of numerical calculations in consideration with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear force and those perspectives are not in the scope of this study 2 the establishment of the analytical model 2 1 relationship between previous work and the analytical model in this paper representative studies in this field are divided into two groups one of them is the study based on comparisons of fem calculations in the time domain foyt et al 2007 kimiaei et al 2010 xia et al 2008 the motion of steel catenary risers scrs in response to the irregular oscillation at the top end has been calculated foyt et al 2007 they concluded that dynamic minimum tension of scr is proportional to the minimum downward velocity at the top end one of the representative studies xia et al 2008 explained the relationship of some design parameters and maximum von mises stresses although insights of their studies support the empirical insights which are already known in the industry those also suggest the limitation to establish a reasonable explanation of the mechanism determining dynamic tension this is because numerical calculations are not good at giving general explanation of the mechanism as the large number of design and environmental parameter has been the main challenge in the design process ismail et al 1992 the other group of previous studies is based on artificial neural networks anns or bio inspired algorithms quéau quéau et al 2015 2014a 2014b 2013 developed an anns model that is trained by a large number of the result of fem calculations in the time domain the developed anns model can estimate the dynamic tension of the free hanging riser based on environmental and design parameters without time consuming numerical calculations in the time domain on the other hand anns models do not explain the mechanism of the physical system which determines the dynamic tension of the riser they divided the whole calculated training data into several groups without physical reasonings in order to achieve high prediction accuracy of the anns model in addition the accuracy of the developed anns model for extrapolating conditions can be quite poor these insights imply that the limitation of the anns model in terms of the reasonable explanation of the mechanism determining dynamic tension approaches based on bio inspired algorithms vieira et al 2009 have similar advantages and disadvantages to that based on anns models namely they enable the effective optimum solution searching for an individual project out of a large number of fem calculations in the time domain on the other hand their approaches without physical reasonings to adjust parameters in the algorisms do not give sufficient understanding of the mechanism the analytical model introduced hereinafter compensates for the shortcomings of these two approaches all fem calculations in this study are performed by orcaflex orcina ltd 2019 orcaflex is one of the most proven softwares for dynamic analysis of offshore slender structures and operations in the time domain the post processing of orcaflex calculations are performed with the python and matlab interface to orcaflex heffernan 2016 2 2 static equilibriums of the analytical model the analytical model in this paper consists of three point masses that are connected by non deformable rods to each other as the concept of the analytical model is shown in fig 2 note that we do not consider the following phenomenon in this analytical model we confine degrees of freedom as shown in fig 2 because a lumped mass model having further degrees of freedom does not have an explicit analytical solution the number of rods in the introduced lumped mass model is always two in this study because of this reason and we can see this constraint is reasonable to explain the basic characteristic of the dynamic tension of free hanging riser verifying the introduced explicit solution with comprehensive orcaflex calculation in the section 3 hence the analytical model shown in fig 2 does not consider multi node flexural vibration we have checked that the effect of multi node flexural vibration on dynamic minimum tension dmt is marginal within the parameters representing basic design conditions in this paper the effect can be significant in deep water due to a large phase difference between the motion at the top end and dynamic tension at the touch down point tdp we put the total length of the free hanging riser from the top end to the static tdp as l and the unit mass of the riser as w the top point mass represents one fourth of the riser at the top side and the middle point mass represents half of the riser in the middle part of the riser the bottom point mass represents the mass of one fourth of the riser at the bottom and δ w δ w is the mass of the riser beyond static tdp which moves dynamically the distribution of the mass into three point masses is illustrated in fig 2 according to recommended practice for flexible pipe by american petroleum institute american petroleum institute 2002 the vessel motion at the top end of the free hanging riser transfers directly to the seabed and leads to compression at tdp therefore the introduced analytical model hereinafter aims for formulating the occurrence of axial compression with the ratio of the dynamic component of tension to the static component of tension f 2 t 2 at the bottom rod representing the riser near tdp in the author s previous study kanazawa et al 2018 f 2 t 2 has represented the characteristics of the occurrence of axial compression poorly the innovation in this study based on the authors previous study kanazawa et al 2018 is to release the point mass at tdp in the vertical direction in order to represent the occurrence of axial compression with f 2 t 2 properly avoiding excessive constraint at the point mass at tdp the static condition of the analytical model is shown in fig 3 putting the static horizontal force at the top end as t h and the static vertical force at the top end as t v following static force equilibriums are derived in the horizontal and vertical direction at each point mass to define the static angle of the top rod θ 1 the static angle of the bottom rod θ 2 the static tension of the top rod t 1 the static tension of the bottom rod t 2 and the normal reaction force t r which is applied at tdp due to δ weight we define the coefficient of the weight in water α which represents the ratio of the unit weight in water of the riser to the weight in air of the riser therefore 0 α 1 is always true the number of catenary γ t h α w g is defined for simplicity in this study then the following static equilibriums equ 1 5 in the horizontal and vertical direction are derived 1 t h t 1 sin θ 1 t 2 sin θ 2 α w g γ 2 t v α w g l 3 t 1 cos θ 1 t v α w g l 4 4 t 2 cos θ 2 t 1 cos θ 1 α w g l 2 5 t 2 cos θ 2 t r α w g l 4 δ we can rearrange equ 1 5 as following equ 6 9 6 t v α w g l 7 t 1 cos θ 1 3 t v 4 8 t 2 cos θ 2 t v 4 9 t r α w g δ then the following equ 10 13 are derived from equ 6 9 10 sin θ 1 t h t 1 11 cos θ 1 3 t v 4 t 1 12 sin θ 2 t h t 2 13 cos θ 2 t v 4 t 2 2 3 dynamic equilibriums of the analytical model let us move on to the definition of the dynamic condition of the analytical model as shown in fig 4 we assume the forced displacement x 0 z 0 is applied at the point mass at the top end we define the displacement of the point mass dynamic tension and angle of the riser in response to the displacement x 0 z 0 as follows f h the dynamic component of tension at the top end in the vertical direction f v the dynamic component of tension at the top end in the horizontal direction f 1 the dynamic component of tension of the top rod f 2 the dynamic component of tension of the bottom rod δ 1 the dynamic component of the angle of the top rod δ 2 the dynamic component of the angle of the bottom rod x 1 the displacement of the middle point mass in the horizontal direction z 1 the displacement of the middle point mass in the vertical direction the bottom point mass is fixed in the horizontal direction and moves only in the vertical direction induced by the applied displacement at the top end we define the displacement of the bottom point mass in the vertical direction as z 2 in addition we define the coefficient of the virtual mass β which represents the ratio of the virtual mass including added mass of the riser to the unit mass of the riser therefore β 1 is always true since the rod is non deformable following geometrical constraints equ 14 17 should be satisfied 14 l 2 sin θ 1 δ 1 l 2 sin θ 1 x 0 x 1 15 l 2 cos θ 1 δ 1 l 2 cos θ 1 z 0 z 1 16 l 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 l 2 sin θ 2 x 1 17 l 2 cos θ 2 δ 2 l 2 cos θ 2 z 1 z 2 assuming δ 1 and δ 2 are small enough 18 l 2 cos θ 1 δ 1 x 0 x 1 19 l 2 sin θ 1 δ 1 z 0 z 1 20 l 2 cos θ 2 δ 2 x 1 21 l 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 z 1 z 2 then we can derive the following equations 22 3 t 2 δ 1 t 1 δ 2 8 t 1 t 2 l t v x 0 23 t 2 δ 1 t 1 δ 2 2 t 1 t 2 l t h z 0 z 2 then the following equations are derived 24 δ 1 4 t 1 l t v x 0 t 1 l t h z 0 z 2 25 δ 2 4 t 2 l t v x 0 3 t 2 l t h z 0 z 2 then the displacement of the middle point mass is derived as follows 26 x 1 1 2 x 0

virtual mass β is independent of the direction of the motion dynamic equilibriums equ 28 32 are derived as follows 28 t v f v t 1 f 1 cos θ 1 δ 1 α w g l 4 β w l 4 z 0 29 t 1 f 1 sin θ 1 δ 1 t 2 f 2

f 2 t 2 are small enough the equations are described as follows by eliminating terms of static equilibriums following rearrangements equ 33 34 are useable since we assume the regularly forced oscillation at the top end of the riser for simplicity note that the frequency of the oscillation is defined as ω 33 x 0 ω 2 x 0 34 z 0 ω 2 z 0 therefore following rearrangements equ 35 39 are derived

follows 43 μ 3 3 l 4 γ 2 3 3 l 4 γ 2 8 δ l equ 41 and 42 are the solution to the introduced analytical model f 1 t 1 and f 2 t 2 are the ratio of the dynamic component to the static component of the rod tension note that the introduced lumped mass model aims for evaluating the occurrence of axial compression with f 2 t 2 representing the ratio of the dynamic component to the static component of the tension near tdp the introduced analytical model has four non dimensional key parameters on dynamic tension namely the amplification factor β α which is the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end ω 2 x 0 g and ω 2 z 0 g the static top angle θ 1 tan 1 γ l and δ l the role of δ l in the analytical model is to adjust the effect of how to distribute actual riser weight in the simplified analytical model with only three point masses therefore the discussion about the quantitative value of δ l has little meaning for explaining the mechanism of determination of dynamic tension due to the simplicity of the analytical model since we can see that the analytical solution with δ l 1 25 is qualitative in a good agreement with the results of comprehensive orcaflex calculations presented hereinafter we use δ l 1 25 as a default value of the introduced analytical model in this study even though the drastic simplification and linearization have been carried out in the derivation of the introduced analytical result f 2 t 2 well represents the qualitative effect of key design parameters on dynamic tension as described in the next section on the other hand we should note that discussion on the quantitative value of f 2 t 2 is beyond the scope of the introduced analytical result 3 verification of the analytical model so far we introduced the analytical model to estimate the effect of key parameters on the dynamic tension of free hanging riser hereinafter we verify how the analytical model in this paper works to estimate the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension we compare the introduced analytical solution to the result of orcaflex fem calculations in the time domain if the analytical solution can capture the result of orcaflex fem calculations qualitatively that means the analytical model we introduced in this paper is useful for the estimation of the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension and explains the basic mechanism to determine the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures first of all we explain the calculation conditions of orcaflex model for verification the calculation conditions in this paper are based on our previous work kanazawa et al 2018 we apply the regularly forced oscillation at the top end of the riser the oscillation amplitude increases gradually for over 300 s in order to avoid the impact load on the riser the total simulation time is 600s the convergence tests for the segment length and time step of numerical integration are performed and we have checked segment length and time step do not affect effective tension at the top end if segment length is no more than 2 0 m and time step is no more than 0 10s in this study the segment length is 1 5 m and the time step is 0 02s the number of elements of the analytical model for comparison in the figure is always two as we introduced in the previous section the static configuration of the riser of which static top angle is θ t a r g e t is calculated with orcaflex as follows at first we fix the hanging point of the riser of which segment length is 1 5 m and the total length is 1260 m next we adjust the anchor position of the riser in the horizontal direction in order to let the calculated static top angle close to the target static top angle θ t a r g e t in the static calculation if the gap between the calculated static top angle and θ t a r g e t is smaller than 0 1 deg we define the model as the static configuration of which static top angle is θ t a r g e t subsequently we redefine the anchor position truncating the riser on the seabed to make the total length of the riser 1 2 times the length from the hanging point to the static tdp parameters of the representative model are shown in table 1 we focus on dmt which is related to the occurrence of the axial compression of the riser in the 600s simulation result we define dmt as the minimum tension of the riser in the last period of the oscillation the water depth is 500 m the density of the internal fluid is 1030 0 kg m3 an elastic seabed model is applied in the orcaflex calculations the normal seabed stiffness is 100 0 kg m m3 we start with the verification of the effect of maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle we use only one type of riser specification which is shown in table 2 as value 2 we prepare 7 types of different riser configurations that have different static top angles from 5 to 35 in the step of 5 the oscillation amplitude is from 0 1m to 3 0m the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 6 5s and the oscillation direction is horizontal or vertical namely we calculate 7 types of static top angles 210 types of the forced oscillation at the top end 1470 types of orcaflex calculation model we plot the results on maximum normalized acceleration static top angle plane as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 fig 6 shows the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end and fig 7 shows the results in response to the vertical oscillation the calculation condition of which dmt is always positive is plotted in green and the other compression is observed is plotted in red therefore the boundary between red plots and green plots represents the boundary condition of the occurrence of axial compression calculated with orcaflex the contour of the dotted lines shows the f 2 t 2 analytical solution in this paper note that the difference between calculation conditions of figs 6 and 7 is only the direction of forced oscillation at the top end of the riser in figs 6 and 7 we can see that the analytical model is quantitatively in poor agreement with the results of orcaflex in the time domain quantitative estimation is beyond the scope of the introduced analytical model since we completely ignore nonlinear drag force and multi degree of freedom of the riser motion the point is qualitative agreement of the analytical model with the results of orcaflex in the time domain we can see that the qualitative agreement in figs 6 and 7 with comparing the f 2 t 2 analytical contour and the boundary between red and green points the next discussion is the verification of the effect of the maximum acceleration at the top end and the amplification factor in the water on dmt we use only one static top angle 15deg in addition we prepare 27 risers which have different amplification factors in water with combining design parameters as shown in table 2 the oscillation amplitude is from 0 5m to 2 0m the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 8 0s and the oscillation direction is horizontal or vertical namely we calculate 27 types of riser 126 types of forced oscillation at the top end 3402 types of orcaflex calculation model we plot the results on maximum acceleration at the top end the amplification factor in water plane as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end and fig 9 shows those in response to the vertical oscillation the contour of the dotted lines shows the analytical solution in this paper we can see that the introduced analytical model is qualitatively in good agreement with the results of orcaflex 4 discussion of the effect of inertia and drag forces on the dynamic tension we verified that the introduced analytical model is useful to explain the qualitative effect of key parameters on dynamic tension in the previous section however previous researches foyt et al 2007 kanazawa et al 2018 have suggested that the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is technically not neglectable or dominant compared to inertia force in some calculation cases therefore further investigations are needed to explain the relationship between the inertia component and the nonlinear drag component of dynamic tension first of all we introduce π i the ratio of inertia component to gravity force and π d the ratio of nonlinear drag component to gravity force as follows 44 π i β α ω 2 a g 45 π d 1 2 c d ρ w d ω a 2 α w g 2 c d π 1 α α ω a 2 g d we defined f 1 and f 2 in the introduction of the analytical model here we define a corresponding parameter f and t at any selected point on the riser let t be the static tension at selected point of the riser and f m i n be dmt of the riser then f t 0 is defined as follows 46 f t 1 f m i n t morison s equation j r et al 1950 orcina ltd 2019 considers that the force on the vertical cylinder in the flow consists of an inertia component which is proportional to the acceleration of the flow and nonlinear drag component which is proportional to the squared velocity of the flow similarly we assume that dmt min f t is determined as follows with π i and π d w i is a weighting factor for π i and w d is that for π d 47 min f t w i π i 2 w d π d 2 note that min f t is always positive since f t is always negative namely 48 w i π i 2 w d π d 2 min f t 2 this suggests that the contour of dmt of the riser should be a quadrant of an oval on the π i π d plane if all assumptions here are true we call this hypothesis hypothesis see fig 10 we can verify the hypothesis with comprehensive orcaflex fem calculations in the time domain we calculate orcaflex fem models which have different riser specifications and different forced oscillations at the top end of the riser we plot the result on the π i π d plane in green if the effective tension is always positive and in red if not this means the boundary between red and green points is the boundary of compression on the π d π i plane to clarify the contribution of nonlinear drag and inertia forces to dynamic tension the orcaflex fem calculations for verification here is more comprehensive than those in the previous section we calculate the motion of 16 different risers which have different drag coefficient in the normal direction different added mass coefficient unit mass and outer diameter as shown in table 3 the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 12 0s the oscillation amplitude is from 0 1m to 4 0m for the horizontal oscillation and from 0 1m to 2 0m for the vertical oscillation namely the number of oscillation is 143 for the vertical oscillation and 195 for the horizontal oscillation the number of calculation is 143 195 16 5408 we plot the results on the π i π d plane as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the calculation pattern of which dmt is always positive is plotted in green and the other compression pattern is plotted in red the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end are shown in fig 11 and that in response to the vertical oscillation at the top end are shown in fig 12 on the π i π d plane the oscillation amplitude at the top end is used to calculate π i and π d of each orcaflex calculation we can see that the boundary between red and green points is almost parallel to the horizontal axis of the graph in fig 11 this result suggests that the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is marginal in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end therefore the estimation by the introduced analytical model without considering nonlinear drag force is quite reasonable in response to the horizontal oscillation on the other hand the shape of the boundary in fig 12 between red and green points is a part of the oval as the hypothesis this implies the hypothesis is verified by orcaflex fem calculations and that the improvement toward the origin on π i and π d plane is effective if the oscillation at the top end is in the vertical direction 5 conclusions we have developed a linear lumped mass model that explains the basic mechanism determining the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures comprehensive orcaflex fem calculations have been performed and we have verified that the analytical model can capture the basic characteristic determining dynamic tension this paper has clarified the following basic mechanisms three key parameters on dynamic tension the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle are explicitly derived through reasonable formulations the effect of nonlinear force and multi degrees of freedom on dynamic tension is not neglectable quantitively on the other hand the introduced linear solution succeeds at explaining the qualitative effect of key parameters on dynamic tension we introduced two non dimensional numbers in this study in order to explain the contribution of the linear inertia force and the nonlinear drag force π i represents the ratio of inertia force component to gravity force and π d represents the ratio of the nonlinear drag force component to gravity force we revealed the boundary of the occurrence of the axial compression is a quadrant of an oval on the π i π d plane the design improvement toward the origin on π i and π d plane is effective if the oscillation at the top end is in the vertical direction and the effect of nonlinear drag force on dmt is marginal if the oscillation at the top end is in the horizontal direction the works presented in this study contribute to the following improvement of the riser design in the initial planning stage of slender structures the findings of this study aid the comprehensive understanding of the numerical calculation results while numerical calculations in the time and frequency domain have succeeded in evaluating the dynamic tension accurately they are inferior in isolating factors composing the results and acquiring reasonable insights on how to update parameters the analytical insights of key parameter s contribution to dynamic tension behavior supports the engineer s iterative design

21356,free hanging is vulnerable to dynamic motion at the top end inducing axial compression at the touchdown point numerical approaches in consideration with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear drag force have been succeeded at evaluating dynamic characteristics of free hanging slender structures accurately on the other hand analytical investigations into the mechanism determining dynamic tension and how design parameters affect dynamic tension based on sufficient reasoning are yet to be fully developed in this paper we aim for establishing a linear lumped mass model that gives sufficient explanations of the basic mechanism determining dynamic tension of free hanging slender structure the established model analytically describes how the key parameters namely the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle contribute to the dynamic tension behavior in addition we verify the results of the linear analytical model by orcaflex calculations in the time domain we illustrate the contribution of nonlinear force on dynamic tension by introducing the ratio of the nonlinear force to the gravity force keywords slender structures axial compression lumped mass model dynamic tension free hanging 1 introduction slender structures including flexible risers mooring lines and umbilical cables are an important element of ocean development their role is to connect a floating structure on the sea surface to the seabed the floating structure is exposed to waves and wind on the sea surface and easily moves the motion of the floating structure is transmitted to the slender structure connected to the floating structure and induces the dynamic tension of the slender structure the dynamic tension of the slender structure induces many failures drumond et al 2018 in the short term it induces lateral buckling and over bending of slender structures due to over axial compression the axial compression is known as one of the representative cause of riser failures o brien and picksley 2001 and leads to snap loads on mooring lines hsu et al 2017 in the long term repetitive dynamic tension induces fatigue failures of slender structures hence the failure of the slender structure due to dynamic tension leads to the fatal accident and significantly increases the total cost of the project on the other hand undue safety factor can make the project cost huge the conventional design approach of slender structures according to an industrial standard is shown in fig 1 the motion of slender structures in the water is a problem with nonlinear drag forces and multi degrees of freedom therefore the design approach consists of iterations of time consuming finite element method fem calculations in the time domain american petroleum institute 2002 det norske veritas dnv 2010 numerical methods in consideration with multi degrees of freedom problem and nonlinear force have been succeeded at evaluating dynamic characteristics of slender structures quite adequately on the other hand the analytical investigation into the basic mechanism determining dynamic characteristics of slender structures is yet to be fully understood better analytical understanding of dynamic tension without significant dependence on numerical calculations would have the following contributions if the result of fem calculation in the time domain ends up with axial compression analytical explicit solutions give valuable insights on how we should update design parameters based on sufficient reasoning analytical explicit solutions based on sufficient reasoning give better understanding of the effect of each design parameter separately this would give better explanation and reasonable verification of numerical calculations in this paper we aim for establishing a linear lumped mass model that gives sufficient explanations of the basic mechanism determining the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures the introduced lumped mass model reveals how well known key parameters in the industry are reproduced analytically and contributes to better analytical understanding of the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension the objective of this study is not to surrogate replace conventional numerical calculation but to establish basic understanding explaining the result of numerical calculation we address how reasonable the established analytical model is with comprehensive numerical fem calculations in addition the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is discussed in detail to explain the role of linear inertia force and nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension as we ignore nonlinear force in the formulation of the introduced lumped mass model the analytical model in this study is an extension of the authors previous work kanazawa et al 2018 this study focuses on free hanging that is the most simple configuration of slender structures in order to expand our results to the other configurations in the future starting with simple discussion in addition free hanging is a worth thinking example to investigate the core mechanisms because it is a representative configuration well known for vulnerability to the dynamic motion at the top end hill et al n d this study illustrates the occurrence of the axial compression to discuss the characteristics of dynamic tension this means we do not go into detail about the following discussions estimation of maximum tension of slender structures structural local nonlinearity of slender structures we introduce explicit analytical solutions on dynamic tension successfully owing to narrowing down a target to dynamic tension note that comprehensive estimation of dynamic characteristics including minimum bending radius and deformation of slender structures is the biggest advantage of numerical calculations in consideration with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear force and those perspectives are not in the scope of this study 2 the establishment of the analytical model 2 1 relationship between previous work and the analytical model in this paper representative studies in this field are divided into two groups one of them is the study based on comparisons of fem calculations in the time domain foyt et al 2007 kimiaei et al 2010 xia et al 2008 the motion of steel catenary risers scrs in response to the irregular oscillation at the top end has been calculated foyt et al 2007 they concluded that dynamic minimum tension of scr is proportional to the minimum downward velocity at the top end one of the representative studies xia et al 2008 explained the relationship of some design parameters and maximum von mises stresses although insights of their studies support the empirical insights which are already known in the industry those also suggest the limitation to establish a reasonable explanation of the mechanism determining dynamic tension this is because numerical calculations are not good at giving general explanation of the mechanism as the large number of design and environmental parameter has been the main challenge in the design process ismail et al 1992 the other group of previous studies is based on artificial neural networks anns or bio inspired algorithms quéau quéau et al 2015 2014a 2014b 2013 developed an anns model that is trained by a large number of the result of fem calculations in the time domain the developed anns model can estimate the dynamic tension of the free hanging riser based on environmental and design parameters without time consuming numerical calculations in the time domain on the other hand anns models do not explain the mechanism of the physical system which determines the dynamic tension of the riser they divided the whole calculated training data into several groups without physical reasonings in order to achieve high prediction accuracy of the anns model in addition the accuracy of the developed anns model for extrapolating conditions can be quite poor these insights imply that the limitation of the anns model in terms of the reasonable explanation of the mechanism determining dynamic tension approaches based on bio inspired algorithms vieira et al 2009 have similar advantages and disadvantages to that based on anns models namely they enable the effective optimum solution searching for an individual project out of a large number of fem calculations in the time domain on the other hand their approaches without physical reasonings to adjust parameters in the algorisms do not give sufficient understanding of the mechanism the analytical model introduced hereinafter compensates for the shortcomings of these two approaches all fem calculations in this study are performed by orcaflex orcina ltd 2019 orcaflex is one of the most proven softwares for dynamic analysis of offshore slender structures and operations in the time domain the post processing of orcaflex calculations are performed with the python and matlab interface to orcaflex heffernan 2016 2 2 static equilibriums of the analytical model the analytical model in this paper consists of three point masses that are connected by non deformable rods to each other as the concept of the analytical model is shown in fig 2 note that we do not consider the following phenomenon in this analytical model we confine degrees of freedom as shown in fig 2 because a lumped mass model having further degrees of freedom does not have an explicit analytical solution the number of rods in the introduced lumped mass model is always two in this study because of this reason and we can see this constraint is reasonable to explain the basic characteristic of the dynamic tension of free hanging riser verifying the introduced explicit solution with comprehensive orcaflex calculation in the section 3 hence the analytical model shown in fig 2 does not consider multi node flexural vibration we have checked that the effect of multi node flexural vibration on dynamic minimum tension dmt is marginal within the parameters representing basic design conditions in this paper the effect can be significant in deep water due to a large phase difference between the motion at the top end and dynamic tension at the touch down point tdp we put the total length of the free hanging riser from the top end to the static tdp as l and the unit mass of the riser as w the top point mass represents one fourth of the riser at the top side and the middle point mass represents half of the riser in the middle part of the riser the bottom point mass represents the mass of one fourth of the riser at the bottom and δ w δ w is the mass of the riser beyond static tdp which moves dynamically the distribution of the mass into three point masses is illustrated in fig 2 according to recommended practice for flexible pipe by american petroleum institute american petroleum institute 2002 the vessel motion at the top end of the free hanging riser transfers directly to the seabed and leads to compression at tdp therefore the introduced analytical model hereinafter aims for formulating the occurrence of axial compression with the ratio of the dynamic component of tension to the static component of tension f 2 t 2 at the bottom rod representing the riser near tdp in the author s previous study kanazawa et al 2018 f 2 t 2 has represented the characteristics of the occurrence of axial compression poorly the innovation in this study based on the authors previous study kanazawa et al 2018 is to release the point mass at tdp in the vertical direction in order to represent the occurrence of axial compression with f 2 t 2 properly avoiding excessive constraint at the point mass at tdp the static condition of the analytical model is shown in fig 3 putting the static horizontal force at the top end as t h and the static vertical force at the top end as t v following static force equilibriums are derived in the horizontal and vertical direction at each point mass to define the static angle of the top rod θ 1 the static angle of the bottom rod θ 2 the static tension of the top rod t 1 the static tension of the bottom rod t 2 and the normal reaction force t r which is applied at tdp due to δ weight we define the coefficient of the weight in water α which represents the ratio of the unit weight in water of the riser to the weight in air of the riser therefore 0 α 1 is always true the number of catenary γ t h α w g is defined for simplicity in this study then the following static equilibriums equ 1 5 in the horizontal and vertical direction are derived 1 t h t 1 sin θ 1 t 2 sin θ 2 α w g γ 2 t v α w g l 3 t 1 cos θ 1 t v α w g l 4 4 t 2 cos θ 2 t 1 cos θ 1 α w g l 2 5 t 2 cos θ 2 t r α w g l 4 δ we can rearrange equ 1 5 as following equ 6 9 6 t v α w g l 7 t 1 cos θ 1 3 t v 4 8 t 2 cos θ 2 t v 4 9 t r α w g δ then the following equ 10 13 are derived from equ 6 9 10 sin θ 1 t h t 1 11 cos θ 1 3 t v 4 t 1 12 sin θ 2 t h t 2 13 cos θ 2 t v 4 t 2 2 3 dynamic equilibriums of the analytical model let us move on to the definition of the dynamic condition of the analytical model as shown in fig 4 we assume the forced displacement x 0 z 0 is applied at the point mass at the top end we define the displacement of the point mass dynamic tension and angle of the riser in response to the displacement x 0 z 0 as follows f h the dynamic component of tension at the top end in the vertical direction f v the dynamic component of tension at the top end in the horizontal direction f 1 the dynamic component of tension of the top rod f 2 the dynamic component of tension of the bottom rod δ 1 the dynamic component of the angle of the top rod δ 2 the dynamic component of the angle of the bottom rod x 1 the displacement of the middle point mass in the horizontal direction z 1 the displacement of the middle point mass in the vertical direction the bottom point mass is fixed in the horizontal direction and moves only in the vertical direction induced by the applied displacement at the top end we define the displacement of the bottom point mass in the vertical direction as z 2 in addition we define the coefficient of the virtual mass β which represents the ratio of the virtual mass including added mass of the riser to the unit mass of the riser therefore β 1 is always true since the rod is non deformable following geometrical constraints equ 14 17 should be satisfied 14 l 2 sin θ 1 δ 1 l 2 sin θ 1 x 0 x 1 15 l 2 cos θ 1 δ 1 l 2 cos θ 1 z 0 z 1 16 l 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 l 2 sin θ 2 x 1 17 l 2 cos θ 2 δ 2 l 2 cos θ 2 z 1 z 2 assuming δ 1 and δ 2 are small enough 18 l 2 cos θ 1 δ 1 x 0 x 1 19 l 2 sin θ 1 δ 1 z 0 z 1 20 l 2 cos θ 2 δ 2 x 1 21 l 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 z 1 z 2 then we can derive the following equations 22 3 t 2 δ 1 t 1 δ 2 8 t 1 t 2 l t v x 0 23 t 2 δ 1 t 1 δ 2 2 t 1 t 2 l t h z 0 z 2 then the following equations are derived 24 δ 1 4 t 1 l t v x 0 t 1 l t h z 0 z 2 25 δ 2 4 t 2 l t v x 0 3 t 2 l t h z 0 z 2 then the displacement of the middle point mass is derived as follows 26 x 1 1 2 x 0 3 t v 8 t h z 0 z 2 27 z 1 2 t h t v x 0 1 2 3 z 0 z 2 let us move on to the establishment of dynamic equilibriums in fig 4 we do not consider nonlinear drag force and we assume the coefficient of the virtual mass β is independent of the direction of the motion dynamic equilibriums equ 28 32 are derived as follows 28 t v f v t 1 f 1 cos θ 1 δ 1 α w g l 4 β w l 4 z 0 29 t 1 f 1 sin θ 1 δ 1 t 2 f 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 β w l 2 x 1 30 t 1 f 1 cos θ 1 δ 1 t 2 f 2 cos θ 2 δ 2 α w g l 2 β w l 2 z 1 31 t 2 f 2 sin θ 2 δ 2 t h f h 32 t 2 f 2 cos θ 2 2 t r α w g l 4 δ β w l 4 δ z 2 assuming δ 1 δ 2 f 1 t 1 and f 2 t 2 are small enough the equations are described as follows by eliminating terms of static equilibriums following rearrangements equ 33 34 are useable since we assume the regularly forced oscillation at the top end of the riser for simplicity note that the frequency of the oscillation is defined as ω 33 x 0 ω 2 x 0 34 z 0 ω 2 z 0 therefore following rearrangements equ 35 39 are derived

we can rearrange the solution as follows with the number of the catenary γ 41 f 1 t 1 β α ω 2 g 4 3 μ γ l x 0 1 4 δ 3 l μ z 0 42 f 2 t 2 β α ω 2 g 1 4 δ l μ 4 γ 3 l x 0 z 0 note that μ is defined as follows 43 μ 3 3 l 4 γ 2 3 3 l 4 γ 2 8 δ l equ 41 and 42 are the solution to the introduced analytical model f 1 t 1 and f 2 t 2 are the ratio of the dynamic component to the static component of the rod tension note that the introduced lumped mass model aims for evaluating the occurrence of axial compression with f 2 t 2 representing the ratio of the dynamic component to the static component of the tension near tdp the introduced analytical model has four non dimensional key parameters on dynamic tension namely the amplification factor β α which is the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end ω 2 x 0 g and ω 2 z 0 g the static top angle θ 1 tan 1 γ l and δ l the role of δ l in the analytical model is to adjust the effect of how to distribute actual riser weight in the simplified analytical model with only three point masses therefore the discussion about the quantitative value of δ l has little meaning for explaining the mechanism of determination of dynamic tension due to the simplicity of the analytical model since we can see that the analytical solution with δ l 1 25 is qualitative in a good agreement with the results of comprehensive orcaflex calculations presented hereinafter we use δ l 1 25 as a default value of the introduced analytical model in this study even though the drastic simplification and linearization have been carried out in the derivation of the introduced analytical result f 2 t 2 well represents the qualitative effect of key design parameters on dynamic tension as described in the next section on the other hand we should note that discussion on the quantitative value of f 2 t 2 is beyond the scope of the introduced analytical result 3 verification of the analytical model so far we introduced the analytical model to estimate the effect of key parameters on the dynamic tension of free hanging riser hereinafter we verify how the analytical model in this paper works to estimate the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension we compare the introduced analytical solution to the result of orcaflex fem calculations in the time domain if the analytical solution can capture the result of orcaflex fem calculations qualitatively that means the analytical model we introduced in this paper is useful for the estimation of the effect of key parameters on dynamic tension and explains the basic mechanism to determine the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures first of all we explain the calculation conditions of orcaflex model for verification the calculation conditions in this paper are based on our previous work kanazawa et al 2018 we apply the regularly forced oscillation at the top end of the riser the oscillation amplitude increases gradually for over 300 s in order to avoid the impact load on the riser the total simulation time is 600s the convergence tests for the segment length and time step of numerical integration are performed and we have checked segment length and time step do not affect effective tension at the top end if segment length is no more than 2 0 m and time step is no more than 0 10s in this study the segment length is 1 5 m and the time step is 0 02s the number of elements of the analytical model for comparison in the figure is always two as we introduced in the previous section the static configuration of the riser of which static top angle is θ t a r g e t is calculated with orcaflex as follows at first we fix the hanging point of the riser of which segment length is 1 5 m and the total length is 1260 m next we adjust the anchor position of the riser in the horizontal direction in order to let the calculated static top angle close to the target static top angle θ t a r g e t in the static calculation if the gap between the calculated static top angle and θ t a r g e t is smaller than 0 1 deg we define the model as the static configuration of which static top angle is θ t a r g e t subsequently we redefine the anchor position truncating the riser on the seabed to make the total length of the riser 1 2 times the length from the hanging point to the static tdp parameters of the representative model are shown in table 1 we focus on dmt which is related to the occurrence of the axial compression of the riser in the 600s simulation result we define dmt as the minimum tension of the riser in the last period of the oscillation the water depth is 500 m the density of the internal fluid is 1030 0 kg m3 an elastic seabed model is applied in the orcaflex calculations the normal seabed stiffness is 100 0 kg m m3 we start with the verification of the effect of maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle we use only one type of riser specification which is shown in table 2 as value 2 we prepare 7 types of different riser configurations that have different static top angles from 5 to 35 in the step of 5 the oscillation amplitude is from 0 1m to 3 0m the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 6 5s and the oscillation direction is horizontal or vertical namely we calculate 7 types of static top angles 210 types of the forced oscillation at the top end 1470 types of orcaflex calculation model we plot the results on maximum normalized acceleration static top angle plane as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 fig 6 shows the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end and fig 7 shows the results in response to the vertical oscillation the calculation condition of which dmt is always positive is plotted in green and the other compression is observed is plotted in red therefore the boundary between red plots and green plots represents the boundary condition of the occurrence of axial compression calculated with orcaflex the contour of the dotted lines shows the f 2 t 2 analytical solution in this paper note that the difference between calculation conditions of figs 6 and 7 is only the direction of forced oscillation at the top end of the riser in figs 6 and 7 we can see that the analytical model is quantitatively in poor agreement with the results of orcaflex in the time domain quantitative estimation is beyond the scope of the introduced analytical model since we completely ignore nonlinear drag force and multi degree of freedom of the riser motion the point is qualitative agreement of the analytical model with the results of orcaflex in the time domain we can see that the qualitative agreement in figs 6 and 7 with comparing the f 2 t 2 analytical contour and the boundary between red and green points the next discussion is the verification of the effect of the maximum acceleration at the top end and the amplification factor in the water on dmt we use only one static top angle 15deg in addition we prepare 27 risers which have different amplification factors in water with combining design parameters as shown in table 2 the oscillation amplitude is from 0 5m to 2 0m the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 8 0s and the oscillation direction is horizontal or vertical namely we calculate 27 types of riser 126 types of forced oscillation at the top end 3402 types of orcaflex calculation model we plot the results on maximum acceleration at the top end the amplification factor in water plane as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end and fig 9 shows those in response to the vertical oscillation the contour of the dotted lines shows the analytical solution in this paper we can see that the introduced analytical model is qualitatively in good agreement with the results of orcaflex 4 discussion of the effect of inertia and drag forces on the dynamic tension we verified that the introduced analytical model is useful to explain the qualitative effect of key parameters on dynamic tension in the previous section however previous researches foyt et al 2007 kanazawa et al 2018 have suggested that the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is technically not neglectable or dominant compared to inertia force in some calculation cases therefore further investigations are needed to explain the relationship between the inertia component and the nonlinear drag component of dynamic tension first of all we introduce π i the ratio of inertia component to gravity force and π d the ratio of nonlinear drag component to gravity force as follows 44 π i β α ω 2 a g 45 π d 1 2 c d ρ w d ω a 2 α w g 2 c d π 1 α α ω a 2 g d we defined f 1 and f 2 in the introduction of the analytical model here we define a corresponding parameter f and t at any selected point on the riser let t be the static tension at selected point of the riser and f m i n be dmt of the riser then f t 0 is defined as follows 46 f t 1 f m i n t morison s equation j r et al 1950 orcina ltd 2019 considers that the force on the vertical cylinder in the flow consists of an inertia component which is proportional to the acceleration of the flow and nonlinear drag component which is proportional to the squared velocity of the flow similarly we assume that dmt min f t is determined as follows with π i and π d w i is a weighting factor for π i and w d is that for π d 47 min f t w i π i 2 w d π d 2 note that min f t is always positive since f t is always negative namely 48 w i π i 2 w d π d 2 min f t 2 this suggests that the contour of dmt of the riser should be a quadrant of an oval on the π i π d plane if all assumptions here are true we call this hypothesis hypothesis see fig 10 we can verify the hypothesis with comprehensive orcaflex fem calculations in the time domain we calculate orcaflex fem models which have different riser specifications and different forced oscillations at the top end of the riser we plot the result on the π i π d plane in green if the effective tension is always positive and in red if not this means the boundary between red and green points is the boundary of compression on the π d π i plane to clarify the contribution of nonlinear drag and inertia forces to dynamic tension the orcaflex fem calculations for verification here is more comprehensive than those in the previous section we calculate the motion of 16 different risers which have different drag coefficient in the normal direction different added mass coefficient unit mass and outer diameter as shown in table 3 the oscillation period is from 3 5s to 12 0s the oscillation amplitude is from 0 1m to 4 0m for the horizontal oscillation and from 0 1m to 2 0m for the vertical oscillation namely the number of oscillation is 143 for the vertical oscillation and 195 for the horizontal oscillation the number of calculation is 143 195 16 5408 we plot the results on the π i π d plane as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the calculation pattern of which dmt is always positive is plotted in green and the other compression pattern is plotted in red the results in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end are shown in fig 11 and that in response to the vertical oscillation at the top end are shown in fig 12 on the π i π d plane the oscillation amplitude at the top end is used to calculate π i and π d of each orcaflex calculation we can see that the boundary between red and green points is almost parallel to the horizontal axis of the graph in fig 11 this result suggests that the effect of nonlinear drag force on dynamic tension is marginal in response to the horizontal oscillation at the top end therefore the estimation by the introduced analytical model without considering nonlinear drag force is quite reasonable in response to the horizontal oscillation on the other hand the shape of the boundary in fig 12 between red and green points is a part of the oval as the hypothesis this implies the hypothesis is verified by orcaflex fem calculations and that the improvement toward the origin on π i and π d plane is effective if the oscillation at the top end is in the vertical direction 5 conclusions we have developed a linear lumped mass model that explains the basic mechanism determining the dynamic tension of free hanging slender structures comprehensive orcaflex fem calculations have been performed and we have verified that the analytical model can capture the basic characteristic determining dynamic tension this paper has clarified the following basic mechanisms three key parameters on dynamic tension the ratio of the coefficient of the virtual mass to the coefficient of the weight in water the maximum acceleration at the top end and the static top angle are explicitly derived through reasonable formulations the effect of nonlinear force and multi degrees of freedom on dynamic tension is not neglectable quantitively on the other hand the introduced linear solution succeeds at explaining the qualitative effect of key parameters on dynamic tension we introduced two non dimensional numbers in this study in order to explain the contribution of the linear inertia force and the nonlinear drag force π i represents the ratio of inertia force component to gravity force and π d represents the ratio of the nonlinear drag force component to gravity force we revealed the boundary of the occurrence of the axial compression is a quadrant of an oval on the π i π d plane the design improvement toward the origin on π i and π d plane is effective if the oscillation at the top end is in the vertical direction and the effect of nonlinear drag force on dmt is marginal if the oscillation at the top end is in the horizontal direction the works presented in this study contribute to the following improvement of the riser design in the initial planning stage of slender structures the findings of this study aid the comprehensive understanding of the numerical calculation results while numerical calculations in the time and frequency domain have succeeded in evaluating the dynamic tension accurately they are inferior in isolating factors composing the results and acquiring reasonable insights on how to update parameters the analytical insights of key parameter s contribution to dynamic tension behavior supports the engineer s iterative design

21357,analytic method for nonlinear wave generation by a wavemaker that is free of 2nd order limitation inherent to existing wavemaker theories is proposed the method is based on the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation and the nonlinear boundary condition at the wavemaker advantages offered by the nls model allowed simplification of the expressions for determination of the wavemaker driving signal and thus made them easily applicable in practice the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker driving signal are calculated from the complex surface elevation envelope obtained as a solution of the nls equation at the prescribed location in the wave flume the domain of applicability of the generation method was determined on the basis of numerous experiments in the wave flume as well as numerical simulations using a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt a very good generation of the required wave train shape was obtained for sufficiently narrow banded spectra in both deep water and intermediate depth conditions the generation of the sheared current due to oscillatory wavemaker motion has been discussed keywords wavemaker theory third order wave generation nonlinear schrödinger equation nls 1 introduction computations of evolution in time and space of unidirectional nonlinear deep and intermediate depth wave trains are performed using different approaches that range from simpler weakly nonlinear water waves models that contain different levels of simplifying approximations up to diverse fully nonlinear solvers the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation suggested by zakharov 1968 and hasimoto and ono 1972 is the simplest model that accounts for weak nonlinearity of water waves the nls equation is limited to moderate wave steepness ε k 0 a 0 k 0 and a 0 being the carrier wave number and surface elevation amplitude respectively and narrow banded spectra of the surface elevation the limited applicability of the nls equation to computation of evolution of nonlinear surface water wave trains has been demonstrated experimentally see e g shemer et al 1998 despite these limitations the nls equation remains an attractive theoretical model that admits solution by inverse scattering transform osborne 2010 it is frequently applied for investigation of diverse nonlinear phenomena in water waves plasma physics optics and other fields in view of the strong interest in nls equation from theoretical point of view its experimental validation in wave flumes is important attempts were made to examine experimentally several analytical solutions of nls equation chabchoub et al 2011 2012 such as kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 peregrine 1983 and akhmediev et al 1987 breathers the numerical solutions of the nls equation for different wave trains were validated against more complicated theoretical water waves models and against measurements in the wave flume shemer et al 1998 2002 chabchoub et al 2013 rozenman et al 2019 experimental validation of the solutions of the nls equation requires accurate excitation of the wave trains by wavemakers usually of piston or paddle type application of the simplest motion of the wavemaker according to the linear wave theory havelock f 1929 biesel and suquet 1951 ursell et al 1960 leads to appearance of the unwanted spurious free propagating waves at the 2nd and higher harmonics schäffer 1996 those waves contaminate the wave field in the flume even at very large distances from the wavemaker the existence of those waves complicates significantly experimental validation of nonlinear wave models especially for waves propagating in intermediate water depth conditions k 0 h 0 7 h is the mean water depth nonlinear wavemaker theory is needed to avoid appearance of the spurious waves allowing minimization of the deviation of the generated wave field from the prescribed initial conditions accurate wave generation in numerical wave tanks based on computational fluid dynamics cfd represents an important practical problem as well windt et al 2019 have shown that existing approaches to wave generation in cfd are of limited capabilities and robustness placement of the fixed or floating structures in the numerical domain that reflect the incident wave back to the wavemaker contributes additional complication for dealing with practical engineering problems the method of coupling analytical and numerical solutions named relaxation zone was suggested by jacobsen et al 2012 alternatively a set of analytic wave generating boundary conditions higuera et al 2013 higuera 2020 was found to be efficient in some cases both approaches are inapplicable in physical experiments since the waves are generated artificially taking advantage of the numerical procedures given that cfd models are usually used for complementation of the laboratory setups the moving boundaries and deforming meshes are required to replicate physical wavemakers higuera et al 2015 it should be emphasized that the nonlinear wavemaker theories are also needed to drive the motion of the numerical wavemakers for avoiding excitation of the unwanted spurious free waves several analytical nonlinear wavemaker theories were suggested the transfer function approach havelock f 1929 biesel and suquet 1951 ursell et al 1960 was employed by schäffer 1996 to extend the theory to the 2nd order in wave steepness the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion was introduced to avoid excitation of spurious waves lengthy expressions for this correction were derived by schäffer 1996 from the complex spectrum of free waves defined at the wavemaker location alternative 2nd order approach to nonlinear wave generation based on the zakharov model was suggested by khait and shemer 2019a this method allowed mathematical simplification of the calculation of the nonlinear wavemaker driving signal as compared to the theory of schäffer 1996 while retaining the accuracy the 2nd order theory of schäffer 1996 was investigated by sriram et al 2015 in generation of broad banded focused wave trains under laboratory conditions in both intermediate and deep water regions the temporal evolution of the selected harmonics was analyzed using the inverse fast fourier transform ifft to study the propagation of the spurious long waves aknin and spinneken 2017 validated experimentally the wave generation theories by schäffer 1996 and zhang and schäffer 2007 in shallow intermediate and depth water conditions it was established that these approaches are only partially successful in suppression of the spurious waves several empirical corrections were suggested to decrease further the unwanted waves content houtani et al 2018a 2018b suggested a numerical approach based on schäffer 1996 wave generation theory and higher order spectral model hosm and applied this approach for generation of 2d wave fields in a basin a similar 2nd order wave generation method in hosm was applied by hasan et al 2018 to study the wind effect on the nonlinear focusing wave train taking into account the jeffrey s sheltering mechanism touboul et al 2008 a comprehensive experimental study on accuracy of different nonlinear wavemaker theories was carried out by eldrup and andersen 2019 it was demonstrated that only wave generation method based on stream function theory zhang and schäffer 2007 is acceptable in shallow water and even in intermediate water depth this is explained by significant importance of 3rd and higher order contributions to the wavemaker motion when approaching the shallow water regime those effects are not taken into account in the 2nd order accurate theory of schäffer 1996 moreover the most accurate method among all considered has demonstrated certain deviations in wave shape when irregular waves are generated it was also reported that this method is quite time consuming when applied to the irregular waves limited accuracy and significant complexity of existing analytic wave generation methods prompted development of empirical and numerical algorithms for iterative adjustment of the wavemaker driving signal shemer et al 2007 fernández et al 2014 stagonas et al 2018 khait and shemer 2019b those approaches however proved to be substantially less effective in shallow and intermediate water depths the so called nonlinear fourier analysis was recently offered to improve the accuracy of the available analytic wave generation theories yim et al 2017 mohtat et al 2018 to the best of author s knowledge this approach has not yet been verified in wave generation solution of the nls equation is given as a complex envelope thus an additional step converting the nls solution into the complex surface elevation spectrum is needed to apply the existing analytic wavemaker theories schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a to circumvent this intermediate step the 2nd order accurate method for computation of the wavemaker motion directly from the complex envelope solution of the nls equation was proposed by khait and shemer 2019c this method demonstrated a good performance in deep water wave generation however quite significant inaccuracies have been reported when waves were generated in intermediate water depth close to the limits of applicability of the involved 2nd order approximations the current paper is aimed at improvement of the accuracy of the method presented in khait and shemer 2019c to extend its applicability to intermediate water depth retaining high wave generation accuracy the 3rd order accuracy of the nls equation allowed extension of the wavemaker boundary condition to incorporate the 3rd order contributions such improvement of the wave generation approach is expected to increase the accuracy when waves are excited in intermediate water depth beyond the validity of the 2nd order accurate methods schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a 2019c the 3rd order accurate method suggested in the paper exploits the complex envelope solution of the nls equation as an input parameter simplifying the calculation of the wavemaker displacements 2 formulation of the method in the simplest case when only linear waves are considered surface elevation of an arbitrary wave group can be expressed through the complex envelope a x t using the following general expression η x t 1 2 a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t c c here k 0 and ω 0 are the carrier wave number and angular frequency the complex envelope a x t determines variation of both instantaneous local amplitude and phase of the wave in physical coordinates x and t several formulations of the wave propagation problem are possible in the current paper the spatial propagation of waves is considered i e the complex envelope as a function of time is assumed to be known at x 0 as initial condition it is required to find the envelope for all other spatial coordinates x as was mentioned above the weakly nonlinear evolution of the narrow banded wave trains is governed by the nls equation the spatial form of the nls equation in an arbitrary water depth is taken as a theoretical model shemer et al 1998 chabchoub et al 2013 1 i a ξ α 2 a τ 2 β a 2 a 0 the dimensionless scaled variables

respectively while fluid velocity is v ϕ the term ϕ 0 o ε 2 in 5a introduces the sheared current due to propagation of nonlinear waves note that the mean position of the wavemaker cannot deviate from its initial location which does not allow excitation of the current therefore the term ϕ 0 is not considered in the paper i e it is assumed ϕ 0 0 the terms ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 as well as η 1 η 2 and η 3 represent the contributions of the 1st order free the 2nd and the 3rd order bound waves respectively the nls equation was derived assuming slow variation of the envelope a ξ τ in both time and space if this assumption is not strictly fulfilled a higher order correction to the 1st order free wave appears in the solution of the nls equation this correction is designated as ϕ a 2 in 5a despite appearance of ϕ a 2 at the 2nd order it does not contribute to the bound waves therefore it should be considered as a separate term to generate the wave train accurately the nonlinear velocity field given by 5a should be introduced by the wavemaker at x 0 the terms in 5a and 5b can be expressed following mei 1989 6a ϕ 1 a 0 g ω 0 cosh k 0 h z cosh k 0 h re i a e i k 0 x ω 0 t 6b ϕ a 2 a 0 ω 0 k 0

is now possible to substitute the velocity potential 6 and the solution for the 1st order wavemaker motion x 1 15 into 13e it is found from 13e that assumption x d 2 0 leads to generation of not only the spurious propagating wave components but also the sheared mean current u c 19 ϕ d 2 x x 0 u c p d 2 z re a x 0 2 e i 2 ω 0 t the physical origin of u c is similar to the stokes drift however the current u c exists only in the presence of the wave generating boundary and constitutes an addition to the classical stokes drift the value of u c is strongly varying with depth as follows 20 u c a 0

from 13f following similar algorithm contrary to the 2nd order problem at the 3rd order the mean current does not appear however in this case the spurious waves are excited at two frequencies ω 0 and 3ω 0 23 ϕ d 3 x x 0 p d 3 z re a x 0 3 e i ω 0 t e 3 i ω 0 t for convenience these contributions are designated by additional superscripts and see 14 application of the method from appendix b with

the driving signal the complex envelope a a t x 0 should be obtained first the natural procedure for that is the numerical solution of the nls equation 1 however the suggested wave generation approach can be applied even if the surface elevation is given explicitly η η t x 0 in this case the complex envelope can be constructed using the hilbert transform 25 a t η t i h η t a 0 exp i ω 0 t where h is the hilbert transform 26 h η τ t 1 π p v η τ τ t d τ here pv stands for the cauchy principal value the carrier frequency ω 0 in 25 can be chosen arbitrary but usually it is the central frequency of the free waves spectrum at the next step the complex envelope a t x 0 is used in 14 to calculate the variation of the wavemaker displacement as a function of time x x t application of the complex envelope approach considerably simplifies computations of the wavemaker driving signal compared to the methods based on the spectral description of the surface elevation see e g schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a 3 analysis of the wavemaker motion at different orders 3 1 generation of monochromatic free wave to analyze different regimes of the wave generation the simplest monochromatic free wave is first considered the complex wave envelope in this case is constant a 1 variation of a 0 leads to different wave steepness ε k 0 a 0 while k 0 is dependent on the water depth h and angular frequency ω 0 according to 4 the shape of the wave incorporating contributions of different orders calculated using 7a 7c is examined in fig 2 a and b panel a is plotted for the deep water conditions i e k 0 h 3 while panel b corresponds to the intermediate depth 0 3 k 0 h 3 closer to the shallow water even for extremely steep wave of ε 0 3 propagating in deep water the 2nd and the 3rd order accurate wave shapes η 1 η 2 and η 1 η 2 η 3 respectively are practically identical in contrast in intermediate water depth the 3rd order accurate wave shape is notably different from that of the 2nd order in this case the wave steepness was reduced to ε 0 1 in order to satisfy the applicability of the stokes perturbation method this analysis shows that the 3rd order contributions to the wavemaker motion may potentially be important in the intermediate depth conditions panels c and d in fig 2 show the velocities of the wavemaker computed according to the suggested wave generation method and needed to produce the wave shapes shown in panels a and b for brevity we consider here only a paddle type wavemaker the contributions to the wavemaker velocity at different orders of ε are given as separate curves as expected in deep water the 3rd order contribution to the wavemaker motion is negligibly small as compared to that at the 2nd order on the contrary in intermediate depth the 3rd order correction to the wavemaker motion is comparable in amplitude to the corresponding 2nd order one cf panels c and d the paddle displacements given in panels e and f confirm this observation fig 3 examines amplitudes of the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker motion as function of ε and h at the 2nd order panels a and b the complex amplitudes b 2 and b d 2 are shifted by π interplaying with each other in deep water b d 2 is dominant b 2 0 for k 0 h whereas in intermediate water depth b 2 b d 2 at a certain water depth these terms cancel each other leading to the zero 2nd order contribution to the wavemaker motion zero correction the depth corresponding to the zero correction regime is found to be dependent on the hinge location l fig 1 i e on the wavemaker geometry cf fig 3 a and b similar situation is also observed in panels e and f depicting the 3rd order amplitudes b d 3 contributing at the frequency ω 0 note that b d 3 consists of several terms having phase shift of zero or π see appendix d a quite different situation arises at the frequency 3ω 0 due to amplitudes b 3 and b d 3 in this case the zero correction is observed for paddle wavemaker panel d but not for the piston one panel c to examine the reasons for that we add the third dimensionless parameter l h characterizing the relative location of the hinge fig 1 and plot the value of b 3 b d 3 in fig 4 it is seen from this plot that when l h 1 i e the hinge is below the bottom at the distance approximately equal to the water depth the 3rd order correction to the wavemaker motion almost disappears at frequency 3ω 0 for any water depth when l h 1 the zero correction regime exists while it does not appear for l h 1 in general fig 3 demonstrates that decrease in water depth especially when k 0 h 0 6 requires more significant nonlinear corrections to the wavemaker dynamics the dimensionless value of the nonlinear term coefficient β in 1 is plotted in fig 5 for different water depths k 0 h the coefficient β is positive in deep water and becomes negative with decrease of the depth at k 0 h 1 36 the cubic term in 1 vanishes leading to the linear wave train evolution equation note that for k 0 h 1 36 the coefficient β in 1 is negative corresponding to defocusing regime mei 1989 shemer et al 1998 the intervals of the zero correction wave generation are also depicted in fig 5 in accordance with fig 3 it is seen that the 2nd order zero correction zone is separated from that of the 3rd order while β 0 is located in between these two areas to validate the wave generation method the water depth should be selected such that the nonlinear effects are significant the values of k 0 h denoted by two dashed and dash dotted vertical lines in fig 5 and corresponding to deep water and intermediate depth were thus selected for further investigation another nonlinear phenomenon considered in this research is the generation of the current u c it is of practical importance to assess and compare the values and the profile of u c 20 with the classical stokes drift u s 21 fig 6 a shows the profiles of the normalized velocity of the current excited by the piston wavemaker wave steepness ε 0 3 three dimensionless water depths are considered u c and u s are given by solid and dashed lines respectively near the bottom the velocity of the stokes drift is comparable to that of the current generated by the wavemaker however closer to the free surface the stokes drift has higher values of the velocity the biggest velocity difference near the free surface is observed in deep water while in the intermediate depth this difference is relatively small around 30 in the case of the paddle wavemaker see fig 6 b the profiles of u c and u s are qualitatively different the value of u c near the bottom is always equal to zero irrespective of the water depth selected while the stokes drift velocity u s at the bottom increases with reduction of the water depth the profiles of u c and u s are almost identical in deep water except for the near free surface region where u s u c reduction of the water depth results in a rapid growth of the current generated by the wavemaker to values much higher than the corresponding stokes drift however for the smallest considered water depth k 0 h 0 56 the required paddle inclinations become physically unachievable limiting the applicability of the hinged type wavemaker in intermediate depth regime the blue line in fig 6 b corresponding to the water depth k 0 h 1 leads to paddle inclinations around 25 3 2 generation of a broad banded gaussian shaped wave train applicability of the underlying nls equation is restricted in terms of the allowed spectral bandwidth therefore in this section we analyze accuracy of the suggested method in generation of wave packets with different spectral bandwidth consider gaussian shaped wave train defined by the complex envelope 27 a x f t exp t m t 0 2 exp i k 0 x f the phase shift given by the complex exponent in 27 is introduced to specify the appearance of the steepest wave crest exactly at the coordinate x f in this section assume x f 0 parameter m defines width of the spectrum such that lower value of m produces wider spectrum t 0 and k 0 are carrier wave period and carrier wave number respectively carrier angular frequency is ω 0 2π t 0 to evaluate spectral width introduce frequency range δω such that energy levels within ω 0 δ ω 2 ω ω 0 δ ω 2 are higher or equal to 1 2 of the spectrum maximum to find δω consider fourier transform of 7a after substitution 27 assuming x 0 28 η ˆ ω f η 1 t a 0 m t 0 2 2 exp π 2 m 2 1 ω ω 0 2 1 exp 4 π 2 m 2 ω ω 0 solution of the equation η ˆ ω a 0 m t 0 2 2 2 1 2 gives the sought spectral width 29 δ ω ω 0 ln 4 π m wave generation method proposed in khait and shemer 2019a based on the zakharov s theory is free of restrictions on the spectral width therefore the 2nd order accurate wavemaker motion x z 1 2 computed using the aforementioned method will be exploited as a reference in the current analysis the 2nd order accurate wavemaker motion computed by the method based on the nls equation is denoted as x n l s 1 2 both x z 1 2 t and x n l s 1 2 t provide variation of the wavemaker displacement in time consider maximum displacement of the wavemaker x max t x t accuracy of the nls based wave generation method is thus characterized by the divergence x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 fig 7 investigates dependence of x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 on the dimensionless water depth k 0 h and the spectral width δω ω 0 the wave steepness is taken as k 0 a 0 0 3 as seen from panel b piston wavemaker has the narrowest allowed spectral width δω ω 0 0 4 near the border between deep water and intermediate water depth at approximately k 0 h 2 increase of the spectral width beyond 0 4 value may lead to significant inaccuracies in wave generation interestingly both increase and reduction of the water depth k 0 h lead to widening of the allowed spectral width paddle wavemaker studied in panel a performs quite similar to the piston except for the small water depths where large discrepancies are observed however at those depths operation of paddle wavemaker is limited because of large displacements of the wave generating surface not possible due to its hinge fixation it is of practical interest to see the dependency of x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 on the spectral width parameter m explicitly present in 27 see fig 8 it can be suggested that the accuracy of the wave generation method based on the nls equation is acceptable if m 1 for both piston and paddle wavemakers a small deterioration of the generation accuracy by the piston wavemaker can be reported at water depths close to shallow water cf figs 7 b and 8 b 4 experimental and numerical verification of the method 4 1 wave generation in deep water to validate the proposed wave generation method in deep water conditions experiments were carried out in the 18 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep wave flume the displacement of the paddle wavemaker was controlled by a computer wave energy absorbing 3 m long sloping beach was installed to reduce the effect of the wave reflection resistance type wave gauges were used to measure the surface elevation variation with time at the prescribed locations the wave gauges were supported by a computer controlled instrument carriage allowing their accurate positioning along the wave flume the entire experimental procedure including the carriage positioning wave generation and data acquisition was controlled by a single labview program ensuring precise synchronization the outputs of the wave gauges and instantaneous coordinates of the paddles were sampled at the rate of t 0 128 where t 0 is the carrier wave period excitation of both narrow banded and broad banded gaussian shaped wave trains 27 is considered for validation of the wave generation method the target wave train is to be generated at the focusing coordinate x f 4 m the deep water conditions are satisfied by selection of the following wave train parameters t 0 0 7 s ω 0 8 976 λ 0 0 765 m k 0 h 4 928 the spectral width parameter m was varied within the range 0 5 m 3 steepness of the wave train is controlled at the wavemaker location by varying the value of the constant a 0 defined in 2 30 ε 0 max k 0 a 0 a x 0 t where a x 0 t is the complex envelope at the wavemaker location the steepness was varying within 0 05 ε 0 0 25 wave trains were generated as follows first the target complex envelope 27 was defined at x f 4 m as the initial condition the nls equation 1 was then solved numerically using the method of lo and mei 1985 to obtain the complex envelope at the wavemaker location x 0 expression 14 was used to calculate the 3rd order accurate wavemaker motion needed for excitation of the designed wave train however as argued above the 2nd order wavemaker driving signal is sufficient in the deep water conditions see fig 2 surface elevation variation with time was measured by the wave gauges at two locations x p 2 m and x p 4 m five independent experiments were conducted for every individual wavemaker driving signal to demonstrate the repeatability of the results the results of the experiments confirmed that the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion needed for excitation of the steep wave train in deep water is relatively weak in the considered case it is lower than 5 of the 1st order wavemaker displacement see fig 9 a the measured ensemble averaged surface elevation of the narrow banded wave train is compared in fig 9 b and c with the numerical solutions of the nls equation it is seen that the surface elevation of the nls model which includes both 1st order free 2nd and 3rd order bound waves computed according to 7a 7c agrees very well with the measurements it should be emphasized that the agreement in this case is almost independent of the distance from the wavemaker the power spectrum s 2 ω j was calculated where s ω j is the surface elevation amplitude spectrum j 1 n n is the number of harmonics comparison of the ensemble averaged power spectra with the numerical solutions of the nls equation given in fig 10 demonstrates quite small errors at the meaningful free and bound harmonics for both values of x p as well as very good repeatability of the experiments as expected in deep water the 3rd order bound waves are significantly weaker as compared to the 2nd order bound waves similarly comparison of the measurements with the numerical solution of the nls equation for steep broad banded wave train is carried out in figs 11 and 12 the target wave train in this case consists of numerous harmonics resulting in strong dispersion that manifests itself in the wave train focusing at x f 4 m cf fig 11 b and c the degree of agreement of the measurements with the nls solution varies with the distance from the wavemaker in the vicinity of the wavemaker x p 2 m the agreement is reasonable confirming the accuracy of the adopted wave generation method farther away from the wavemaker at x p 4 m the nls equation solution deviates substantially from the measurements note that nls equation is formally valid for vanishing spectral width the growing with the distance deviation of the experimental results from the nls solution thus demonstrates limited applicability of the nls equation to model the spatial evolution of a broad banded wave train fig 12 shows power spectra calculated for the surface elevations presented in fig 11 in the vicinity of the wavemaker the solution of the nls equation reproduces the location of the spectral peak as well as the bandwidth reasonably well however already close to the wavemaker the measured spectrum exhibits asymmetry relative to the peak location this asymmetry is absent in the nls solution farther away from the wavemaker at x p 4 m the quality of the nls solution deteriorates dramatically the measured power spectrum is significantly narrower as compared to the theoretical result the peak downshifting in the measurements is absent in the nls solution the results presented in figs 9 12 thus clearly demonstrate that the spectral width significantly affects the accuracy of the nls model and consequently the wave generation method based on it to estimate the accuracy of the wave generation method for multiple wave trains with different parameters the dimensionless root mean square rms deviation between the measured and the predicted by the nls model power spectra was calculated 31 r m s s n l s 2 s e x p 2 max s n l s 2 1 max j s n l s j 2 j n s n l s j 2 s exp j 2 2 n fig 13 a examines the rms deviation of the spectra at x p 2 m as a function of the spectral width parameter m and of the wave steepness ε 0 based on the measurements in the vicinity of the wavemaker it is seen that the deviation is almost independent of wave steepness ε 0 in agreement with the previous observations cf figs 9 and 10 however the accuracy of the nls based wave generation method is reduced with the reduction of m and thus wider spectra at larger distance from the wavemaker and for the narrow banded wave trains m 3 and m 2 fig 13 b the characteristic deviations between the experiment and the nls computations remain independent of the wave steepness however a significant deterioration of the nls model accuracy with ε 0 is observed for the wave trains with a broader power spectrum m 1 in agreement with fig 8 4 2 wave generation in intermediate water depth validation of the method in intermediate water depth requires significant reduction of the water depth not possible in the wave flume used for experiments the increase of the carrier wave period implies displacements of the wavemaker plane beyond the mechanical limitations of the paddle wavemaker thus for validation of the wave generation method in intermediate depth conditions the fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt based on the boundary element method bem was utilized the description of the numerical methods used in nwt is presented in grilli et al 1989 grilli and svendsen 1990 grilli and subramanya 1996 careful validation of the nwt in generation of the surface water waves by the piston wavemaker was performed in khait and shemer 2019a 2019b 2019c for brevity further details on the nwt are omitted here as shown in fig 3 the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker motion are most significant in the intermediate water depth the decrease of the effective water depth k 0 h was done by selection of the mean water depth h 0 036 m within the intermediate depth regime the carrier wave period remained t 0 0 7 s yielding the carrier wave length λ 0 0 395 m see 4 and the dimensionless water depth k 0 h 0 572 corresponding to the most problematic wave generation regime schäffer 1996 the carrier wave steepness was taken as ε 0 0 06 see 30 providing applicability of the stokes perturbation expansion the narrow banded wave train with m 3 is considered the length of the nwt domain was set to 10 m while the length of the generated wave train was less than 5 m the reflection of the waves from the far end boundary of the domain was suppressed numerically see khait and shemer 2019a 2019b 2019c first the linear wavemaker motion x 1 was calculated and applied as a boundary condition in nwt excitation of significant spurious propagating free waves was observed that affected the surface elevation even in the vicinity of the wavemaker see fig 14 a the spurious free waves appear at the frequencies ω 0 2ω 0 and 3ω 0 the waves dispersion leads to different propagation velocities of the target and the spurious wave groups c g ω 0 0 512 m s c g 2ω 0 0 326 m s and c g 3ω 0 0 189 m s thus at longer distances from the wavemaker those wave groups are separated see fig 14 b note the spurious waves at the angular frequency ω 0 are not separated from the target wave train as both propagate with equal velocities wave height of the spurious waves is significant so that those waves cannot be neglected at the second step the effect of the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion is investigated the value of x 2 x d 2 is calculated and appended to x 1 in the nwt wavemaker boundary condition it should be emphasized that this correction attains almost 10 of the 1st order displacements of the wavemaker as shown in fig 15 a the shapes of the resultant wave train generated in the nwt are shown in panels b and c of fig 15 in this case the spurious waves are suppressed quite effectively cf fig 14 a b and 15 b c however a significant deviation of the nwt results from the target wave shape given by solution of the nls equation is observed even in the vicinity of the wavemaker at x p 0 6 m see fig 15 b this points out to the insufficiency of the introduced nonlinear wavemaker motion correction to overcome the given problem a further investigation of the effect of the 3rd order wavemaker displacement x 3 x d 3 x d 3 as well as the 2nd order correction x a 2 appearing due to peculiarities of the nls model is required corrections to the wavemaker driving signal at all orders are depicted in fig 15 d unexpectedly it is seen that the dominant nonlinear contribution is introduced by x a 2 on the other hand the 3rd order wavemaker motion is also quite significant however it is lower than all other nonlinear corrections utilization of the full 3rd order accurate wavemaker motion given by 14 in the nwt simulation resulted in substantial improvement of the accuracy of the generated wave shape cf fig 15 b and e now the fully nonlinear solution matches almost perfectly the target wave shape predicted by the nls equation when comparing the wave profiles at longer distance from the wavemaker x p 4 m a significant inaccuracy of the nls model is found for all considered cases cf fig 15 c and f such distortion arises even if the wave train is narrow banded m 3 it can be explained by the loss of accuracy of the nls model with reduction of the water depth in the limit of shallow water the nls equation becomes inapplicable on the other hand a very good match of the wave shapes in the close proximity of the wavemaker may indicate that the suggested wave generation method based on the complex envelope representation of the free surface may have a somewhat wider range of applicability compared to the nls model in terms of the water depth 5 conclusions existing nonlinear theories of the wave generation by a wavemaker including the theory of schäffer 1996 and the method by khait and shemer 2019a require the complex spectrum of the water surface elevation at the wavemaker as an input the nonlinear correction to the wavemaker motion needed for the accurate excitation of steep waves is then calculated from that spectrum using a relatively complicated procedure involving lengthy expressions it makes those methods inconvenient in several practical applications it should be stressed that the nonlinear correction to the wavemaker motion is mainly a result of the presence of bound waves in the actual surface elevation at the wavemaker as well as a result of interaction between velocity field of the free and bound propagating waves with the oscillating wave generating surface the knowledge of the nonlinear velocity field for any prescribed shape of the wave train at the wavemaker can thus be advantageous for computing the required correction to the wavemaker driving signal the nonlinear schrödinger nls model is used here to compute velocity fields induced by both 1st order free the 2nd and the 3rd order bound waves associated with the prescribed wave train shape this approach allows overcoming the 2nd order restriction inherent to the theory of schäffer 1996 the method applies the complex envelope rather than the wave spectrum of the desired waveform as an input for determination of the 2nd and the 3rd order wavemaker driving signal the envelope can be obtained as a result of numerical solution of the nls equation accounting for the nonlinear evolution of the wave train it can be also easily constructed using hilbert transform from the surface elevation explicitly given at the wavemaker the suggested 3rd order accurate method allows significant simplification of the nonlinear wave generation when the wave train spectrum is sufficiently narrow the wave generation method was validated in both deep water and in intermediate water depth and demonstrated very good performance for narrow banded steep wave trains however the wave generation accuracy is reduced substantially with the spectral broadening this limitation is attributed to the vanishing spectral width assumption intrinsic to the nls model the range of applicability of the wave generation method based on the nls model was verified as a result of numerous experiments in the wave flume particular emphasis was given to the analysis of the sheared current that inevitably appears at 2nd order as a result of any oscillatory motion of the wavemaker the physical origin of this current is similar to that of the stokes drift however it exists only in presence of the wave generating surface and constitutes an addition to the classical stokes drift the value of the wavemaker generated current was found to be very close to the stokes drift at the bottom while it has a notably smaller velocity close to the free surface the paddle wavemaker was found to be responsible for generation of the strongest current even higher than the corresponding stokes drift however when water depth is very small the inclination of the paddle may fall beyond the mechanical restriction of the wavemaker credit authorship contribution statement anatoliy khait methodology investigation software validation

21357,analytic method for nonlinear wave generation by a wavemaker that is free of 2nd order limitation inherent to existing wavemaker theories is proposed the method is based on the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation and the nonlinear boundary condition at the wavemaker advantages offered by the nls model allowed simplification of the expressions for determination of the wavemaker driving signal and thus made them easily applicable in practice the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker driving signal are calculated from the complex surface elevation envelope obtained as a solution of the nls equation at the prescribed location in the wave flume the domain of applicability of the generation method was determined on the basis of numerous experiments in the wave flume as well as numerical simulations using a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt a very good generation of the required wave train shape was obtained for sufficiently narrow banded spectra in both deep water and intermediate depth conditions the generation of the sheared current due to oscillatory wavemaker motion has been discussed keywords wavemaker theory third order wave generation nonlinear schrödinger equation nls 1 introduction computations of evolution in time and space of unidirectional nonlinear deep and intermediate depth wave trains are performed using different approaches that range from simpler weakly nonlinear water waves models that contain different levels of simplifying approximations up to diverse fully nonlinear solvers the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation suggested by zakharov 1968 and hasimoto and ono 1972 is the simplest model that accounts for weak nonlinearity of water waves the nls equation is limited to moderate wave steepness ε k 0 a 0 k 0 and a 0 being the carrier wave number and surface elevation amplitude respectively and narrow banded spectra of the surface elevation the limited applicability of the nls equation to computation of evolution of nonlinear surface water wave trains has been demonstrated experimentally see e g shemer et al 1998 despite these limitations the nls equation remains an attractive theoretical model that admits solution by inverse scattering transform osborne 2010 it is frequently applied for investigation of diverse nonlinear phenomena in water waves plasma physics optics and other fields in view of the strong interest in nls equation from theoretical point of view its experimental validation in wave flumes is important attempts were made to examine experimentally several analytical solutions of nls equation chabchoub et al 2011 2012 such as kuznetsov 1977 ma 1979 peregrine 1983 and akhmediev et al 1987 breathers the numerical solutions of the nls equation for different wave trains were validated against more complicated theoretical water waves models and against measurements in the wave flume shemer et al 1998 2002 chabchoub et al 2013 rozenman et al 2019 experimental validation of the solutions of the nls equation requires accurate excitation of the wave trains by wavemakers usually of piston or paddle type application of the simplest motion of the wavemaker according to the linear wave theory havelock f 1929 biesel and suquet 1951 ursell et al 1960 leads to appearance of the unwanted spurious free propagating waves at the 2nd and higher harmonics schäffer 1996 those waves contaminate the wave field in the flume even at very large distances from the wavemaker the existence of those waves complicates significantly experimental validation of nonlinear wave models especially for waves propagating in intermediate water depth conditions k 0 h 0 7 h is the mean water depth nonlinear wavemaker theory is needed to avoid appearance of the spurious waves allowing minimization of the deviation of the generated wave field from the prescribed initial conditions accurate wave generation in numerical wave tanks based on computational fluid dynamics cfd represents an important practical problem as well windt et al 2019 have shown that existing approaches to wave generation in cfd are of limited capabilities and robustness placement of the fixed or floating structures in the numerical domain that reflect the incident wave back to the wavemaker contributes additional complication for dealing with practical engineering problems the method of coupling analytical and numerical solutions named relaxation zone was suggested by jacobsen et al 2012 alternatively a set of analytic wave generating boundary conditions higuera et al 2013 higuera 2020 was found to be efficient in some cases both approaches are inapplicable in physical experiments since the waves are generated artificially taking advantage of the numerical procedures given that cfd models are usually used for complementation of the laboratory setups the moving boundaries and deforming meshes are required to replicate physical wavemakers higuera et al 2015 it should be emphasized that the nonlinear wavemaker theories are also needed to drive the motion of the numerical wavemakers for avoiding excitation of the unwanted spurious free waves several analytical nonlinear wavemaker theories were suggested the transfer function approach havelock f 1929 biesel and suquet 1951 ursell et al 1960 was employed by schäffer 1996 to extend the theory to the 2nd order in wave steepness the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion was introduced to avoid excitation of spurious waves lengthy expressions for this correction were derived by schäffer 1996 from the complex spectrum of free waves defined at the wavemaker location alternative 2nd order approach to nonlinear wave generation based on the zakharov model was suggested by khait and shemer 2019a this method allowed mathematical simplification of the calculation of the nonlinear wavemaker driving signal as compared to the theory of schäffer 1996 while retaining the accuracy the 2nd order theory of schäffer 1996 was investigated by sriram et al 2015 in generation of broad banded focused wave trains under laboratory conditions in both intermediate and deep water regions the temporal evolution of the selected harmonics was analyzed using the inverse fast fourier transform ifft to study the propagation of the spurious long waves aknin and spinneken 2017 validated experimentally the wave generation theories by schäffer 1996 and zhang and schäffer 2007 in shallow intermediate and depth water conditions it was established that these approaches are only partially successful in suppression of the spurious waves several empirical corrections were suggested to decrease further the unwanted waves content houtani et al 2018a 2018b suggested a numerical approach based on schäffer 1996 wave generation theory and higher order spectral model hosm and applied this approach for generation of 2d wave fields in a basin a similar 2nd order wave generation method in hosm was applied by hasan et al 2018 to study the wind effect on the nonlinear focusing wave train taking into account the jeffrey s sheltering mechanism touboul et al 2008 a comprehensive experimental study on accuracy of different nonlinear wavemaker theories was carried out by eldrup and andersen 2019 it was demonstrated that only wave generation method based on stream function theory zhang and schäffer 2007 is acceptable in shallow water and even in intermediate water depth this is explained by significant importance of 3rd and higher order contributions to the wavemaker motion when approaching the shallow water regime those effects are not taken into account in the 2nd order accurate theory of schäffer 1996 moreover the most accurate method among all considered has demonstrated certain deviations in wave shape when irregular waves are generated it was also reported that this method is quite time consuming when applied to the irregular waves limited accuracy and significant complexity of existing analytic wave generation methods prompted development of empirical and numerical algorithms for iterative adjustment of the wavemaker driving signal shemer et al 2007 fernández et al 2014 stagonas et al 2018 khait and shemer 2019b those approaches however proved to be substantially less effective in shallow and intermediate water depths the so called nonlinear fourier analysis was recently offered to improve the accuracy of the available analytic wave generation theories yim et al 2017 mohtat et al 2018 to the best of author s knowledge this approach has not yet been verified in wave generation solution of the nls equation is given as a complex envelope thus an additional step converting the nls solution into the complex surface elevation spectrum is needed to apply the existing analytic wavemaker theories schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a to circumvent this intermediate step the 2nd order accurate method for computation of the wavemaker motion directly from the complex envelope solution of the nls equation was proposed by khait and shemer 2019c this method demonstrated a good performance in deep water wave generation however quite significant inaccuracies have been reported when waves were generated in intermediate water depth close to the limits of applicability of the involved 2nd order approximations the current paper is aimed at improvement of the accuracy of the method presented in khait and shemer 2019c to extend its applicability to intermediate water depth retaining high wave generation accuracy the 3rd order accuracy of the nls equation allowed extension of the wavemaker boundary condition to incorporate the 3rd order contributions such improvement of the wave generation approach is expected to increase the accuracy when waves are excited in intermediate water depth beyond the validity of the 2nd order accurate methods schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a 2019c the 3rd order accurate method suggested in the paper exploits the complex envelope solution of the nls equation as an input parameter simplifying the calculation of the wavemaker displacements 2 formulation of the method in the simplest case when only linear waves are considered surface elevation of an arbitrary wave group can be expressed through the complex envelope a x t using the following general expression η x t 1 2 a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t c c here k 0 and ω 0 are the carrier wave number and angular frequency the complex envelope a x t determines variation of both instantaneous local amplitude and phase of the wave in physical coordinates x and t several formulations of the wave propagation problem are possible in the current paper the spatial propagation of waves is considered i e the complex envelope as a function of time is assumed to be known at x 0 as initial condition it is required to find the envelope for all other spatial coordinates x as was mentioned above the weakly nonlinear evolution of the narrow banded wave trains is governed by the nls equation the spatial form of the nls equation in an arbitrary water depth is taken as a theoretical model shemer et al 1998 chabchoub et al 2013 1 i a ξ α 2 a τ 2 β a 2 a 0 the dimensionless scaled variables are defined as 2 a a a 0 ξ ε 2 x τ ε t x c g where ξ and τ are the scaled coordinates in space and time respectively a ξ τ and a ξ τ are the dimensionless and the dimensional complex envelopes

respectively while fluid velocity is v ϕ the term ϕ 0 o ε 2 in 5a introduces the sheared current due to propagation of nonlinear waves note that the mean position of the wavemaker cannot deviate from its initial location which does not allow excitation of the current therefore the term ϕ 0 is not considered in the paper i e it is assumed ϕ 0 0 the terms ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 as well as η 1 η 2 and η 3 represent the contributions of the 1st order free the 2nd and the 3rd order bound waves respectively the nls equation was derived assuming slow variation of the envelope a ξ τ in both time and space if this assumption is not strictly fulfilled a higher order correction to the 1st order free wave appears in the solution of the nls equation this correction is designated as ϕ a 2 in 5a despite appearance of ϕ a 2 at the 2nd order it does not contribute to the bound waves therefore it should be considered as a separate term to generate the wave train accurately the nonlinear velocity field given by 5a should be introduced by the wavemaker at x 0 the terms in 5a and 5b can be expressed following mei 1989 6a ϕ 1 a 0 g ω 0 cosh k 0 h z cosh k 0 h re i a e i k 0 x ω 0 t 6b ϕ a 2 a 0 ω 0 k 0

from 13f following similar algorithm contrary to the 2nd order problem at the 3rd order the mean current does not appear however in this case the spurious waves are excited at two frequencies ω 0 and

the driving signal the complex envelope a a t x 0 should be obtained first the natural procedure for that is the numerical solution of the nls equation 1 however the suggested wave generation approach can be applied even if the surface elevation is given explicitly η η t x 0 in this case the complex envelope can be constructed using the hilbert transform 25 a t η t i h η t a 0 exp i ω 0 t where h

the free waves spectrum at the next step the complex envelope a t x 0 is used in 14 to calculate the variation of the wavemaker displacement as a function of time x x t application of the complex envelope approach considerably simplifies computations of the wavemaker driving signal compared to the methods based on the spectral description of the surface elevation see e g schäffer 1996 khait and shemer 2019a 3 analysis of the wavemaker motion at different orders 3 1 generation of monochromatic free wave to analyze different regimes of the wave generation the simplest monochromatic free wave is first considered the complex wave envelope in this case is constant a 1 variation of a 0 leads to different wave steepness ε k 0 a 0 while k 0 is dependent on the water depth h and angular frequency ω 0 according to 4 the shape of the wave incorporating contributions of different orders calculated using 7a 7c is examined in fig 2 a and b panel a is plotted for the deep water conditions i e k 0 h 3 while panel b corresponds to the intermediate depth 0 3 k 0 h 3 closer to the shallow water even for extremely steep wave of ε 0 3 propagating in deep water the 2nd and the 3rd order accurate wave shapes η 1 η 2 and η 1 η 2 η 3 respectively are practically identical in contrast in intermediate water depth the 3rd order accurate wave shape is notably different from that of the 2nd order in this case the wave steepness was reduced to ε 0 1 in order to satisfy the applicability of the stokes perturbation method this analysis shows that the 3rd order contributions to the wavemaker motion may potentially be important in the intermediate depth conditions panels c and d in fig 2 show the velocities of the wavemaker computed according to the suggested wave generation method and needed to produce the wave shapes shown in panels a and b for brevity we consider here only a paddle type wavemaker the contributions to the wavemaker velocity at different orders of ε are given as separate curves as expected in deep water the 3rd order contribution to the wavemaker motion is negligibly small as compared to that at the 2nd order on the contrary in intermediate depth the 3rd order correction to the wavemaker motion is comparable in amplitude to the corresponding 2nd order one cf panels c and d the paddle displacements given in panels e and f confirm this observation fig 3 examines amplitudes of the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker motion as function of ε and h at the 2nd order panels a and b the complex amplitudes b 2 and b d 2 are shifted by π interplaying with each other in deep water b d 2 is dominant b 2 0 for k 0 h whereas in intermediate water depth b 2 b d 2 at a certain water depth these terms cancel each other leading to the zero 2nd order contribution to the wavemaker motion zero correction the depth corresponding to the zero correction regime is found to be dependent on the hinge location l fig 1 i e on the wavemaker geometry cf fig 3 a and b similar situation is also observed in panels e and f depicting the 3rd order amplitudes b d 3 contributing at the frequency ω 0 note that b d 3 consists of several terms having phase shift of zero or π see appendix d a quite different situation arises at the frequency 3ω 0 due to amplitudes b 3 and b d 3 in this case the zero correction is observed for paddle wavemaker panel d but not for the piston one panel c to examine the reasons for that we add the third dimensionless parameter l h characterizing the relative location of the hinge fig 1 and plot the value of b 3 b d 3 in fig 4 it is seen from this plot that when l h 1 i e the hinge is below the bottom at the distance approximately equal to the water depth the 3rd order correction to the wavemaker motion almost disappears at frequency 3ω 0 for any water depth when l h 1 the zero correction regime exists while it does not appear for l h 1 in general fig 3 demonstrates that decrease in water depth especially when k 0 h 0 6 requires more significant nonlinear corrections to the wavemaker dynamics the dimensionless value of the nonlinear term coefficient β in 1 is plotted in fig 5 for different water depths k 0 h the coefficient β is positive in deep water and becomes negative with decrease of the depth at k 0 h 1 36 the cubic term in 1 vanishes leading to the linear wave train evolution equation note that for k 0 h 1 36 the coefficient β in 1 is negative corresponding to defocusing regime mei 1989 shemer et al 1998 the intervals of the zero correction wave generation are also depicted in fig 5 in accordance with fig 3 it is seen that the 2nd order zero correction zone is separated from that of the 3rd order while β 0 is located in between these two areas to validate the wave generation method the water depth should be selected such that the nonlinear effects are significant the values of k 0 h denoted by two dashed and dash dotted vertical lines in fig 5 and corresponding to deep water and intermediate depth were thus selected for further investigation another nonlinear phenomenon considered in this research is the generation of the current u c it is of practical importance to assess and compare the values and the profile of u c 20 with the classical stokes drift u s 21 fig 6 a shows the profiles of the normalized velocity of the current excited by the piston wavemaker wave steepness ε 0 3 three dimensionless water depths are considered u c and u s are given by solid and dashed lines respectively near the bottom the velocity of the stokes drift is comparable to that of the current generated by the wavemaker however closer to the free surface the stokes drift has higher values of the velocity the biggest velocity difference near the free surface is observed in deep water while in the intermediate depth this difference is relatively small around 30 in the case of the paddle wavemaker see fig 6 b the profiles of u c and u s are qualitatively different the value of u c near the bottom is always equal to zero irrespective of the water depth selected while the stokes drift velocity u s at the bottom increases with reduction of the water depth the profiles of u c and u s are almost identical in deep water except for the near free surface region where u s u c reduction of the water depth results in a rapid growth of the current generated by the wavemaker to values much higher than the corresponding stokes drift however for the smallest considered water depth k 0 h 0 56 the required paddle inclinations become physically unachievable limiting the applicability of the hinged type wavemaker in intermediate depth regime the blue line in fig 6 b corresponding to the water depth k 0 h 1 leads to paddle inclinations around 25 3 2 generation of a broad banded gaussian shaped wave train applicability of the underlying nls equation is restricted in terms of the allowed spectral bandwidth therefore in this section we analyze accuracy of the suggested method in generation of wave packets with different spectral bandwidth consider gaussian shaped wave train defined by the complex envelope 27 a x f t exp t m t 0 2 exp i k 0 x f the phase shift given by the complex exponent in 27 is introduced to specify the appearance of the steepest wave crest exactly at the coordinate x f in this section assume x f 0 parameter m defines width of the spectrum such that lower value of m produces wider spectrum t 0 and k 0 are carrier wave period and carrier wave number respectively carrier angular frequency is ω 0 2π t 0 to evaluate spectral width introduce frequency range δω such that energy levels within ω 0 δ ω 2 ω ω 0 δ ω 2 are higher or equal to 1 2 of the spectrum maximum to find δω consider fourier transform of 7a after substitution 27 assuming x 0 28 η ˆ ω f η 1 t a 0 m t 0 2 2 exp π 2 m 2 1 ω ω 0 2 1 exp 4 π 2 m 2 ω ω 0 solution of the equation η ˆ ω a 0 m t 0 2 2 2 1 2 gives the sought spectral width 29 δ ω ω 0 ln 4 π m wave generation method proposed in khait and shemer 2019a based on the zakharov s theory is free of restrictions on the spectral width therefore the 2nd order accurate wavemaker motion x z 1 2 computed using the aforementioned method will be exploited as a reference in the current analysis the 2nd order accurate wavemaker motion computed by the method based on the nls equation is denoted as x n l s 1 2 both x z 1 2 t and x n l s 1 2 t provide variation of the wavemaker displacement in time consider maximum displacement of the wavemaker x max t x t accuracy of the nls based wave generation method is thus characterized by the divergence x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 fig 7 investigates dependence of x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 on the dimensionless water depth k 0 h and the spectral width δω ω 0 the wave steepness is taken as k 0 a 0 0 3 as seen from panel b piston wavemaker has the narrowest allowed spectral width δω ω 0 0 4 near the border between deep water and intermediate water depth at approximately k 0 h 2 increase of the spectral width beyond 0 4 value may lead to significant inaccuracies in wave generation interestingly both increase and reduction of the water depth k 0 h lead to widening of the allowed spectral width paddle wavemaker studied in panel a performs quite similar to the piston except for the small water depths where large discrepancies are observed however at those depths operation of paddle wavemaker is limited because of large displacements of the wave generating surface not possible due to its hinge fixation it is of practical interest to see the dependency of x z 1 2 x n l s 1 2 x z 1 2 on the spectral width parameter m explicitly present in 27 see fig 8 it can be suggested that the accuracy of the wave generation method based on the nls equation is acceptable if m 1 for both piston and paddle wavemakers a small deterioration of the generation accuracy by the piston wavemaker can be reported at water depths close to shallow water cf figs 7 b and 8 b 4 experimental and numerical verification of the method 4 1 wave generation in deep water to validate the proposed wave generation method in deep water conditions experiments were carried out in the 18 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep wave flume the displacement of the paddle wavemaker was controlled by a computer wave energy absorbing 3 m long sloping beach was installed to reduce the effect of the wave reflection resistance type wave gauges were used to measure the surface elevation variation with time at the prescribed locations the wave gauges were supported by a computer controlled instrument carriage allowing their accurate positioning along the wave flume the entire experimental procedure including the carriage positioning wave generation and data acquisition was controlled by a single labview program ensuring precise synchronization the outputs of the wave gauges and instantaneous coordinates of the paddles were sampled at the rate of t 0 128 where t 0 is the carrier wave period excitation of both narrow banded and broad banded gaussian shaped wave trains 27 is considered for validation of the wave generation method the target wave train is to be generated at the focusing coordinate x f 4 m the deep water conditions are satisfied by selection of the following wave train parameters t 0 0 7 s ω 0 8 976 λ 0 0 765 m k 0 h 4 928 the spectral width parameter m was varied within the range 0 5 m 3 steepness of the wave train is controlled at the wavemaker location by varying the value of the constant a 0 defined in 2 30 ε 0 max k 0 a 0 a x 0 t where a x 0 t is the complex envelope at the wavemaker location the steepness was varying within 0 05 ε 0 0 25 wave trains were generated as follows first the target complex envelope 27 was defined at x f 4 m as the initial condition the nls equation 1 was then solved numerically using the method of lo and mei 1985 to obtain the complex envelope at the wavemaker location x 0 expression 14 was used to calculate the 3rd order accurate wavemaker motion needed for excitation of the designed wave train however as argued above the 2nd order wavemaker driving signal is sufficient in the deep water conditions see fig 2 surface elevation variation with time was measured by the wave gauges at two locations x p 2 m and x p 4 m five independent experiments were conducted for every individual wavemaker driving signal to demonstrate the repeatability of the results the results of the experiments confirmed that the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion needed for excitation of the steep wave train in deep water is relatively weak in the considered case it is lower than 5 of the 1st order wavemaker displacement see fig 9 a the measured ensemble averaged surface elevation of the narrow banded wave train is compared in fig 9 b and c with the numerical solutions of the nls equation it is seen that the surface elevation of the nls model which includes both 1st order free 2nd and 3rd order bound waves computed according to 7a 7c agrees very well with the measurements it should be emphasized that the agreement in this case is almost independent of the distance from the wavemaker the power spectrum s 2 ω j was calculated where s ω j is the surface elevation amplitude spectrum j 1 n n is the number of harmonics comparison of the ensemble averaged power spectra with the numerical solutions of the nls equation given in fig 10 demonstrates quite small errors at the meaningful free and bound harmonics for both values of x p as well as very good repeatability of the experiments as expected in deep water the 3rd order bound waves are significantly weaker as compared to the 2nd order bound waves similarly comparison of the measurements with the numerical solution of the nls equation for steep broad banded wave train is carried out in figs 11 and 12 the target wave train in this case consists of numerous harmonics resulting in strong dispersion that manifests itself in the wave train focusing at x f 4 m cf fig 11 b and c the degree of agreement of the measurements with the nls solution varies with the distance from the wavemaker in the vicinity of the wavemaker x p 2 m the agreement is reasonable confirming the accuracy of the adopted wave generation method farther away from the wavemaker at x p 4 m the nls equation solution deviates substantially from the measurements note that nls equation is formally valid for vanishing spectral width the growing with the distance deviation of the experimental results from the nls solution thus demonstrates limited applicability of the nls equation to model the spatial evolution of a broad banded wave train fig 12 shows power spectra calculated for the surface elevations presented in fig 11 in the vicinity of the wavemaker the solution of the nls equation reproduces the location of the spectral peak as well as the bandwidth reasonably well however already close to the wavemaker the measured spectrum exhibits asymmetry relative to the peak location this asymmetry is absent in the nls solution farther away from the wavemaker at x p 4 m the quality of the nls solution deteriorates dramatically the measured power spectrum is significantly narrower as compared to the theoretical result the peak downshifting in the measurements is absent in the nls solution the results presented in figs 9 12 thus clearly demonstrate that the spectral width significantly affects the accuracy of the nls model and consequently the wave generation method based on it to estimate the accuracy of the wave generation method for multiple wave trains with different parameters the dimensionless root mean square rms deviation between the measured and the predicted by the nls model power spectra was calculated 31 r m s s n l s 2 s e x p 2 max s n l s 2 1 max j s n l s j 2 j n s n l s j 2 s exp j 2 2 n fig 13 a examines the rms deviation of the spectra at x p 2 m as a function of the spectral width parameter m and of the wave steepness ε 0 based on the measurements in the vicinity of the wavemaker it is seen that the deviation is almost independent of wave steepness ε 0 in agreement with the previous observations cf figs 9 and 10 however the accuracy of the nls based wave generation method is reduced with the reduction of m and thus wider spectra at larger distance from the wavemaker and for the narrow banded wave trains m 3 and m 2 fig 13 b the characteristic deviations between the experiment and the nls computations remain independent of the wave steepness however a significant deterioration of the nls model accuracy with ε 0 is observed for the wave trains with a broader power spectrum m 1 in agreement with fig 8 4 2 wave generation in intermediate water depth validation of the method in intermediate water depth requires significant reduction of the water depth not possible in the wave flume used for experiments the increase of the carrier wave period implies displacements of the wavemaker plane beyond the mechanical limitations of the paddle wavemaker thus for validation of the wave generation method in intermediate depth conditions the fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt based on the boundary element method bem was utilized the description of the numerical methods used in nwt is presented in grilli et al 1989 grilli and svendsen 1990 grilli and subramanya 1996 careful validation of the nwt in generation of the surface water waves by the piston wavemaker was performed in khait and shemer 2019a 2019b 2019c for brevity further details on the nwt are omitted here as shown in fig 3 the 2nd and the 3rd order corrections to the wavemaker motion are most significant in the intermediate water depth the decrease of the effective water depth k 0 h was done by selection of the mean water depth h 0 036 m within the intermediate depth regime the carrier wave period remained t 0 0 7 s yielding the carrier wave length λ 0 0 395 m see 4 and the dimensionless water depth k 0 h 0 572 corresponding to the most problematic wave generation regime schäffer 1996 the carrier wave steepness was taken as ε 0 0 06 see 30 providing applicability of the stokes perturbation expansion the narrow banded wave train with m 3 is considered the length of the nwt domain was set to 10 m while the length of the generated wave train was less than 5 m the reflection of the waves from the far end boundary of the domain was suppressed numerically see khait and shemer 2019a 2019b 2019c first the linear wavemaker motion x 1 was calculated and applied as a boundary condition in nwt excitation of significant spurious propagating free waves was observed that affected the surface elevation even in the vicinity of the wavemaker see fig 14 a the spurious free waves appear at the frequencies ω 0 2ω 0 and 3ω 0 the waves dispersion leads to different propagation velocities of the target and the spurious wave groups c g ω 0 0 512 m s c g 2ω 0 0 326 m s and c g 3ω 0 0 189 m s thus at longer distances from the wavemaker those wave groups are separated see fig 14 b note the spurious waves at the angular frequency ω 0 are not separated from the target wave train as both propagate with equal velocities wave height of the spurious waves is significant so that those waves cannot be neglected at the second step the effect of the 2nd order correction to the wavemaker motion is investigated the value of x 2 x d 2 is calculated and appended to x 1 in the nwt wavemaker boundary condition it should be emphasized that this correction attains almost 10 of the 1st order displacements of the wavemaker as shown in fig 15 a the shapes of the resultant wave train generated in the nwt are shown in panels b and c of fig 15 in this case the spurious waves are suppressed quite effectively cf fig 14 a b and 15 b c however a significant deviation of the nwt results from the target wave shape given by solution of the nls equation is observed even in the vicinity of the wavemaker at x p 0 6 m see fig 15 b this points out to the insufficiency of the introduced nonlinear wavemaker motion correction to overcome the given problem a further investigation of the effect of the 3rd order wavemaker displacement x 3 x d 3 x d 3 as well as the 2nd order correction x a 2 appearing due to peculiarities of the nls model is required corrections to the wavemaker driving signal at all orders are depicted in fig 15 d unexpectedly it is seen that the dominant nonlinear contribution is introduced by x a 2 on the other hand the 3rd order wavemaker motion is also quite significant however it is lower than all other nonlinear corrections utilization of the full 3rd order accurate wavemaker motion given by 14 in the nwt simulation resulted in substantial improvement of the accuracy of the generated wave shape cf fig 15 b and e now the fully nonlinear solution matches almost perfectly the target wave shape predicted by the nls equation when comparing the wave profiles at longer distance from the wavemaker x p 4 m a significant inaccuracy of the nls model is found for all considered cases cf fig 15 c and f such distortion arises even if the wave train is narrow banded m 3 it can be explained by the loss of accuracy of the nls model with reduction of the water depth in the limit of shallow water the nls equation becomes inapplicable on the other hand a very good match of the wave shapes in the close proximity of the wavemaker may indicate that the suggested wave generation method based on the complex envelope representation of the free surface may have a somewhat wider range of applicability compared to the nls model in terms of the water depth 5 conclusions existing nonlinear theories of the wave generation by a wavemaker including the theory of schäffer 1996 and the method by khait and shemer 2019a require the complex spectrum of the water surface elevation at the wavemaker as an input the nonlinear correction to the wavemaker motion needed for the accurate excitation of steep waves is then calculated from that spectrum using a relatively complicated procedure involving lengthy expressions it makes those methods inconvenient in several practical applications it should be stressed that the nonlinear correction to the wavemaker motion is mainly a result of the presence of bound waves in the actual surface elevation at the wavemaker as well as a result of interaction between velocity field of the free and bound propagating waves with the oscillating wave generating surface the knowledge of the nonlinear velocity field for any prescribed shape of the wave train at the wavemaker can thus be advantageous for computing the required correction to the wavemaker driving signal the nonlinear schrödinger nls model is used here to compute velocity fields induced by both 1st order free the 2nd and the 3rd order bound waves associated with the prescribed wave train shape this approach allows overcoming the 2nd order restriction inherent to the theory of schäffer 1996 the method applies the complex envelope rather than the wave spectrum of the desired waveform as an input for determination of the 2nd and the 3rd order wavemaker driving signal the envelope can be obtained as a result of numerical solution of the nls equation accounting for the nonlinear evolution of the wave train it can be also easily constructed using hilbert transform from the surface elevation explicitly given at the wavemaker the suggested 3rd order accurate method allows significant simplification of the nonlinear wave generation when the wave train spectrum is sufficiently narrow the wave generation method was validated in both deep water and in intermediate water depth and demonstrated very good performance for narrow banded steep wave trains however the wave generation accuracy is reduced substantially with the spectral broadening this limitation is attributed to the vanishing spectral width assumption intrinsic to the nls model the range of applicability of the wave generation method based on the nls model was verified as a result of numerous experiments in the wave flume particular emphasis was given to the analysis of the sheared current that inevitably appears at 2nd order as a result of any oscillatory motion of the wavemaker the physical origin of this current is similar to that of the stokes drift however it exists only in presence of the wave generating surface and constitutes an addition to the classical stokes drift the value of the wavemaker generated current was found to be very close to the stokes drift at the bottom while it has a notably smaller velocity close to the free surface the paddle wavemaker was found to be responsible for generation of the strongest current even higher than the corresponding stokes drift however when water depth is very small the inclination of the paddle may fall beyond the mechanical restriction of the wavemaker credit authorship contribution statement anatoliy khait methodology investigation software validation

21358,global offshore wind power is rapidly developing and has a broad market china has the advantage of developing offshore wind power which is the direction of future development of china s power generation industry because of the high maintenance and repair costs as well as the large sizes of wind power structures damage to them could cause loss of lives and property in this paper a health monitoring method for analyzing offshore wind power structures based on a genetic algorithm and an uncertain analytic hierarchy process ahp is proposed the uncertain analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to establish the hierarchical model after calculating the weight range of each part the optimal weight is obtained through the training and optimization of genetic algorithm and the comprehensive weight table is obtained finally the grading of health condition of the whole structure can be obtained by inputting the health indicators of each part based on the statistical distribution for weighted calculation based on the qualitative analysis of the uncertain analytic hierarchy process and the quantitative analysis of the genetic algorithm the method is shown to reliably monitor the health of offshore wind power structures reduce maintenance costs and ensure staff safety both simulation and actual measurement experiments are performed in this study the simulation based on the vibration data proves that the proposed structural health monitoring method for offshore wind power structures can evaluate the grading of health condition rapidly and accurately using data in real time through the training and verification of simulation data the accuracy of prediction after training can exceed 98 through a verification experiment using actual measured data the vibration data measured by the offshore wind power structure during the healthy service period are evaluated the evaluation results are found to be consistent with the actual operation state of the wind power structure the proposed method can be used for quick real time evaluations keywords offshore wind power structure structural health monitoring genetic algorithm rapid assessment uncertain ahp 1 introduction wind energy is a clean and renewable energy which has received much attention worldwide in the past ten years there has been a tremendous rise in the development and utilization of wind resources pacheco et al 2017 due to the long coastline and general offshore distance of offshore wind farms ranging from 10 to 50 km china has a natural advantage in the development of wind power in addition china s offshore wind farms are close to the coastal power load center which has less adverse impact on the environment and little visual interference it is suitable to install wind power structures with larger single capacity for large scale development liu et al 2019 based on the advantages of offshore wind power its development is becoming increasingly popular in china however a critical issue in the development of offshore wind power is the maintenance of offshore wind turbines tian et al 2020 due to the complex marine environment the immature detection and maintenance capabilities can lead to problems such as excessive cost and lack of protection of personnel safety zhou et al 2019 if the traditional onshore wind farm maintenance method is applied to offshore wind farms 25 30 of the generated revenue needs to be invested in daily operations maintenance and risk response which is a very high proportion therefore it is necessary to carry out rapid and accurate health diagnosis perform timely maintenance checks minimize maintenance costs and ensure the safety of staff and maintenance personnel involved in offshore wind power structures liu et al 2019 hence the method of fault data analysis is particularly crucial for fault diagnosis of offshore large scale wind power structures and is closely related to the development of offshore wind power pentaris et al 2013 data acquisition and processing flow of an offshore wind farm is shown in fig 1 wireless sensors such as vibration sensors corrosion sensors and strain sensors are required for the tower above the platform according to rules or specific fan layout for the part below the platform i e the part below sea level wired sensors such as water pressure sensor velocity sensor and strain sensor are used both wired and wireless sensors measure all kinds of data obtained from offshore wind power structures at the same time and transmit the data to the data aggregation node on the platform for collection and synchronization through wireless signal transmission and wired cable transmission respectively then the synchronous data is processed and transmitted to the shore station using wired or wireless means for real time data monitoring storage analysis and other operations at present the technology of structural health detection in the field of bridge is relatively mature while in the field of offshore structural health monitoring most structural health monitoring is only aimed at wind turbines and their components rather than structures combined with these aspects the relevant research is as follows 1 devriendt et al identified the modal parameters of the offshore wind turbines based on the data measured by operating mode analysis oma under natural environment excitation and extracted the modal parameters of the structure this method can safely and accurately estimate the natural frequency damping ratio and vibration mode of offshore wind turbine without affecting the normal operation of the structure so as to carry out modal analysis and analyze the health status of wind turbine devriendt et al 2014 at present there are many articles about modal analysis of wind turbine liu et al 2020 for large scale structures this method is rarely used in the health monitoring of offshore structures while its application in bridge health monitoring is relatively mature sun et al 2019 2 in the aspect of large scale offshore structures there are also studies on modal identification through the relevant data of structures kraemer and friedmanna give a basic description of the algorithm based on stochastic subspace and introduce its application in the structure of marine hydraulic structures the method is demonstrated and discussed through practical test peter and herbert 2015 li et al used the inverse finite element method ifem to monitor a tower of an owt under both static and dynamic loading conditions the total displacement and von mises stress obtained from the analysis of ifem were compared with the reference results and the optimal position of the sensor was determined li et al 2020 mojtahedi et al carried out experimental modal analysis ema on the physical model of offshore jacket platform established a numerical updated finite element model and compared the influence of different model reduction methods on the dynamic characteristics of spd8 jacket platform by using the traditional and improved cross model cross mode cmcm iterative algorithm mojtahedi et al 2020 there are also related studies using the vibration characteristics to obtain modal parameters establish the structure finite element model and the results of the physical model are modified by numerical model finally a complex and efficient structural health monitoring system is proposed by combining intelligent algorithm with fuzzy logic mojtahdi et al 2019 3 based on the local data measurement set the corresponding damage thresholds and carry out fault warning and diagnosis of the wind turbines by defining the safety range of the strain value mieloszyk and ostachowicz 2017 in this method the data of various damage types are extracted by simulating damage test of wind turbines and then the damage index is defined this method can not only monitor the damage accurately but also locate the damage so as to repair the damaged parts in time among the above methods modal identification method can get the modal parameters of the structure accurately and analyze them liu et al 2020 however due to the need for modal analysis and the establishment of relevant models the numerical calculation of this method is relatively complex at present this method is still mainly used for off line analysis carne and james 2010 liu et al 2017 the threshold alarm and detection method based on local measurement data can detect the health status of wind turbine in real time and locate accurately but for large scale offshore structures it is difficult to carry out damage simulation test and fault data collection therefore at present these methods are mostly used for offshore wind turbines rather than structures using analytic hierarchy process to calculate the health index of wind power structure we can evaluate the overall weight distribution of wind power structure by expert score and evaluate the overall structure by combining the local health detection method however if this method is to be used for on line monitoring it also depends on the specific local damage detection method at the same time there is room for improvement in the application of ahp in the study of bridge structures wei developed models using ahp and group judgment and established indicators using a statistical distribution method to evaluate the state of the bridge structure wei 2012 the experimental results show that the method can successfully complete the real time health monitoring of the bridge structure through numerical calculation in the case of lack of fault data because of the flexibility of this method there is still room for improvement in the calculation and optimization of the weight structure due to the problems such as limited fault data of offshore wind turbine structures lack of unified fault standards and difficulty in rapid and objective health assessment of part of the structure or the entire structure this study proposes a health monitoring method of offshore wind turbine structure based on genetic algorithm optimization and uncertain ahp this method does not need to identify offshore wind power structure parameters and establish a model but uses statistical methods to quickly calculate and complete the evaluation at the same time the combination of uncertain analytic hierarchy process and genetic algorithm training based on measured data not only adds certain objectivity to analytic hierarchy process but also reduces the amount of data required for genetic algorithm training to a certain extent ultimately this method can successfully achieve fast and accurate online monitoring of offshore wind power structures 2 methods 2 1 uncertain analytic hierarchy process the ahp classifies the decision objectives factors decision criteria and decision objects into the highest middle and lowest levels according to their mutual relations and draws the hierarchy chart the highest level refers to the purpose of decision making and the problems to be solved the lowest level refers to alternatives in the decision making process the middle layer refers to the considered factors and criteria for decision making for any two adjacent layers the upper layer is called the target layer and the lower layer is the factor layer fu 2011 regarding the specific situation of offshore wind power structures this paper takes vibration signal as an example to study the health monitoring method of offshore wind power structure because the impacts of vibration signals on the health status of various parts of the wind power structures are different we classify the health status according to the vibration signals of various parts tu et al 2012 taking a single pile offshore wind power structure as an example the evaluation index system and hierarchy of wind power structure vibration signal are obtained as follows as shown in fig 2 the vibration signal is composed of tower vibration signal and blade vibration signal which is subdivided into tower top tower middle tower bottom blade top blade middle and blade bottom after drawing the hierarchy diagram the index weight is usually solved by the expert system fu et al 2015 the ahp judgment matrix is established for each substructure i e upper and lower structure as shown in fig 2 and the model has three upper and three lower structures by each expert for the lower level indicators of each substructure the comparison of the importance of the two indicators is expressed by a specific number ranging between 1 and 9 which quantifies the importance of the indicators the scoring criteria are listed in table 1 we can form the judgment matrix in which the elements of the i th row and j th column represent the importance of the i th factor compared with j th factor which is expressed by a i j however it is arbitrary to express indicators with specific numbers because of the complexity of determining objective facts the determined numbers are replaced with intervals to form the uncertain judgment matrix this method of analysis is called the uncertain ahp here the uncertain judgment matrix where a i j a i j b i j represents the score of the i th factor for the j th factor and the interval matrix is divided into two matrices a a i j n n and a b i j n n for each uncertain judgment matrix calculate the corresponding weights of matrix a and matrix a with the least square method the terms ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n t and ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n t are calculated as shown in 1 and 2 where n represents the dimension of matrix and ω and ω are the corresponding weights of a and a respectively 1 w k i 1 n a k i a k k a i k a i i 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 n a j i a j j a i j a i i 1 2 n k 1 2 n 2 ω k i 1 n b k i b k k b i k b i i 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 n b j i b j j b i j b i i 1 2 n k 1 2 n the following two indicators are calculated by a and a as shown in 3 and 4 respectively 3 k j 1 n 1 i 1 n b i j 4 m j 1 n 1 i 1 n a i j where k and m are the weight indexes used in the calculation of the expert s weight therefore the weight interval of n factors of the uncertain matrix a obtained by the expert s score can be expressed as shown in 5 5 ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n where ω i k ω i m ω i and i 1 n represent the weight range of the expert s judgment on the i th structural factor to its superior each group of substructures is evaluated based on m uncertain matrices by m experts each uncertain matrix is calculated to obtain a weight vector the number of weight vector elements is n which represents the expert s weight distribution of n factors because the scores are all composed of intervals the weight elements of each determined factor are also represented using intervals for each substructure m experts get m weight interval vectors for each group of substructures m weight vectors are summarized into a table and then a weight interval summary table of m rows and n columns is obtained table 2 can be obtained where the matrix element in row k and column i is ω k i ω k i ω k i i 1 n k 1 m which represents the weight range of the evaluation on the i th element by the k th expert after getting the weight interval summary table of a substructure we need to synthesize the results of multiple experts because we obtain the evaluation weight interval of various factors of the substructure from multiple experts here we use group judgment to calculate the results of several experts to determine the credibility of each expert using the weighted average technique the evaluation interval of each factor is obtained after synthesizing the results of several experts in other words multiple weight vectors are weighted to obtain a comprehensive weight vector the elements of the weight vector are still composed of intervals the weighted weights are determined from the credibility of the experts the credibility needs to integrate the similarities and differences between the experts the steps of similarity calculation are as follows 1 construct a consistent digital matrix according to the uncertain judgment matrix a a i j n n made by each expert where a i j a i j b i j take 6 as the consistency number matrix 6 m i j k 1 n a i k b i k a j k b i k 1 2 n following this approach the consistent number matrix m m i j n n is obtained 2 arrange the row vectors of the consistent digital matrix in a row to form a new row vector 3 finally according to the above method the judgment matrix made by m experts is transformed into m row vectors which are recorded as α 1 α 2 α m such that η i j represents the cosine of the angle between α i and α j the cosine formula is given in 7 7 cos θ α β α β i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n b i 2 in 7 n represents the dimension n of the matrix of order take 8 ξ i j 1 m η i j 1 where η i j is the cosine of the angle between α i and α j and ξ i is the similarity index by normalizing ξ i we can determine the quantity ξ i of the similarity degree between the judgment of the i th expert and that of other experts as shown in 9 9 ζ i ξ i j 1 m ξ j the steps for calculating the difference degree are as follows 1 record the m row vectors calculated in the second step of the similarity calculation as α 1 α 2 α m where α k a k 1 a k 2 a k n is the evaluation value given by the k th expert for n indicators 2 take the following 10 x i 1 m k 1 m a k i i 1 2 n where x i represents the average value of all the experts evaluation at the i th evaluation index 3 note that σ k i a k i x i where σ k i represents the difference between the evaluation value and mean value of the i th index by the k th expert the sum of the difference between the evaluation value and the corresponding mean value of each index by the k th expert is given in 11 11 σ k i 1 n σ k i 4 subsequently the difference between the judgment results of the k th expert and other experts is presented in 12 12 δ k σ k σ k 1 2 m σ k 1 m σ k the evaluation weight γ k of the k th expert can be obtained by combining the similarities and differences as shown in 13 13 γ k ζ k 1 δ k 1 k 1 m ζ k δ k k 1 m ζ k δ k 1 ζ k k 1 m ζ k δ k 1 5 after obtaining γ k the upper and lower limits of the weight interval of the corresponding expert results are the weighted average by γ k that is the upper and lower limits of the comprehensive weight interval of the i th element in this substructure are calculated using 14 and 15 14 ω f i k 1 m γ k ω k i i 1 n 15 ω f i k 1 m γ k ω k i i 1 n where ω k i and ω k i represent the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the interval judged by the k th expert on the i th factor finally the comprehensive weight interval vector ω f ω f 1 ω f 2 ω f n of each factor based on several experts in this substructure is obtained where ω f i ω f i ω f i and i 1 n in this way for each group of substructures the comprehensive weight interval of each factor in a substructure group can be obtained after obtaining the weight intervals of all the factors of the substructure the multi level weight interval table can be developed comprehensively as the weights are expressed by intervals it is necessary to determine the specific weights in the interval obtain the final weight setting value and determine the final multi level setting weight table 2 2 genetic algorithm in this study we determine the fixed weight value by genetic algorithm optimization this is because the uncertain ahp determines the weight interval of each part and we need to obtain the fixed weight value of each part the genetic algorithm toolbox in matlab 2016 is used for optimization training and the parameters of genetic algorithm are shown in table 3 the input parameter variable is the weight of each part calculated by the uncertain ahp and each variable is limited to the corresponding weight range of each variable the linear constraint of variables is added that is the sum of the weights of each factor in the lower layer under each substructure is 1 for example for the offshore single pile wind power structure eight weight variables are input as the parameters for optimization namely tower barrel blade tower bottom tower center tower top blade top blade center and blade bottom which are represented by ω a ω b ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 ω b 1 ω b 2 and ω b 3 respectively in the training process these variables need to satisfy the relationship ω a ω b 1 ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 1 and ω b 1 ω b 2 ω b 3 1 because this method is based on historical data and actual state the fitness function of the genetic algorithm is defined each time 200 groups of historical data are input for training each group of historical data includes the vibration data of each bottom layer part within a given period as well as the health status of the overall structure in this period the health status level is represented by numbers including 1 2 3 and 4 because the statistics interval based on the formula is determined when the vibration data within the period is determined the four kinds of correlation degrees of the corresponding bottom parts are also determined therefore the historical data used for training can be simplified as follows four kinds of correlation degrees of each bottom layer part and the corresponding state level of the overall structure the four kinds of correlation degrees of historical data are calculated using the current multiple weight variables to obtain the corresponding correlation degrees of the entire structure based on the current weight the correlation degrees are calculated to determine the health status level of the overall structure under the current weight two hundred groups of data are calculated for each training the calculated results i e the overall structural state level are compared with the real state level of historical data the initial count is set to 0 for each training and 1 is added to the count if each group of data in the historical data matches successfully each time 200 groups of data are compared the matching rate is calculated as the count divided by 200 because the fitness function is set to converge to the minimum we shall take the fitness function as the opposite number of the matching rate i e count 200 to maximize the matching rate 2 3 method of judging health state based on statistical distribution after determining the weight value of each part of the overall structure for the target layer we need to obtain the health indicators of each specific part of the bottom layer by weighting them through the weight table we can determine the health indicators of the overall structure of the top layer to assess the health status of the global structure however due to lack of sufficient fault data in wind power structures it is difficult to determine the fault standard or threshold of specific data types therefore in this study we refer to the health diagnosis method in the research of bridge structures wei 2012 and adopt the health judgment method based on statistical distribution in the case of lack of fault data this method can also be used to define the fault standard or health index and determine the health index of each specific part most actions on offshore wind power structures are randomly produced such as wind force and waves therefore during the actual health monitoring the measured responses are taken as non stationary random responses because the calculation of non stationary random response is complex for convenience the calculation and analysis are carried out based on the stationary random response in probability statistics most of the random scalars x obey or partly obey the normal distribution curve as long as the sample size is large enough the variation distribution meets the standard normal distribution in the actual measurement the measured value x can have an extreme value of a particular parameter in a specific time interval t which can be adjusted and the average value is set as the average value of x in a cycle the variation is the difference between the measured values in the cycle and the average value in this monitoring cycle and the overall standard deviation can be obtained correspondingly the statistics meet the standard normal distribution as given in 16 16 δ σ n 0 1 where σ is the standard deviation and δ is the variation from the table corresponding to the normal distribution we can get 17 17 p δ σ 2 0 2 φ 2 0 1 95 44 according to the table when the confidence interval is 2 2 the confidence level has then reached 95 44 which is almost guaranteed therefore we grade within this interval the division standard is divided according to equal area that is the same area is divided into four parts in the confidence interval checking the table the confidence interval can be obtained as shown in 18 19 and 20 18 p δ σ 0 3 2 φ 0 3 1 23 58 19 p δ σ 0 65 2 φ 0 65 1 48 44 20 p δ σ 1 1 2 φ 1 1 1 72 86 as shown in fig 3 the confidence interval is divided into several areas according to the equal area method among the intervals health level 1 is the highest and level 4 is the lowest in practice we take the data of a monitoring cycle for a specific part each time we calculate the difference between the measured value and the mean value of all the data in this monitoring cycle as the change quantity and calculate a statistical quantity for each change quantity in this cycle using a fixed formula if we sum up the statistics then we can get the interval of the statistics of this period then calculating the correlation degree between this region and each health region four types of correlation degrees in this region are obtained and compared it is considered that the health state region with the largest relative correlation degree is the health state of the current region the calculation formula for correlation degree is derived as follows define the distance from the point to the interval using 21 21 ρ x a b x a b 2 b a 2 where c and d are the endpoints on both sides of the coordinate range of the coordinate system then define the distance from interval x y to interval c d as given in 22 22 ρ x y c d 1 2 ρ x c d ρ y c d determine the classic domain from 23 23 r t n t c j x t j n t c 1 x t 1 c 2 x t 2 c n x t n n t c 1 c t 1 d t 1 c 2 c t 2 d t 2 c n c t n d t n where n t t 1 2 m is the level of the state of the wind power structure c j j 1 2 n is the evaluation index and x t j is the range of j index corresponding to n t i e classical domain c t j d t j which represents several health state intervals determine the joint domain using 24 24 r p n p c j x p j n p c 1 x p 1 c 2 x p 2 c n x p n n t c 1 c p 1 d p 1 c 2 c p 2 d p 2 c n c p n d p n where n p is the whole state level x p j is the range of quantity value determined by n p on evaluation index c j i e section c p j d p j for confidence interval 0 2 and p represents the whole of health state level subsequently determine the matter element which refers to the interval of measured data statistics of each bottom layer which is recorded as c 0 j d 0 j therefore the correlation between the data of each bottom layer and that of each health status level can be calculated using 25 25 k t x 0 j ρ x 0 j x t j ρ x 0 j x p j ρ x 0 j x t j c 0 j d 0 j c t j d t j ρ x 0 j x t j x t j c 0 j d 0 j c t j b t j where t corresponds to the health level and j represents the j th part of the bottom layer k t x 0 j is the correlation degree of the data of the j bottom layer to the status level t from this equation we can obtain four kinds of correlation degrees for each part of the bottom layer 3 decision method of uncertain analytic hierarchy process based on genetic algorithm optimization 3 1 total flow therefore in this study an uncertain ahp decision method is proposed based on genetic algorithm optimization the overall flow chart is illustrated in fig 4 the specific steps in determining the total flow are as follows 1 calculate the weight range of each part taking a single pile offshore wind power structure as an example a hierarchical health monitoring model of the single pile offshore wind power structure based on a vibration signal is established through the uncertain ahp each substructure is scored by experts the weights of each part are preliminarily evaluated and the weights of each part of the upper layer are calculated 2 the weight of each part is determined through optimization after determining the weight intervals we need to confirm each weight interval as a fixed value therefore based on the historical measured data including the historical vibration data and historical health status we take the weight interval of each part as the input variable and the fitness function in carrying out the optimization training of the genetic algorithm in other words the genetic algorithm is used to optimize each weight interval where the sum of the weights of the lower layer of each substructure is 1 3 four correlation degrees of each part of the bottom layer are calculated based on the health state judgment method of statistical distribution the vibration data within a period are calculated and four kinds of correlation degrees of each factor in the bottom layer are obtained 4 develop a comprehensive table for example for the wind power structure the multi level weight distribution table added with four types of correlation degrees is presented in table 4 that each weight distribution meets the requirements of ω a ω b 1 ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 1 and ω b 1 ω b 2 ω b 3 1 5 calculate the four kinds of correlation degrees of the entire structure the correlation degrees are weighted and synthesized based on the weight distribution table and the four kinds of correlation degrees of the whole structure are obtained in short the overall health indicators are calculated according to the weight structure and health indicators of each part in which the uncertain analytic hierarchy process and genetic algorithm are used to calculate the weight structure and the statistical distribution method is used to calculate the health indicators of each specific part 4 simulation test 4 1 test description to test the uncertain ahp based on the genetic algorithm optimization of the vibration signal of offshore wind power structures the feasibility and reliability of this method are verified through experiments to determine the judgment matrix we need to prepare five scoring experts to score several substructures in the offshore wind power structure model based on vibration signals through calculations the weight distribution interval of each part of the model is obtained subsequently 500 groups of simulation vibration signal data of wind power structure need to be prepared each group of data represents vibration signal data of six specific parts of the wind power structure within each fixed period and the health status level of the wind power structure in the same period the fixed period here is tentatively determined as 1 min 120 vibration values expressed by acceleration are collected for each specific part every minute therefore each group of data contains 720 vibration data values generated by simulating real vibration data in a larger range in each group of simulation data six groups of vibration signal data of specific bottom layer parts are simplified into four kinds of correlation degrees for each of the six bottom layer parts using the health state determination method based on statistical distribution the health status level of each group of simulated data is represented by numbers 1 4 that is the final overall structural health status obtained by calculating the correlations of the health status of each part of the simulated vibration data through the simulation weights here the simulation weights are set to 0 69 0 31 0 48 0 31 0 21 0 22 0 32 0 46 respectively which represent the distribution weights of the tower blade tower bottom tower middle tower top blade top blade middle and blade bottom relative to their upper layers that is each group of historical data consists of 4 6 correlation degree data and one health state level data two hundred groups of data are used in the model to train and optimize the weight intervals of eight parts and three hundred groups are used to match and verify the optimized weights 4 2 test steps 4 2 1 solve the weight interval using uncertain ahp based on the uncertain ahp each of five experts grade three substructures through calculation each substructure synthesizes the scoring table of the five experts to obtain a comprehensive weight interval table an expert scores the substructures of the tower bottom middle and top as shown in table 5 from the reciprocal matrix property table 6 is obtained after completing the scoring table the matrix is rewritten into two matrices as follows 26 a 1 1 1 2 0 333 1 1 0 25 0 333 1 27 a 1 1 3 4 1 1 3 0 5 1 1 from 1 to 5 the final evaluation weight intervals of this expert for each factor of this substructure are as follows tower bottom weight range ω 11 0 4399 0 5914 tower middle weight range ω 12 0 2590 0 3482 tower top weight range ω 13 0 1525 0 2050 where ω k i is the weight interval assigned by the k th expert to the i th factor in this substructure similarly the judgment complementary matrices of the other four experts are presented in tables 7 10 using 6 to 13 the evaluation weights of the similarity and difference of each expert can be calculated using the uncertain judgment matrix the weights of the five experts are γ 1 0 1898 γ 2 0 2292 γ 3 0 1803 γ 4 0 1554 γ 5 0 2453 from 14 and 15 the upper and lower boundaries of the evaluation weight intervals of multiple experts corresponding to each factor are weighted and averaged based on the corresponding expert weight the final weight ranges of tower bottom middle and top for the tower are ω f 1 0 4257 0 5468 ω f 2 0 2736 0 3507 ω f 3 0 1746 0 2239 similarly for the other two substructures i e the substructure composed of the whole structure tower and blade and the substructure composed of the blade top middle and bottom the above calculation is carried out the results are summarized and the multi level weight summary is presented in table 12 4 2 2 optimize the weight interval using the genetic algorithm genetic algorithm is used to optimize the eight weights first the variables are set as ω f 1 ω f 2 ω f 3 ω f 4 ω f 5 ω f 6 ω f 7 and ω f 8 which represent the weights of tower tube blade tower bottom tower middle tower top blade bottom blade middle and blade top to the upper layer respectively the upper and lower limits of the variables are set as the upper and lower boundaries of their respective weight intervals and the linear constraints are set as ω f 1 ω f 2 1 ω f 3 ω f 4 ω f 5 1 and ω f 6 ω f 7 ω f 8 1 by inputting the correlation degree of 200 groups of historical data and the overall health status four kinds of correlation degrees of each part of each data group are calculated for eight weight variables correspondingly four kinds of health status correlation degrees of the entire structure prediction are obtained by comparison the predicted overall health status was obtained for each iteration count the data quantity of 200 groups of data whose predicted overall health status is the same as the actual overall health status for the correct number of times then the fitness function is the matching rate count divided by 200 4 2 3 summarize the optimization results because the uncertain ahp has determined the range of variables the initial fitness of optimization is high the convergence speed is fast and the matching rate after training can reach up to 99 after optimization the optimal weights of each part are shown in figs 5 7 the weight distributions of the bottom middle and top layers of the tower are 0 4743 0 3018 and 0 2239 respectively the weight distributions of the top middle and bottom parts of the blade are 0 2013 0 3324 and 0 4663 respectively the weight distributions of tower and blade for the overall structure are 0 6932 and 0 3068 respectively therefore the multi level weight table is presented in table 13 4 2 4 verification input 300 groups of data again calculate through the obtained optimal weights and compare the results with the actual health status of the data and obtain the matching rate through verification by verifying the matching rate the overall matching rate of 300 groups of data can exceed 99 the variables converge within 50 generations 5 practical test the monitoring campaigns were conducted in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 the offshore wind farm shown in fig 1 is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province based on the historical measured data and overall health status of the tower bottom middle and top of the single pile offshore wind power structure the health monitoring method based on the genetic algorithm and uncertainty ahp is used for the state evaluation because the data is given for the tower only the tower structure is evaluated for constructing models and assessing the health status therefore only one level structure exists in the established hierarchical model which comprises the tower tube bottom middle and top the layout of field sensors is shown in fig 8 and the structure of the wind turbine monitored is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province five sensor nodes were used to record the vibration signal of the monitored structure on the top point is a5 sensor node and a1 sensor node is located at the junction of the tower and foundation the remainder of the five wireless sensor nodes are evenly arranged on the tower between a1 test point and a5 test point the data on the top middle and bottom of the tower are collected by three collection nodes a1 a3 and a5 after collection the modulus of the sum of the acceleration vectors of the three axes is taken as vibration data one of three axes of each a1 a3 and a5 acceleration sensor node is shown in fig 8 to further prove the reliability of the theory the statistical histogram is shown is fig 9 the figure can clearly tell that the practical data fit an approximate normal distribution which conforms to our initial assumptions as shown in the simulation test the uncertain judgment matrix is constructed by the expert score based on the effect of vibration acceleration signal on each part the overall comprehensive weight interval is listed in table 14 take the acceleration vector modulus of 120 consecutive time points as a group take 500 groups of data through the calculation and process of statistical distribution after calculation each group of data includes four kinds of correlation degrees of three tower parts and the health status of the entire tower corresponding to the time based on 200 groups of data train three variables described by the weight interval through a genetic algorithm the weight histogram is shown in fig 10 as listed in table 15 the specific weight values of the bottom middle and top of the tower are obtained through optimization the weight values of the bottom middle and top of the tower are 0 4811 0 3127 and 0 2062 respectively input the remaining 300 groups of data and then calculate the weight combined with the correlation degree compared with the real data state of the tower the evaluation matching rate can exceed 98 it can be seen that this method has an excellent degree of accuracy when the weight structure is known the calculation time of 300 groups of data representing the health status of each period is only 0 013 s and the calculation time of a single period data is shorter therefore it is demonstrated that the necessary real time evaluation can be realized when the training is completed because this method is fast in the process of on line monitoring the single pile structure is taken as an example first we get the weight distribution of the whole structure through expert scoring and the training of genetic algorithm based on historical data then we arrange three vibration acquisition instruments to synchronously collect the acceleration signals of the top middle and bottom of the tower the acquisition instruments of each part send two acceleration values to the upper computer every second taking 1 min as a health status evaluation cycle 120 values of each part collected every minute are statistically distributed and four health status correlations of each part in this cycle are obtained respectively four health status correlations are synthesized by weight structure trained by genetic algorithm and the final health status of the overall structure can be obtained as the amount of historical data will gradually increase over time we can regularly update the weight structure to increase the credibility of the method due to environmental conditions or sudden external influences such as wind waves and weather at sea the real time state may fluctuate if such effects need to be eliminated in the actual assessment the assessment results in a long period can be statistically processed the more accurate structural health state can be summarized based on the environmental state of the day 6 conclusion to evaluate the health of offshore wind power structures rapidly and accurately a health monitoring method based on genetic algorithm and uncertain ahp is proposed in this study for the first time the uncertain ahp is introduced in the health assessment of wind power structures and the genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the weight structure because the uncertain ahp is mostly based on subjective factors of experts to increase the objectivity in the genetic algorithm optimization the historical measured data was matched and the matching rate was calculated as the fitness function through the test verification of the simulated and measured data the weight structure obtained after training was used for evaluation the matching rate exceeded 98 and the calculation time of 300 groups of data representing each period was only 0 013s therefore the calculation time of data in a single period was shorter so that the staff can timely check and maintain the offshore wind power structure therefore this method can quickly and accurately evaluate the health status of offshore wind power structures with the increase in measured data the updated measured data can be added to the training of the genetic algorithm and the weight structure can be optimized regularly to improve the accuracy of the health status assessment system further this study adopted a single pile wind power structure as an example for modeling and calculation which verified the feasibility and reliability of the method in practice modeling and calculation can be carried out according to the respective actual situations of different structures credit authorship contribution statement lin zhou conceptualization methodology supervision

21358,global offshore wind power is rapidly developing and has a broad market china has the advantage of developing offshore wind power which is the direction of future development of china s power generation industry because of the high maintenance and repair costs as well as the large sizes of wind power structures damage to them could cause loss of lives and property in this paper a health monitoring method for analyzing offshore wind power structures based on a genetic algorithm and an uncertain analytic hierarchy process ahp is proposed the uncertain analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to establish the hierarchical model after calculating the weight range of each part the optimal weight is obtained through the training and optimization of genetic algorithm and the comprehensive weight table is obtained finally the grading of health condition of the whole structure can be obtained by inputting the health indicators of each part based on the statistical distribution for weighted calculation based on the qualitative analysis of the uncertain analytic hierarchy process and the quantitative analysis of the genetic algorithm the method is shown to reliably monitor the health of offshore wind power structures reduce maintenance costs and ensure staff safety both simulation and actual measurement experiments are performed in this study the simulation based on the vibration data proves that the proposed structural health monitoring method for offshore wind power structures can evaluate the grading of health condition rapidly and accurately using data in real time through the training and verification of simulation data the accuracy of prediction after training can exceed 98 through a verification experiment using actual measured data the vibration data measured by the offshore wind power structure during the healthy service period are evaluated the evaluation results are found to be consistent with the actual operation state of the wind power structure the proposed method can be used for quick real time evaluations keywords offshore wind power structure structural health monitoring genetic algorithm rapid assessment uncertain ahp 1 introduction wind energy is a clean and renewable energy which has received much attention worldwide in the past ten years there has been a tremendous rise in the development and utilization of wind resources pacheco et al 2017 due to the long coastline and general offshore distance of offshore wind farms ranging from 10 to 50 km china has a natural advantage in the development of wind power in addition china s offshore wind farms are close to the coastal power load center which has less adverse impact on the environment and little visual interference it is suitable to install wind power structures with larger single capacity for large scale development liu et al 2019 based on the advantages of offshore wind power its development is becoming increasingly popular in china however a critical issue in the development of offshore wind power is the maintenance of offshore wind turbines tian et al 2020 due to the complex marine environment the immature detection and maintenance capabilities can lead to problems such as excessive cost and lack of protection of personnel safety zhou et al 2019 if the traditional onshore wind farm maintenance method is applied to offshore wind farms 25 30 of the generated revenue needs to be invested in daily operations maintenance and risk response which is a very high proportion therefore it is necessary to carry out rapid and accurate health diagnosis perform timely maintenance checks minimize maintenance costs and ensure the safety of staff and maintenance personnel involved in offshore wind power structures liu et al 2019 hence the method of fault data analysis is particularly crucial for fault diagnosis of offshore large scale wind power structures and is closely related to the development of offshore wind power pentaris et al 2013 data acquisition and processing flow of an offshore wind farm is shown in fig 1 wireless sensors such as vibration sensors corrosion sensors and strain sensors are required for the tower above the platform according to rules or specific fan layout for the part below the platform i e the part below sea level wired sensors such as water pressure sensor velocity sensor and strain sensor are used both wired and wireless sensors measure all kinds of data obtained from offshore wind power structures at the same time and transmit the data to the data aggregation node on the platform for collection and synchronization through wireless signal transmission and wired cable transmission respectively then the synchronous data is processed and transmitted to the shore station using wired or wireless means for real time data monitoring storage analysis and other operations at present the technology of structural health detection in the field of bridge is relatively mature while in the field of offshore structural health monitoring most structural health monitoring is only aimed at wind turbines and their components rather than structures combined with these aspects the relevant research is as follows 1 devriendt et al identified the modal parameters of the offshore wind turbines based on the data measured by operating mode analysis oma under natural environment excitation and extracted the modal parameters of the structure this method can safely and accurately estimate the natural frequency damping ratio and vibration mode of offshore wind turbine without affecting the normal operation of the structure so as to carry out modal analysis and analyze the health status of wind turbine devriendt et al 2014 at present there are many articles about modal analysis of wind turbine liu et al 2020 for large scale structures this method is rarely used in the health monitoring of offshore structures while its application in bridge health monitoring is relatively mature sun et al 2019 2 in the aspect of large scale offshore structures there are also studies on modal identification through the relevant data of structures kraemer and friedmanna give a basic description of the algorithm based on stochastic subspace and introduce its application in the structure of marine hydraulic structures the method is demonstrated and discussed through practical test peter and herbert 2015 li et al used the inverse finite element method ifem to monitor a tower of an owt under both static and dynamic loading conditions the total displacement and von mises stress obtained from the analysis of ifem were compared with the reference results and the optimal position of the sensor was determined li et al 2020 mojtahedi et al carried out experimental modal analysis ema on the physical model of offshore jacket platform established a numerical updated finite element model and compared the influence of different model reduction methods on the dynamic characteristics of spd8 jacket platform by using the traditional and improved cross model cross mode cmcm iterative algorithm mojtahedi et al 2020 there are also related studies using the vibration characteristics to obtain modal parameters establish the structure finite element model and the results of the physical model are modified by numerical model finally a complex and efficient structural health monitoring system is proposed by combining intelligent algorithm with fuzzy logic mojtahdi et al 2019 3 based on the local data measurement set the corresponding damage thresholds and carry out fault warning and diagnosis of the wind turbines by defining the safety range of the strain value mieloszyk and ostachowicz 2017 in this method the data of various damage types are extracted by simulating damage test of wind turbines and then the damage index is defined this method can not only monitor the damage accurately but also locate the damage so as to repair the damaged parts in time among the above methods modal identification method can get the modal parameters of the structure accurately and analyze them liu et al 2020 however due to the need for modal analysis and the establishment of relevant models the numerical calculation of this method is relatively complex at present this method is still mainly used for off line analysis carne and james 2010 liu et al 2017 the threshold alarm and detection method based on local measurement data can detect the health status of wind turbine in real time and locate accurately but for large scale offshore structures it is difficult to carry out damage simulation test and fault data collection therefore at present these methods are mostly used for offshore wind turbines rather than structures using analytic hierarchy process to calculate the health index of wind power structure we can evaluate the overall weight distribution of wind power structure by expert score and evaluate the overall structure by combining the local health detection method however if this method is to be used for on line monitoring it also depends on the specific local damage detection method at the same time there is room for improvement in the application of ahp in the study of bridge structures wei developed models using ahp and group judgment and established indicators using a statistical distribution method to evaluate the state of the bridge structure wei 2012 the experimental results show that the method can successfully complete the real time health monitoring of the bridge structure through numerical calculation in the case of lack of fault data because of the flexibility of this method there is still room for improvement in the calculation and optimization of the weight structure due to the problems such as limited fault data of offshore wind turbine structures lack of unified fault standards and difficulty in rapid and objective health assessment of part of the structure or the entire structure this study proposes a health monitoring method of offshore wind turbine structure based on genetic algorithm optimization and uncertain ahp this method does not need to identify offshore wind power structure parameters and establish a model but uses statistical methods to quickly calculate and complete the evaluation at the same time the combination of uncertain analytic hierarchy process and genetic algorithm training based on measured data not only adds certain objectivity to analytic hierarchy process but also reduces the amount of data required for genetic algorithm training to a certain extent ultimately this method can successfully achieve fast and accurate online monitoring of offshore wind power structures 2 methods 2 1 uncertain analytic hierarchy process the ahp classifies the decision objectives factors decision criteria and decision objects into the highest middle and lowest levels according to their mutual relations and draws the hierarchy chart the highest level refers to the purpose of decision making and the problems to be solved the lowest level refers to alternatives in the decision making process the middle layer refers to the considered factors and criteria for decision making for any two adjacent layers the upper layer is called the target layer and the lower layer is the factor layer fu 2011 regarding the specific situation of offshore wind power structures this paper takes vibration signal as an example to study the health monitoring method of offshore wind power structure because the impacts of vibration signals on the health status of various parts of the wind power structures are different we classify the health status according to the vibration signals of various parts tu et al 2012 taking a single pile offshore wind power structure as an example the evaluation index system and hierarchy of wind power structure vibration signal are obtained as follows as shown in fig 2 the vibration signal is composed of tower vibration signal and blade vibration signal which is subdivided into tower top tower middle tower bottom blade top blade middle and blade bottom after drawing the hierarchy diagram the index weight is usually solved by the expert system fu et al 2015 the ahp judgment matrix is established for each substructure i e upper and lower structure as shown in fig 2 and the model has three upper and three lower structures by each expert for the lower level indicators of each substructure the comparison of the importance of the two indicators is expressed by a specific number ranging between 1 and 9 which quantifies the importance of the indicators the scoring criteria are listed in table 1 we can form the judgment matrix in which the elements of the i th row and j th column represent the importance of the i th factor compared with j th factor which is expressed by a i j however it is arbitrary to express indicators with specific numbers because of the complexity of determining objective facts the determined numbers are replaced with intervals to form the uncertain judgment matrix this method of analysis is called the uncertain ahp here the uncertain judgment matrix where a i j a i j b i j represents the score of the i th factor for the j th factor and the interval matrix is divided into two matrices a a i j n n and a b i j n n for each uncertain judgment matrix calculate the corresponding weights of matrix a and matrix a with the least square method the terms ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n t and ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n t are calculated as shown in 1 and 2 where n represents the dimension of matrix and ω and ω are the corresponding weights of a and a respectively 1 w k i 1 n a k i a k k a i k a i i 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 n a j i a j j a i j a i i 1 2 n k 1 2 n 2 ω k i 1 n b k i b k k b i k b i i 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 n b j i b j j b i j b i i 1 2 n k 1 2 n the following two indicators are calculated by a and a as shown in 3 and 4 respectively 3 k j 1 n 1 i 1 n b i j 4 m j 1 n 1 i 1 n a i j where k and m are the weight indexes used in the calculation of the expert s weight therefore the weight interval of n factors of the uncertain matrix a obtained by the expert s score can be expressed as shown in 5 5 ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n where ω i k ω i m ω i and i 1 n represent the weight range of the expert s judgment on the i th structural factor to its superior each group of substructures is evaluated based on m uncertain matrices by m experts each uncertain matrix is calculated to obtain a weight vector the number of weight vector elements is n which represents the expert s weight distribution of n factors because the scores are all composed of intervals the weight elements of each determined factor are also represented using intervals for each substructure m experts get m weight interval vectors for each group of substructures m weight vectors are summarized into a table and then a weight interval summary table of m rows and n columns is obtained table 2 can be obtained where the matrix element in row k and column i is ω k i ω k i ω k i i 1 n k 1 m which represents the weight range of the evaluation on the i th element by the k th expert after getting the weight interval summary table of a substructure we need to synthesize the results of multiple experts because we obtain the evaluation weight interval of various factors of the substructure from multiple experts here we use group judgment to calculate the results of several experts to determine the credibility of each expert using the weighted average technique the evaluation interval of each factor is obtained after synthesizing the results of several experts in other words multiple weight vectors are weighted to obtain a comprehensive weight vector the elements of the weight vector are still composed of intervals the weighted weights are determined from the credibility of the experts the credibility needs to integrate the similarities and differences between the experts the steps of similarity calculation are as follows 1 construct a consistent digital matrix according to the uncertain judgment matrix a a i j n n made by each expert where a i j a i j b i j take 6 as the consistency number matrix 6 m i j k 1 n a i k b i k a j k b i k 1 2 n following this approach the consistent number matrix m m i j n n is obtained 2 arrange the row vectors of the consistent digital matrix in a row to form a new row vector 3 finally according to the above method the judgment matrix made by m experts is transformed into m row vectors which are recorded as α 1 α 2 α m such that η i j represents the cosine of the angle between α i and α j the cosine formula is given in 7 7 cos θ α β α β i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n b i 2 in 7 n represents the dimension n of the matrix of order take 8 ξ i j 1 m η i j 1 where η i j is the cosine of the angle between α i and α j and ξ i is the similarity index by normalizing ξ i we can determine the quantity ξ i of the similarity degree between the judgment of the i th expert and that of other experts as shown in 9 9 ζ i ξ i j 1 m ξ j the steps for calculating the difference degree are as follows 1 record the m row vectors calculated in the second step of the similarity calculation as α 1 α 2 α m where α k a k 1 a k 2 a k n is the evaluation value given by the k th expert for n indicators 2 take the following 10 x i 1 m k 1 m a k i i 1 2 n where x i represents the average value of all the experts evaluation at the i th evaluation index 3 note that σ k i a k i x i where σ k i represents the difference between the evaluation value and mean value of the i th index by the k th expert the sum of the difference between the evaluation value and the corresponding mean value of each index by the k th expert is given in 11 11 σ k i 1 n σ k i 4 subsequently the difference between the judgment results of the k th expert and other experts is presented in 12 12 δ k σ k σ k 1 2 m σ k 1 m σ k the evaluation weight γ k of the k th expert can be obtained by combining the similarities and differences as shown in 13 13 γ k ζ k 1 δ k 1 k 1 m ζ k δ k k 1 m ζ k δ k 1 ζ k k 1 m ζ k δ k 1 5 after obtaining γ k the upper and lower limits of the weight interval of the corresponding expert results are the weighted average by γ k that is the upper and lower limits of the comprehensive weight interval of the i th element in this substructure are calculated using 14 and 15 14 ω f i k 1 m γ k ω k i i 1 n 15 ω f i k 1 m γ k ω k i i 1 n where ω k i and ω k i represent the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the interval judged by the k th expert on the i th factor finally the comprehensive weight interval vector ω f ω f 1 ω f 2 ω f n of each factor based on several experts in this substructure is obtained where ω f i ω f i ω f i and i 1 n in this way for each group of substructures the comprehensive weight interval of each factor in a substructure group can be obtained after obtaining the weight intervals of all the factors of the substructure the multi level weight interval table can be developed comprehensively as the weights are expressed by intervals it is necessary to determine the specific weights in the interval obtain the final weight setting value and determine the final multi level setting weight table 2 2 genetic algorithm in this study we determine the fixed weight value by genetic algorithm optimization this is because the uncertain ahp determines the weight interval of each part and we need to obtain the fixed weight value of each part the genetic algorithm toolbox in matlab 2016 is used for optimization training and the parameters of genetic algorithm are shown in table 3 the input parameter variable is the weight of each part calculated by the uncertain ahp and each variable is limited to the corresponding weight range of each variable the linear constraint of variables is added that is the sum of the weights of each factor in the lower layer under each substructure is 1 for example for the offshore single pile wind power structure eight weight variables are input as the parameters for optimization namely tower barrel blade tower bottom tower center tower top blade top blade center and blade bottom which are represented by ω a ω b ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 ω b 1 ω b 2 and ω b 3 respectively in the training process these variables need to satisfy the relationship ω a ω b 1 ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 1 and ω b 1 ω b 2 ω b 3 1 because this method is based on historical data and actual state the fitness function of the genetic algorithm is defined each time 200 groups of historical data are input for training each group of historical data includes the vibration data of each bottom layer part within a given period as well as the health status of the overall structure in this period the health status level is represented by numbers including 1 2 3 and 4 because the statistics interval based on the formula is determined when the vibration data within the period is determined the four kinds of correlation degrees of the corresponding bottom parts are also determined therefore the historical data used for training can be simplified as follows four kinds of correlation degrees of each bottom layer part and the corresponding state level of the overall structure the four kinds of correlation degrees of historical data are calculated using the current multiple weight variables to obtain the corresponding correlation degrees of the entire structure based on the current weight the correlation degrees are calculated to determine the health status level of the overall structure under the current weight two hundred groups of data are calculated for each training the calculated results i e the overall structural state level are compared with the real state level of historical data the initial count is set to 0 for each training and 1 is added to the count if each group of data in the historical data matches successfully each time 200 groups of data are compared the matching rate is calculated as the count divided by 200 because the fitness function is set to converge to the minimum we shall take the fitness function as the opposite number of the matching rate i e count 200 to maximize the matching rate 2 3 method of judging health state based on statistical distribution after determining the weight value of each part of the overall structure for the target layer we need to obtain the health indicators of each specific part of the bottom layer by weighting them through the weight table we can determine the health indicators of the overall structure of the top layer to assess the health status of the global structure however due to lack of sufficient fault data in wind power structures it is difficult to determine the fault standard or threshold of specific data types therefore in this study we refer to the health diagnosis method in the research of bridge structures wei 2012 and adopt the health judgment method based on statistical distribution in the case of lack of fault data this method can also be used to define the fault standard or health index and determine the health index of each specific part most actions on offshore wind power structures are randomly produced such as wind force and waves therefore during the actual health monitoring the measured responses are taken as non stationary random responses because the calculation of non stationary random response is complex for convenience the calculation and analysis are carried out based on the stationary random response in probability statistics most of the random scalars x obey or partly obey the normal distribution curve as long as the sample size is large enough the variation distribution meets the standard normal distribution in the actual measurement the measured value x can have an extreme value of a particular parameter in a specific time interval t which can be adjusted and the average value is set as the average value of x in a cycle the variation is the difference between the measured values in the cycle and the average value in this monitoring cycle and the overall standard deviation can be obtained correspondingly the statistics meet the standard normal distribution as given in 16 16 δ σ n 0 1 where σ is the standard deviation and δ is the variation from the table corresponding to the normal distribution we can get 17 17 p δ σ 2 0 2 φ 2 0 1 95 44 according to the table when the confidence interval is 2 2 the confidence level has then reached 95 44 which is almost guaranteed therefore we grade within this interval the division standard is divided according to equal area that is the same area is divided into four parts in the confidence interval checking the table the confidence interval can be obtained as shown in 18 19 and 20 18 p δ σ 0 3 2 φ 0 3 1 23 58 19 p δ σ 0 65 2 φ 0 65 1 48 44 20 p δ σ 1 1 2 φ 1 1 1 72 86 as shown in fig 3 the confidence interval is divided into several areas according to the equal area method among the intervals health level 1 is the highest and level 4 is the lowest in practice we take the data of a monitoring cycle for a specific part each time we calculate the difference between the measured value and the mean value of all the data in this monitoring cycle as the change quantity and calculate a statistical quantity for each change quantity in this cycle using a fixed formula if we sum up the statistics then we can get the interval of the statistics of this period then calculating the correlation degree between this region and each health region four types of correlation degrees in this region are obtained and compared it is considered that the health state region with the largest relative correlation degree is the health state of the current region the calculation formula for correlation degree is derived as follows define the distance from the point to the interval using 21 21 ρ x a b x a b 2 b a 2 where c and d are the endpoints on both sides of the coordinate range of the coordinate system then define the distance from interval x y to interval c d as given in 22 22 ρ x y c d 1 2 ρ x c d ρ y c d determine the classic domain from 23 23 r t n t c j x t j n t c 1 x t 1 c 2 x t 2 c n x t n n t c 1 c t 1 d t 1 c 2 c t 2 d t 2 c n c t n d t n where n t t 1 2 m is the level of the state of the wind power structure c j j 1 2 n is the evaluation index and x t j is the range of j index corresponding to n t i e classical domain c t j d t j which represents several health state intervals determine the joint domain using 24 24 r p n p c j x p j n p c 1 x p 1 c 2 x p 2 c n x p n n t c 1 c p 1 d p 1 c 2 c p 2 d p 2 c n c p n d p n where n p is the whole state level x p j is the range of quantity value determined by n p on evaluation index c j i e section c p j d p j for confidence interval 0 2 and p represents the whole of health state level subsequently determine the matter element which refers to the interval of measured data statistics of each bottom layer which is recorded as c 0 j d 0 j therefore the correlation between the data of each bottom layer and that of each health status level can be calculated using 25 25 k t x 0 j ρ x 0 j x t j ρ x 0 j x p j ρ x 0 j x t j c 0 j d 0 j c t j d t j ρ x 0 j x t j x t j c 0 j d 0 j c t j b t j where t corresponds to the health level and j represents the j th part of the bottom layer k t x 0 j is the correlation degree of the data of the j bottom layer to the status level t from this equation we can obtain four kinds of correlation degrees for each part of the bottom layer 3 decision method of uncertain analytic hierarchy process based on genetic algorithm optimization 3 1 total flow therefore in this study an uncertain ahp decision method is proposed based on genetic algorithm optimization the overall flow chart is illustrated in fig 4 the specific steps in determining the total flow are as follows 1 calculate the weight range of each part taking a single pile offshore wind power structure as an example a hierarchical health monitoring model of the single pile offshore wind power structure based on a vibration signal is established through the uncertain ahp each substructure is scored by experts the weights of each part are preliminarily evaluated and the weights of each part of the upper layer are calculated 2 the weight of each part is determined through optimization after determining the weight intervals we need to confirm each weight interval as a fixed value therefore based on the historical measured data including the historical vibration data and historical health status we take the weight interval of each part as the input variable and the fitness function in carrying out the optimization training of the genetic algorithm in other words the genetic algorithm is used to optimize each weight interval where the sum of the weights of the lower layer of each substructure is 1 3 four correlation degrees of each part of the bottom layer are calculated based on the health state judgment method of statistical distribution the vibration data within a period are calculated and four kinds of correlation degrees of each factor in the bottom layer are obtained 4 develop a comprehensive table for example for the wind power structure the multi level weight distribution table added with four types of correlation degrees is presented in table 4 that each weight distribution meets the requirements of ω a ω b 1 ω a 1 ω a 2 ω a 3 1 and ω b 1 ω b 2 ω b 3 1 5 calculate the four kinds of correlation degrees of the entire structure the correlation degrees are weighted and synthesized based on the weight distribution table and the four kinds of correlation degrees of the whole structure are obtained in short the overall health indicators are calculated according to the weight structure and health indicators of each part in which the uncertain analytic hierarchy process and genetic algorithm are used to calculate the weight structure and the statistical distribution method is used to calculate the health indicators of each specific part 4 simulation test 4 1 test description to test the uncertain ahp based on the genetic algorithm optimization of the vibration signal of offshore wind power structures the feasibility and reliability of this method are verified through experiments to determine the judgment matrix we need to prepare five scoring experts to score several substructures in the offshore wind power structure model based on vibration signals through calculations the weight distribution interval of each part of the model is obtained subsequently 500 groups of simulation vibration signal data of wind power structure need to be prepared each group of data represents vibration signal data of six specific parts of the wind power structure within each fixed period and the health status level of the wind power structure in the same period the fixed period here is tentatively determined as 1 min 120 vibration values expressed by acceleration are collected for each specific part every minute therefore each group of data contains 720 vibration data values generated by simulating real vibration data in a larger range in each group of simulation data six groups of vibration signal data of specific bottom layer parts are simplified into four kinds of correlation degrees for each of the six bottom layer parts using the health state determination method based on statistical distribution the health status level of each group of simulated data is represented by numbers 1 4 that is the final overall structural health status obtained by calculating the correlations of the health status of each part of the simulated vibration data through the simulation weights here the simulation weights are set to 0 69 0 31 0 48 0 31 0 21 0 22 0 32 0 46 respectively which represent the distribution weights of the tower blade tower bottom tower middle tower top blade top blade middle and blade bottom relative to their upper layers that is each group of historical data consists of 4 6 correlation degree data and one health state level data two hundred groups of data are used in the model to train and optimize the weight intervals of eight parts and three hundred groups are used to match and verify the optimized weights 4 2 test steps 4 2 1 solve the weight interval using uncertain ahp based on the uncertain ahp each of five experts grade three substructures through calculation each substructure synthesizes the scoring table of the five experts to obtain a comprehensive weight interval table an expert scores the substructures of the tower bottom middle and top as shown in table 5 from the reciprocal matrix property table 6 is obtained after completing the scoring table the matrix is rewritten into two matrices as follows 26 a 1 1 1 2 0 333 1 1 0 25 0 333 1 27 a 1 1 3 4 1 1 3 0 5 1 1 from 1 to 5 the final evaluation weight intervals of this expert for each factor of this substructure are as follows tower bottom weight range ω 11 0 4399 0 5914 tower middle weight range ω 12 0 2590 0 3482 tower top weight range ω 13 0 1525 0 2050 where ω k i is the weight interval assigned by the k th expert to the i th factor in this substructure similarly the judgment complementary matrices of the other four experts are presented in tables 7 10 using 6 to 13 the evaluation weights of the similarity and difference of each expert can be calculated using the uncertain judgment matrix the weights of the five experts are γ 1 0 1898 γ 2 0 2292 γ 3 0 1803 γ 4 0 1554 γ 5 0 2453 from 14 and 15 the upper and lower boundaries of the evaluation weight intervals of multiple experts corresponding to each factor are weighted and averaged based on the corresponding expert weight the final weight ranges of tower bottom middle and top for the tower are ω f 1 0 4257 0 5468 ω f 2 0 2736 0 3507 ω f 3 0 1746 0 2239 similarly for the other two substructures i e the substructure composed of the whole structure tower and blade and the substructure composed of the blade top middle and bottom the above calculation is carried out the results are summarized and the multi level weight summary is presented in table 12 4 2 2 optimize the weight interval using the genetic algorithm genetic algorithm is used to optimize the eight weights first the variables are set as ω f 1 ω f 2 ω f 3 ω f 4 ω f 5 ω f 6 ω f 7 and ω f 8 which represent the weights of tower tube blade tower bottom tower middle tower top blade bottom blade middle and blade top to the upper layer respectively the upper and lower limits of the variables are set as the upper and lower boundaries of their respective weight intervals and the linear constraints are set as ω f 1 ω f 2 1 ω f 3 ω f 4 ω f 5 1 and ω f 6 ω f 7 ω f 8 1 by inputting the correlation degree of 200 groups of historical data and the overall health status four kinds of correlation degrees of each part of each data group are calculated for eight weight variables correspondingly four kinds of health status correlation degrees of the entire structure prediction are obtained by comparison the predicted overall health status was obtained for each iteration count the data quantity of 200 groups of data whose predicted overall health status is the same as the actual overall health status for the correct number of times then the fitness function is the matching rate count divided by 200 4 2 3 summarize the optimization results because the uncertain ahp has determined the range of variables the initial fitness of optimization is high the convergence speed is fast and the matching rate after training can reach up to 99 after optimization the optimal weights of each part are shown in figs 5 7 the weight distributions of the bottom middle and top layers of the tower are 0 4743 0 3018 and 0 2239 respectively the weight distributions of the top middle and bottom parts of the blade are 0 2013 0 3324 and 0 4663 respectively the weight distributions of tower and blade for the overall structure are 0 6932 and 0 3068 respectively therefore the multi level weight table is presented in table 13 4 2 4 verification input 300 groups of data again calculate through the obtained optimal weights and compare the results with the actual health status of the data and obtain the matching rate through verification by verifying the matching rate the overall matching rate of 300 groups of data can exceed 99 the variables converge within 50 generations 5 practical test the monitoring campaigns were conducted in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 the offshore wind farm shown in fig 1 is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province based on the historical measured data and overall health status of the tower bottom middle and top of the single pile offshore wind power structure the health monitoring method based on the genetic algorithm and uncertainty ahp is used for the state evaluation because the data is given for the tower only the tower structure is evaluated for constructing models and assessing the health status therefore only one level structure exists in the established hierarchical model which comprises the tower tube bottom middle and top the layout of field sensors is shown in fig 8 and the structure of the wind turbine monitored is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province five sensor nodes were used to record the vibration signal of the monitored structure on the top point is a5 sensor node and a1 sensor node is located at the junction of the tower and foundation the remainder of the five wireless sensor nodes are evenly arranged on the tower between a1 test point and a5 test point the data on the top middle and bottom of the tower are collected by three collection nodes a1 a3 and a5 after collection the modulus of the sum of the acceleration vectors of the three axes is taken as vibration data one of three axes of each a1 a3 and a5 acceleration sensor node is shown in fig 8 to further prove the reliability of the theory the statistical histogram is shown is fig 9 the figure can clearly tell that the practical data fit an approximate normal distribution which conforms to our initial assumptions as shown in the simulation test the uncertain judgment matrix is constructed by the expert score based on the effect of vibration acceleration signal on each part the overall comprehensive weight interval is listed in table 14 take the acceleration vector modulus of 120 consecutive time points as a group take 500 groups of data through the calculation and process of statistical distribution after calculation each group of data includes four kinds of correlation degrees of three tower parts and the health status of the entire tower corresponding to the time based on 200 groups of data train three variables described by the weight interval through a genetic algorithm the weight histogram is shown in fig 10 as listed in table 15 the specific weight values of the bottom middle and top of the tower are obtained through optimization the weight values of the bottom middle and top of the tower are 0 4811 0 3127 and 0 2062 respectively input the remaining 300 groups of data and then calculate the weight combined with the correlation degree compared with the real data state of the tower the evaluation matching rate can exceed 98 it can be seen that this method has an excellent degree of accuracy when the weight structure is known the calculation time of 300 groups of data representing the health status of each period is only 0 013 s and the calculation time of a single period data is shorter therefore it is demonstrated that the necessary real time evaluation can be realized when the training is completed because this method is fast in the process of on line monitoring the single pile structure is taken as an example first we get the weight distribution of the whole structure through expert scoring and the training of genetic algorithm based on historical data then we arrange three vibration acquisition instruments to synchronously collect the acceleration signals of the top middle and bottom of the tower the acquisition instruments of each part send two acceleration values to the upper computer every second taking 1 min as a health status evaluation cycle 120 values of each part collected every minute are statistically distributed and four health status correlations of each part in this cycle are obtained respectively four health status correlations are synthesized by weight structure trained by genetic algorithm and the final health status of the overall structure can be obtained as the amount of historical data will gradually increase over time we can regularly update the weight structure to increase the credibility of the method due to environmental conditions or sudden external influences such as wind waves and weather at sea the real time state may fluctuate if such effects need to be eliminated in the actual assessment the assessment results in a long period can be statistically processed the more accurate structural health state can be summarized based on the environmental state of the day 6 conclusion to evaluate the health of offshore wind power structures rapidly and accurately a health monitoring method based on genetic algorithm and uncertain ahp is proposed in this study for the first time the uncertain ahp is introduced in the health assessment of wind power structures and the genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the weight structure because the uncertain ahp is mostly based on subjective factors of experts to increase the objectivity in the genetic algorithm optimization the historical measured data was matched and the matching rate was calculated as the fitness function through the test verification of the simulated and measured data the weight structure obtained after training was used for evaluation the matching rate exceeded 98 and the calculation time of 300 groups of data representing each period was only 0 013s therefore the calculation time of data in a single period was shorter so that the staff can timely check and maintain the offshore wind power structure therefore this method can quickly and accurately evaluate the health status of offshore wind power structures with the increase in measured data the updated measured data can be added to the training of the genetic algorithm and the weight structure can be optimized regularly to improve the accuracy of the health status assessment system further this study adopted a single pile wind power structure as an example for modeling and calculation which verified the feasibility and reliability of the method in practice modeling and calculation can be carried out according to the respective actual situations of different structures credit authorship contribution statement lin zhou conceptualization methodology supervision

21359,the classical finite element approach cannot guarantee satisfactory accuracy for acoustic problems at large wavenumbers on account of the numerical pollution error effect this negative effect stems from the fact that the approximate wavenumbers are usually in conflict with the real wavenumbers in many numerical methods to suppress this effect a radial point interpolation meshless technique with a modified scheme for selecting interpolation nodes is employed in this paper one dimensional dispersion analysis shows that this modified scheme can effectively reduce numerical errors compared with the original scheme the results of several numerical examples have manifested that the present method can generate more accurate and reliable solutions than the standard finite element approach and the original radial point interpolation method in the acoustic analyses keywords meshfree simulation modified radial point interpolation method pollution error effect acoustic problems 1 introduction computational acoustics has received more and more attention in the past few decades since acoustics plays an important role in not only engineering applications jung et al 2020 but also the field of physical acoustics such as the photonic crystal balint and bordas 2020 hussein 2018 to precisely acquire the acoustic field is a primary prerequisite for conducting investigations of acoustics various analytical methods diperna and stanton 1994 mitri 2015 or semi analytical methods gong et al 2017 pillai et al 1982 have been successfully applied in the acoustic analyses however the use of these methodologies is confined to the acoustic analyses for simple regular geometries for more complicated geometric models the numerical methods are the sensible choices the finite element method fem ihlenburg 1998 and the boundary element method bem estorff 2000 fu et al 2018a b are two widely used numerical methods to conduct acoustic analyses owing to the reliability and the mature formulation however the resulting system matrices of the classical bem are usually asymmetric and nonsparse giving rise to the prohibitively high computational cost for large scale models harari and hughes 1992a li et al 2019 in addition the classical bem may produce non unique solutions for exterior acoustic problems at large characteristic wavenumbers hence fem is still a preferable method in analyzing acoustics due to the sparse and symmetric system matrices however it is well known that the pollution effect coming from the discretization of the continuous acoustical medium would degrade the accuracy of fem solutions in large wavenumbers hence denser meshgrids and polynomial bases of high order at the cost of higher amount of computation efforts ihlenburg and babuška 1995 1997 demkowicz 2006 schwab 1998 are required to improve the accuracy of the standard fem for large wavenumbers on the other side many researchers aim to improve the variation principle or the function space of fem for suppressing the pollution error effect babuška et al 1995 thompson and pinsky 1995 oberai and pinsky 2000 melenk and babuška 1996 these improved methods can be quite effective in one dimensional problems however they cannot eliminate the aforementioned pollution effect for two dimensional acoustic problems it is reported from some works li et al 2020 he et al 2016 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 that the staple source of the pollution error roots in the out of balance between the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix obtained from the discretized numerical model hence a cluster of the smoothed fems liu and nguyen 2010 liu and zhang 2013 zeng and liu 2018 and a mass redistributed fem li et al 2016 li and he 2019 for balancing the stiff and the mass matrices are proposed the investigations of numerical examples have shown that these methods chai et al 2016 2018 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 you et al 2019 2020a can depress the pollution errors for high wavenumbers more effectively than the standard fem in addition the isogeometric analysis iga atroshchenko et al 2018 marussig et al 2015 simpson et al 2014 has also received much attention in acoustics since the geometric model can be exactly represented in the analysis without model errors iga can generate quite accurate results for interior acoustics chen et al 2018 coox et al 2016 wu et al 2015 shaaban et al 2020 and acoustic scattering khajah et al 2016 2019 khajah and villamizar 2019 videla et al 2019 by elevating the order of non uniform rational b splines nurbs shape functions or increasing the discretization density furthermore a promising deep neural network method anitescu et al 2019 is adopted to study helmholtz equation with an adaptive collocation strategy producing considerably accurate results the mesh based numerical methods are still limited by the generation of meshgrids in adaptive analyses or analyzing complex geometries resulting in a trend for developing meshfree techniques chen and li 2020 nguyen et al 2008 fu et al 2018a b due to the flexibility in the discretization and the high accuracy formulation of shape functions meshfree techniques have been introduced in handling helmholtz problems the problems of wave propagation have been solved via an element free galerkin method efgm li 2018 by bouillard and suleaub 1998 suleau and bouillard 2000 and suleau et al 2000 revealing that efgm can significantly relieve the pollution error effect at high wavenumbers compared to fem however the shape functions in efgm lack the kronecker delta function property for directly implementing the essential boundary condition in light of this the radial basis function rbf meshless method embracing this property is employed to approximate unknown variables in this work the rbf collocation method was first employed to solve partial differential equations by kansa 1990 and then has been extended to scientific problems of many areas kansa 2015 until now little work has focused on the feasibility of the rbf methods for acoustic problems especially for exterior acoustics the numerical methods using rbfs based on the strong form lin et al 2012 hon and chen 2003 the weak form wenterodt and estorff 2009 xu et al 2019 chai et al 2020 and the local weak form you et al 2020b have been analyzed for interior acoustics which yields good accuracy for acoustics compared with the standard fem or bem however these works mainly focus on interior acoustic problems for relatively simple geometries in real life interior or exterior acoustic problems for complicated geometries are often encountered in engineering applications such as automotive engineering and ocean engineering the purpose of this work is thus to further extend the rbf method based on the galerkin weak form namely the radial point interpolation method rpim into more complicated acoustic problems such as acoustic scattering generally rpim follows the pattern of fem except for the mesh generation and the interpolation process meaning that the program codes of rpim are largely similar to those of fem with easy implementation moreover in this work a modified scheme for selecting nodes in the interpolation is introduced to improve the accuracy of rpim when using non uniform or irregular node arrangements the performance of the modified rpim mrpim is compared with the four node bilinear fem fem q4 the eight node quadratic fem fem q8 and the original rpim through several acoustic problems indicating that mrpim can outperform the original rpim and fem q4 in the analyses and behaves better than fem q8 for acoustics scattering the rest of this paper is structured as the following parts in section 2 the fundamental equations for acoustic problems are briefly introduced in section 3 mrpim is introduced with the modified scheme of node selection to reduce the errors in the numerical integration in section 4 the measurement of the pollution error effect in numerical solutions is presented in section 5 several typical numerical examples are analyzed to compare the performances of the different numerical methodologies in the last section several discussions and remarks concerning mrpim are given 2 basic concepts of computational acoustic 2 1 governing equations consider a d dimensional domain r r d that is bounded by a boundary γ inside the problem domain the unknown acoustic pressure u is governed by the helmholtz equation 1 δ u k 2 u f where δ is laplacian k ω c signifies the considered wavenumber ω is the angular frequency c is the wave speed and f indicates a volumetric source term assuming that the boundary γ γ d γ n γ r is composed of 2 u u on γ d dirichlet boundary condition u n i ρ ω v n on γ n neumann boundary condition u n i ρ ω a n u on γ r robin boundary condition in which u and v n are the given data on the corresponding boundaries n indicates the outward normal vector of the corresponding boundaries a n is the admittance parameter for robin boundary and ρ is the medium density on the basis of the motion relationship the acoustical particle velocity v is linked to the gradients of acoustic pressure 3 u i ρ ω v for interior acoustic problems the domain based numerical methods can be directly performed to solve the helmholtz equation however the sommerfeld radiation condition should be satisfied when the domain based numerical methods are employed to tackle exterior acoustic problems the sommerfeld radiation condition is given as 4 lim x r d 1 2 u r i k u 0 in which r x is the distance from the origin to infinity the general way for satisfying this condition is to employ an artificial boundary γ a that truncates the unbounded problem domain r into the bounded domain ω for computations as shown in fig 1 several methodologies can be chosen to achieve this such as the nonreflecting boundary condition grote and keller 1995 the absorbing boundary conditions bayliss et al 1982 modave et al 2018 2020 the infinite elements gerdes 2000 and the absorbing layer turkel and yefet 1998 fu et al 2020 among these methodologies the dirichlet to neumann dtn map grote and keller 1995 which is an ideal nonreflecting boundary condition is adopted in this work 2 2 dtn map the dtn map employs an exact radiation solution to relate the pressure data with the derivative data on the truncated dtn boundary γ a the pressure solution on the dtn boundary is expressed in the polar coordinates as 5 u r θ 1 π n 0 0 2 π h n 1 k r h n 1 k r a cos n θ θ u r a θ d θ where r a is the radius of the circular dtn boundary h n 1 is first kind hankel functions of n order and the prime after the sum means that for n 0 the term is multiplied by a coefficient of 0 5 differentiating eq 5 with respect to r along the outward normal direction of the boundary γ a and letting r r a we can obtain 6 u r a θ n n 0 0 2 π m n θ θ n u r a θ d θ in which the dtn kernel is 7 m θ θ n k π h n 1 k r a h n 1 k r a cos n θ θ with n being the term number of the dtn map according to the work harari and hughes 1992b the number n of dtn map should be larger than n k r a to obtain the stable solutions for exterior acoustics the dtn map can also be rewritten in a general form for easy expression 8 u r a θ n m u with m being the dtn operator 2 3 galerkin weak form multiplying eq 1 by the test function w in a form of integral without the volumetric source term such that 9 ω w δ u k 2 u d ω 0 utilizing green s theorem eq 9 gives rise to the weak form as below 10 ω w u d ω k 2 ω w u d ω γ w u n d γ 0 in the galerkin method the test function is chosen the same as the employed shape functions the discretized weak form is then expressed as 11 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω γ φ t u n d γ 0 in which u h φ u φ is the vector of shape functions obtained from the numerical method and u is the vector collecting node variables taking into consideration the related boundary conditions eq 11 is further derived as 12 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω i ρ ω γ n φ t v n d γ i ρ ω a n γ r φ t φ u d γ 0 for interior acoustics 13 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω γ a φ t m φ u d γ i ρ ω γ n φ t v n d γ i ρ ω a n γ r φ t φ u d γ 0 for exterior acoustics 3 formulation of rpim 3 1 basic concepts of meshfree techniques the salient merit of meshfree techniques over the mesh based fem lies in that the procedure of forming shape functions does not count on the meshgrid anymore besides a series of background integration cells is required to integrate the weak form of corresponding governing equations in meshfree techniques and field nodes in the interpolations can be chosen from the whole problem domain without the restriction of the mesh therefore meshfree techniques can be more flexible in the discretization owing to the unnecessary requirement on the node connectivity in this paper four node quadrangles encircled by the dashed lines are chosen as the background cells as shown in fig 2 to obtain the shape functions associated with an arbitrary point of interest x q a few field nodes embraced in the square local support domain of the point x q are employed in the interpolations the support domain is shown as the square encircled by the green lines note that the influence domain of a field node also displayed in fig 2 as the square encircled by the red lines is closely relevant to the concept of the support domain for instance if a field node locates in the support domain of a point of interest the point of interest also locates in the influence domain of this field node so the size r inf of the influence domain and the support domain is usually equivalent in this sense 3 2 shape functions constructed from rbfs rbfs with the linear polynomial basis functions pbfs are utilized to form the shape functions of rpim the use of rbfs for the interpolations is fairly stable when a large number of irregularly distributed nodes are utilized and can always give rise to the invertible moment matrices in the interpolations sharan et al 1997 while high order pbfs cannot nonetheless the use of pure rbfs cannot pass the patch test liu and gu 2005 for the incapability of precisely reproducing the linear consistency so that the linear pbfs are also equipped in rpim the unknown variable u h x in the interpolations is represented as 14 u h x r t x a p t x b i 1 m r i x a i j 1 4 p j x b i in which r i x denotes rbfs for the interpolations m is the number of considered nodes in the interpolations as well as the number of the rbfs used p x 1 x y x y t represents the linear pbfs for two dimensional problems a i and b i are the undetermined coefficients related to certain basis functions and a a 1 a 2 a m m 1 t and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 4 1 t are the column matrices collecting a i and b i respectively in this work the multiquadrics rbf mqrbf is utilized as the basis function which is expressed by 15 r i r r 2 α c d c 2 q in which r x x i 2 y y i 2 is the distance from the interpolation point x x y to a field node x i x i y i d c is the characteristic node spacing α c and q are the adjustable parameters concerning mqrbf the optimal choice of α c and q based on the rigorous mathematical theory is still an open question alternatively α c 2 and q 1 03 are numerically determined by wang and liu 2002 to obtain satisfactory accuracy by enforcing the involved node values in the influence domain of the point x into eq 14 we can obtain a series of linear equations 16 u r m a p m b where u is a column matrix collecting the nodal values 17 u u 1 u 2 u 3 u m m 1 t with the moment matrix r m for rbfs being 18 r m r 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r m r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 r 2 r m r 2 r 1 r m r 2 r m r m r m m m r k x k x i 2 y k y i 2 and the moment matrix p m for the linear pbfs being 19 p m 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 1 x m y m x m y m m 4 additional constraint condition to ensure uniqueness is satisfied as 20 p m t a 0 combining eq 16 with eq 20 a group of linear equations is formulated as follows 21 r m p m p m t 0 a b u 0 substituting eq 21 into eq 14 the unknown variable is solved as 22 u h x r t x p t x r m p m p m t 0 1 u 0 φ x u in which φ x denotes the rpim shape functions that are 23 φ x φ 1 x φ 2 x φ m x the derivatives of φ x are constructed directly by differentiating rbfs note that mqrbfs are c continuous so the derivatives of φ x can be fairly smoother in the interpolations than the counterparts of the standard fem additionally the kronecker delta function property is reserved due to the formulation of point interpolation liu and gu 2005 that is 24 φ i x x j 1 i j 0 i j where i and j denote the node indexes hence the scheme for imposing the essential boundary condition in rpim is as common as in standard fem 3 3 modified node selection scheme for mrpim as is well known the numerical integration always takes an important role in the accuracy of several meshfree numerical methodologies due to the complex integrand in meshfree techniques resulting from the node selection as well as the employed non polynomial basis functions the conventional numerical integration technique such as the gaussian integration and the trapezoidal integration cannot exactly integrate the integrand concerning the stiffness and the mass matrices of a discretized model as shown in the first plot of fig 3 four integration points denoted as the four crosses of different colors are in a background integration cell in the original rpim the shape functions are constructed using a particular set of field nodes embraced in the support domain of a particular integration point consequently the integrand functions associated with the shape functions are incompatible inside the background cell in other words the integrand functions are varying within the different subregions of the background cell so that the numerical integration has to be separately conducted in each subregion to exactly integrate the varying integrand functions indeed the method of subdividing the integration cell into many subregions has been employed to increase the accuracy of meshfree techniques atluri et al 1999 liu and gu 2001 however this method would increase the computation cost therefore a modified node selection scheme for constructing shape functions is presented here as shown in the second plot of fig 3 the central point of a background integration cell is deliberately marked as the black triangle then a set of field nodes in the support domain of this central point is picked out the support domain of the central point is bounded by the multi color quadrangle in the modified node selection scheme this set of field nodes would be utilized to construct the shape functions for all integration points in a background cell as a result the shape functions over the background cell are continuous resulting in the compatible integrand for numerical integration it is hence anticipated that the errors in the numerical integration can be effectively cut down by using the modified node selection scheme in addition the modified node selection scheme for mrpim can be more efficient in the computation compared with the original node selection scheme for rpim in rpim for each integration point the operation for selecting interpolation nodes is performed once while in mrpim for each background integration cell this same operation would be performed once undoubtedly the number of integration points is always larger than that of integration cells meaning that the node selection operations in rpim can be more time consuming than those in mrpim in order to examine the effectiveness of the modified node selection scheme we start with an one dimensional dispersion analysis ihlenburg and babuška 1997 suleau and bouillard 2000 dispersion analysis is an a priori estimate of numerical solutions for acoustic computations serving as an efficient tool to predict the accuracy of a numerical method in dispersion analysis an infinite node distribution is assumed to be used then the coefficients of the system equations with respect to all nodes are obtained by the specific numerical method in practice we can employ a sufficiently large node distribution to conduct dispersion analysis as long as the central node is irrelevant to the boundary nodes assuming that an array of one dimensional unit plane wave u e i k x propagates in the region ω 0 1 discretized by ten background cells at an identical interval h 0 1 m where k denotes the exact wavenumber as shown in fig 4 the field nodes described as the circles are equally distributed in the form of x i 0 1 i 1 i 1 2 11 for each background cell two point gaussian integration is adopted and the integration points are expressed as the crosses then we have employed three different node selection schemes for comparison schemes 1 and 2 are based on the original node selection scheme for rpim where four or five nodes are employed to interpolate the unknown pressure for each integration point respectively and the interpolation nodes for the two integration points in a background cell are different scheme 3 is based on the modified node selection scheme for mrpim where the same four nodes are employed in the interpolations for the two integration points in a background cell according to the schemes above the selected nodes for the interpolations are given in table 1 and the example of how to choose interpolation nodes for integration points is plotted in fig 4 the nodes embraced in the rectangular box of a specific color are chosen for the interpolations at the integration point of the same color it is noted that the integrand functions obtained using schemes 1 and 2 are incompatible in the background cell while the integrand functions obtained using scheme 3 are compatible besides the interpolation nodes for each integration point in scheme 1 and scheme 3 are also part of those in scheme 2 using the shape functions obtained from the node selection schemes above the resulting system equations can be constructed as 25 ω φ t φ d ω k 2 ω φ t φ d ω u 0 it is observed from table 1 that central node 6 is totally isolated from boundary nodes 1 and 11 in the three schemes so the equation concerning node 6 is formed based on eq 25 such that 26 for schemes 1 and 3 a 3 u 3 a 4 u 4 a 5 u 5 a 6 u 6 a 7 u 7 a 8 u 8 a 9 u 9 0 for scheme 2 a 2 u 2 a 3 u 3 a 4 u 4 a 5 u 5 a 6 u 6 a 7 u 7 a 8 u 8 a 9 u 9 a 10 u 10 0 where a i denotes the coefficients of the system equation computed using the numerical methods and u i denotes the pressure concerning node i according to the symmetry of the resulting system matrices a 2 a 10 a 3 a 9 a 4 a 8 and a 5 a 7 next substituting the numerical solution u h e i k h x of the involved node into eq 26 we can obtain 27 a 3 e i 3 k h h e i 3 k h h a 4 e i 2 k h h e i 2 k h h a 5 e i k h h e i k h h a 6 0 or a 2 e i 4 k h h e i 4 k h h a 3 e i 3 k h h e i 3 k h h a 4 e i 2 k h h e i 2 k h h a 5 e i k h h e i k h h a 6 0 in which k h denotes the considered numerical wavenumber by means of euler s formula eq 27 is further simplified as follows by canceling the imaginary parts 28 2 a 3 cos 3 k h h 2 a 4 cos 2 k h h 2 a 5 cos k h h a 6 0 or 2 a 2 cos 4 k h h 2 a 3 cos 3 k h h 2 a 4 cos 2 k h h 2 a 5 cos k h h a 6 0 we can observe from eq 25 that the values of the coefficients a i in eq 28 depend on the exact wavenumber k the used node selection scheme and the node distribution as the node distribution is fixed k can be solved through eq 28 with the given values of k h for different node selection schemes then the ratio k k h can be used to directly reflect the magnitude of the dispersion effect in the numerical solutions for an accurate solution k k h should approach 1 the curves of the ratio k k h obtained using the three node selection schemes as a function of the normalized numerical wavenumbers are displayed in fig 5 from the results it is indicated that 1 the ratio obtained using scheme 3 for mrpim almost equals 1 when k h h 2 whereas the ratios obtained using schemes 1 and 2 are larger than 1 when k h h 1 2 by increasing the number of interpolation nodes the solutions in relatively large normalized wavenumbers can be improved in scheme 2 as compared with scheme 1 3 even though the number of interpolation nodes in scheme 3 is less than that in scheme 2 much more accurate solutions can be obtained by using scheme 3 for mrpim traditionally enlarging the influence domain or the support domain to introduce more interpolation nodes can effectively improve the accuracy of meshfree techniques however this requires expensive computational cost in obtaining the shape functions because of the expensive inversion procedure of the large moment matrix in this work we have presented that by reasonably determining the node selection scheme mrpim with fewer interpolation nodes can yield better solutions than rpim with more interpolation nodes this may be because the modified node selection scheme results in the compatible integrand functions in each background cell so that the reduction on the errors of the numerical integration can improve the accuracy of mrpim though the analysis is conducted based on an one dimensional dispersion analysis for the unit plane wave it still has great significance to two dimensional or three dimensional acoustic problems as the other types of waves can be considered as the combinations of plane waves with various propagation directions 4 pollution error effect in numerical solutions as mentioned in the introduction solutions of numerical methodologies are suffering from the pollution error effect on account of the discretization of real models the detailed theoretical analysis of the pollution error effect for the classical galerkin fem is studied by ihlenburg and babuška 1995 1997 actually the behaviors of certain meshless techniques such as efgm rpim and mrpim that are also based on the galerkin weak form for acoustics are quite similar to those of the galerkin fem the distinction between them is the different formulations in constructing shape functions consequently the behaviors of certain galerkin meshless techniques in controlling the pollution error effect are also quite similar to the galerkin fem bouillard and suleaub 1998 and several researchers have successfully employed the error estimate criterion in fem to test the performance of the meshfree techniques in solving acoustic problems suleau and bouillard 2000 suleau et al 2000 wenterodt and estorff 2009 therefore we also employ a similar process to assess the ability of mrpim in handling the pollution error in this work the discretization error in acoustical solutions of a numerical approach is commonly employed as an error estimate the discretization error in h 1 semi norm is given by 29 u u h 1 ω v v h t v v h d ω where v and v h indicate the precise and the approximate solutions of acoustical particle velocity respectively and the symbol represents the operation of complex conjugate and the relative discretization error in h 1 semi norm ihlenburg and babuška 1997 for the hp fem in 1d is bounded by 30 ε p u u h 1 u 1 ω v v h t v v h d ω ω v t v d ω c 1 k h o o c 2 k k h o 2 o where c 1 and c 2 are the constant coefficients o denotes the order of pbfs used in the interpolations and h signifies the characteristic nodal spacing of the meshgrid this relative error in eq 30 consists of two components the first component is defined as the interpolation error that arises from the interpolation process and the other component denotes the pollution error coming from the accumulating dispersion error the relative error of the linear fem o 1 is bounded by 31 ε p c 1 k h c 2 k 3 h 2 it is clear from eq 31 that the relative error would grow correspondingly by increasing the wavenumber k owing to the term k 3 h 2 in practical engineering applications many engineers have believed that the rule of thumb can well control the pollution error in solutions of the linear fem in which at least six elements are required for one wavelength that is keeping k h 1 nonetheless it is proved that this criterion cannot ensure the effectiveness of the linear fem in large wavenumbers by eq 31 hence it is necessary to seek a more effective criterion for controlling the pollution error and the detailed treatments will be presented in sub section 5 1 3 5 numerical examples several numerical examples concerning acoustic problems are numerically analyzed in this section for comparison the linear fem q4 the quadratic fem q8 rpim and mrpim based on quadrilateral cells are employed in this work the average node spacing liu and gu 2005 is defined as follow 32 d c a d n n 1 where a d is the area of the considered domain and n n is the number of nodes in the domain 5 1 interior acoustic problem with analytical solutions acoustic wave propagation in a square domain is considered in fig 6 with the acoustic speed c 343 m s and the medium density ρ 1 225 kg m 3 the acoustic pressure p 0 0 1 pa is applied on the bottom left vertex of the domain and the four sides are subject to the related robin boundary conditions for this problem the regular and irregular meshgrids with the average node spacing d c 0 01 m are employed as the meshgrids of fem as well as the node arrangements of rpim and mrpim additionally it is noted here that the irregular node arrangement is constructed from the regular node arrangement by using the expression x x d c r c β i r where r c is a random number varying from 1 to 1 and β i r denotes the adjustable distortion magnitude changing from 0 to 0 5 the larger the distortion magnitude is the more irregular the node arrangement becomes in this work we generally chose β i r 0 4 for all problems to generate irregular node arrangements the analytical expression bouillard and suleaub 1998 of acoustic pressure for this problem is obtained as follows 33 u cos k l ξ cos β η sin β j sin k l ξ cos β η sin β where ξ and η are the nondimensional coordinates that are determined as ξ x l and η y l respectively and β 45 represents the angle from the propagating path of acoustic wave to the positive x axis 5 1 1 influence domain size of mrpim more nodes are employed in the interpolations by increasing the influence doman size of a field node which hence improves the numerical accuracy what is more field nodes can be freely chosen in the interpolations regradless of the restriction of mesh for rpim and mrpim while a re constructed meshgrid is required to properly determine the locations of nodes in elements when higher order fem p refinement is used in this sense an analogous p refinement strategy for rpim and mrpim can be easily conducted with the initial node arrangement by simply increasing the influence domain size to employ more nodes in the interpolations employing the regular meshgrid the effect of the influence domain size r inf or the support size of rpim and mrpim on the solution accuracy is tested by considering the wavenumbers from 10 to 100 the corresponding relative discretization errors from the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim are shown in figs 7 and 8 in which the values of r inf vary in the range from d c to 5 d c according to the rule of thumb the reasonable considered wavenumbers should be below 100 note here that using the regular node arrangement the results of rpim are almost identical to those of mrpim due to the use of the structured node distribution and the square influence domains that leads to the almost identical schemes for choosing interpolation nodes but the identical results of rpim and mrpim would not be observed when the irregular node arrangement is employed it is indicated in figs 8 and 9 that 1 the results of rpim and mrpim with r inf d c are quite similar to those of fem q4 in addition the rule of thumb is ineffective to guarantee the accuracy for large wavenumbers as the relative errors of fem q4 rpim and mrpim with r inf d c increase to more than 10 1 when the considered wavenumbers are higher than k 40 2 increasing the influence domain size r inf is a doable way to improve the accuracy of rpim and mrpim in comparison to fem q4 the results of rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 5 d c can be evidently improved in particular the errors obtained from rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 5 d c are close to those obtained from fem q8 in fact too large influence domain size of the field node would result in expensive computational cost in the interpolations so the influence domain size r inf of rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c to provide comparable results compared with fem q8 in this work 5 1 2 comparison of computational accuracy using regular andirregular node arrangements in real simulations it is of significance for numerical methods to maintain adequate accuracy even when using irregular node arrangements since most engineering models cannot be discretized into the regular node arrangements employing the irregular node arrangement the computational accuracy of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 d c is compared for a range of wavenumbers as plotted in fig 9 it is indicated in fig 9 that the results obtained from all numerical methods have been degraded by the irregularity magnitude of the node arrangement fem q4 yields the highest relative errors by using the irregular node arrangement implying that fem q4 is quite susceptible to the irregularity magnitude of the employed node arrangement at this point we normally have to resort to the re meshing process to obtain a higher quality meshgrid for fem q4 leading to more pre processor time in the computation moreover we can see that the results of fem q8 and rpim are inferior to those of mrpim using the irregular node arrangement for wavenumbers larger than 40 in comparison to the other numerical methods mrpim behaves relatively better in using the irregular node arrangement this can be attributed to two facts 1 the isoparametric interpolations are employed in fem q4 and fem q8 where the inverse of the jacob matrix is seriously affected by the irregularity magnitude of the node arrangement 2 compared with rpim mrpim with the modified node selection scheme can effectively reduce the errors in the numerical integration hence improving the accuracy of mrpim using the irregular node arrangement 5 1 3 criterion for mrpim to control the pollution error it is known from eq 31 that the interpolation error is constrained via the criterion of keeping k h constant whereas the numerical pollution error would grow linearly via the increase of the wavenumber k on account of the pollution error term k 3 h 2 however these two types of errors would be tightly constrained via the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant for further verification the processes of controlling the pollution error by employing the criterions of keeping k h constant and keeping k 3 h 2 constant for mrpim are conducted in fig 10 for comparison the same processes for fem q4 fem q8 and rpim are also provided it is noted here that by keeping k h 0 2 π ten elements per wavelength would be employed in the computations fig 10 indicates that the criterion of keeping k h constant cannot ensure the decline of relative errors with the refinements of node arrangements for all numerical methods this implicates that this criterion or the rule of thumb cannot stabilize the accuracy of numerical solutions with the increasing wavenumbers even though using the relatively denser node arrangements it is because the growth rate of the pollution error is more sensitive to the increasing considered wavenumber requiring much denser node arrangements than those governed by the rule of thumb in addition we can see that the accuracy of fem q8 rpim and mrpim is much better than that of fem q4 by keeping k h 0 2 π in contrast by following the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 0 2 π the relative errors in the results of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mpim are stabilized in general with the increase of wavenumbers and the results of fem q8 rpim and mpim are much more accurate than those of fem q4 moreover the relative errors of mrpim tend to slowly drop together with the refinements of node arrangements which indicates that the numerical pollution error is under well control by following the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant hence it is recommended that the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant should be obeyed in real applications for mrpim to obtain reasonable accuracy 5 1 4 comparison of convergence property the comparisons of the convergence properties of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the slope of mrpim is similar to that of fem q4 whereas mrpim can provide much accurate results than fem q4 using the same nodal spacing so much less degrees of freedom dofs for mrpim are required to obtain the same accuracy compared with fem q4 which hence saves computational memories and storages however the convergence property of mrpim may be not better than that of fem q8 the reason for this is that the radial bases and the linear polynomial bases used in mrpim generate similar convergence property to fem q4 while the quadratic polynomial bases used in fem q8 provide better convergence property in general mrpim still yields the accuracy comparable to fem q8 5 1 5 computational efforts of mrpim for the survival of a novel numerical method it is of importance to compare its computational efforts with other mature numerical methods however a rigorous measurement on the computational efforts of numerical methods is quite difficult and involved so we employ the rough estimations of computational efforts by comparing the condition number and the mean half bandwidth bathe 2006 of the resulting system matrix the number of integration points for forming the resulting system matrix and the cpu time second for solving the resulting system matrices these factors are closely relevant to the computational efforts of a numerical method because the formulation and the computational requirements of a numerical model directly depend on these factors the condition number n c d of the resulting system matrix is plotted in figs 12 and 13 by varying the considered wavenumbers and the average nodal spacing respectively the condition number is obtained by n c d λ max λ min in which λ max and λ min are the maximum and minimum eigen values of the resulting system matrix the resulting system matrix of larger condition number incurs severer numerical instability indicating the degradation of the computational efficiency we can see from figs 12 and 13 that with the increase of wavenumbers the condition number decreases and with the decrease of average nodal spacing the condition number increases besides the condition number of the resulting system matrix of fem q4 is the smallest and the condition number of fem q8 is larger than those of the other numerical methods when the nodal spacing decreases the number of total gauss points for integration n gp and the mean half bandwidth of the system matrix n hb of different numerical methods are listed in table 2 it is observed that the number of total gauss points and the mean half bandwidth of the system matrix of mrpim and rpim are usually larger than those of fem q4 and fem q8 implying that the time for forming system matrices and the computational storages required for mrpim and rpim are hence larger than those for fem q4 and fem q8 when the same dofs are used in fact when analyzing large scale models the time for solving linear system matrices and meshgrid generation dominates and the time for forming linear system matrices can be a small part of the total solution time what is more less dofs are required for mrpim and rpim than fem q4 to obtain a same order of accuracy and the requirements on the meshgrid generation are relaxed in the meshfree mrpim and rpim from these points of view mrpim and rpim can provide comparable performance to fem the relative errors of different numerical methods versus the cpu time second for solving linear system matrices with the same direct solver are show in fig 14 at k 30 fig 14 shows that to obtain the identical relative error the required cpu time of mrpim is less than those of fem q4 and rpim however is much larger than that of fem q8 these results indicate that the efficiency of mrpim may not be better than that of fem q8 in regard to the cost of the solution process due to the system matrix of larger bandwidth obtained from mrpim nevertheless the use of the eight node quadratic elements in fem q8 may weaken its effectiveness for complex geometric models and we can foresee that the time of fem q8 for mesh generation would be much longer than the counterpart of mrpim the meshfree feature of mrpim can effectively cut down the cost of the meshgrid generation so it is expected that mrpim is still a competitive method 5 2 longitudinal section of an automobile an engineering structure concerning an automobile is considered in fig 15 the noise coming from the engine causes the vibration of the front plate denoted as the red line with the neumann boundary condition v n 0 01 m s and the acoustical absorbing materials which are represented as the robin boundary condition a n 0 00144 m pa s are attached to the ceiling of the automobile denoted as the magenta line the longitudinal section of the car is discretized as the meshgrid with the average nodal spacing d c 0 012 m and the influence domain size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c 5 2 1 pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim the comparisons of the acoustic pressure distributions of the automobile section computed using fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 40 and 50 are shown in figs 16 18 since it is difficult to obtain the exact solutions to this problem the solutions of fem q4 with a quite refined meshgrid are considered as the reference solutions as exhibited in fig 16 the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim are in good accordance with the reference solution at k 30 however it is shown in figs 17 and 18 that the acoustic pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 do not conform well with the reference solutions for k 40 and 50 as many spurious wavelets can be seen in the backseat region of the car by comparison the solutions of rpim and mrpim still agree well with the reference solutions relatively and the differences between rpim and mrpim are not obvious by comparing the acoustic pressure distributions so the pressure solutions on a path ab denoted as the blue line in fig 15 are employed to further compare the results of rpim and mrpim in the following 5 2 2 acoustic pressure solutions on a path ab the amplitude of the acoustic pressure solutions obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim on a path ab is displayed in figs 19 21 for k 30 40 and 50 in addition the reference solutions are also plotted for comparison fig 19 indicates that the acoustic pressure solutions obtained using fem q4 depart slightly from the reference solution for k 30 while the good solutions are obtained using the other numerical methods in fig 20 we can observe that the solutions of fem q4 cannot accord well with the reference solutions for k 40 and the solutions of rpim deviate from the reference solution more obviously than mrpim as shown in fig 21 the curve of fem q4 becomes considerably oscillatory for k 50 and the curves of the other numerical methods also deviate a little from the reference solution besides the curve of mrpim is closer to the reference solution than that of rpim in the aspect of the acoustic pressure amplitude 5 3 acoustic scattering from a rigid infinite cylinder the acoustic scattering from a rigid infinite cylinder impinged by a unit plane wave is considered here as plotted in fig 22 the original problem can be further simplified to a two dimensional problem since all variables remain constant along the lengthwise direction of the cylinder the cylinder is surrounded by water with the density of 1000 kg m3 and the sound velocity of 1500 m s the radii of the dtn boundary and the cylinder are 2 m and 1 m respectively and the influence domain size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c the analytical solution to this problem morse 1948 is expressed as 34 u n 0 i n ν n j n k r h n 1 k r h n 1 k r cos n θ where r is the radius of the cylinder j n and h n 1 are the bessel function and hankel function of first kind respectively and ν n 1 when n 0 otherwise ν n 2 5 3 1 scattering patterns obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim the acoustic scattering patterns which are expressed as the scattering pressure amplitude on the circle with a radius of 1 5 m are plotted in figs 23 25 for k 30 50 and 70 using the regular node arrangement with the average nodal spacing d c 0 021 m it is pointed out here that the employed meshgrid for k 30 ensures ten elements per wavelength while the employed meshgrid for k 50 ensures six elements per wavelength which is related to the rule of thumb for k 30 the solutions of all the numerical methods accord well with the analytical solutions while for the higher wavenumbers the solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 depart more obviously from the analytical solutions in comparison to rpim and mrpim moreover we can find that the curves of mrpim are closer to the analytical solutions than rpim in k 50 and k 70 for 90 to 90 indicating that the modified node selection scheme employed in mrpim can effectively reduce numerical errors in addition the acoustic scattering patterns obtained using the irregular node arrangement are also displayed infig 26 28 it is observed that the solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 have been seriously degraded by using the irregular node arrangement especially for k 50 and 70 since the curves of fem q4 and fem q8 become quite oscillatory by comparison rpim and mrpim seem to behave much better than fem q4 and fem q8 when using the irregular node arrangement what is more as shown in fig 28 the curve of mrpim can be a little less oscillatory than that of rpim for k 70 to quantitatively compare the performance of mrpim and rpim in terms of the relative errors the computational accuracy study will be conducted in the following subsection 5 3 2 computational accuracy study in order to compare the present method with the b spline fem khajah et al 2019 we employ the relative l2 error indicator in this subsection that is 35 ε l 2 ω u u h t u u h d ω ω u t u d ω khajah et al 2019 have studied the accuracy of the b spline fem for analyzing the acoustic scattering of an infinite cylinder generally by keeping ten elements per wavelength the high order b spline fem can yield very accurate results with negligible pollution errors the accuracy of rpim and mrpim is compared with the first order and the second b spline fems by keeping ten elements per wavelength as displayed in fig 29 we can obtain that fem q4 and the first order b spline fem yield the highest relative errors the relative errors obtained from fem q8 and rpim are nearly the same and the accuracy of mrpim is a little lower than that of the second b spline fem moreover the relative errors of mrpim are one order of magnitude lower than those of rpim for the relatively higher wavenumbers implying that the modified node selection scheme can considerably increase the accuracy of mrpim for this problem also the relative errors in the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim using the regular and the irregular node arrangements are plotted in fig 30 for a range of wavenumbers the average nodal spacing is fixed as d c 0 021 m by following the rule of thumb the considered wavenumber should not exceed 47 6 and by employing ten elements per wavelength the considered wavenumber should be under 29 9 as expected the relative errors of fem q4 are the largest for k 10 among these numerical methods and the solutions of fem q8 are not satisfactory for k 30 in comparison rpim and mrpim behave better than fem q4 and fem q8 and mrpim can yield more accurate solutions than rpim for relatively higher wavenumbers interestingly it is found that the results of rpim and mrpim using the irregular node arrangement can be more accurate than those using the regular node arrangement for k 20 this reason for this may be that the employed rbfs in the interpolations for rpim and mrpim are insensitive to the irregularity magnitude of the annular node arrangement for the considered annular problem domain 5 4 acoustic scattering from a rigid rudder in this section the acoustic scattering of a two dimensional rudder by a unit plane wave is considered as shown in fig 31 the geometry of this rudder is described as the airfoil section in terms of naca0018 where the length of the rudder is 1m and the radius of the dtn boundary is 2m as the model is unsymmetrical the plane waves of specific incident angles θ can result in specific scattering patterns for this problem a nonuniform meshgrid with the average nodal spacing is dc 0 02m is employed and the influence doamin size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c 5 4 1 scattering pressure distributions with the incident angle 0 the acoustic scattering pressure distributions of the rudder obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 50 and 75 at the incident angle 0 are displayed in figs 32 34 for comparison the results of fem q4 using a very fine meshgrid are employed as the reference solutions it is noted here that the employed meshgrid for k 30 ensures nearly ten elements per wavelength while the employed meshgrid for k 50 ensures six elements per wavelength which is related to the rule of thumb it is observed that all the numerical solutions agree well with the reference solution for k 30 however the pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 are relatively oscillatory in k 50 moreover we can see that the pressure solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 are quite oscillatory for k 75 compared with the reference solution while the solutions of rpim and mrpim are more accurate than fem q4 and fem q8 5 4 2 scattering pressure distributions with the incident angle 90 the acoustic scattering pressure distributions of the rudder obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 50 and 75 at the incident angle 90 are shown in figs 35 37 again fem q4 cannot provide sufficiently good simulations of the scattering distributions for k 50 and 75 in comparison to the reference solutions and the pressure distribution of fem q8 is also quite unstable for k 75 in addition we can observe that the spurious separation occurs in the forescattering pressure distribution obtained from rpim when compared with mrpim solution and the reference solution for k 75 implying that mrpim can be superior to rpim in analyzing this scattering problem 6 discussions and remarks in this work the performance of mrpim with the modified node selection scheme is examined by the a priori dispersion analysis and a number of numerical examples associated with acoustic wave propagation several discussions and remarks are presented as the following 1 in comparison with fem q4 and fem q8 the accuracy of mrpim is higher than that of fem q4 and is similar to that of fem q8 for interior acoustics while the solutions of mrpim are more accurate than those of fem q4 and fem q8 for acoustic scattering especially for relatively high wavenumbers 2 in comparison with rpim mrpim with the modified node selection scheme can lead to lower numerical errors compared with the original rpim and this idea may be also effective for other meshfree techniques based on the weak form 3 in using irregular or nonuniform node arrangements the behaviors of mrpim are more favorable than those of the other numerical methods in particular for the annular problem domain for acoustic scattering credit authorship contribution statement xiangyu you conceptualization formal analysis qiang gui conceptualization formal

21359,the classical finite element approach cannot guarantee satisfactory accuracy for acoustic problems at large wavenumbers on account of the numerical pollution error effect this negative effect stems from the fact that the approximate wavenumbers are usually in conflict with the real wavenumbers in many numerical methods to suppress this effect a radial point interpolation meshless technique with a modified scheme for selecting interpolation nodes is employed in this paper one dimensional dispersion analysis shows that this modified scheme can effectively reduce numerical errors compared with the original scheme the results of several numerical examples have manifested that the present method can generate more accurate and reliable solutions than the standard finite element approach and the original radial point interpolation method in the acoustic analyses keywords meshfree simulation modified radial point interpolation method pollution error effect acoustic problems 1 introduction computational acoustics has received more and more attention in the past few decades since acoustics plays an important role in not only engineering applications jung et al 2020 but also the field of physical acoustics such as the photonic crystal balint and bordas 2020 hussein 2018 to precisely acquire the acoustic field is a primary prerequisite for conducting investigations of acoustics various analytical methods diperna and stanton 1994 mitri 2015 or semi analytical methods gong et al 2017 pillai et al 1982 have been successfully applied in the acoustic analyses however the use of these methodologies is confined to the acoustic analyses for simple regular geometries for more complicated geometric models the numerical methods are the sensible choices the finite element method fem ihlenburg 1998 and the boundary element method bem estorff 2000 fu et al 2018a b are two widely used numerical methods to conduct acoustic analyses owing to the reliability and the mature formulation however the resulting system matrices of the classical bem are usually asymmetric and nonsparse giving rise to the prohibitively high computational cost for large scale models harari and hughes 1992a li et al 2019 in addition the classical bem may produce non unique solutions for exterior acoustic problems at large characteristic wavenumbers hence fem is still a preferable method in analyzing acoustics due to the sparse and symmetric system matrices however it is well known that the pollution effect coming from the discretization of the continuous acoustical medium would degrade the accuracy of fem solutions in large wavenumbers hence denser meshgrids and polynomial bases of high order at the cost of higher amount of computation efforts ihlenburg and babuška 1995 1997 demkowicz 2006 schwab 1998 are required to improve the accuracy of the standard fem for large wavenumbers on the other side many researchers aim to improve the variation principle or the function space of fem for suppressing the pollution error effect babuška et al 1995 thompson and pinsky 1995 oberai and pinsky 2000 melenk and babuška 1996 these improved methods can be quite effective in one dimensional problems however they cannot eliminate the aforementioned pollution effect for two dimensional acoustic problems it is reported from some works li et al 2020 he et al 2016 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 that the staple source of the pollution error roots in the out of balance between the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix obtained from the discretized numerical model hence a cluster of the smoothed fems liu and nguyen 2010 liu and zhang 2013 zeng and liu 2018 and a mass redistributed fem li et al 2016 li and he 2019 for balancing the stiff and the mass matrices are proposed the investigations of numerical examples have shown that these methods chai et al 2016 2018 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 you et al 2019 2020a can depress the pollution errors for high wavenumbers more effectively than the standard fem in addition the isogeometric analysis iga atroshchenko et al 2018 marussig et al 2015 simpson et al 2014 has also received much attention in acoustics since the geometric model can be exactly represented in the analysis without model errors iga can generate quite accurate results for interior acoustics chen et al 2018 coox et al 2016 wu et al 2015 shaaban et al 2020 and acoustic scattering khajah et al 2016 2019 khajah and villamizar 2019 videla et al 2019 by elevating the order of non uniform rational b splines nurbs shape functions or increasing the discretization density furthermore a promising deep neural network method anitescu et al 2019 is adopted to study helmholtz equation with an adaptive collocation strategy producing considerably accurate results the mesh based numerical methods are still limited by the generation of meshgrids in adaptive analyses or analyzing complex geometries resulting in a trend for developing meshfree techniques chen and li 2020 nguyen et al 2008 fu et al 2018a b due to the flexibility in the discretization and the high accuracy formulation of shape functions meshfree techniques have been introduced in handling helmholtz problems the problems of wave propagation have been solved via an element free galerkin method efgm li 2018 by bouillard and suleaub 1998 suleau and bouillard 2000 and suleau et al 2000 revealing that efgm can significantly relieve the pollution error effect at high wavenumbers compared to fem however the shape functions in efgm lack the kronecker delta function property for directly implementing the essential boundary condition in light of this the radial basis function rbf meshless method embracing this property is employed to approximate unknown variables in this work the rbf collocation method was first employed to solve partial differential equations by kansa 1990 and then has been extended to scientific problems of many areas kansa 2015 until now little work has focused on the feasibility of the rbf methods for acoustic problems especially for exterior acoustics the numerical methods using rbfs based on the strong form lin et al 2012 hon and chen 2003 the weak form wenterodt and estorff 2009 xu et al 2019 chai et al 2020 and the local weak form you et al 2020b have been analyzed for interior acoustics which yields good accuracy for acoustics compared with the standard fem or bem however these works mainly focus on interior acoustic problems for relatively simple geometries in real life interior or exterior acoustic problems for complicated geometries are often encountered in engineering applications such as automotive engineering and ocean engineering the purpose of this work is thus to further extend the rbf method based on the galerkin weak form namely the radial point interpolation method rpim into more complicated acoustic problems such as acoustic scattering generally rpim follows the pattern of fem except for the mesh generation and the interpolation process meaning that the program codes of rpim are largely similar to those of fem with easy implementation moreover in this work a modified scheme for selecting nodes in the interpolation is introduced to improve the accuracy of rpim when using non uniform or irregular node arrangements the performance of the modified rpim mrpim is compared with the four node bilinear fem fem q4 the eight node quadratic fem fem q8 and the original rpim through several acoustic problems indicating that mrpim can outperform the original rpim and fem q4 in the analyses and behaves better than fem q8 for acoustics scattering the rest of this paper is structured as the following parts in section 2 the fundamental equations for acoustic problems are briefly introduced in section 3 mrpim is introduced with the modified scheme of node selection to reduce the errors in the numerical integration in section 4 the measurement of the pollution error effect in numerical solutions is presented in section 5 several typical numerical examples are analyzed to compare the performances of the different numerical methodologies in the last section several discussions and remarks concerning mrpim are given 2 basic concepts of computational acoustic 2 1 governing equations consider a d dimensional domain r r d that is bounded by a boundary γ inside the problem domain the unknown acoustic pressure u is governed by the helmholtz equation 1 δ u k 2 u f where δ is laplacian k ω c signifies the considered wavenumber ω is the angular frequency c is the wave speed and f indicates a volumetric source term assuming that the boundary γ γ d γ n γ r is composed of 2 u u on γ d dirichlet boundary condition u n i ρ ω v n on γ n neumann boundary condition u n i ρ ω a n u on γ r robin boundary condition in which u and v n are the given data on the corresponding boundaries n indicates the outward normal vector of the corresponding boundaries a n is the admittance parameter for robin boundary and ρ is the medium density on the basis of the motion relationship the acoustical particle velocity v is linked to the gradients of acoustic pressure 3 u i ρ ω v for interior acoustic problems the domain based numerical methods can be directly performed to solve the helmholtz equation however the sommerfeld radiation condition should be satisfied when the domain based numerical methods are employed to tackle exterior acoustic problems the sommerfeld radiation condition is given as 4 lim x r d 1 2 u r i k u 0 in which r x is the distance from the origin to infinity the general way for satisfying this condition is to employ an artificial boundary γ a that truncates the unbounded problem domain r into the bounded domain ω for computations as shown in fig 1 several methodologies can be chosen to achieve this such as the nonreflecting boundary condition grote and keller 1995 the absorbing boundary conditions bayliss et al 1982 modave et al 2018 2020 the infinite elements gerdes 2000 and the absorbing layer turkel and yefet 1998 fu et al 2020 among these methodologies the dirichlet to neumann dtn map grote and keller 1995 which is an ideal nonreflecting boundary condition is adopted in this work 2 2 dtn map the dtn map employs an exact radiation solution to relate the pressure data with the derivative data on the truncated dtn boundary γ a the pressure solution on the dtn boundary is expressed in the polar coordinates as 5 u r θ 1 π n 0 0 2 π h n 1 k r h n 1 k r a cos n θ θ u r a θ d θ where r a is the radius of the circular dtn boundary h n 1 is first kind hankel functions of n order and the prime after the sum means that for n 0 the term is multiplied by a coefficient of 0 5 differentiating eq 5 with respect to r along the outward normal direction of the boundary γ a and letting r r a we can obtain 6 u r a θ n n 0 0 2 π m n θ θ n u r a θ d θ in which the dtn kernel is 7 m θ θ n k π h n 1 k r a h n 1 k r a cos n θ θ with n being the term number of the dtn map according to the work harari and hughes 1992b the number n of dtn map should be larger than n k r a to obtain the stable solutions for exterior acoustics the dtn map can also be rewritten in a general form for easy expression 8 u r a θ n m u with m being the dtn operator 2 3 galerkin weak form multiplying eq 1 by the test function w in a form of integral without the volumetric source term such that 9 ω w δ u k 2 u d ω 0 utilizing green s theorem eq 9 gives rise to the weak form as below 10 ω w u d ω k 2 ω w u d ω γ w u n d γ 0 in the galerkin method the test function is chosen the same as the employed shape functions the discretized weak form is then expressed as 11 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω γ φ t u n d γ 0 in which u h φ u φ is the vector of shape functions obtained from the numerical method and u is the vector collecting node variables taking into consideration the related boundary conditions eq 11 is further derived as 12 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω i ρ ω γ n φ t v n d γ i ρ ω a n γ r φ t φ u d γ 0 for interior acoustics 13 ω φ t φ u d ω k 2 ω φ t φ u d ω γ a φ t m φ u d γ i ρ ω γ n φ t v n d γ i ρ ω a n γ r φ t φ u d γ 0 for exterior acoustics 3 formulation of rpim 3 1 basic concepts of meshfree techniques the salient merit of meshfree techniques over the mesh based fem lies in that the procedure of forming shape functions does not count on the meshgrid anymore besides a series of background integration cells is required to integrate the weak form of corresponding governing equations in meshfree techniques and field nodes in the interpolations can be chosen from the whole problem domain without the restriction of the mesh therefore meshfree techniques can be more flexible in the discretization owing to the unnecessary requirement on the node connectivity in this paper four node quadrangles encircled by the dashed lines are chosen as the background cells as shown in fig 2 to obtain the shape functions associated with an arbitrary point of interest x q a few field nodes embraced in the square local support domain of the point x q are employed in the interpolations the support domain is shown as the square encircled by the green lines note that the influence domain of a field node also displayed in fig 2 as the square encircled by the red lines is closely relevant to the concept of the support domain for instance if a field node locates in the support domain of a point of interest the point of interest also locates in the influence domain of this field node so the size r inf of the influence domain and the support domain is usually equivalent in this sense 3 2 shape functions constructed from rbfs rbfs with the linear polynomial basis functions pbfs are utilized to form the shape functions of rpim the use of rbfs for the interpolations is fairly stable when a large number of irregularly distributed nodes are utilized and can always give rise to the invertible moment matrices in the interpolations sharan et al 1997 while high order pbfs cannot nonetheless the use of pure rbfs cannot pass the patch test liu and gu 2005 for the incapability of precisely reproducing the linear consistency so that the linear pbfs are also equipped in rpim the unknown variable u h x in the interpolations is represented as 14 u h x r t x a p t x b i 1 m r i x a i j 1 4 p j x b i in which r i x denotes rbfs for the interpolations m is the number of considered nodes in the interpolations as well as the number of the rbfs used p x 1 x y x y t represents the linear pbfs for two dimensional problems a i and b i are the undetermined coefficients related to certain basis functions and a a 1 a 2 a m m 1 t and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 4 1 t are the column matrices collecting a i and b i respectively in this work the multiquadrics rbf mqrbf is utilized as the basis function which is expressed by 15 r i r r 2 α c d c 2 q in which r x x i 2 y y i 2 is the distance from the interpolation point x x y to a field node x i x i y i d c is the characteristic node spacing α c and q are the adjustable parameters concerning mqrbf the optimal choice of α c and q based on the rigorous mathematical theory is still an open question alternatively α c 2 and q 1 03 are numerically determined by wang and liu 2002 to obtain satisfactory accuracy by enforcing the involved node values in the influence domain of the point x into eq 14 we can obtain a series of linear equations 16 u r m a p m b where u is a column matrix collecting the nodal values 17 u u 1 u 2 u 3 u m m 1 t with the moment matrix r m for rbfs being 18 r m r 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r m r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 r 2 r m r 2 r 1 r m r 2 r m r m r m m m r k x k x i 2 y k y i 2 and the moment matrix p m for the linear pbfs being 19 p m 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 1 x m y m x m y m m 4 additional constraint condition to ensure uniqueness is satisfied as 20 p m t a 0 combining eq 16 with eq 20 a group of linear equations is formulated as follows 21 r m p m p m t 0 a b u 0 substituting eq 21 into eq 14 the unknown variable is solved as 22 u h x r t x p t x r m p m p m t 0 1 u 0 φ x u in which φ x denotes the rpim shape functions that are 23 φ x φ 1 x φ 2 x φ m x the derivatives of φ x are constructed directly by differentiating rbfs note that mqrbfs are c continuous so the derivatives of φ x can be fairly smoother in the interpolations than the counterparts of the standard fem additionally the kronecker delta function property is reserved due to the formulation of point interpolation liu and gu 2005 that is 24 φ i x x j 1 i j 0 i j where i and j denote the node indexes hence the scheme for imposing the essential boundary condition in rpim is as common as in standard fem 3 3 modified node selection scheme for mrpim as is well known the numerical integration always takes an important role in the accuracy of several meshfree numerical methodologies due to the complex integrand in meshfree techniques resulting from the node selection as well as the employed non polynomial basis functions the conventional numerical integration technique such as the gaussian integration and the trapezoidal integration cannot exactly integrate the integrand concerning the stiffness and the mass matrices of a discretized model as shown in the first plot of fig 3 four integration points denoted as the four crosses of different colors are in a background integration cell in the original rpim the shape functions are constructed using a particular set of field nodes embraced in the support domain of a particular integration point consequently the integrand functions associated with the shape functions are incompatible inside the background cell in other words the integrand functions are varying within the different subregions of the background cell so that the numerical integration has to be separately conducted in each subregion to exactly integrate the varying integrand functions indeed the method of subdividing the integration cell into many subregions has been employed to increase the accuracy of meshfree techniques atluri et al 1999 liu and gu 2001 however this method would increase the computation cost therefore a modified node selection scheme for constructing shape functions is presented here as shown in the second plot of fig 3 the central point of a background integration cell is deliberately marked as the black triangle then a set of field nodes in the support domain of this central point is picked out the support domain of the central point is bounded by the multi color quadrangle in the modified node selection scheme this set of field nodes would be utilized to construct the shape functions for all integration points in a background cell as a result the shape functions over the background cell are continuous resulting in the compatible integrand for numerical integration it is hence anticipated that the errors in the numerical integration can be effectively cut down by using the modified node selection scheme in addition the modified node selection scheme for mrpim can be more efficient in the computation compared with the original node selection scheme for rpim in rpim for each integration point the operation for selecting interpolation nodes is performed once while in mrpim for each background integration cell this same operation would be performed once undoubtedly the number of integration points is always larger than that of integration cells meaning that the node selection operations in rpim can be more time consuming than those in mrpim in order to examine the effectiveness of the modified node selection scheme we start with an one dimensional dispersion analysis ihlenburg and babuška 1997 suleau and bouillard 2000 dispersion analysis is an a priori estimate of numerical solutions for acoustic computations serving as an efficient tool to predict the accuracy of a numerical method in dispersion analysis an infinite node distribution is assumed to be used then the coefficients of the system equations with respect to all nodes are obtained by the specific numerical method in practice we can employ a sufficiently large node distribution to conduct dispersion analysis as long as the central node is irrelevant to the boundary nodes assuming that an array of one dimensional unit plane wave u e i k x propagates in the region ω 0 1 discretized by ten background cells at an identical interval h 0 1 m where k denotes the exact wavenumber as shown in fig 4 the field nodes described as the circles are equally distributed in the form of x i 0 1 i 1 i 1 2 11 for each background cell two point gaussian integration is adopted and the integration points are expressed as the crosses then we have employed three different node selection schemes for comparison schemes 1 and 2 are based on the original node selection scheme for rpim where four or five nodes are employed to interpolate the unknown pressure for each integration point respectively and the interpolation nodes for the two integration points in a background cell are different scheme 3 is based on the modified node selection scheme for mrpim where the same four nodes are employed in the interpolations for the two integration points in a background cell according to the schemes above the selected nodes for the interpolations are given in table 1 and the example of how to choose interpolation nodes for integration points is plotted in fig 4 the nodes embraced in the rectangular box of a specific color are chosen for the interpolations at the integration point of the same color it is noted that the integrand functions obtained using schemes 1 and 2 are incompatible in the background cell while the integrand functions obtained using scheme 3 are compatible besides the interpolation nodes for each integration point in scheme 1 and scheme 3 are also part of those in scheme 2 using the shape functions obtained from the node selection schemes above the resulting system equations can be constructed as 25 ω φ t φ d ω k 2 ω φ t φ d ω u 0 it is observed from table 1 that central node 6 is totally isolated from boundary nodes 1 and 11 in the three schemes so the equation concerning node 6 is formed based on eq 25 such that 26 for schemes 1 and 3 a 3 u 3 a 4 u 4 a 5 u 5 a 6 u 6 a 7 u 7 a 8 u 8 a 9 u 9 0 for scheme 2 a 2 u 2 a 3 u 3 a 4 u 4 a 5 u 5 a 6 u 6 a 7 u 7 a 8 u 8 a 9 u 9 a 10 u 10 0 where a i denotes the coefficients of the system equation computed using the numerical methods and u i denotes the pressure concerning node i according to the symmetry of the resulting system matrices a 2 a 10 a 3 a 9 a 4 a 8 and a 5 a 7 next substituting the numerical solution u h e i k h x of the involved node into eq 26 we can obtain 27 a 3 e i 3 k h h e i 3 k h h a 4 e i 2 k h h e i 2 k h h a 5 e i k h h e i k h h a 6 0 or a 2 e i 4 k h h e i 4 k h h a 3 e i 3 k h h e i 3 k h h a 4 e i 2 k h h e i 2 k h h a 5 e i k h h e i k h h a 6 0 in which k h denotes the considered numerical wavenumber by means of euler s formula eq 27 is further simplified as follows by canceling the imaginary parts 28 2 a 3 cos 3 k h h 2 a 4 cos 2 k h h 2 a 5 cos k h h a 6 0 or 2 a 2 cos 4 k h h 2 a 3 cos 3 k h h 2 a 4 cos 2 k h h 2 a 5 cos k h h a 6 0 we can observe from eq 25 that the values of the coefficients a i in eq 28 depend on the exact wavenumber k the used node selection scheme and the node distribution as the node distribution is fixed k can be solved through eq 28 with the given values of k h for different node selection schemes then the ratio k k h can be used to directly reflect the magnitude of the dispersion effect in the numerical solutions for an accurate solution k k h should approach 1 the curves of the ratio k k h obtained using the three node selection schemes as a function of the normalized numerical wavenumbers are displayed in fig 5 from the results it is indicated that 1 the ratio obtained using scheme 3 for mrpim almost equals 1 when k h h 2 whereas the ratios obtained using schemes 1 and 2 are larger than 1 when k h h 1 2 by increasing the number of interpolation nodes the solutions in relatively large normalized wavenumbers can be improved in scheme 2 as compared with scheme 1 3 even though the number of interpolation nodes in scheme 3 is less than that in scheme 2 much more accurate solutions can be obtained by using scheme 3 for mrpim traditionally enlarging the influence domain or the support domain to introduce more interpolation nodes can effectively improve the accuracy of meshfree techniques however this requires expensive computational cost in obtaining the shape functions because of the expensive inversion procedure of the large moment matrix in this work we have presented that by reasonably determining the node selection scheme mrpim with fewer interpolation nodes can yield better solutions than rpim with more interpolation nodes this may be because the modified node selection scheme results in the compatible integrand functions in each background cell so that the reduction on the errors of the numerical integration can improve the accuracy of mrpim though the analysis is conducted based on an one dimensional dispersion analysis for the unit plane wave it still has great significance to two dimensional or three dimensional acoustic problems as the other types of waves can be considered as the combinations of plane waves with various propagation directions 4 pollution error effect in numerical solutions as mentioned in the introduction solutions of numerical methodologies are suffering from the pollution error effect on account of the discretization of real models the detailed theoretical analysis of the pollution error effect for the classical galerkin fem is studied by ihlenburg and babuška 1995 1997 actually the behaviors of certain meshless techniques such as efgm rpim and mrpim that are also based on the galerkin weak form for acoustics are quite similar to those of the galerkin fem the distinction between them is the different formulations in constructing shape functions consequently the behaviors of certain galerkin meshless techniques in controlling the pollution error effect are also quite similar to the galerkin fem bouillard and suleaub 1998 and several researchers have successfully employed the error estimate criterion in fem to test the performance of the meshfree techniques in solving acoustic problems suleau and bouillard 2000 suleau et al 2000 wenterodt and estorff 2009 therefore we also employ a similar process to assess the ability of mrpim in handling the pollution error in this work the discretization error in acoustical solutions of a numerical approach is commonly employed as an error estimate the discretization error in h 1 semi norm is given by 29 u u h 1 ω v v h t v v h d ω where v and v h indicate the precise and the approximate solutions of acoustical particle velocity respectively and the symbol represents the operation of complex conjugate and the relative discretization error in h 1 semi norm ihlenburg and babuška 1997 for the hp fem in 1d is bounded by 30 ε p u u h 1 u 1 ω v v h t v v h d ω ω v t v d ω c 1 k h o o c 2 k k h o 2 o where c 1 and c 2 are the constant coefficients o denotes the order of pbfs used in the interpolations and h signifies the characteristic nodal spacing of the meshgrid this relative error in eq 30 consists of two components the first component is defined as the interpolation error that arises from the interpolation process and the other component denotes the pollution error coming from the accumulating dispersion error the relative error of the linear fem o 1 is bounded by 31 ε p c 1 k h c 2 k 3 h 2 it is clear from eq 31 that the relative error would grow correspondingly by increasing the wavenumber k owing to the term k 3 h 2 in practical engineering applications many engineers have believed that the rule of thumb can well control the pollution error in solutions of the linear fem in which at least six elements are required for one wavelength that is keeping k h 1 nonetheless it is proved that this criterion cannot ensure the effectiveness of the linear fem in large wavenumbers by eq 31 hence it is necessary to seek a more effective criterion for controlling the pollution error and the detailed treatments will be presented in sub section 5 1 3 5 numerical examples several numerical examples concerning acoustic problems are numerically analyzed in this section for comparison the linear fem q4 the quadratic fem q8 rpim and mrpim based on quadrilateral cells are employed in this work the average node spacing liu and gu 2005 is defined as follow 32 d c a d n n 1 where a d is the area of the considered domain and n n is the number of nodes in the domain 5 1 interior acoustic problem with analytical solutions acoustic wave propagation in a square domain is considered in fig 6 with the acoustic speed c 343 m s and the medium density ρ 1 225 kg m 3 the acoustic pressure p 0 0 1 pa is applied on the bottom left vertex of the domain and the four sides are subject to the related robin boundary conditions for this problem the regular and irregular meshgrids with the average node spacing d c 0 01 m are employed as the meshgrids of fem as well as the node arrangements of rpim and mrpim additionally it is noted here that the irregular node arrangement is constructed from the regular node arrangement by using the expression x x d c r c β i r where r c is a random number varying from 1 to 1 and β i r denotes the adjustable distortion magnitude changing from 0 to 0 5 the larger the distortion magnitude is the more irregular the node arrangement becomes in this work we generally chose β i r 0 4 for all problems to generate irregular node arrangements the analytical expression bouillard and suleaub 1998 of acoustic pressure for this problem is obtained as follows 33 u cos k l ξ cos β η sin β j sin k l ξ cos β η sin β where ξ and η are the nondimensional coordinates that are determined as ξ x l and η y l respectively and β 45 represents the angle from the propagating path of acoustic wave to the positive x axis 5 1 1 influence domain size of mrpim more nodes are employed in the interpolations by increasing the influence doman size of a field node which hence improves the numerical accuracy what is more field nodes can be freely chosen in the interpolations regradless of the restriction of mesh for rpim and mrpim while a re constructed meshgrid is required to properly determine the locations of nodes in elements when higher order fem p refinement is used in this sense an analogous p refinement strategy for rpim and mrpim can be easily conducted with the initial node arrangement by simply increasing the influence domain size to employ more nodes in the interpolations employing the regular meshgrid the effect of the influence domain size r inf or the support size of rpim and mrpim on the solution accuracy is tested by considering the wavenumbers from 10 to 100 the corresponding relative discretization errors from the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim are shown in figs 7 and 8 in which the values of r inf vary in the range from d c to 5 d c according to the rule of thumb the reasonable considered wavenumbers should be below 100 note here that using the regular node arrangement the results of rpim are almost identical to those of mrpim due to the use of the structured node distribution and the square influence domains that leads to the almost identical schemes for choosing interpolation nodes but the identical results of rpim and mrpim would not be observed when the irregular node arrangement is employed it is indicated in figs 8 and 9 that 1 the results of rpim and mrpim with r inf d c are quite similar to those of fem q4 in addition the rule of thumb is ineffective to guarantee the accuracy for large wavenumbers as the relative errors of fem q4 rpim and mrpim with r inf d c increase to more than 10 1 when the considered wavenumbers are higher than k 40 2 increasing the influence domain size r inf is a doable way to improve the accuracy of rpim and mrpim in comparison to fem q4 the results of rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 5 d c can be evidently improved in particular the errors obtained from rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 5 d c are close to those obtained from fem q8 in fact too large influence domain size of the field node would result in expensive computational cost in the interpolations so the influence domain size r inf of rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c to provide comparable results compared with fem q8 in this work 5 1 2 comparison of computational accuracy using regular andirregular node arrangements in real simulations it is of significance for numerical methods to maintain adequate accuracy even when using irregular node arrangements since most engineering models cannot be discretized into the regular node arrangements employing the irregular node arrangement the computational accuracy of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim with r inf 4 d c is compared for a range of wavenumbers as plotted in fig 9 it is indicated in fig 9 that the results obtained from all numerical methods have been degraded by the irregularity magnitude of the node arrangement fem q4 yields the highest relative errors by using the irregular node arrangement implying that fem q4 is quite susceptible to the irregularity magnitude of the employed node arrangement at this point we normally have to resort to the re meshing process to obtain a higher quality meshgrid for fem q4 leading to more pre processor time in the computation moreover we can see that the results of fem q8 and rpim are inferior to those of mrpim using the irregular node arrangement for wavenumbers larger than 40 in comparison to the other numerical methods mrpim behaves relatively better in using the irregular node arrangement this can be attributed to two facts 1 the isoparametric interpolations are employed in fem q4 and fem q8 where the inverse of the jacob matrix is seriously affected by the irregularity magnitude of the node arrangement 2 compared with rpim mrpim with the modified node selection scheme can effectively reduce the errors in the numerical integration hence improving the accuracy of mrpim using the irregular node arrangement 5 1 3 criterion for mrpim to control the pollution error it is known from eq 31 that the interpolation error is constrained via the criterion of keeping k h constant whereas the numerical pollution error would grow linearly via the increase of the wavenumber k on account of the pollution error term k 3 h 2 however these two types of errors would be tightly constrained via the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant for further verification the processes of controlling the pollution error by employing the criterions of keeping k h constant and keeping k 3 h 2 constant for mrpim are conducted in fig 10 for comparison the same processes for fem q4 fem q8 and rpim are also provided it is noted here that by keeping k h 0 2 π ten elements per wavelength would be employed in the computations fig 10 indicates that the criterion of keeping k h constant cannot ensure the decline of relative errors with the refinements of node arrangements for all numerical methods this implicates that this criterion or the rule of thumb cannot stabilize the accuracy of numerical solutions with the increasing wavenumbers even though using the relatively denser node arrangements it is because the growth rate of the pollution error is more sensitive to the increasing considered wavenumber requiring much denser node arrangements than those governed by the rule of thumb in addition we can see that the accuracy of fem q8 rpim and mrpim is much better than that of fem q4 by keeping k h 0 2 π in contrast by following the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 0 2 π the relative errors in the results of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mpim are stabilized in general with the increase of wavenumbers and the results of fem q8 rpim and mpim are much more accurate than those of fem q4 moreover the relative errors of mrpim tend to slowly drop together with the refinements of node arrangements which indicates that the numerical pollution error is under well control by following the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant hence it is recommended that the criterion of keeping k 3 h 2 constant should be obeyed in real applications for mrpim to obtain reasonable accuracy 5 1 4 comparison of convergence property the comparisons of the convergence properties of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the slope of mrpim is similar to that of fem q4 whereas mrpim can provide much accurate results than fem q4 using the same nodal spacing so much less degrees of freedom dofs for mrpim are required to obtain the same accuracy compared with fem q4 which hence saves computational memories and storages however the convergence property of mrpim may be not better than that of fem q8 the reason for this is that the radial bases and the linear polynomial bases used in mrpim generate similar convergence property to fem q4 while the quadratic polynomial bases used in fem q8 provide better convergence property in general mrpim still yields the accuracy comparable to fem q8 5 1 5 computational efforts of mrpim for the survival of a novel numerical method it is of importance to compare its computational efforts with other mature numerical methods however a rigorous measurement on the computational efforts of numerical methods is quite difficult and involved so we employ the rough estimations of computational efforts by comparing the condition number and the mean half bandwidth bathe 2006 of the resulting system matrix the number of integration points for forming the resulting system matrix and the cpu time second for solving the resulting system matrices these factors are closely relevant to the computational efforts of a numerical method because the formulation and the computational requirements of a numerical model directly depend on these factors the condition number n c d of the resulting system matrix is plotted in figs 12 and 13 by varying the considered wavenumbers and the average nodal spacing respectively the condition number is obtained by n c d λ max λ min in which λ max and λ min are the maximum and minimum eigen values of the resulting system matrix the resulting system matrix of larger condition number incurs severer numerical instability indicating the degradation of the computational efficiency we can see from figs 12 and 13 that with the increase of wavenumbers the condition number decreases and with the decrease of average nodal spacing the condition number increases besides the condition number of the resulting system matrix of fem q4 is the smallest and the condition number of fem q8 is larger than those of the other numerical methods when the nodal spacing decreases the number of total gauss points for integration n gp and the mean half bandwidth of the system matrix n hb of different numerical methods are listed in table 2 it is observed that the number of total gauss points and the mean half bandwidth of the system matrix of mrpim and rpim are usually larger than those of fem q4 and fem q8 implying that the time for forming system matrices and the computational storages required for mrpim and rpim are hence larger than those for fem q4 and fem q8 when the same dofs are used in fact when analyzing large scale models the time for solving linear system matrices and meshgrid generation dominates and the time for forming linear system matrices can be a small part of the total solution time what is more less dofs are required for mrpim and rpim than fem q4 to obtain a same order of accuracy and the requirements on the meshgrid generation are relaxed in the meshfree mrpim and rpim from these points of view mrpim and rpim can provide comparable performance to fem the relative errors of different numerical methods versus the cpu time second for solving linear system matrices with the same direct solver are show in fig 14 at k 30 fig 14 shows that to obtain the identical relative error the required cpu time of mrpim is less than those of fem q4 and rpim however is much larger than that of fem q8 these results indicate that the efficiency of mrpim may not be better than that of fem q8 in regard to the cost of the solution process due to the system matrix of larger bandwidth obtained from mrpim nevertheless the use of the eight node quadratic elements in fem q8 may weaken its effectiveness for complex geometric models and we can foresee that the time of fem q8 for mesh generation would be much longer than the counterpart of mrpim the meshfree feature of mrpim can effectively cut down the cost of the meshgrid generation so it is expected that mrpim is still a competitive method 5 2 longitudinal section of an automobile an engineering structure concerning an automobile is considered in fig 15 the noise coming from the engine causes the vibration of the front plate denoted as the red line with the neumann boundary condition v n 0 01 m s and the acoustical absorbing materials which are represented as the robin boundary condition a n 0 00144 m pa s are attached to the ceiling of the automobile denoted as the magenta line the longitudinal section of the car is discretized as the meshgrid with the average nodal spacing d c 0 012 m and the influence domain size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c 5 2 1 pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim the comparisons of the acoustic pressure distributions of the automobile section computed using fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 40 and 50 are shown in figs 16 18 since it is difficult to obtain the exact solutions to this problem the solutions of fem q4 with a quite refined meshgrid are considered as the reference solutions as exhibited in fig 16 the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim are in good accordance with the reference solution at k 30 however it is shown in figs 17 and 18 that the acoustic pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 do not conform well with the reference solutions for k 40 and 50 as many spurious wavelets can be seen in the backseat region of the car by comparison the solutions of rpim and mrpim still agree well with the reference solutions relatively and the differences between rpim and mrpim are not obvious by comparing the acoustic pressure distributions so the pressure solutions on a path ab denoted as the blue line in fig 15 are employed to further compare the results of rpim and mrpim in the following 5 2 2 acoustic pressure solutions on a path ab the amplitude of the acoustic pressure solutions obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim on a path ab is displayed in figs 19 21 for k 30 40 and 50 in addition the reference solutions are also plotted for comparison fig 19 indicates that the acoustic pressure solutions obtained using fem q4 depart slightly from the reference solution for k 30 while the good solutions are obtained using the other numerical methods in fig 20 we can observe that the solutions of fem q4 cannot accord well with the reference solutions for k 40 and the solutions of rpim deviate from the reference solution more obviously than mrpim as shown in fig 21 the curve of fem q4 becomes considerably oscillatory for k 50 and the curves of the other numerical methods also deviate a little from the reference solution besides the curve of mrpim is closer to the reference solution than that of rpim in the aspect of the acoustic pressure amplitude 5 3 acoustic scattering from a rigid infinite cylinder the acoustic scattering from a rigid infinite cylinder impinged by a unit plane wave is considered here as plotted in fig 22 the original problem can be further simplified to a two dimensional problem since all variables remain constant along the lengthwise direction of the cylinder the cylinder is surrounded by water with the density of 1000 kg m3 and the sound velocity of 1500 m s the radii of the dtn boundary and the cylinder are 2 m and 1 m respectively and the influence domain size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c the analytical solution to this problem morse 1948 is expressed as 34 u n 0 i n ν n j n k r h n 1 k r h n 1 k r cos n θ where r is the radius of the cylinder j n and h n 1 are the bessel function and hankel function of first kind respectively and ν n 1 when n 0 otherwise ν n 2 5 3 1 scattering patterns obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim the acoustic scattering patterns which are expressed as the scattering pressure amplitude on the circle with a radius of 1 5 m are plotted in figs 23 25 for k 30 50 and 70 using the regular node arrangement with the average nodal spacing d c 0 021 m it is pointed out here that the employed meshgrid for k 30 ensures ten elements per wavelength while the employed meshgrid for k 50 ensures six elements per wavelength which is related to the rule of thumb for k 30 the solutions of all the numerical methods accord well with the analytical solutions while for the higher wavenumbers the solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 depart more obviously from the analytical solutions in comparison to rpim and mrpim moreover we can find that the curves of mrpim are closer to the analytical solutions than rpim in k 50 and k 70 for 90 to 90 indicating that the modified node selection scheme employed in mrpim can effectively reduce numerical errors in addition the acoustic scattering patterns obtained using the irregular node arrangement are also displayed infig 26 28 it is observed that the solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 have been seriously degraded by using the irregular node arrangement especially for k 50 and 70 since the curves of fem q4 and fem q8 become quite oscillatory by comparison rpim and mrpim seem to behave much better than fem q4 and fem q8 when using the irregular node arrangement what is more as shown in fig 28 the curve of mrpim can be a little less oscillatory than that of rpim for k 70 to quantitatively compare the performance of mrpim and rpim in terms of the relative errors the computational accuracy study will be conducted in the following subsection 5 3 2 computational accuracy study in order to compare the present method with the b spline fem khajah et al 2019 we employ the relative l2 error indicator in this subsection that is 35 ε l 2 ω u u h t u u h d ω ω u t u d ω khajah et al 2019 have studied the accuracy of the b spline fem for analyzing the acoustic scattering of an infinite cylinder generally by keeping ten elements per wavelength the high order b spline fem can yield very accurate results with negligible pollution errors the accuracy of rpim and mrpim is compared with the first order and the second b spline fems by keeping ten elements per wavelength as displayed in fig 29 we can obtain that fem q4 and the first order b spline fem yield the highest relative errors the relative errors obtained from fem q8 and rpim are nearly the same and the accuracy of mrpim is a little lower than that of the second b spline fem moreover the relative errors of mrpim are one order of magnitude lower than those of rpim for the relatively higher wavenumbers implying that the modified node selection scheme can considerably increase the accuracy of mrpim for this problem also the relative errors in the solutions of fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim using the regular and the irregular node arrangements are plotted in fig 30 for a range of wavenumbers the average nodal spacing is fixed as d c 0 021 m by following the rule of thumb the considered wavenumber should not exceed 47 6 and by employing ten elements per wavelength the considered wavenumber should be under 29 9 as expected the relative errors of fem q4 are the largest for k 10 among these numerical methods and the solutions of fem q8 are not satisfactory for k 30 in comparison rpim and mrpim behave better than fem q4 and fem q8 and mrpim can yield more accurate solutions than rpim for relatively higher wavenumbers interestingly it is found that the results of rpim and mrpim using the irregular node arrangement can be more accurate than those using the regular node arrangement for k 20 this reason for this may be that the employed rbfs in the interpolations for rpim and mrpim are insensitive to the irregularity magnitude of the annular node arrangement for the considered annular problem domain 5 4 acoustic scattering from a rigid rudder in this section the acoustic scattering of a two dimensional rudder by a unit plane wave is considered as shown in fig 31 the geometry of this rudder is described as the airfoil section in terms of naca0018 where the length of the rudder is 1m and the radius of the dtn boundary is 2m as the model is unsymmetrical the plane waves of specific incident angles θ can result in specific scattering patterns for this problem a nonuniform meshgrid with the average nodal spacing is dc 0 02m is employed and the influence doamin size r inf for rpim and mrpim is chosen as 4 d c 5 4 1 scattering pressure distributions with the incident angle 0 the acoustic scattering pressure distributions of the rudder obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 50 and 75 at the incident angle 0 are displayed in figs 32 34 for comparison the results of fem q4 using a very fine meshgrid are employed as the reference solutions it is noted here that the employed meshgrid for k 30 ensures nearly ten elements per wavelength while the employed meshgrid for k 50 ensures six elements per wavelength which is related to the rule of thumb it is observed that all the numerical solutions agree well with the reference solution for k 30 however the pressure distributions obtained from fem q4 are relatively oscillatory in k 50 moreover we can see that the pressure solutions of fem q4 and fem q8 are quite oscillatory for k 75 compared with the reference solution while the solutions of rpim and mrpim are more accurate than fem q4 and fem q8 5 4 2 scattering pressure distributions with the incident angle 90 the acoustic scattering pressure distributions of the rudder obtained from fem q4 fem q8 rpim and mrpim for k 30 50 and 75 at the incident angle 90 are shown in figs 35 37 again fem q4 cannot provide sufficiently good simulations of the scattering distributions for k 50 and 75 in comparison to the reference solutions and the pressure distribution of fem q8 is also quite unstable for k 75 in addition we can observe that the spurious separation occurs in the forescattering pressure distribution obtained from rpim when compared with mrpim solution and the reference solution for k 75 implying that mrpim can be superior to rpim in analyzing this scattering problem 6 discussions and remarks in this work the performance of mrpim with the modified node selection scheme is examined by the a priori dispersion analysis and a number of numerical examples associated with acoustic wave propagation several discussions and remarks are presented as the following 1 in comparison with fem q4 and fem q8 the accuracy of mrpim is higher than that of fem q4 and is similar to that of fem q8 for interior acoustics while the solutions of mrpim are more accurate than those of fem q4 and fem q8 for acoustic scattering especially for relatively high wavenumbers 2 in comparison with rpim mrpim with the modified node selection scheme can lead to lower numerical errors compared with the original rpim and this idea may be also effective for other meshfree techniques based on the weak form 3 in using irregular or nonuniform node arrangements the behaviors of mrpim are more favorable than those of the other numerical methods in particular for the annular problem domain for acoustic scattering credit authorship contribution statement xiangyu you conceptualization formal analysis qiang gui conceptualization formal
