7515,it is vital to identify drought events and to evaluate multivariate drought characteristics based on a composite drought index for better drought risk assessment and sustainable development of water resources however most composite drought indices are constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices in this study the multidimensional copulas function was applied to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship due to its dependence structure and flexibility the nmdi was constructed by combining meteorological hydrological and agricultural variables precipitation runoff and soil moisture to better reflect the multivariate variables simultaneously based on the constructed nmdi and runs theory drought events for a particular area regarding three drought characteristics duration peak and severity were identified finally multivariate drought risk was analyzed as a tool for providing reliable support in drought decision making the results indicate that 1 multidimensional copulas can effectively solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multivariate variables 2 compared with single and other composite drought indices the nmdi is slightly more sensitive in capturing recorded drought events and 3 drought risk shows a spatial variation out of the five partitions studied the jing river basin as well as the upstream and midstream of the wei river basin are characterized by a higher multivariate drought risk in general multidimensional copulas provides a reliable way to solve the nonlinear relationship when constructing a comprehensive drought index and evaluating multivariate drought characteristics keywords nonlinear multivariate drought index multidimensional copulas drought events drought risk 1 introduction droughts and floods are extreme events mishra and singh 2010 hao et al 2016 maity et al 2016 in nature causing great harm to humans agricultural production and society they are especially damaging in the northwest arid area of china li et al 2011 hao et al 2016 according to statistics global economic losses due to droughts reached up to 6 8 billion dollars far exceeding losses caused by other meteorological disasters wilhite 2001 more seriously water demand has climbed sharply due to the expanding scale of industry agriculture energy development of the social economy global warming and rapid increase of the world s population it has led to the exacerbation of the water shortage and obvious global drought trend cammalleri et al 2015 nam et al 2015 caracciolo et al 2016 therefore an accurate drought risk assessment is fundamental to prevent and mitigate drought disasters drought event identification is the basis of drought risk assessment drought event is a multivariate phenomenon xu et al 2015 its negative influence presents multivariate drought characteristics such as drought duration peak severity and affected area traditional drought risk assessment only considers one drought characteristic and may not reflect the complex characteristics of drought events xu et al 2015 therefore one purpose of this study is the multivariate drought risk assessment considering three drought characteristics drought duration peak and severity to accurately identify drought events a dependable drought index is indispensable drought index can reflect drought anomalies or degrees wilhite 2001 and is also the basis for credible drought risk assessment it is primarily employed to quantify or monitor drought events currently numerous drought indices including single multiple and composite indices mishra and singh 2010 cammalleri et al 2015 waseem et al 2015 have been used to evaluate different types of droughts a single drought index only considers one variable such as precipitation runoff or soil moisture waseem et al 2015 a multiple drought index takes more variables into consideration a single drought index or multiple drought index mostly can typically reflect one type of drought meteorological hydrological agricultural or socioeconomic drought in addition drought events identifications based on different drought indices are a little bit different from each other most importantly different types of droughts may occur simultaneously and it is hard to distinguish them hao and singh 2015 therefore the single and multiple drought indices are insufficient to reveal the complicated relationship among different variables to overcome this issue the composite index was proposed a composite index entails constructing an index based on different drought indices rajsekhar et al 2015 which can reflect multivariate drought variables simultaneously huang et al 2015 chang et al 2016 there have been numerous studies that have focused on constructing a composite index based on different methods linear combination is a candidate to combine different drought indices svoboda et al 2002 proposed an objective blend of drought indicators obdi based on a linear weighted method a linearly combined drought index ldi assuming the same weight was employed to predict the drought by hao et al 2016 the principal component analysis pca is another way to construct the multivariate drought index meyer et al 1991 proposed to use the pca to combine the pdsi with crop moisture index cmi keyantash and dracup 2004 developed an aggregate drought index adi that integrates meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts based on pca entropy theory is also a mean to construct the composite drought index a multivariate drought index mdi was built by rajsekhar et al 2015 based on entropy method waseem et al 2015 huang et al 2015 and chang et al 2016 also built composite drought indices using this method composite drought indices constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method all assume a linear relationship among different drought indices mo and lettenmaier 2014 therefore some researchers proposed to employ the copulas function to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multiple variables kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 ma et al 2014 the copulas function is a method which has been widely used in hydrological fields such as multivariate drought frequency analysis huang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 and hydrometeorological extremes kao and govindaraju 2010 copulas is a flexible statistical tool which can be used to construct the joint distribution function by combining multiple univariate marginal distribution functions according to the dependence structure hao and singh 2015 there is no limitation in choosing the marginal distribution function of univariate drought index i e margin free characteristics favre et al 2004 in addition all margin free characteristics can be fully maintained jeong and lee 2015 more importantly there are a set of copulas families that can describe the nonlinear symmetric or asymmetric relationship a copula based joint deficit index jdi was constructed by kao and govindaraju 2010 based on precipitation and streamflow hao and aghakouchak 2013 put forward a multivariate standardized drought index msdi based on 2 dimensional copulas to reflect meteorological and agricultural droughts at the same time the copulas function can also be employed to higher dimensions to characterize multiple drought types at the same time ma et al 2014 put forward the standardized palmer drought index spdi based joint drought index spdi jdi based on multidimensional copulas function these studies prove the effectiveness and feasibility of using copulas to construct a composite drought index nonetheless since the research on the construction of the composite drought index based on multidimensional copulas function is still limited another purpose of this study is to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi based on multidimensional copulas function to simultaneously reflect meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought variables precipitation runoff and soil moisture the wei river basin is one of the most important grain and industrial production bases in china it plays an important role in the western china s development nevertheless due to the impacts of climate change and human activities runoff has decreased yang et al 2016 at the same time with the development of the economy water demand is growing each year therefore there is an imbalance between water supply and water demand leading to frequent droughts a more accurate assessment of drought risk in the wei river basin can aid in the planning and sustainable development of water resources drought early warning and relief the wei river basin was chosen as the study area because of this challenging problem as a reliable drought index is the basis of drought risk assessment the main purposes of this study are 1 to construct a reliable nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi and 2 to conduct a multivariate drought risk assessment considering three drought characteristics duration peak and severity for early drought warning and mitigation 2 study area and data sources the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river at 818 km in length the average slope of the main stream is 0 223 it flows through gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces covering about 134 800 km2 and accounting for 18 of the area of the yellow river basin chang et al 2016 it is located at 104 e 110 4 e 33 n 38 n in an arid and semi arid region the mean annual rainfall of the wei river basin is about 527 mm and much higher in the south over 800 mm than the north lower than 550 mm the largest monthly rainfall mainly occurs in july or august whereas the minimum occurs in december or january rainfall from july to october accounts for over 60 of the annual rainfall huang et al 2014 the mean annual evaporation ranges from approximately 600 1600 mm the mean annual runoff is approximately 100 4 108 m3 comprising 17 3 of the runoff in the yellow river the wei river basin wrb is divided into five partitions the jing river basin jrb beiluo river basin brb upstream of the wei river basin uwrb midstream of the wei river basin mwrb downstream of the wei river basin dwrb illustrated in fig 1 the precipitation average vapor pressure average air temperature minimum and maximum air temperature average sunshine hours and average wind speed of 21 meteorological stations in the wei river basin were gathered from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and are shown in fig 1 the runoff in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb and lwrb were collected from 5 hydrological stations zhangjiacun zhuangtou linjiacun xianyang and huanxian based on data published by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission soil types were obtained from the world soil information the data period is from 1960 to 2005 the meteorological data of the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb were calculated using the thiessen polygon method 3 methodology the main flowchart used to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi and to assess multivariate drought risk the two purposes of this study is displayed in fig 2 the detailed calculations are to follow 3 1 nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship among different drought indices the multidimensional copulas function was employed in this study to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi by integrating meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices according to its margin free characteristics and structure dependence kao and govindaraju 2010 there are three steps to construct the nmdi step 1 calculation of the monthly meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices values step 2 selection of the optimal marginal distribution functions of monthly meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices values step 3 selection of the optimal copulas function to construct the nmdi 3 1 1 three drought indices precipitation anomaly percentage pap streamflow drought index sdi and modified palmer drought severity index mpdsi were employed as the meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought index respectively time scales for pap sdi and mpdsi are all one month in this study therefore the time scale of the constructed nmdi is also one month the pap can directly reflect a drought caused by a precipitation anomaly the method is simple and the data required is easy to obtain therefore it has been widely used chang et al 2016 the formula for pap is defined as follows 1 pap p p p where p is the monthly precipitation and p is the average monthly precipitation the calculation of sdi is simple stable and flexible in addition it can reflect the intensity and duration of a drought hence it has been widely applied nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 tabari et al 2013 the formula of the sdi is as follows 2 z sdi s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 where t ln 1 f 2 if f 0 5 s 1 conversely if f 0 5 s 1 f x x 0 0 f x dx x is the measured monthly runoff f x x 0 is the cumulative probability function of the measured runoff f x is the probability density function of the measured runoff and f x obeys the gamma distribution c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 the pdsi was proposed by palmer 1965 based on the water balance equation this index considers the previous precipitation water supply and water demand and can provide clear physical description as it nicely captures the variation of soil moisture currently it is the most widely used drought index ma et al 2013 nam et al 2015 the pdsi was constructed according to data from the united states it is not sensitive in the northwest of china chang et al 2016 therefore it must be modified to accurately identify a drought event the formula of the modified pdsi mpdsi chang et al 2016 in the wei river basin is expressed as follows 3 mpdsi x i z i 216 0 9213 x i 1 where xi is the drought index zi denotes the abnormal moisture index 4 z dk 5 d p p 6 k i 2601 3 j 1 12 d j k j k 7 k 4 3208 log 10 pe i r i ro i p i l i d i 8 9661 where ki is the climatic characteristic coefficient k is the modified climatic characteristic coefficient d represents the difference between p measured monthly precipitation and p monthly precipitation in suitable climate condition pe r ro p l d refer to average potential evapotranspiration average water supplement average runoff average precipitation average water loss and average absolute value of d drought grade classifications of meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices are shown in table 1 3 1 2 selection of the optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought indices to better preserve all margin free characteristics jeong and lee 2015 in this paper a larger set of marginal distribution functions including gamma rayleigh log normal normal beta exponential weibull and generalized pareto were selected as candidates to fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values shown in table 2 as the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi had negative values some marginal distribution functions were not applicable therefore normalization was conducted madadgar et al 2014 to ensure that three monthly drought indices values were all in the interval of 0 1 then parameters of these eight marginal distribution functions for three normalized drought indices values were estimated based on the maximum likelihood algorithm for each drought index there are eight marginal distribution functions an optimal marginal distribution function of each drought index must be chosen to better represent the properties of each drought index in this region the optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought indices values were selected with the highest goodness of fit gof i e the lowest values of three evaluation indices the root mean square error rmse ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 rmse ols and aic are computed as follows 8 p e p a a i m 1 i n m 0 44 n 0 12 9 mse 1 n 1 i 1 n p e p t 2 10 ols 1 n i 1 n p e p t 2 11 rmse mse 12 aic n log mse 2 k where pe is the empirical cumulative probability of monthly pap sdi or mpdsi values nm represents the number counted as a a i n is the total number pt is the theoretical cumulative probability of monthly pap sdi or mpdsi values calculated based on the determined optimal parameters and k is the total number of the function parameters 3 1 3 construction of the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi in this study four families belonging to 3 dimensional archimedean copulas gumbel hougaard gumbel ali mikhail haq amh clayton and frank were chosen as the candidates to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi distribution functions of four multidimensional archimedean copulas are listed in table 3 in this study the curve fitting method zhang and song 2011 was used to determine the optimal parameters of four copulas with the highest goodness of fit by comparing the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi and 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi eq 13 13 h a b c p a a i b b i c c i m 1 i l 1 i k 1 i n mlk 0 44 n 0 12 where h a b c is the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi nmlk represents the number counted as a a i b b i c c i n is the total number assuming that the theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi are f x g y and k z simplified as u v w respectively the formula of the nmdi drought index can be calculated based on the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi which is defined as follows madadgar et al 2014 14 nmdi c f x g y k z c u v w where c is the copulas joint distribution function c u v w is the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices as four families of copulas functions all have their own best goodness of fit therefore the optimal copulas function must be determined to construct a more reasonable drought index the best copulas function was determined by analyzing which copulas function has the highest goodness of fit after selection of the optimal copulas the formula to calculate the nmdi eq 14 was obtained based on the corresponding copulas joint distribution function and optimal parameters of the optimal copulas table 3 next the monthly nmdi values was computed based on the formula and the optimal theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi then the drought grade classifications of the nmdi was acquired based on the normalized drought grade classifications of pap sdi and mpdsi and the formula of the nmdi 3 2 drought risk assessment 3 2 1 identification of drought events to assess the drought risk it is necessary to identify drought events including three drought characteristics the drought duration d severity s and peak p based on the runs theory cancelliere and salas 2004 chang et al 2016 in this study the drought event is defined as the constructed nmdi values smaller than the truncation level the critical value between the no drought and slight drought duration d is the number of continuous months of the drought event the months when nmdi values are smaller than the critical value drought severity s is the cumulative deficit below the critical value of the drought event drought peak p is the maximal gap between the nmdi value and the critical value of the drought event 3 2 2 drought risk assessment in this study drought risk is defined as the likely occurrence drought possibility for a given duration peak and severity the multivariate drought risk can be derived as follows 15 p d d p p s s 1 u v w c u v c u w c w v c u v w where p d d p p s s is the multivariate drought risk joint exceedance possibility c u v c u w and c w v are the 2 dimensional joint cumulative probability of duration and peak duration and severity peak and severity respectively the calculation of optimal marginal distribution functions of drought duration peak and severity and the optimal copulas function to derive the joint distribution of three characteristics are similar with that in section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 marginal distribution of the calculated pap sdi and mpdsi values based on the description in section 3 1 the foundation work to construct the nmdi is to calculate the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values and to determine their corresponding optimal marginal distribution functions monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the five partitions as well as the whole wei river basin were calculated based on the formulas in section 3 1 1 next eight marginal distribution functions were employed to fit the normalized monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin then the optimal parameters of eight marginal distribution functions for pap sdi and mpdsi values in five partitions and the whole wei river basin were estimated based on the maximum likelihood algorithm afterwards the optimal goodness of fit gof of eight marginal distribution functions was calculated by comparing the theoretical cumulative probability of pap sdi or mpdsi calculated based on optimal marginal distribution function parameters and the empirical cumulative probability of pap sdi or mpdsi eq 8 the gof criteria results of eight distribution functions and their corresponding parameters for the pap in the jrb were taken as an example and listed in table 4 the smallest are the three evaluation indices and the goodness of fit of the selected marginal distribution function is the best table 4 shows that for the monthly pap values in the jrb three evaluation indices of weibull are smallest with rmse 0 0310 ols 0 0309 and aic 1625 81 therefore weibull with α 0 2242 β 1 3716 is the most appropriate marginal distribution function to fit the monthly pap values in the jrb similarly in the jrb the weibull and normal marginal distribution functions are optimal for the monthly sdi and mpdsi values respectively weibull normal and normal fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the brb best respectively weibull weibull and normal are most appropriate to fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the uwrb respectively the best fit marginal distribution functions of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the mwrb are weibull normal and normal respectively the optimal marginal distribution functions of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the lwrb are weibull weibull and normal respectively weibull weibull and normal fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the wrb best respectively 4 2 construction of the nonlinear multivariate drought index after determining the optimal marginal distribution functions and their parameters of monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values four families of 3 dimensional archimedean copulas gumbel amh clayton and frank were employed to construct the nmdi in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin for each copulas function when the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi is nearest to the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices eq 13 based on lowest values of three evaluation indices rmse ols and aic the parameter of the copulas function is the best in this study the curve fitting method was applied to derive the optimal parameter of the gumbel amh clayton and frank the gof criteria results from the four copulas functions and their corresponding optimal parameters in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that in the jrb three evaluation indices of gumbel are lowest with rmse 0 053936 ols 0 053886 and aic 1367 57 revealing that the gumbel copula with parameter θ 1 3674 is the best function to construct the nmdi according to the optimal marginal distributions of pap sdi and mpdsi similarly the gumbel copula was also used for the mwrb lwrb and wrb while the frank copula was used for brb and uwrb based on the corresponding parameters distribution functions of the optimal copulas function and the optimal theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi monthly nmdi values 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin were obtained the comparisons between the 3 dimensional empirical and optimal theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices is quite close to the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices in the five partitions and the wrb this result illustrates the reliability of the selected optimal archimedean copulas and optimal parameters the drought grade classifications of the nmdi must be determined to better assess the drought degrees taking the jrb as an example based on the selected optimal copulas gumbel table 5 its optimal parameter and the normalized drought grade classifications of pap sdi and mpdsi table 1 the drought grade classifications of the nmdi in the jrb were calculated according to eq 14 similarly drought grade classifications of the nmdi in the brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and the whole wrb were obtained as shown in table 6 the spatial diagram of the drought grade classifications is shown in fig 4 above the blue isosurface there is no drought the space between the blue and green isosurface represents slight droughts the space between the green and yellow isosurface represents moderate droughts the space between the yellow and red isosurface is severe drought and finally the space below the red isosurface is extreme drought 4 3 comparison between the nmdi and other drought indices to verify the reliability of the constructed nmdi in this study taking the nmdi pap sdi and mpdsi values of the wrb in 2000 as an example the comparison is plotted in fig 5 for better visualization fig 5 shows that the variation trend of the monthly nmdi values is relatively consistent with the variation trends of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values the increase or decline of the pap sdi and mpdsi values will also lead to a corresponding increase or decline of the nmdi values as the nmdi was constructed based on the pap sdi and mpdsi it should reflect the multiple meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties the correlation analyses between two drought indices are shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the correlations between two single drought indices pap sdi pap mpdsi and sdi mpdsi are generally around 0 4 and the correlations between the constructed composite drought index nmdi and single drought index pap nmdi sdi nmdi and mpdsi nmdi typically exceed 0 7 the correlations between two single drought indices are obviously smaller than the correlations between the constructed composite drought index nmdi and single drought index this indicates that to some extent the meteorological drought index pap cannot reflect the hydrological and agricultural droughts very well similarly the hydrological drought index sdi cannot reflect the meteorological and agricultural droughts very well and the agricultural drought index mpdsi cannot assess the meteorological and hydrological drought very well however the constructed nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi can relatively reflect the multiple meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties better the constructed nmdi provides a new perspective to reflect meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties at the same time to further prove the reliability of the constructed nmdi a drought frequency comparison analysis between the constructed nmdi and other single or composite drought index proposed in this study area pap sdi mpdsi and midi is essential shown in fig 6 in this study drought frequency means the occurrence possibility of different grades of droughts fig 6 shows that for the yearly total droughts the drought frequency in the jrb is the highest based on the nmdi this is in agreement with the values calculated by the mpdsi and midi the frequency of slight droughts is the highest in the brb based on the nmdi which is consistent with results from the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequency of moderate droughts in the uwrb is higher than others based on the nmdi which is in agreement with those computed by the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequencies of severe droughts are the highest in the jrb uwrb and mwrb which is also unanimous with the frequencies calculated by the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequency of extreme drought is the highest in the jrb based on the nmdi which is similar to the pap mpdsi and midi results as well the yearly drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is relatively consistent with the pap sdi mpdsi and midi indicating that the drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is reliable fig 6 also shows that drought frequencies in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are relatively higher as the yearly drought properties may cover the seasonal drought properties the seasonal drought frequency based on the nmdi was also calculated shown in fig 7 spring drought is defined as a drought that occurred from march to may summer drought is from june to august autumn drought is from september to november winter drought is from december to next february fig 7 shows that the frequencies of the total spring droughts are the highest in the jrb and uwrb for total summer droughts the frequency is the highest in the mwrb the frequency of the total autumn droughts is the highest in the uwrb the frequencies of the total winter droughts are the highest in the jrb and mwrb a slight spring summer autumn and winter droughts are likely to occur in the brb mwrb brb and jrb respectively the frequencies of moderate spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the jrb mwrb uwrb and uwrb are the highest respectively the frequencies of severe spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the uwrb jrb mwrb and mwrb are the highest respectively the frequencies of extreme spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the jrb mwrb jrb and jrb are the highest based on figs 6 and 7 we conclude that the drought frequency in the jrb is relatively the highest followed by the mwrb and uwrb in addition drought frequency analysis is consistent with other research huang et al 2015 chang et al 2016 indicating that the constructed nmdi is reliable to further prove the behavior and reliability of the nmdi whether the constructed nmdi could snap a historical drought was also analyzed in this study five years 1978 1980 1995 1997 and 2000 were selected that had recorded severe or extreme drought occurrences wang et al 2013 chang et al 2016 the comparisons of whether pap sdi mpdsi midi and nmdi could snap these droughts are shown in table 8 table 8 shows that the constructed nmdi basically captures more recorded severe or extreme drought occurrences than the pap sdi mpdsi and midi that indicates the nmdi can better reflect the complex multivariate natural variables among these five drought indices the fewest amount of droughts are captured based on the pap the reason may be that the pap only considers one variable precipitation rather than multivariate variables based on the outlined above the constructed nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi has a good reliability and it can identify multivariate drought types meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts at the same time in addition it can basically capture more recorded drought occurrences indicating that the nmdi provides a fuller picture than other drought indices 4 4 multivariate analysis of the drought risk based on the runs theory in section 3 2 drought events regarding three drought characteristics the drought duration d drought peak p and drought severity s were identified based on the nmdi in the five partitions and the wrb as a whole there were 90 98 80 83 85 and 83 drought events in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb respectively the drought peak severity and duration of these drought events in five partitions are shown in table 9 table 9 shows that the maximum drought duration in the brb is the shortest at 8 months and that the maximum drought severity of 0 79 is relatively smaller than those in other partitions indicating that droughts in the brb are relatively less serious however the maximum drought duration in the mwrb is the longest 17 months while the maximum drought peak of 0 1 is relatively higher and maximum drought severity of 1 5 is the highest showing that droughts in the mwrb are very serious droughts in the uwrb and jrb are also very serious on the whole drought in the wei river basin is a significant issue to better analyze the drought risk regarding three drought characteristics duration peak and severity to better plan and manage water resources alleviate the drought and develop drought warning systems the four families of 3 dimensional copulas function were also employed to inquire into the multivariate drought risk i e the joint exceedance possibility first it was necessary to derive the optimal marginal distribution functions of the duration peak and severity based on eight marginal distribution functions in the five partitions and the wrb the calculation method is similar with that shown in table 4 the results show that the optimal marginal distribution functions for the duration severity and peak in the jrb are rayleigh beta and normal respectively rayleigh gamma and generalized pareto fit the duration severity and peak in the brb best respectively rayleigh gamma and generalized pareto are most appropriate to fit duration severity and peak in the uwrb respectively the best fit marginal distribution functions of the duration severity and peak in the mwrb are rayleigh log normal and normal respectively the optimal marginal distribution functions for the duration severity and peak in the lwrb are rayleigh log normal and generalized pareto respectively in the wrb rayleigh generalized pareto and generalized pareto fit the duration severity and peak best respectively after confirming the optimal marginal distribution functions and parameters of the drought duration peak and severity four families of 3 dimensional archimedean copulas including gumbel amh clayton and frank were employed to derive the multivariate drought risk the calculation process is similar with that in section 4 2 the gof criteria results of four copulas functions and their corresponding optimal parameters to derive the multivariate drought risk in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin are shown in table 10 table 10 shows that in the jrb three evaluation indices of the gumbel are lowest with rmse 0 0718 ols 0 0714 and aic 203 8990 showing that the gumbel with parameter θ 3 1731 is best to construct the joint distribution of three drought characteristics the duration peak and severity similarly optimal 3 dimensional archimedean copulas functions used to construct the joint distribution of three drought characteristics are frank frank gumbel frank and frank in the brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb respectively next the multivariate drought risks in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin were calculated based on eq 15 optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought characteristics optimal copulas functions and its optimal parameters shown in table 10 the multivariate slice map of the drought risk is shown in fig 8 the multivariate isosurfaces of the drought risk are shown in fig 9 fig 8 is used to analyze how the multivariate drought risk reacts to the variation of the drought duration peak and severity fig 8 shows the slice map of multivariate drought risk under the conditions pd 0 25 pd 0 5 pd 0 75 pp 0 25 pp 0 5 pp 0 75 ps 0 25 ps 0 5 and ps 0 75 pd pp and ps are the theoretical cumulative probability of the drought duration peak and severity respectively the higher the ps is the greater the drought severity the higher the pd is the longer the drought duration the higher the pp is the greater the drought peak the color represents the multivariate drought risk possibility values fig 8 shows that the law of drought risk in the five partitions and the wrb is similar taking the jrb as an example and keeping the pd and pp constant for example when pd 0 25 and pp 0 the higher the ps is the lower the multivariate drought risk similarly with the increase of pd or the pp multivariate drought risk declines the multivariate drought risk negatively correlated with the cumulative probability of the duration peak and severity this result indicates that the more severe the drought the lower the multivariate drought risk it also indicates that the more serious the duration peak and severity the less likely is the occurrence of a corresponding drought event fig 9 shows the multivariate isosurfaces when pre 0 1 pre is the 3 dimensional i e multivariate drought risk possibility pre 0 2 pre 0 3 pre 0 4 pre 0 5 pre 0 6 pre 0 7 pre 0 8 and pre 0 9 it shows the isosurfaces of multivariate drought risk from the viewing angle it also illustrates that when cumulative probability of duration peak and severity increases the multivariate drought risk declines which agrees with fig 8 it also indicates that the likely occurrence drought possibility of severe or extreme droughts is lower than that of light droughts therefore in practice more attention should be paid to the slight or moderate drought events in this study multivariate drought risks under two scenarios scenario 1 droughts more likely to happen p d 2 p 0 05 s 0 05 scenario 2 droughts less likely to happen p d 4 p 0 075 s 0 1 in the five partitions are demonstrated in fig 10 fig 10 shows that for scenario 1 the multivariate drought risks in the jrb uwrb mwrb brb and lwrb are 0 59 0 68 0 65 0 50 and 0 48 respectively for scenario 2 the multivariate drought risks in the jrb uwrb mwrb brb and lwrb are 0 10 0 24 0 30 0 14 and 0 12 respectively the likely occurrence drought possibilities of scenario 1 in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher than those in the other partitions the likely occurrence drought possibilities of scenario 2 in the uwrb and mwrb are higher than those in the other partitions the multivariate drought risks in the uwrb mwrb and jrb are relatively higher than those in the other partitions this indicates that for a given duration peak and severity the likely occurrence drought possibilities in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher this result is in accordance with the drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi in figs 6 and 7 the reason why the drought frequency and multivariate drought risk in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are shown as follows from the angle of the terrain the geomorphology in the jrb is mainly loess the soil texture is relatively coarse and the vegetation is rare leading to poor water retention moreover the jrb is the main source of the sediment of the yellow river the soil and water losses in the jrb are the most serious in the wei river basin with regards to climate precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and it is not easy to store in addition evapotranspiration is larger due to abundant sunshine therefore the capacity to resist drought in the jrb is low many important cities such as xi an xianyang and tianshui are located in uwrb and mwrb and many studies have stated that due to human activities and climate variation runoff in these cities has markedly declined chang et al 2014 2016 more importantly the increasing number of people moving to these cities has resulted in a sharp increase of water demand at the same time evaporation has increased due to the rising temperature these factors all lead to the higher drought risks in the uwrb and mwrb the wei river basin is facing a serious drought risk which will compromise the basin s sustainable development therefore relevant government departments should take greater measures regarding early drought warning and drought relief to better prevent and control the droughts 5 conclusions previous research mainly focused on constructing the composite drought index to analyze multivariate drought characteristics based on the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices in this study a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi was constructed based on the multidimensional archimedean copulas then based on the constructed nmdi and runs theory drought events regarding three drought characteristics drought duration peak and severity were identified multivariate drought risks were also assessed in the wei river basin for better drought early warning and relief the main conclusions are as follows 1 the nmdi was constructed to derive the joint distribution of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi based on their optimal marginal distribution functions and the nmdi formula the nmdi formula was computed according to the optimal parameters and corresponding joint distribution function of the optimal copulas results show that the most appropriate multidimensional copulas functions to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb are gumbel frank frank gumbel gumbel and gumbel respectively 2 correlation coefficients between the nmdi and single drought index are mostly over 0 7 indicating that the nmdi can reflect the comprehensive meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties simultaneously this suggests that the copulas can solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among different drought indices in addition the margin free characteristics are completely preserved by the copulas function when constructing the joint distribution function 3 drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is consistent with the pap sdi mpdsi and midi moreover the nmdi is basically more sensitive to capture more historical recorded drought occurrences indicating that the nmdi is reliable and superior 4 drought risk shows a spatial variation for scenario 1 droughts more likely to happen the drought risks in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher for scenario 2 droughts less likely to happen the drought risks in the uwrb and mwrb are higher this indicates that the likely occurrence drought possibilities in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher 5 although the wrb is selected as the study area the constructed nmdi can also be applied in other regions how to assess the impacts of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts on society and the economy is the priority of our next study in addition more drought characteristics will be considered for better drought risk assessment acknowledgments this research is supported by

7515,it is vital to identify drought events and to evaluate multivariate drought characteristics based on a composite drought index for better drought risk assessment and sustainable development of water resources however most composite drought indices are constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices in this study the multidimensional copulas function was applied to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship due to its dependence structure and flexibility the nmdi was constructed by combining meteorological hydrological and agricultural variables precipitation runoff and soil moisture to better reflect the multivariate variables simultaneously based on the constructed nmdi and runs theory drought events for a particular area regarding three drought characteristics duration peak and severity were identified finally multivariate drought risk was analyzed as a tool for providing reliable support in drought decision making the results indicate that 1 multidimensional copulas can effectively solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multivariate variables 2 compared with single and other composite drought indices the nmdi is slightly more sensitive in capturing recorded drought events and 3 drought risk shows a spatial variation out of the five partitions studied the jing river basin as well as the upstream and midstream of the wei river basin are characterized by a higher multivariate drought risk in general multidimensional copulas provides a reliable way to solve the nonlinear relationship when constructing a comprehensive drought index and evaluating multivariate drought characteristics keywords nonlinear multivariate drought index multidimensional copulas drought events drought risk 1 introduction droughts and floods are extreme events mishra and singh 2010 hao et al 2016 maity et al 2016 in nature causing great harm to humans agricultural production and society they are especially damaging in the northwest arid area of china li et al 2011 hao et al 2016 according to statistics global economic losses due to droughts reached up to 6 8 billion dollars far exceeding losses caused by other meteorological disasters wilhite 2001 more seriously water demand has climbed sharply due to the expanding scale of industry agriculture energy development of the social economy global warming and rapid increase of the world s population it has led to the exacerbation of the water shortage and obvious global drought trend cammalleri et al 2015 nam et al 2015 caracciolo et al 2016 therefore an accurate drought risk assessment is fundamental to prevent and mitigate drought disasters drought event identification is the basis of drought risk assessment drought event is a multivariate phenomenon xu et al 2015 its negative influence presents multivariate drought characteristics such as drought duration peak severity and affected area traditional drought risk assessment only considers one drought characteristic and may not reflect the complex characteristics of drought events xu et al 2015 therefore one purpose of this study is the multivariate drought risk assessment considering three drought characteristics drought duration peak and severity to accurately identify drought events a dependable drought index is indispensable drought index can reflect drought anomalies or degrees wilhite 2001 and is also the basis for credible drought risk assessment it is primarily employed to quantify or monitor drought events currently numerous drought indices including single multiple and composite indices mishra and singh 2010 cammalleri et al 2015 waseem et al 2015 have been used to evaluate different types of droughts a single drought index only considers one variable such as precipitation runoff or soil moisture waseem et al 2015 a multiple drought index takes more variables into consideration a single drought index or multiple drought index mostly can typically reflect one type of drought meteorological hydrological agricultural or socioeconomic drought in addition drought events identifications based on different drought indices are a little bit different from each other most importantly different types of droughts may occur simultaneously and it is hard to distinguish them hao and singh 2015 therefore the single and multiple drought indices are insufficient to reveal the complicated relationship among different variables to overcome this issue the composite index was proposed a composite index entails constructing an index based on different drought indices rajsekhar et al 2015 which can reflect multivariate drought variables simultaneously huang et al 2015 chang et al 2016 there have been numerous studies that have focused on constructing a composite index based on different methods linear combination is a candidate to combine different drought indices svoboda et al 2002 proposed an objective blend of drought indicators obdi based on a linear weighted method a linearly combined drought index ldi assuming the same weight was employed to predict the drought by hao et al 2016 the principal component analysis pca is another way to construct the multivariate drought index meyer et al 1991 proposed to use the pca to combine the pdsi with crop moisture index cmi keyantash and dracup 2004 developed an aggregate drought index adi that integrates meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts based on pca entropy theory is also a mean to construct the composite drought index a multivariate drought index mdi was built by rajsekhar et al 2015 based on entropy method waseem et al 2015 huang et al 2015 and chang et al 2016 also built composite drought indices using this method composite drought indices constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method all assume a linear relationship among different drought indices mo and lettenmaier 2014 therefore some researchers proposed to employ the copulas function to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multiple variables kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 ma et al 2014 the copulas function is a method which has been widely used in hydrological fields such as multivariate drought frequency analysis huang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 and hydrometeorological extremes kao and govindaraju 2010 copulas is a flexible statistical tool which can be used to construct the joint distribution function by combining multiple univariate marginal distribution functions according to the dependence structure hao and singh 2015 there is no limitation in choosing the marginal distribution function of univariate drought index i e margin free characteristics favre et al 2004 in addition all margin free characteristics can be fully maintained jeong and lee 2015 more importantly there are a set of copulas families that can describe the nonlinear symmetric or asymmetric relationship a copula based joint deficit index jdi was constructed by kao and govindaraju 2010 based on precipitation and streamflow hao and aghakouchak 2013 put forward a multivariate standardized drought index msdi based on 2 dimensional copulas to reflect meteorological and agricultural droughts at the same time the copulas function can also be employed to higher dimensions to characterize multiple drought types at the same time ma et al 2014 put forward the standardized palmer drought index spdi based joint drought index spdi jdi based on multidimensional copulas function these studies prove the effectiveness and feasibility of using copulas to construct a composite drought index nonetheless since the research on the construction of the composite drought index based on multidimensional copulas function is still limited another purpose of this study is to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi based on multidimensional copulas function to simultaneously reflect meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought variables precipitation runoff and soil moisture the wei river basin is one of the most important grain and industrial production bases in china it plays an important role in the western china s development nevertheless due to the impacts of climate change and human activities runoff has decreased yang et al 2016 at the same time with the development of the economy water demand is growing each year therefore there is an imbalance between water supply and water demand leading to frequent droughts a more accurate assessment of drought risk in the wei river basin can aid in the planning and sustainable development of water resources drought early warning and relief the wei river basin was chosen as the study area because of this challenging problem as a reliable drought index is the basis of drought risk assessment the main purposes of this study are 1 to construct a reliable nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi and 2 to conduct a multivariate drought risk assessment considering three drought characteristics duration peak and severity for early drought warning and mitigation 2 study area and data sources the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river at 818 km in length the average slope of the main stream is 0 223 it flows through gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces covering about 134 800 km2 and accounting for 18 of the area of the yellow river basin chang et al 2016 it is located at 104 e 110 4 e 33 n 38 n in an arid and semi arid region the mean annual rainfall of the wei river basin is about 527 mm and much higher in the south over 800 mm than the north lower than 550 mm the largest monthly rainfall mainly occurs in july or august whereas the minimum occurs in december or january rainfall from july to october accounts for over 60 of the annual rainfall huang et al 2014 the mean annual evaporation ranges from approximately 600 1600 mm the mean annual runoff is approximately 100 4 108 m3 comprising 17 3 of the runoff in the yellow river the wei river basin wrb is divided into five partitions the jing river basin jrb beiluo river basin brb upstream of the wei river basin uwrb midstream of the wei river basin mwrb downstream of the wei river basin dwrb illustrated in fig 1 the precipitation average vapor pressure average air temperature minimum and maximum air temperature average sunshine hours and average wind speed of 21 meteorological stations in the wei river basin were gathered from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and are shown in fig 1 the runoff in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb and lwrb were collected from 5 hydrological stations zhangjiacun zhuangtou linjiacun xianyang and huanxian based on data published by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission soil types were obtained from the world soil information the data period is from 1960 to 2005 the meteorological data of the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb were calculated using the thiessen polygon method 3 methodology the main flowchart used to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi and to assess multivariate drought risk the two purposes of this study is displayed in fig 2 the detailed calculations are to follow 3 1 nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship among different drought indices the multidimensional copulas function was employed in this study to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi by integrating meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices according to its margin free characteristics and structure dependence kao and govindaraju 2010 there are three steps to construct the nmdi step 1 calculation of the monthly meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices values step 2 selection of the optimal marginal distribution functions of monthly meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices values step 3 selection of the optimal copulas function to construct the nmdi 3 1 1 three drought indices precipitation anomaly percentage pap streamflow drought index sdi and modified palmer drought severity index mpdsi were employed as the meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought index respectively time scales for pap sdi and mpdsi are all one month in this study therefore the time scale of the constructed nmdi is also one month the pap can directly reflect a drought caused by a precipitation anomaly the method is simple and the data required is easy to obtain therefore it has been widely used chang et al 2016 the formula for pap is defined as follows 1 pap p p p where p is the monthly precipitation and p is the average monthly precipitation the calculation of sdi is simple stable and flexible in addition it can reflect the intensity and duration of a drought hence it has been widely applied nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 tabari et al 2013 the formula of the sdi is as follows 2 z sdi s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 where t ln 1 f 2 if f 0 5 s 1 conversely if f 0 5 s 1 f x x 0 0 f x dx x is the measured monthly runoff f x x 0 is the cumulative probability function of the measured runoff f x is the probability density function of the measured runoff and f x obeys the gamma distribution c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 the pdsi was proposed by palmer 1965 based on the water balance equation this index considers the previous precipitation water supply and water demand and can provide clear physical description as it nicely captures the variation of soil moisture currently it is the most widely used drought index ma et al 2013 nam et al 2015 the pdsi was constructed according to data from the united states it is not sensitive in the northwest of china chang et al 2016 therefore it must be modified to accurately identify a drought event the formula of the modified pdsi mpdsi chang et al 2016 in the wei river basin is expressed as follows 3 mpdsi x i z i 216 0 9213 x i 1 where xi is the drought index zi denotes the abnormal moisture index 4 z dk 5 d p p 6 k i 2601 3 j 1 12 d j k j k 7 k 4 3208 log 10 pe i r i ro i p i l i d i 8 9661 where ki is the climatic characteristic coefficient k is the modified climatic characteristic coefficient d represents the difference between p measured monthly precipitation and p monthly precipitation in suitable climate condition pe r ro p l d refer to average potential evapotranspiration average water supplement average runoff average precipitation average water loss and average absolute value of d drought grade classifications of meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought indices are shown in table 1 3 1 2 selection of the optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought indices to better preserve all margin free characteristics jeong and lee 2015 in this paper a larger set of marginal distribution functions including gamma rayleigh log normal normal beta exponential weibull and generalized pareto were selected as candidates to fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values shown in table 2 as the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi had negative values some marginal distribution functions were not applicable therefore normalization was conducted madadgar et al 2014 to ensure that three monthly drought indices values were all in the interval of 0 1 then parameters of these eight marginal distribution functions for three normalized drought indices values were estimated based on the maximum likelihood algorithm for each drought index there are eight marginal distribution functions an optimal marginal distribution function of each drought index must be chosen to better represent the properties of each drought index in this region the optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought indices values were selected with the highest goodness of fit gof i e the lowest values of three evaluation indices the root mean square error rmse ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 rmse ols and aic are computed as follows 8 p e p a a i m 1 i n m 0 44 n 0 12 9 mse 1 n 1 i 1 n p e p t 2 10 ols 1 n i 1 n p e p t 2 11 rmse mse 12 aic n log mse 2 k where pe is the empirical cumulative probability of monthly pap sdi or mpdsi values nm represents the number counted as a a i n is the total number pt is the theoretical cumulative probability of monthly pap sdi or mpdsi values calculated based on the determined optimal parameters and k is the total number of the function parameters 3 1 3 construction of the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi in this study four families belonging to 3 dimensional archimedean copulas gumbel hougaard gumbel ali mikhail haq amh clayton and frank were chosen as the candidates to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi distribution functions of four multidimensional archimedean copulas are listed in table 3 in this study the curve fitting method zhang and song 2011 was used to determine the optimal parameters of four copulas with the highest goodness of fit by comparing the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi and 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi eq 13 13 h a b c p a a i b b i c c i m 1 i l 1 i k 1 i n mlk 0 44 n 0 12 where h a b c is the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi nmlk represents the number counted as a a i b b i c c i n is the total number assuming that the theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi are f x g y and k z simplified as u v w respectively the formula of the nmdi drought index can be calculated based on the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi which is defined as follows madadgar et al 2014 14 nmdi c f x g y k z c u v w where c is the copulas joint distribution function c u v w is the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices as four families of copulas functions all have their own best goodness of fit therefore the optimal copulas function must be determined to construct a more reasonable drought index the best copulas function was determined by analyzing which copulas function has the highest goodness of fit after selection of the optimal copulas the formula to calculate the nmdi eq 14 was obtained based on the corresponding copulas joint distribution function and optimal parameters of the optimal copulas table 3 next the monthly nmdi values was computed based on the formula and the optimal theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi then the drought grade classifications of the nmdi was acquired based on the normalized drought grade classifications of pap sdi and mpdsi and the formula of the nmdi 3 2 drought risk assessment 3 2 1 identification of drought events to assess the drought risk it is necessary to identify drought events including three drought characteristics the drought duration d severity s and peak p based on the runs theory cancelliere and salas 2004 chang et al 2016 in this study the drought event is defined as the constructed nmdi values smaller than the truncation level the critical value between the no drought and slight drought duration d is the number of continuous months of the drought event the months when nmdi values are smaller than the critical value drought severity s is the cumulative deficit below the critical value of the drought event drought peak p is the maximal gap between the nmdi value and the critical value of the drought event 3 2 2 drought risk assessment in this study drought risk is defined as the likely occurrence drought possibility for a given duration peak and severity the multivariate drought risk can be derived as follows 15 p d d p p s s 1 u v w c u v c u w c w v c u v w where p d d p p s s is the multivariate drought risk joint exceedance possibility c u v c u w and c w v are the 2 dimensional joint cumulative probability of duration and peak duration and severity peak and severity respectively the calculation of optimal marginal distribution functions of drought duration peak and severity and the optimal copulas function to derive the joint distribution of three characteristics are similar with that in section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 marginal distribution of the calculated pap sdi and mpdsi values based on the description in section 3 1 the foundation work to construct the nmdi is to calculate the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values and to determine their corresponding optimal marginal distribution functions monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the five partitions as well as the whole wei river basin were calculated based on the formulas in section 3 1 1 next eight marginal distribution functions were employed to fit the normalized monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin then the optimal parameters of eight marginal distribution functions for pap sdi and mpdsi values in five partitions and the whole wei river basin were estimated based on the maximum likelihood algorithm afterwards the optimal goodness of fit gof of eight marginal distribution functions was calculated by comparing the theoretical cumulative probability of pap sdi or mpdsi calculated based on optimal marginal distribution function parameters and the empirical cumulative probability of pap sdi or mpdsi eq 8 the gof criteria results of eight distribution functions and their corresponding parameters for the pap in the jrb were taken as an example and listed in table 4 the smallest are the three evaluation indices and the goodness of fit of the selected marginal distribution function is the best table 4 shows that for the monthly pap values in the jrb three evaluation indices of weibull are smallest with rmse 0 0310 ols 0 0309 and aic 1625 81 therefore weibull with α 0 2242 β 1 3716 is the most appropriate marginal distribution function to fit the monthly pap values in the jrb similarly in the jrb the weibull and normal marginal distribution functions are optimal for the monthly sdi and mpdsi values respectively weibull normal and normal fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the brb best respectively weibull weibull and normal are most appropriate to fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the uwrb respectively the best fit marginal distribution functions of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the mwrb are weibull normal and normal respectively the optimal marginal distribution functions of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the lwrb are weibull weibull and normal respectively weibull weibull and normal fit the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values in the wrb best respectively 4 2 construction of the nonlinear multivariate drought index after determining the optimal marginal distribution functions and their parameters of monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values four families of 3 dimensional archimedean copulas gumbel amh clayton and frank were employed to construct the nmdi in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin for each copulas function when the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi is nearest to the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices eq 13 based on lowest values of three evaluation indices rmse ols and aic the parameter of the copulas function is the best in this study the curve fitting method was applied to derive the optimal parameter of the gumbel amh clayton and frank the gof criteria results from the four copulas functions and their corresponding optimal parameters in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that in the jrb three evaluation indices of gumbel are lowest with rmse 0 053936 ols 0 053886 and aic 1367 57 revealing that the gumbel copula with parameter θ 1 3674 is the best function to construct the nmdi according to the optimal marginal distributions of pap sdi and mpdsi similarly the gumbel copula was also used for the mwrb lwrb and wrb while the frank copula was used for brb and uwrb based on the corresponding parameters distribution functions of the optimal copulas function and the optimal theoretical cumulative probabilities of pap sdi and mpdsi monthly nmdi values 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin were obtained the comparisons between the 3 dimensional empirical and optimal theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the 3 dimensional theoretical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices is quite close to the 3 dimensional empirical joint cumulative probability of three drought indices in the five partitions and the wrb this result illustrates the reliability of the selected optimal archimedean copulas and optimal parameters the drought grade classifications of the nmdi must be determined to better assess the drought degrees taking the jrb as an example based on the selected optimal copulas gumbel table 5 its optimal parameter and the normalized drought grade classifications of pap sdi and mpdsi table 1 the drought grade classifications of the nmdi in the jrb were calculated according to eq 14 similarly drought grade classifications of the nmdi in the brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and the whole wrb were obtained as shown in table 6 the spatial diagram of the drought grade classifications is shown in fig 4 above the blue isosurface there is no drought the space between the blue and green isosurface represents slight droughts the space between the green and yellow isosurface represents moderate droughts the space between the yellow and red isosurface is severe drought and finally the space below the red isosurface is extreme drought 4 3 comparison between the nmdi and other drought indices to verify the reliability of the constructed nmdi in this study taking the nmdi pap sdi and mpdsi values of the wrb in 2000 as an example the comparison is plotted in fig 5 for better visualization fig 5 shows that the variation trend of the monthly nmdi values is relatively consistent with the variation trends of the monthly pap sdi and mpdsi values the increase or decline of the pap sdi and mpdsi values will also lead to a corresponding increase or decline of the nmdi values as the nmdi was constructed based on the pap sdi and mpdsi it should reflect the multiple meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties the correlation analyses between two drought indices are shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the correlations between two single drought indices pap sdi pap mpdsi and sdi mpdsi are generally around 0 4 and the correlations between the constructed composite drought index nmdi and single drought index pap nmdi sdi nmdi and mpdsi nmdi typically exceed 0 7 the correlations between two single drought indices are obviously smaller than the correlations between the constructed composite drought index nmdi and single drought index this indicates that to some extent the meteorological drought index pap cannot reflect the hydrological and agricultural droughts very well similarly the hydrological drought index sdi cannot reflect the meteorological and agricultural droughts very well and the agricultural drought index mpdsi cannot assess the meteorological and hydrological drought very well however the constructed nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi can relatively reflect the multiple meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties better the constructed nmdi provides a new perspective to reflect meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties at the same time to further prove the reliability of the constructed nmdi a drought frequency comparison analysis between the constructed nmdi and other single or composite drought index proposed in this study area pap sdi mpdsi and midi is essential shown in fig 6 in this study drought frequency means the occurrence possibility of different grades of droughts fig 6 shows that for the yearly total droughts the drought frequency in the jrb is the highest based on the nmdi this is in agreement with the values calculated by the mpdsi and midi the frequency of slight droughts is the highest in the brb based on the nmdi which is consistent with results from the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequency of moderate droughts in the uwrb is higher than others based on the nmdi which is in agreement with those computed by the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequencies of severe droughts are the highest in the jrb uwrb and mwrb which is also unanimous with the frequencies calculated by the sdi mpdsi and midi the frequency of extreme drought is the highest in the jrb based on the nmdi which is similar to the pap mpdsi and midi results as well the yearly drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is relatively consistent with the pap sdi mpdsi and midi indicating that the drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is reliable fig 6 also shows that drought frequencies in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are relatively higher as the yearly drought properties may cover the seasonal drought properties the seasonal drought frequency based on the nmdi was also calculated shown in fig 7 spring drought is defined as a drought that occurred from march to may summer drought is from june to august autumn drought is from september to november winter drought is from december to next february fig 7 shows that the frequencies of the total spring droughts are the highest in the jrb and uwrb for total summer droughts the frequency is the highest in the mwrb the frequency of the total autumn droughts is the highest in the uwrb the frequencies of the total winter droughts are the highest in the jrb and mwrb a slight spring summer autumn and winter droughts are likely to occur in the brb mwrb brb and jrb respectively the frequencies of moderate spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the jrb mwrb uwrb and uwrb are the highest respectively the frequencies of severe spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the uwrb jrb mwrb and mwrb are the highest respectively the frequencies of extreme spring summer autumn and winter droughts in the jrb mwrb jrb and jrb are the highest based on figs 6 and 7 we conclude that the drought frequency in the jrb is relatively the highest followed by the mwrb and uwrb in addition drought frequency analysis is consistent with other research huang et al 2015 chang et al 2016 indicating that the constructed nmdi is reliable to further prove the behavior and reliability of the nmdi whether the constructed nmdi could snap a historical drought was also analyzed in this study five years 1978 1980 1995 1997 and 2000 were selected that had recorded severe or extreme drought occurrences wang et al 2013 chang et al 2016 the comparisons of whether pap sdi mpdsi midi and nmdi could snap these droughts are shown in table 8 table 8 shows that the constructed nmdi basically captures more recorded severe or extreme drought occurrences than the pap sdi mpdsi and midi that indicates the nmdi can better reflect the complex multivariate natural variables among these five drought indices the fewest amount of droughts are captured based on the pap the reason may be that the pap only considers one variable precipitation rather than multivariate variables based on the outlined above the constructed nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi has a good reliability and it can identify multivariate drought types meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts at the same time in addition it can basically capture more recorded drought occurrences indicating that the nmdi provides a fuller picture than other drought indices 4 4 multivariate analysis of the drought risk based on the runs theory in section 3 2 drought events regarding three drought characteristics the drought duration d drought peak p and drought severity s were identified based on the nmdi in the five partitions and the wrb as a whole there were 90 98 80 83 85 and 83 drought events in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb respectively the drought peak severity and duration of these drought events in five partitions are shown in table 9 table 9 shows that the maximum drought duration in the brb is the shortest at 8 months and that the maximum drought severity of 0 79 is relatively smaller than those in other partitions indicating that droughts in the brb are relatively less serious however the maximum drought duration in the mwrb is the longest 17 months while the maximum drought peak of 0 1 is relatively higher and maximum drought severity of 1 5 is the highest showing that droughts in the mwrb are very serious droughts in the uwrb and jrb are also very serious on the whole drought in the wei river basin is a significant issue to better analyze the drought risk regarding three drought characteristics duration peak and severity to better plan and manage water resources alleviate the drought and develop drought warning systems the four families of 3 dimensional copulas function were also employed to inquire into the multivariate drought risk i e the joint exceedance possibility first it was necessary to derive the optimal marginal distribution functions of the duration peak and severity based on eight marginal distribution functions in the five partitions and the wrb the calculation method is similar with that shown in table 4 the results show that the optimal marginal distribution functions for the duration severity and peak in the jrb are rayleigh beta and normal respectively rayleigh gamma and generalized pareto fit the duration severity and peak in the brb best respectively rayleigh gamma and generalized pareto are most appropriate to fit duration severity and peak in the uwrb respectively the best fit marginal distribution functions of the duration severity and peak in the mwrb are rayleigh log normal and normal respectively the optimal marginal distribution functions for the duration severity and peak in the lwrb are rayleigh log normal and generalized pareto respectively in the wrb rayleigh generalized pareto and generalized pareto fit the duration severity and peak best respectively after confirming the optimal marginal distribution functions and parameters of the drought duration peak and severity four families of 3 dimensional archimedean copulas including gumbel amh clayton and frank were employed to derive the multivariate drought risk the calculation process is similar with that in section 4 2 the gof criteria results of four copulas functions and their corresponding optimal parameters to derive the multivariate drought risk in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin are shown in table 10 table 10 shows that in the jrb three evaluation indices of the gumbel are lowest with rmse 0 0718 ols 0 0714 and aic 203 8990 showing that the gumbel with parameter θ 3 1731 is best to construct the joint distribution of three drought characteristics the duration peak and severity similarly optimal 3 dimensional archimedean copulas functions used to construct the joint distribution of three drought characteristics are frank frank gumbel frank and frank in the brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb respectively next the multivariate drought risks in the five partitions and the whole wei river basin were calculated based on eq 15 optimal marginal distribution functions of three drought characteristics optimal copulas functions and its optimal parameters shown in table 10 the multivariate slice map of the drought risk is shown in fig 8 the multivariate isosurfaces of the drought risk are shown in fig 9 fig 8 is used to analyze how the multivariate drought risk reacts to the variation of the drought duration peak and severity fig 8 shows the slice map of multivariate drought risk under the conditions pd 0 25 pd 0 5 pd 0 75 pp 0 25 pp 0 5 pp 0 75 ps 0 25 ps 0 5 and ps 0 75 pd pp and ps are the theoretical cumulative probability of the drought duration peak and severity respectively the higher the ps is the greater the drought severity the higher the pd is the longer the drought duration the higher the pp is the greater the drought peak the color represents the multivariate drought risk possibility values fig 8 shows that the law of drought risk in the five partitions and the wrb is similar taking the jrb as an example and keeping the pd and pp constant for example when pd 0 25 and pp 0 the higher the ps is the lower the multivariate drought risk similarly with the increase of pd or the pp multivariate drought risk declines the multivariate drought risk negatively correlated with the cumulative probability of the duration peak and severity this result indicates that the more severe the drought the lower the multivariate drought risk it also indicates that the more serious the duration peak and severity the less likely is the occurrence of a corresponding drought event fig 9 shows the multivariate isosurfaces when pre 0 1 pre is the 3 dimensional i e multivariate drought risk possibility pre 0 2 pre 0 3 pre 0 4 pre 0 5 pre 0 6 pre 0 7 pre 0 8 and pre 0 9 it shows the isosurfaces of multivariate drought risk from the viewing angle it also illustrates that when cumulative probability of duration peak and severity increases the multivariate drought risk declines which agrees with fig 8 it also indicates that the likely occurrence drought possibility of severe or extreme droughts is lower than that of light droughts therefore in practice more attention should be paid to the slight or moderate drought events in this study multivariate drought risks under two scenarios scenario 1 droughts more likely to happen p d 2 p 0 05 s 0 05 scenario 2 droughts less likely to happen p d 4 p 0 075 s 0 1 in the five partitions are demonstrated in fig 10 fig 10 shows that for scenario 1 the multivariate drought risks in the jrb uwrb mwrb brb and lwrb are 0 59 0 68 0 65 0 50 and 0 48 respectively for scenario 2 the multivariate drought risks in the jrb uwrb mwrb brb and lwrb are 0 10 0 24 0 30 0 14 and 0 12 respectively the likely occurrence drought possibilities of scenario 1 in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher than those in the other partitions the likely occurrence drought possibilities of scenario 2 in the uwrb and mwrb are higher than those in the other partitions the multivariate drought risks in the uwrb mwrb and jrb are relatively higher than those in the other partitions this indicates that for a given duration peak and severity the likely occurrence drought possibilities in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher this result is in accordance with the drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi in figs 6 and 7 the reason why the drought frequency and multivariate drought risk in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are shown as follows from the angle of the terrain the geomorphology in the jrb is mainly loess the soil texture is relatively coarse and the vegetation is rare leading to poor water retention moreover the jrb is the main source of the sediment of the yellow river the soil and water losses in the jrb are the most serious in the wei river basin with regards to climate precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and it is not easy to store in addition evapotranspiration is larger due to abundant sunshine therefore the capacity to resist drought in the jrb is low many important cities such as xi an xianyang and tianshui are located in uwrb and mwrb and many studies have stated that due to human activities and climate variation runoff in these cities has markedly declined chang et al 2014 2016 more importantly the increasing number of people moving to these cities has resulted in a sharp increase of water demand at the same time evaporation has increased due to the rising temperature these factors all lead to the higher drought risks in the uwrb and mwrb the wei river basin is facing a serious drought risk which will compromise the basin s sustainable development therefore relevant government departments should take greater measures regarding early drought warning and drought relief to better prevent and control the droughts 5 conclusions previous research mainly focused on constructing the composite drought index to analyze multivariate drought characteristics based on the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices in this study a nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi was constructed based on the multidimensional archimedean copulas then based on the constructed nmdi and runs theory drought events regarding three drought characteristics drought duration peak and severity were identified multivariate drought risks were also assessed in the wei river basin for better drought early warning and relief the main conclusions are as follows 1 the nmdi was constructed to derive the joint distribution of three drought indices pap sdi and mpdsi based on their optimal marginal distribution functions and the nmdi formula the nmdi formula was computed according to the optimal parameters and corresponding joint distribution function of the optimal copulas results show that the most appropriate multidimensional copulas functions to construct the nonlinear multivariate drought index nmdi in the jrb brb uwrb mwrb lwrb and wrb are gumbel frank frank gumbel gumbel and gumbel respectively 2 correlation coefficients between the nmdi and single drought index are mostly over 0 7 indicating that the nmdi can reflect the comprehensive meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought properties simultaneously this suggests that the copulas can solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among different drought indices in addition the margin free characteristics are completely preserved by the copulas function when constructing the joint distribution function 3 drought frequency analysis based on the nmdi is consistent with the pap sdi mpdsi and midi moreover the nmdi is basically more sensitive to capture more historical recorded drought occurrences indicating that the nmdi is reliable and superior 4 drought risk shows a spatial variation for scenario 1 droughts more likely to happen the drought risks in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher for scenario 2 droughts less likely to happen the drought risks in the uwrb and mwrb are higher this indicates that the likely occurrence drought possibilities in the jrb uwrb and mwrb are higher 5 although the wrb is selected as the study area the constructed nmdi can also be applied in other regions how to assess the impacts of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts on society and the economy is the priority of our next study in addition more drought characteristics will be considered for better drought risk assessment acknowledgments this research is supported by

7516,for the shallow westliches leibnitzer feld aquifer 45 km2 we applied the recently developed methodology by kupfersberger et al 2017a to derive the thermal upper boundary for a 3d heat transport model from observed air temperatures we distinguished between land uses of grass and agriculture sealed surfaces forest and water bodies to represent the heat flux from heated buildings and the mixture between different land surfaces in urban areas we ran the 1d vertical heat conduction module soiltemp which is coupled to the heat transport model using feflow on a time step basis over a simulation period of 23 years the comparison between measured and observed groundwater temperatures yielded nse values ranging from 0 41 to 0 92 including readings at different depths the model results showed that the thermal input signals lead to distinctly different vertical groundwater temperature distributions to overcome the influence of specific warm or cold years we introduced the computation of an annual averaged groundwater temperature profile with respect to the use of groundwater cooling or heating facilities we evaluated the application of vertically averaged statistical groundwater temperature distributions compared to the use of temperature distributions at selected dates we concluded that the heat transport model serves well as an aquifer scale management tool to optimize the use of the shallow subsurface for thermal purposes and to analyze the impacts of corresponding measures on groundwater temperatures keywords shallow groundwater temperature 3d subsurface heat transport model regional thermal groundwater management vertically averaged groundwater temperature time depth diagram of groundwater temperature 1 introduction the heat input into the vadose zone varies according to the ambient air temperature and the thermal characteristics of different land surfaces jansen 2005 showed the correlation between air temperature soil surface temperature and soil temperature time series at 5 cm below ground under grass pumpkin and maize at lysimeters in southeast austria herb et al 2008 presented near surface i e at 1 cm and 5 cm depth respectively soil temperature time series observed below bare soil grass corn and forest furthermore the authors matched the data by computing the unsteady heat conduction through a soil column by solving the differential heat conduction equation with spatially varying thermal properties kupfersberger et al 2017a developed a simple linear regression model to delineate the soil temperature 5 cm below ground under grass asphalt and forest from air temperature time series elevated groundwater temperatures have been observed under urban areas in many countries ferguson and woodbury 2004 zhu et al 2010 this phenomenon is mainly related to the heat flux from heated buildings and from underground infrastructure in the subsurface as well as to anthropogenic groundwater use benz et al 2015 epting et al 2017a garcía gil et al 2015 to provide a reference of groundwater temperatures epting et al 2013 computed a potential natural state of subsurface thermal conditions e g before major urbanization and without anthropogenic groundwater use for the city of basel tamiguchi et al 2007 and taylor and stefan 2009 investigated the combined effects of urbanization and global change on subsurface temperatures if groundwater is used for drinking water supply elevated groundwater temperatures may lead to undesired changes of groundwater quality because they increase bacterial growth decrease oxygen concentration and might trigger biogeochemical reactions furthermore elevated groundwater temperatures add to the temperature increase drinking water supplier observe during water distribution and water storage in urban areas personal communication given the shallow thermal subsurface conditions groundwater can be used for heating and cooling of surface structures e g residential homes business or commercial centers and for the supply of warm water by means of ground source heat pumps gshps in that context the thermal use of groundwater provides an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since it substitutes the use of fossil energy blum et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 quantified the potential heat content in urban aquifers and available capacities for space heating and found out that by decreasing the 20 m thick urban aquifer s temperature by 2 c the amount of extractable geothermal energy beneath cologne is 2 5 times the residential heating demand of the whole city thus it becomes clear that to optimize the use of the geothermal potential of an entire aquifer under legal constraints and to locally adjust the positioning and the operational mode of groundwater heat pumps an appropriate management tool is needed that is capable of addressing the temporal and spatial variation of the relevant involved parameters and drivers numerical heat transport models of the shallow subsurface have been applied on that background for some time fujii et al 2005 investigated different operational schemes to maximize the heat extraction rate from groundwater heat pumps yang et al 2010 provided a review of ground source heat pump systems and the typical simulation models in more recent modeling studies händel et al 2013 described on a regional scale the impact of future scenarios for heating and cooling purposes of large groundwater heat pumps on groundwater temperature changes epting et al 2013 built a 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model of the shallow groundwater body underneath the city of basel accounting for the effects of heated buildings and river groundwater interaction on groundwater temperatures herbert et al 2013 predicted the extent of thermally affected zones of the operational and proposed schemes at the top of the chalk beneath central london after 24 year of operation of ground source energy systems based on a 3d aquifer scale thermal model attard et al 2016 assessed the impact of impervious and draining underground structures on groundwater temperatures by a 20 year simulation of a 3d heat transport model at the scale of the urban area of lyon 44 km2 epting et al 2017b developed concepts for the management of thermal resources in urban areas which include the definition of thermal use goals for specific aquifer regions and discuss their transferability in this work we present an aquifer scale coupled unsaturated and saturated 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model for the alluvial westliches leibnitzer feld wlf aquifer in southeast austria we advance the current modeling state because we simulate the combined thermal effects of different land uses such as grass and agriculture forest asphalt and heated buildings over a 23 year period we use the resulting groundwater temperature distributions to delineate aquifer thermal conditions that can be used to define preferred zones for heating and or cooling purposes and of zones where heating or cooling use should be limited to avoid future adverse groundwater conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 investigation area the investigation area wlf see fig 1 is located approximately 30 km south of graz austria and has a size of 44 km2 fig 1 also shows the location of the 11 wells where groundwater temperature is observed at observation wells where the numbering starts with 6002 groundwater temperature is observed at different depths the hydrogeological characteristics of the area have already been depicted in klammler et al 2013 and händel et al 2013 the wlf aquifer comprises quaternary gravel with an average thickness of 8 m groundwater recharge in the investigation area is mainly provided by infiltrating precipitation without any predominant periods for groundwater recharge the average groundwater depth is approximately 3 5 m aquifer hydraulic conductivities vary between 1 10 4 m s 1 and 7 10 3 m s 1 the mean annual precipitation is 938 mm with a maximum in august 125 mm and a minimum in january 28 mm while the average annual air temperature is 10 5 c monitoring period 1991 2016 the wlf is intensively used for agriculture at present approximately 54 of the investigation area is arable land mainly for the cultivating of maize oil pumpkin and wheat 28 of the investigation area is used for residential purposes and 14 as forest 2 2 description of 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model for wlf aquifer groundwater heat transport is simulated on the basis of the groundwater flow and transport model of the wlf aquifer described in klammler et al 2013 they set up a 2d groundwater model using the finite element simulation code feflow diersch 2009 covering the time period between 1993 and 2009 which has recently been extended to 2015 kupfersberger et al 2017b for computation of daily groundwater recharge different approaches were applied distinguishing between agriculture forest grass and residential areas for more details see klammler et al 2013 to represent shallow subsurface heat transport this model has additionally been expanded in the vertical dimension resulting into 24 layers 309 100 nodes und 575 064 finite elements the 3d numerical model is operated using the phreatic option in feflow for saturated groundwater flow in the wlf aquifer several drinking water wells are in operation total extraction rate on average about 100 l s see also klammler et al 2013 which were incorporated in the model the same groundwater level observation network for flow calibration as described in klammler et al 2013 was used and an equivalent calibration quality achieved thus lateral groundwater flows are implicitly considered in the flow calibration the 3d approach is needed to describe the groundwater temperature distribution and is not due to vertical layering that affect groundwater flow thus we employed an isotropic conductivity distribution moreover no variation of soil thermal properties in the model domain is considered we uniformly applied the thermal properties of the most common soil type of the wlf aquifer which were derived from soil temperature data monitored under grass at the wagna lysimeter kupfersberger et al 2017a b a sand layer was implemented underneath the top soil to complete the representation of the vadose zone in the unsaturated zone only heat conduction is considered in kupfersberger et al 2017a b it was argued that heat conduction dominates heat convection in the unsaturated zone of the wlf aquifer in the saturated zone heat conduction and convection is computed groundwater recharge values were implemented as sources of flow at the layer where the actual groundwater level is located derivation of the upper thermal boundary condition is described in detail in kupfersberger et al 2017a for agriculture grass forest sealed surfaces and gravel dredgings the near surface soil temperature time series i e 5 cm below surface were inferred from the measured air temperature by fitting a linear regression model for the wlf heat transport model the air temperature measured at the wagna station was used for location see fig 1 the fit between measured and computed near surface soil temperature time series under different land uses along with air temperature characteristics is shown in detail in kupfersberger et al 2017a additionally we constantly applied the current land use distribution as displayed in fig 1 over the entire simulation period 1993 2015 obviously over the 20 years the land use didn t stay exactly the same most notably suburban parts i e single family homes and commercial areas grew modestly on the cost of agricultural land whereas forest and gravel dredgings areas mainly remained unchanged thus we slightly overestimate the heat input because the heat input under heated basements and sealed surfaces into the subsurface is larger than under agricultural land however we consider the impact of this simplification as negligible for the groundwater temperature development at the regional scale if a finite element includes several land uses the resulting near surface soil temperature time series is calculated as a weighted average according to the proportions of the existing land use categories the aquitard was implemented in the 3d heat transport model extending over 3 bottom layers with a constant heat flux of 0 8 w m 2 as lower thermal boundary condition for the surface water boundary conditions river mur in the east and rivers sulm and laβnitz in the west measured water temperatures at the river mur gauge 3397 in graz were used which fluctuate between 0 c and 24 3 c initial conditions of groundwater level and groundwater temperature were derived from monitoring data just before the start of the simulation period level and from the average of monitored data during the simulation period temperature respectively table 1 summarizes the subsurface heat properties applied 2 3 direct coupling between soiltemp and feflow heat flux in the subsurface from heated buildings is computed with the 1d vertical heat conduction model soiltemp for a more detailed description see kupfersberger et al 2017a groundwater level and groundwater temperature of the previous time step from feflow are used as bottom boundary conditions for computation of the heat flux of the current time step with soiltemp and then implemented as source of heat at 3 m below ground in feflow with this direct coupling between soiltemp and feflow the actual distance and temperature gradient between the heated basement and the groundwater level are explicitly considered we assume that for residential areas i e mainly the city of leibnitz with about 12 000 inhabitants the entire heated basement per building extends to 2 5 m below ground the distribution of buildings is available by means of a gis layer provided by the administration of the province of styria with this approach we avoid implementing each building into the regional 3d finite element model which would lead to long computational times and or numerical instabilities in computing the corresponding heat fluxes if different land uses including heated buildings exist within a finite element soiltemp is also applied to compute the heat transfer in the unsaturated zone for the other land uses e g sealed surfaces grass in this element fig 2 shows the distribution of buildings percentages within the elements of the computational mesh for the center part of the wlf aquifer the highest buildings percentages between 50 and 60 occur in the city center of leibnitz along the major streets the resulting heat fluxes from these elements into the groundwater body are weighted according to the proportions of the existing land use categories per element 3 results fig 3 shows the multiyear comparison between observed and computed groundwater temperature at observation wells 3808 wagna and 38144 the x axes show different time periods in parts since the observation started later or ended earlier at given observation wells simulated groundwater temperatures are shown for the slices that best approximate the depths of the temperature sensor in the corresponding wells which are 4 3 m below ground at well 3808 8 0 m at well wagna and 3 0 m at well 38144 respectively the measured data do not show any significant increase in groundwater temperatures in the observed time periods only at the observation well wagna downstream of leibnitz area an increase of the annual maximum temperature between 2011 and 2015 from 14 c to 15 c can be seen with respect to temperature extremes and the timing of the annual temperature cycles the match between observed and simulated time series can be generally described as good resulting in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between 0 77 and 0 92 at observation well 3808 annual temperature lows are overestimated in particular in the years 2006 2008 by about 1 c whereas the annual maxima are met quite well the opposite can be seen at observation well 38144 where the simulated groundwater temperature maxima underestimate the observed values between 0 8 c and 1 8 c in the years 1994 1998 though the groundwater temperature minima are matched quite well at the observation well wagna the observed groundwater temperatures fluctuate between about 10 c and 15 c compared to the observation wells 3808 and 38144 with temperature minima of approximately 7 c and 6 c respectively the temperature lows at well wagna are considerably higher which is due to the larger depth 8 m below ground of the monitoring device the simulated groundwater temperatures at the wagna well are generally lower than the observed values including the minima and maxima leading to a 0 5 c lower average temperature fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated groundwater temperature time series at observation well 6002612 in 5 m and 7 m below ground from 1993 to 1999 it can be seen that the observed temperature extremes both decrease with increasing depth by about 0 5 c the average groundwater temperature is the same in both depths the simulated groundwater temperatures overestimate the observed temperatures in both depths the nse value is significantly higher in 5 m below ground compared to 7 m i e 0 76 versus 0 41 which is mainly due to the better match in 5 m depth during the time period from 1996 to 1999 the improvement of the matches between observed and simulated time series at both depths in this time period may be related to the fact that the use of the current land use during the entire simulation period at observation well 6002612 leads to an overestimation of observed groundwater temperatures in the time span between 1993 and 1995 but better resembles the land use impact on groundwater temperatures from 1996 onwards fig 5 presents the distribution of the vertical averaged weighted by the thickness per layer groundwater temperatures for different conditions i median p50 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node ii p97 5 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node and iii groundwater temperature at july 31st 2009 these conditions were selected to represent aquifer conditions if cooling demand in buildings can be supposed due to high air temperatures the year 2009 was chosen because it represents average groundwater temperature characteristics see also figs 7 and 8 white areas indicate that the aquifer falls dry at some moment s during the simulation period we didn t include average groundwater temperatures for these locations in the maps to avoid showing temperature classifications that are based on different numbers of samples the median groundwater temperature distribution shows values between 12 c and 14 c in areas where buildings are present and mainly values between 10 c and 12 c in the remaining regions of the wlf aquifer analyzing the groundwater temperature distribution at the p97 5 percentile level shows in general an increase of the temperatures by 2 c and even by 4 c downstream of the city of leibnitz due to the influence of heated buildings while the temperature pattern doesn t change moreover isolated patches downstream of the gravel dredgings and the city of leibnitz can be identified where the groundwater temperature increases to values between 16 c and 22 c at the selected date the occurrence of the isolated patches of high i e 16 c groundwater temperatures and downstream of the city of leibnitz is similar to the distribution at the p97 5 percentile however upstream of the city of leibnitz the groundwater temperatures at july 31st 2009 look like the temperature distribution of the median groundwater distribution while within the city of leibnitz the groundwater temperatures vary between 12 c and 16 c fig 6 shows the distribution of vertical averaged groundwater temperatures for the following conditions i groundwater temperature at january 31st 2009 ii p2 5 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node and iii median of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node i e same image as shown on the left hand side in fig 5 these conditions were selected to represent aquifer conditions if heating demand in buildings can be supposed due to low air temperatures at january 31st 2009 only in the city areas of leibnitz and leitring and downstream of the gravel dredgings the vertically averaged groundwater temperatures exceeds 12 c in the shallow aquifer regions near the southern river model boundaries the groundwater temperatures decrease to values between 4 c and 8 c north of the city of leibnitz the distribution pattern of the groundwater temperatures is in general similar to the median groundwater temperature conditions at the p2 5 percentile groundwater temperature distribution the temperatures vary in large areas between 8 c and 10 c including parts of the city of leibnitz the areal extends of groundwater temperatures below 8 c and also below 6 c increase along the model boundaries in the southern part of the wlf aquifer where the groundwater level is closer to the surface than in other model regions the groundwater temperature exceeds 10 c only in small areas in fig 7 the changes of subsurface temperatures i e in the unsaturated zone based on sole modeling of heat conduction and in the saturated zone based on heat conduction and convection modeling with depth at observation wells 3802 wg and 38144 are shown between 2006 and 2010 it can be noticed that the temperature distribution patterns change more with location than between years at observation well 3802 near surface soil temperatures do not fall below 6 c and the impact of the low air temperatures can t be seen before january near surface soil temperatures in summer rarely exceed 16 c subsurface temperatures below 10 c extend to depths between 6 m and 8 m below ground cooling and heating of the subsurface is much more pronounced at observation well wg which is located on the edge of a dry excavation pit i e small distance to groundwater level and downstream of the city of leibnitz near surface soil temperatures vary between less than 2 c and more than 22 c in almost every year between 2006 and 2010 with the exemption of 2007 subsurface temperatures fall below 4 c at 2 m depth and below 10 c at 8 m depth below ground respectively in summer temperatures above 16 c are reached in 3 m depth at observation well 38144 the effect of decreasing the subsurface temperatures with increasing depth during wintertime is even more pronounced than in well wg which is related to the influence of infiltrating surface water from the river mur the combination of land cover and groundwater flow conditions leads to an overall lower average groundwater temperature of 10 6 c at observation well 38144 compared to 11 9 c at well wg fig 8 exhibits the change of the subsurface temperature with depth at observation well wagna as annual average over the entire simulation period the average groundwater level is about 3 8 m below the surface at observation well wagna and shows only an annual fluctuation of approximately 15 cm for a typical year it can be seen that subsurface temperatures below 10 c reach to depths of about 7 m in april and temperatures above 14 c reach to depths of about 4 5 m in september with the multiyear average effects of distinct periods e g temperatures below 10 c reach a depth of almost 8 m in 2006 or temperatures above 14 c reach a depth of 7 5 m in 2009 not shown here on the subsurface temperature distribution can be eliminated this analysis may be valuable for management or design purposes 4 discussion with our approach to regional heat transport modeling in shallow aquifers we consider the combined effects of different land use and demonstrated that the resulting subsurface temperature distribution exhibits distinct 3d features the results are based on the assumption of an isotropic conductivity distribution and the use of only the thermal properties of the most common soil type this implementation relates to the fact that neither hydraulic gradients nor relevant sediment layers are observed in the wlf aquifer moreover thermal properties of different soil types were not determined however as indicated by öwav regelblatt 207 öwav 2008 thermal properties of clay silt sand and gravel differ only by small margins so that the effect of different soil types on groundwater temperatures are regarded as of minor importance compared to other varying parameters like near surface soil temperatures the specific impacts of these assumptions on the groundwater temperature distributions could be quantified by a sensitivity study to utilize the modeling results for aquifer thermal management we propose the computation of groundwater temperature distribution maps which are based on statistical analysis of the vertical averaged groundwater temperature time series and of the local subsurface temperature profile which shows the temperature change with depth averaged over an evaluation period 4 1 local subsurface temperature profiles at the observation well wagna we observe a spread of the subsurface temperature between the near ground surface and the top of the aquitard from above 20 c to below 12 c in a representative summer and from below 2 c to 10 c in a representative winter the temperature spread is cut by half at the top of the aquitard to between just above 10 c at the end of april to about 13 c at the end of october the groundwater temperature near the groundwater level varies between above 15 c in the middle of september to just above 8 c at the end of february the annual averaged groundwater temperatures illustrate that the demand for cooling and heating and the distribution of high and low groundwater temperatures occur at significantly different times furthermore the typical use pattern of gshps intensifies the natural temperature signal over the aquifer thickness favorable operational conditions for gshps exist if high cooling demand end of july coincides with low groundwater temperatures middle of april or if high heating demand end of january concurs with high groundwater temperatures end of september in the contrary least favorable conditions exist if high cooling demand coincides with high groundwater temperatures or if high heating demand concurs with low groundwater temperatures from a groundwater protection point of view reinjecting of heated water has to be evaluated so that maximum groundwater temperatures are not exceeded this depends mainly on the ratio of groundwater discharge and reinjection volume at the location of the reinjection assuming that the first is typically larger than the second a considerable increase of the groundwater temperature after mixing may be exceptional but already warmed up regions e g vertically averaged groundwater temperatures above 16 c at the p97 5 level could be excluded from reinjection of heated water as precautionary measure the austrian regulation öwav regelblatt 207 öwav 2008 specifies that at the location of reinjection the resulting groundwater temperature i e after mixing of the ambient and the thermally altered groundwater may neither exceed 20 c nor fall below 5 c in switzerland the maximum allowed temperature difference induced from geothermal energy use is 3 k down gradient of thermal groundwater use in relation to a natural state of groundwater temperatures without anthropogenic influence epting et al 2013 4 2 2d maps of groundwater temperature distribution to facilitate the use of the simulated 3d groundwater temperature data we evaluated different maps of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions including distributions of groundwater temperature for the p2 5 p50 and the p97 5 percentile and for specific dates 31st of january and 31st of july we found that the temperature distributions at the two specific dates representing demand situations i e cooling in summer and heating in winter compare more favorable to the median groundwater temperature distribution than to the extreme percentile distribution for example the vertically averaged groundwater temperature at the observation well wagna changes from between 8 and 10 c at the p2 5 percentile over 10 12 c for median conditions and at 31 01 2019 to 12 14 c at 31 07 2019 and reaches 14 16 c at the p97 5 percentile the groundwater temperature distribution at the selected dates resembles median conditions in particular in the aquifer area north of the city of leibnitz and the city area itself which is where the distance from surface to groundwater level is larger correspondingly median groundwater temperatures vary little in these regions i e maximum one temperature class up or down the extend of the spread between the p2 5 and p97 5 percentile groundwater temperature distributions i e from 10 to 12 c to 14 16 c in the leibnitz urban area are similar to that in regions with other land use in the northern part of the wlf aquifer but considerably less than the temperature variations in areas with shallow groundwater levels i e riverside forests thus the model results show a stabilizing impact on an elevated groundwater temperature level because of the heat fluxes from heated buildings this effect is less pronounced compared to the basel case study epting et al 2017b because the average building percentage per spatial discretization unit in the urban areas is only about 20 and the heated buildings don t reach into the groundwater of the wlf aquifer typical anthropogenic thermal groundwater use in the wlf aquifer is related to single family homes with very low pumping rates of heat pumps i e less than 0 1 l s the effects of this use on the groundwater temperature can t be resolved with a regional heat transport model however kupfersberger 2009 and händel et al 2013 have shown that the impacts of much larger i e more than 10 times larger anthropogenic thermal groundwater uses on the groundwater temperature distribution is locally limited due to the diffuse heat input situation in the wlf aquifer lateral thermal plumes could only be observed downstream of the gravel dredgings however because the water temperature in the gravel dredgings is driven by air temperature variations no steady state groundwater temperature conditions were reached because of the delay of heat propagation into the depth vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions at specific dates show less extreme temperatures than statistical defined states there is always a shift between the date of highest demand and the least favorable conditions for heating of about 2 5 months 31st of january to the middle of april and for cooling of about 2 months 31st of july to the end of september at observation well wagna see fig 8 to analyze the groundwater thermal potential from a conservative perspective we thus recommend to use the p2 5 percentile distribution to evaluate heating conditions and the p97 5 percentile distribution to evaluate cooling conditions the distributions of the two extreme percentile conditions clearly show areas of small distances between surface and groundwater level along the southern model boundaries where riverside forests dominate this finding is more evident for cold conditions i e p2 5 percentile however in this model area we have no observation wells for groundwater temperature so that the simulated groundwater temperature distribution could not be validated against measurements groundwater head calibration quality in this region is unremarkable klammler et al 2013 surface water infiltrates locally depending on head gradients as indicated by herbert et al 2013 epting et al 2013 and attard et al 2016 it is common practice to show resulting groundwater temperature distributions in 2d illustrations for a particular date however any 2d map of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions at a given time will simplify local temperature variations which becomes evident if the groundwater temperature variation at well wagna fig 8 should be represented by just one number yet the use of the vertically averaged groundwater temperatures might be sufficient if mean estimates of aquifer thermal potential or mean impacts of thermal use on groundwater temperatures are needed to take full advantage of the time space distributed results of a 3d heat transport models the use of more sophisticated postprocessing approaches like shown in figs 5 8 is proposed 4 3 multiyear heat transport simulations only a combination of i the vertically averaged groundwater temperature distribution and ii the depth variation of groundwater temperature within a year both averaged over a sufficient long time period will provide representative information about the 3d time space behavior of groundwater temperature looking at the time series of groundwater temperature in the wlf aquifer see fig 3 at first glance one might argue that a multiyear simulation of heat transport is not necessary because the seasonal temperature cycles do not substantially change from year to year at a closer look variations of the groundwater temperature extremes can be recognized at the observation wells 38144 and wagna moreover the data just show the groundwater temperature variations in a given depth multilevel temperature sensors are the exception in the wlf aquifer thus the heat transport model provides additional information compared to what is observed in the subsurface this can be seen at well wg in fig 7 which reveals that the 10 c and the 14 c groundwater temperature isotherms vary in the 5 year period by 3 m i e from 2006 to 2007 and from 2006 to 2009 respectively in contrast epting et al 2013 run their 3d heat transport model for the city of basel just within 2010 this is related to the fact that the distance between the ground surface and the groundwater level is at least 10 m or larger so that the impact of temperature variations at the surface is averaged out during heat conduction through the unsaturated zone the authors also demonstrate this situation by their groundwater temperature calibration results where observations from multilevel wells show individual trends but no seasonal characteristics in the wlf aquifer the distance between the ground surface and the groundwater level is much smaller on average about 3 5 m so that the impact of cold winters or hot summers on the groundwater thermal regime is more pronounced see fig 7 than in the basel case this is also confirmed by the distinct differences between the median and the 2 5 percentile and 97 5 percentile groundwater temperature distributions in the riverside forest areas showing shallow groundwater levels furthermore a multiyear calibrated groundwater flow and heat transport model is more robust against possible feedbacks between hydraulic and thermal processes the groundwater temperature is the result of a nonlinear interaction between different variables e g land surface air temperature distance from surface to groundwater level groundwater temperature anthropogenic thermal subsurface use additionally statistical defined groundwater temperature conditions like the 2 5 or the 97 5 percentile have a wider and thus more reliable foundation if based on multiyear simulations in the context of predictions multiyear heat transport models provide an undisputable basis to assess the impact of transient anthropogenic use of the aquifer geothermal potential kupfersberger et al 2017a have shown that the average air temperature at observation well wagna has risen between the periods of 2005 2008 and 2009 2013 from 10 2 c to 10 7 c including an increase of the maximum daily average temperature from 26 5 c to 28 6 c this effect is accordingly considered in the heat transport model of the wlf aquifer by means of the definition of the upper thermal boundary conditions in the heat transport model of the wlf aquifer we applied current data from the regional administration to delineate numbers and extent of heated buildings along with the assumption of an average basement depth of 2 5 m and recent land use information for all other uses there is no evidence of heated basements reaching into the groundwater body in the riverside forest areas exhibiting shallow groundwater levels almost no housing exists the current land use pattern was kept constant during the simulation of the past period so that we did not account for any changes however because of the distance between the ground and the groundwater level being the most important driver for groundwater temperature development the assumption of constant land use distribution does not significantly influence the computation of groundwater temperatures hence the additional effort for a multiyear heat transport model compared to a one year model was reasonable in the case of the wlf aquifer 5 conclusions a 3d heat transport model for a shallow aquifer in southeastern austria was calibrated against numerous groundwater temperature time series between 1993 and 2015 distributed heat input functions for different land use classes i e grass forest asphalt agriculture were used that were inferred from air temperature data following a linear regression approach described in kupfersberger et al 2017a b heat fluxes from heated basements were considered by linking the 1d heat conduction module soiltemp with the heat transport simulation model feflow on a time step basis to condense the 3d spatial and temporal variation of the simulated groundwater temperatures we suggest the use of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions for different temperature conditions and the computation of an annual vertical subsurface temperature profile averaged over the simulation period with these analysis tools we demonstrated that the typical groundwater temperature profile in the wlf aquifer shows a seasonal cycle that will be emphasized by common use of ground source heat pumps i e cooling in summer and heating in winter moreover aquifer subregions could be identified where additional groundwater use for cooling purposes may lead to undesirable high groundwater temperatures or where already low groundwater temperatures may limit the economic use of gshps for heating the distributions of vertically averaged groundwater temperatures for different temperature conditions reveal regions in which the shallow groundwater level dominates the groundwater temperature regime leading to a large spread between temperature extremes compared to areas in which the temperature regime is more influenced by the prevailing land use significantly increased groundwater temperatures underneath the city of leibnitz were not observed probably related to the small population number however groundwater temperatures showed the least fluctuations on a slightly elevated level the assumption of using the current land use for the entire simulation period did not meaningfully influence the computed groundwater temperatures during the simulation period for administration and planners the proposed analysis tools e g groundwater temperature distribution maps for defined temperature conditions vertical groundwater temperature distribution averaged over a multiyear period provide very detailed information about the groundwater temperature time space behavior to avoid detrimental effects to the thermal regime of shallow aquifers while at the same time enhancing the positioning and operation of gshps acknowledgements funding for this work has been provided by the austrian ministry for transport innovation and technology bmvit through the zielvereinbarungsprojekt

7516,for the shallow westliches leibnitzer feld aquifer 45 km2 we applied the recently developed methodology by kupfersberger et al 2017a to derive the thermal upper boundary for a 3d heat transport model from observed air temperatures we distinguished between land uses of grass and agriculture sealed surfaces forest and water bodies to represent the heat flux from heated buildings and the mixture between different land surfaces in urban areas we ran the 1d vertical heat conduction module soiltemp which is coupled to the heat transport model using feflow on a time step basis over a simulation period of 23 years the comparison between measured and observed groundwater temperatures yielded nse values ranging from 0 41 to 0 92 including readings at different depths the model results showed that the thermal input signals lead to distinctly different vertical groundwater temperature distributions to overcome the influence of specific warm or cold years we introduced the computation of an annual averaged groundwater temperature profile with respect to the use of groundwater cooling or heating facilities we evaluated the application of vertically averaged statistical groundwater temperature distributions compared to the use of temperature distributions at selected dates we concluded that the heat transport model serves well as an aquifer scale management tool to optimize the use of the shallow subsurface for thermal purposes and to analyze the impacts of corresponding measures on groundwater temperatures keywords shallow groundwater temperature 3d subsurface heat transport model regional thermal groundwater management vertically averaged groundwater temperature time depth diagram of groundwater temperature 1 introduction the heat input into the vadose zone varies according to the ambient air temperature and the thermal characteristics of different land surfaces jansen 2005 showed the correlation between air temperature soil surface temperature and soil temperature time series at 5 cm below ground under grass pumpkin and maize at lysimeters in southeast austria herb et al 2008 presented near surface i e at 1 cm and 5 cm depth respectively soil temperature time series observed below bare soil grass corn and forest furthermore the authors matched the data by computing the unsteady heat conduction through a soil column by solving the differential heat conduction equation with spatially varying thermal properties kupfersberger et al 2017a developed a simple linear regression model to delineate the soil temperature 5 cm below ground under grass asphalt and forest from air temperature time series elevated groundwater temperatures have been observed under urban areas in many countries ferguson and woodbury 2004 zhu et al 2010 this phenomenon is mainly related to the heat flux from heated buildings and from underground infrastructure in the subsurface as well as to anthropogenic groundwater use benz et al 2015 epting et al 2017a garcía gil et al 2015 to provide a reference of groundwater temperatures epting et al 2013 computed a potential natural state of subsurface thermal conditions e g before major urbanization and without anthropogenic groundwater use for the city of basel tamiguchi et al 2007 and taylor and stefan 2009 investigated the combined effects of urbanization and global change on subsurface temperatures if groundwater is used for drinking water supply elevated groundwater temperatures may lead to undesired changes of groundwater quality because they increase bacterial growth decrease oxygen concentration and might trigger biogeochemical reactions furthermore elevated groundwater temperatures add to the temperature increase drinking water supplier observe during water distribution and water storage in urban areas personal communication given the shallow thermal subsurface conditions groundwater can be used for heating and cooling of surface structures e g residential homes business or commercial centers and for the supply of warm water by means of ground source heat pumps gshps in that context the thermal use of groundwater provides an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since it substitutes the use of fossil energy blum et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 quantified the potential heat content in urban aquifers and available capacities for space heating and found out that by decreasing the 20 m thick urban aquifer s temperature by 2 c the amount of extractable geothermal energy beneath cologne is 2 5 times the residential heating demand of the whole city thus it becomes clear that to optimize the use of the geothermal potential of an entire aquifer under legal constraints and to locally adjust the positioning and the operational mode of groundwater heat pumps an appropriate management tool is needed that is capable of addressing the temporal and spatial variation of the relevant involved parameters and drivers numerical heat transport models of the shallow subsurface have been applied on that background for some time fujii et al 2005 investigated different operational schemes to maximize the heat extraction rate from groundwater heat pumps yang et al 2010 provided a review of ground source heat pump systems and the typical simulation models in more recent modeling studies händel et al 2013 described on a regional scale the impact of future scenarios for heating and cooling purposes of large groundwater heat pumps on groundwater temperature changes epting et al 2013 built a 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model of the shallow groundwater body underneath the city of basel accounting for the effects of heated buildings and river groundwater interaction on groundwater temperatures herbert et al 2013 predicted the extent of thermally affected zones of the operational and proposed schemes at the top of the chalk beneath central london after 24 year of operation of ground source energy systems based on a 3d aquifer scale thermal model attard et al 2016 assessed the impact of impervious and draining underground structures on groundwater temperatures by a 20 year simulation of a 3d heat transport model at the scale of the urban area of lyon 44 km2 epting et al 2017b developed concepts for the management of thermal resources in urban areas which include the definition of thermal use goals for specific aquifer regions and discuss their transferability in this work we present an aquifer scale coupled unsaturated and saturated 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model for the alluvial westliches leibnitzer feld wlf aquifer in southeast austria we advance the current modeling state because we simulate the combined thermal effects of different land uses such as grass and agriculture forest asphalt and heated buildings over a 23 year period we use the resulting groundwater temperature distributions to delineate aquifer thermal conditions that can be used to define preferred zones for heating and or cooling purposes and of zones where heating or cooling use should be limited to avoid future adverse groundwater conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 investigation area the investigation area wlf see fig 1 is located approximately 30 km south of graz austria and has a size of 44 km2 fig 1 also shows the location of the 11 wells where groundwater temperature is observed at observation wells where the numbering starts with 6002 groundwater temperature is observed at different depths the hydrogeological characteristics of the area have already been depicted in klammler et al 2013 and händel et al 2013 the wlf aquifer comprises quaternary gravel with an average thickness of 8 m groundwater recharge in the investigation area is mainly provided by infiltrating precipitation without any predominant periods for groundwater recharge the average groundwater depth is approximately 3 5 m aquifer hydraulic conductivities vary between 1 10 4 m s 1 and 7 10 3 m s 1 the mean annual precipitation is 938 mm with a maximum in august 125 mm and a minimum in january 28 mm while the average annual air temperature is 10 5 c monitoring period 1991 2016 the wlf is intensively used for agriculture at present approximately 54 of the investigation area is arable land mainly for the cultivating of maize oil pumpkin and wheat 28 of the investigation area is used for residential purposes and 14 as forest 2 2 description of 3d groundwater flow and heat transport model for wlf aquifer groundwater heat transport is simulated on the basis of the groundwater flow and transport model of the wlf aquifer described in klammler et al 2013 they set up a 2d groundwater model using the finite element simulation code feflow diersch 2009 covering the time period between 1993 and 2009 which has recently been extended to 2015 kupfersberger et al 2017b for computation of daily groundwater recharge different approaches were applied distinguishing between agriculture forest grass and residential areas for more details see klammler et al 2013 to represent shallow subsurface heat transport this model has additionally been expanded in the vertical dimension resulting into 24 layers 309 100 nodes und 575 064 finite elements the 3d numerical model is operated using the phreatic option in feflow for saturated groundwater flow in the wlf aquifer several drinking water wells are in operation total extraction rate on average about 100 l s see also klammler et al 2013 which were incorporated in the model the same groundwater level observation network for flow calibration as described in klammler et al 2013 was used and an equivalent calibration quality achieved thus lateral groundwater flows are implicitly considered in the flow calibration the 3d approach is needed to describe the groundwater temperature distribution and is not due to vertical layering that affect groundwater flow thus we employed an isotropic conductivity distribution moreover no variation of soil thermal properties in the model domain is considered we uniformly applied the thermal properties of the most common soil type of the wlf aquifer which were derived from soil temperature data monitored under grass at the wagna lysimeter kupfersberger et al 2017a b a sand layer was implemented underneath the top soil to complete the representation of the vadose zone in the unsaturated zone only heat conduction is considered in kupfersberger et al 2017a b it was argued that heat conduction dominates heat convection in the unsaturated zone of the wlf aquifer in the saturated zone heat conduction and convection is computed groundwater recharge values were implemented as sources of flow at the layer where the actual groundwater level is located derivation of the upper thermal boundary condition is described in detail in kupfersberger et al 2017a for agriculture grass forest sealed surfaces and gravel dredgings the near surface soil temperature time series i e 5 cm below surface were inferred from the measured air temperature by fitting a linear regression model for the wlf heat transport model the air temperature measured at the wagna station was used for location see fig 1 the fit between measured and computed near surface soil temperature time series under different land uses along with air temperature characteristics is shown in detail in kupfersberger et al 2017a additionally we constantly applied the current land use distribution as displayed in fig 1 over the entire simulation period 1993 2015 obviously over the 20 years the land use didn t stay exactly the same most notably suburban parts i e single family homes and commercial areas grew modestly on the cost of agricultural land whereas forest and gravel dredgings areas mainly remained unchanged thus we slightly overestimate the heat input because the heat input under heated basements and sealed surfaces into the subsurface is larger than under agricultural land however we consider the impact of this simplification as negligible for the groundwater temperature development at the regional scale if a finite element includes several land uses the resulting near surface soil temperature time series is calculated as a weighted average according to the proportions of the existing land use categories the aquitard was implemented in the 3d heat transport model extending over 3 bottom layers with a constant heat flux of 0 8 w m 2 as lower thermal boundary condition for the surface water boundary conditions river mur in the east and rivers sulm and laβnitz in the west measured water temperatures at the river mur gauge 3397 in graz were used which fluctuate between 0 c and 24 3 c initial conditions of groundwater level and groundwater temperature were derived from monitoring data just before the start of the simulation period level and from the average of monitored data during the simulation period temperature respectively table 1 summarizes the subsurface heat properties applied 2 3 direct coupling between soiltemp and feflow heat flux in the subsurface from heated buildings is computed with the 1d vertical heat conduction model soiltemp for a more detailed description see kupfersberger et al 2017a groundwater level and groundwater temperature of the previous time step from feflow are used as bottom boundary conditions for computation of the heat flux of the current time step with soiltemp and then implemented as source of heat at 3 m below ground in feflow with this direct coupling between soiltemp and feflow the actual distance and temperature gradient between the heated basement and the groundwater level are explicitly considered we assume that for residential areas i e mainly the city of leibnitz with about 12 000 inhabitants the entire heated basement per building extends to 2 5 m below ground the distribution of buildings is available by means of a gis layer provided by the administration of the province of styria with this approach we avoid implementing each building into the regional 3d finite element model which would lead to long computational times and or numerical instabilities in computing the corresponding heat fluxes if different land uses including heated buildings exist within a finite element soiltemp is also applied to compute the heat transfer in the unsaturated zone for the other land uses e g sealed surfaces grass in this element fig 2 shows the distribution of buildings percentages within the elements of the computational mesh for the center part of the wlf aquifer the highest buildings percentages between 50 and 60 occur in the city center of leibnitz along the major streets the resulting heat fluxes from these elements into the groundwater body are weighted according to the proportions of the existing land use categories per element 3 results fig 3 shows the multiyear comparison between observed and computed groundwater temperature at observation wells 3808 wagna and 38144 the x axes show different time periods in parts since the observation started later or ended earlier at given observation wells simulated groundwater temperatures are shown for the slices that best approximate the depths of the temperature sensor in the corresponding wells which are 4 3 m below ground at well 3808 8 0 m at well wagna and 3 0 m at well 38144 respectively the measured data do not show any significant increase in groundwater temperatures in the observed time periods only at the observation well wagna downstream of leibnitz area an increase of the annual maximum temperature between 2011 and 2015 from 14 c to 15 c can be seen with respect to temperature extremes and the timing of the annual temperature cycles the match between observed and simulated time series can be generally described as good resulting in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between 0 77 and 0 92 at observation well 3808 annual temperature lows are overestimated in particular in the years 2006 2008 by about 1 c whereas the annual maxima are met quite well the opposite can be seen at observation well 38144 where the simulated groundwater temperature maxima underestimate the observed values between 0 8 c and 1 8 c in the years 1994 1998 though the groundwater temperature minima are matched quite well at the observation well wagna the observed groundwater temperatures fluctuate between about 10 c and 15 c compared to the observation wells 3808 and 38144 with temperature minima of approximately 7 c and 6 c respectively the temperature lows at well wagna are considerably higher which is due to the larger depth 8 m below ground of the monitoring device the simulated groundwater temperatures at the wagna well are generally lower than the observed values including the minima and maxima leading to a 0 5 c lower average temperature fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated groundwater temperature time series at observation well 6002612 in 5 m and 7 m below ground from 1993 to 1999 it can be seen that the observed temperature extremes both decrease with increasing depth by about 0 5 c the average groundwater temperature is the same in both depths the simulated groundwater temperatures overestimate the observed temperatures in both depths the nse value is significantly higher in 5 m below ground compared to 7 m i e 0 76 versus 0 41 which is mainly due to the better match in 5 m depth during the time period from 1996 to 1999 the improvement of the matches between observed and simulated time series at both depths in this time period may be related to the fact that the use of the current land use during the entire simulation period at observation well 6002612 leads to an overestimation of observed groundwater temperatures in the time span between 1993 and 1995 but better resembles the land use impact on groundwater temperatures from 1996 onwards fig 5 presents the distribution of the vertical averaged weighted by the thickness per layer groundwater temperatures for different conditions i median p50 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node ii p97 5 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node and iii groundwater temperature at july 31st 2009 these conditions were selected to represent aquifer conditions if cooling demand in buildings can be supposed due to high air temperatures the year 2009 was chosen because it represents average groundwater temperature characteristics see also figs 7 and 8 white areas indicate that the aquifer falls dry at some moment s during the simulation period we didn t include average groundwater temperatures for these locations in the maps to avoid showing temperature classifications that are based on different numbers of samples the median groundwater temperature distribution shows values between 12 c and 14 c in areas where buildings are present and mainly values between 10 c and 12 c in the remaining regions of the wlf aquifer analyzing the groundwater temperature distribution at the p97 5 percentile level shows in general an increase of the temperatures by 2 c and even by 4 c downstream of the city of leibnitz due to the influence of heated buildings while the temperature pattern doesn t change moreover isolated patches downstream of the gravel dredgings and the city of leibnitz can be identified where the groundwater temperature increases to values between 16 c and 22 c at the selected date the occurrence of the isolated patches of high i e 16 c groundwater temperatures and downstream of the city of leibnitz is similar to the distribution at the p97 5 percentile however upstream of the city of leibnitz the groundwater temperatures at july 31st 2009 look like the temperature distribution of the median groundwater distribution while within the city of leibnitz the groundwater temperatures vary between 12 c and 16 c fig 6 shows the distribution of vertical averaged groundwater temperatures for the following conditions i groundwater temperature at january 31st 2009 ii p2 5 percentile of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node and iii median of groundwater temperature time series per mesh node i e same image as shown on the left hand side in fig 5 these conditions were selected to represent aquifer conditions if heating demand in buildings can be supposed due to low air temperatures at january 31st 2009 only in the city areas of leibnitz and leitring and downstream of the gravel dredgings the vertically averaged groundwater temperatures exceeds 12 c in the shallow aquifer regions near the southern river model boundaries the groundwater temperatures decrease to values between 4 c and 8 c north of the city of leibnitz the distribution pattern of the groundwater temperatures is in general similar to the median groundwater temperature conditions at the p2 5 percentile groundwater temperature distribution the temperatures vary in large areas between 8 c and 10 c including parts of the city of leibnitz the areal extends of groundwater temperatures below 8 c and also below 6 c increase along the model boundaries in the southern part of the wlf aquifer where the groundwater level is closer to the surface than in other model regions the groundwater temperature exceeds 10 c only in small areas in fig 7 the changes of subsurface temperatures i e in the unsaturated zone based on sole modeling of heat conduction and in the saturated zone based on heat conduction and convection modeling with depth at observation wells 3802 wg and 38144 are shown between 2006 and 2010 it can be noticed that the temperature distribution patterns change more with location than between years at observation well 3802 near surface soil temperatures do not fall below 6 c and the impact of the low air temperatures can t be seen before january near surface soil temperatures in summer rarely exceed 16 c subsurface temperatures below 10 c extend to depths between 6 m and 8 m below ground cooling and heating of the subsurface is much more pronounced at observation well wg which is located on the edge of a dry excavation pit i e small distance to groundwater level and downstream of the city of leibnitz near surface soil temperatures vary between less than 2 c and more than 22 c in almost every year between 2006 and 2010 with the exemption of 2007 subsurface temperatures fall below 4 c at 2 m depth and below 10 c at 8 m depth below ground respectively in summer temperatures above 16 c are reached in 3 m depth at observation well 38144 the effect of decreasing the subsurface temperatures with increasing depth during wintertime is even more pronounced than in well wg which is related to the influence of infiltrating surface water from the river mur the combination of land cover and groundwater flow conditions leads to an overall lower average groundwater temperature of 10 6 c at observation well 38144 compared to 11 9 c at well wg fig 8 exhibits the change of the subsurface temperature with depth at observation well wagna as annual average over the entire simulation period the average groundwater level is about 3 8 m below the surface at observation well wagna and shows only an annual fluctuation of approximately 15 cm for a typical year it can be seen that subsurface temperatures below 10 c reach to depths of about 7 m in april and temperatures above 14 c reach to depths of about 4 5 m in september with the multiyear average effects of distinct periods e g temperatures below 10 c reach a depth of almost 8 m in 2006 or temperatures above 14 c reach a depth of 7 5 m in 2009 not shown here on the subsurface temperature distribution can be eliminated this analysis may be valuable for management or design purposes 4 discussion with our approach to regional heat transport modeling in shallow aquifers we consider the combined effects of different land use and demonstrated that the resulting subsurface temperature distribution exhibits distinct 3d features the results are based on the assumption of an isotropic conductivity distribution and the use of only the thermal properties of the most common soil type this implementation relates to the fact that neither hydraulic gradients nor relevant sediment layers are observed in the wlf aquifer moreover thermal properties of different soil types were not determined however as indicated by öwav regelblatt 207 öwav 2008 thermal properties of clay silt sand and gravel differ only by small margins so that the effect of different soil types on groundwater temperatures are regarded as of minor importance compared to other varying parameters like near surface soil temperatures the specific impacts of these assumptions on the groundwater temperature distributions could be quantified by a sensitivity study to utilize the modeling results for aquifer thermal management we propose the computation of groundwater temperature distribution maps which are based on statistical analysis of the vertical averaged groundwater temperature time series and of the local subsurface temperature profile which shows the temperature change with depth averaged over an evaluation period 4 1 local subsurface temperature profiles at the observation well wagna we observe a spread of the subsurface temperature between the near ground surface and the top of the aquitard from above 20 c to below 12 c in a representative summer and from below 2 c to 10 c in a representative winter the temperature spread is cut by half at the top of the aquitard to between just above 10 c at the end of april to about 13 c at the end of october the groundwater temperature near the groundwater level varies between above 15 c in the middle of september to just above 8 c at the end of february the annual averaged groundwater temperatures illustrate that the demand for cooling and heating and the distribution of high and low groundwater temperatures occur at significantly different times furthermore the typical use pattern of gshps intensifies the natural temperature signal over the aquifer thickness favorable operational conditions for gshps exist if high cooling demand end of july coincides with low groundwater temperatures middle of april or if high heating demand end of january concurs with high groundwater temperatures end of september in the contrary least favorable conditions exist if high cooling demand coincides with high groundwater temperatures or if high heating demand concurs with low groundwater temperatures from a groundwater protection point of view reinjecting of heated water has to be evaluated so that maximum groundwater temperatures are not exceeded this depends mainly on the ratio of groundwater discharge and reinjection volume at the location of the reinjection assuming that the first is typically larger than the second a considerable increase of the groundwater temperature after mixing may be exceptional but already warmed up regions e g vertically averaged groundwater temperatures above 16 c at the p97 5 level could be excluded from reinjection of heated water as precautionary measure the austrian regulation öwav regelblatt 207 öwav 2008 specifies that at the location of reinjection the resulting groundwater temperature i e after mixing of the ambient and the thermally altered groundwater may neither exceed 20 c nor fall below 5 c in switzerland the maximum allowed temperature difference induced from geothermal energy use is 3 k down gradient of thermal groundwater use in relation to a natural state of groundwater temperatures without anthropogenic influence epting et al 2013 4 2 2d maps of groundwater temperature distribution to facilitate the use of the simulated 3d groundwater temperature data we evaluated different maps of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions including distributions of groundwater temperature for the p2 5 p50 and the p97 5 percentile and for specific dates 31st of january and 31st of july we found that the temperature distributions at the two specific dates representing demand situations i e cooling in summer and heating in winter compare more favorable to the median groundwater temperature distribution than to the extreme percentile distribution for example the vertically averaged groundwater temperature at the observation well wagna changes from between 8 and 10 c at the p2 5 percentile over 10 12 c for median conditions and at 31 01 2019 to 12 14 c at 31 07 2019 and reaches 14 16 c at the p97 5 percentile the groundwater temperature distribution at the selected dates resembles median conditions in particular in the aquifer area north of the city of leibnitz and the city area itself which is where the distance from surface to groundwater level is larger correspondingly median groundwater temperatures vary little in these regions i e maximum one temperature class up or down the extend of the spread between the p2 5 and p97 5 percentile groundwater temperature distributions i e from 10 to 12 c to 14 16 c in the leibnitz urban area are similar to that in regions with other land use in the northern part of the wlf aquifer but considerably less than the temperature variations in areas with shallow groundwater levels i e riverside forests thus the model results show a stabilizing impact on an elevated groundwater temperature level because of the heat fluxes from heated buildings this effect is less pronounced compared to the basel case study epting et al 2017b because the average building percentage per spatial discretization unit in the urban areas is only about 20 and the heated buildings don t reach into the groundwater of the wlf aquifer typical anthropogenic thermal groundwater use in the wlf aquifer is related to single family homes with very low pumping rates of heat pumps i e less than 0 1 l s the effects of this use on the groundwater temperature can t be resolved with a regional heat transport model however kupfersberger 2009 and händel et al 2013 have shown that the impacts of much larger i e more than 10 times larger anthropogenic thermal groundwater uses on the groundwater temperature distribution is locally limited due to the diffuse heat input situation in the wlf aquifer lateral thermal plumes could only be observed downstream of the gravel dredgings however because the water temperature in the gravel dredgings is driven by air temperature variations no steady state groundwater temperature conditions were reached because of the delay of heat propagation into the depth vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions at specific dates show less extreme temperatures than statistical defined states there is always a shift between the date of highest demand and the least favorable conditions for heating of about 2 5 months 31st of january to the middle of april and for cooling of about 2 months 31st of july to the end of september at observation well wagna see fig 8 to analyze the groundwater thermal potential from a conservative perspective we thus recommend to use the p2 5 percentile distribution to evaluate heating conditions and the p97 5 percentile distribution to evaluate cooling conditions the distributions of the two extreme percentile conditions clearly show areas of small distances between surface and groundwater level along the southern model boundaries where riverside forests dominate this finding is more evident for cold conditions i e p2 5 percentile however in this model area we have no observation wells for groundwater temperature so that the simulated groundwater temperature distribution could not be validated against measurements groundwater head calibration quality in this region is unremarkable klammler et al 2013 surface water infiltrates locally depending on head gradients as indicated by herbert et al 2013 epting et al 2013 and attard et al 2016 it is common practice to show resulting groundwater temperature distributions in 2d illustrations for a particular date however any 2d map of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions at a given time will simplify local temperature variations which becomes evident if the groundwater temperature variation at well wagna fig 8 should be represented by just one number yet the use of the vertically averaged groundwater temperatures might be sufficient if mean estimates of aquifer thermal potential or mean impacts of thermal use on groundwater temperatures are needed to take full advantage of the time space distributed results of a 3d heat transport models the use of more sophisticated postprocessing approaches like shown in figs 5 8 is proposed 4 3 multiyear heat transport simulations only a combination of i the vertically averaged groundwater temperature distribution and ii the depth variation of groundwater temperature within a year both averaged over a sufficient long time period will provide representative information about the 3d time space behavior of groundwater temperature looking at the time series of groundwater temperature in the wlf aquifer see fig 3 at first glance one might argue that a multiyear simulation of heat transport is not necessary because the seasonal temperature cycles do not substantially change from year to year at a closer look variations of the groundwater temperature extremes can be recognized at the observation wells 38144 and wagna moreover the data just show the groundwater temperature variations in a given depth multilevel temperature sensors are the exception in the wlf aquifer thus the heat transport model provides additional information compared to what is observed in the subsurface this can be seen at well wg in fig 7 which reveals that the 10 c and the 14 c groundwater temperature isotherms vary in the 5 year period by 3 m i e from 2006 to 2007 and from 2006 to 2009 respectively in contrast epting et al 2013 run their 3d heat transport model for the city of basel just within 2010 this is related to the fact that the distance between the ground surface and the groundwater level is at least 10 m or larger so that the impact of temperature variations at the surface is averaged out during heat conduction through the unsaturated zone the authors also demonstrate this situation by their groundwater temperature calibration results where observations from multilevel wells show individual trends but no seasonal characteristics in the wlf aquifer the distance between the ground surface and the groundwater level is much smaller on average about 3 5 m so that the impact of cold winters or hot summers on the groundwater thermal regime is more pronounced see fig 7 than in the basel case this is also confirmed by the distinct differences between the median and the 2 5 percentile and 97 5 percentile groundwater temperature distributions in the riverside forest areas showing shallow groundwater levels furthermore a multiyear calibrated groundwater flow and heat transport model is more robust against possible feedbacks between hydraulic and thermal processes the groundwater temperature is the result of a nonlinear interaction between different variables e g land surface air temperature distance from surface to groundwater level groundwater temperature anthropogenic thermal subsurface use additionally statistical defined groundwater temperature conditions like the 2 5 or the 97 5 percentile have a wider and thus more reliable foundation if based on multiyear simulations in the context of predictions multiyear heat transport models provide an undisputable basis to assess the impact of transient anthropogenic use of the aquifer geothermal potential kupfersberger et al 2017a have shown that the average air temperature at observation well wagna has risen between the periods of 2005 2008 and 2009 2013 from 10 2 c to 10 7 c including an increase of the maximum daily average temperature from 26 5 c to 28 6 c this effect is accordingly considered in the heat transport model of the wlf aquifer by means of the definition of the upper thermal boundary conditions in the heat transport model of the wlf aquifer we applied current data from the regional administration to delineate numbers and extent of heated buildings along with the assumption of an average basement depth of 2 5 m and recent land use information for all other uses there is no evidence of heated basements reaching into the groundwater body in the riverside forest areas exhibiting shallow groundwater levels almost no housing exists the current land use pattern was kept constant during the simulation of the past period so that we did not account for any changes however because of the distance between the ground and the groundwater level being the most important driver for groundwater temperature development the assumption of constant land use distribution does not significantly influence the computation of groundwater temperatures hence the additional effort for a multiyear heat transport model compared to a one year model was reasonable in the case of the wlf aquifer 5 conclusions a 3d heat transport model for a shallow aquifer in southeastern austria was calibrated against numerous groundwater temperature time series between 1993 and 2015 distributed heat input functions for different land use classes i e grass forest asphalt agriculture were used that were inferred from air temperature data following a linear regression approach described in kupfersberger et al 2017a b heat fluxes from heated basements were considered by linking the 1d heat conduction module soiltemp with the heat transport simulation model feflow on a time step basis to condense the 3d spatial and temporal variation of the simulated groundwater temperatures we suggest the use of vertically averaged groundwater temperature distributions for different temperature conditions and the computation of an annual vertical subsurface temperature profile averaged over the simulation period with these analysis tools we demonstrated that the typical groundwater temperature profile in the wlf aquifer shows a seasonal cycle that will be emphasized by common use of ground source heat pumps i e cooling in summer and heating in winter moreover aquifer subregions could be identified where additional groundwater use for cooling purposes may lead to undesirable high groundwater temperatures or where already low groundwater temperatures may limit the economic use of gshps for heating the distributions of vertically averaged groundwater temperatures for different temperature conditions reveal regions in which the shallow groundwater level dominates the groundwater temperature regime leading to a large spread between temperature extremes compared to areas in which the temperature regime is more influenced by the prevailing land use significantly increased groundwater temperatures underneath the city of leibnitz were not observed probably related to the small population number however groundwater temperatures showed the least fluctuations on a slightly elevated level the assumption of using the current land use for the entire simulation period did not meaningfully influence the computed groundwater temperatures during the simulation period for administration and planners the proposed analysis tools e g groundwater temperature distribution maps for defined temperature conditions vertical groundwater temperature distribution averaged over a multiyear period provide very detailed information about the groundwater temperature time space behavior to avoid detrimental effects to the thermal regime of shallow aquifers while at the same time enhancing the

7517,the study evaluates the water vapor isotopic compositions and its controls with special reference to indian summer monsoon ism season at roorkee india precipitation is usually a discrete event spatially and temporally in this part of the country therefore the information provided is limited while the vapors have all time availability and have a significant contribution in the hydrological cycle locally or over a regional scale hence for understanding the processes altering the various sources its isotopic signatures were studied the isotope water vapour line iso val was drawn together with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the best fit line was δd 5 42 δ18o 27 86 the precipitation samples were also collected during the study period and were best fitted with δd 8 20 0 18 δ18o 9 04 1 16 in the local meteoric water line lmwl from the back trajectory analysis of respective vapor samples it is unambiguous that three major sources viz local vapor western disturbance and monsoon vapor are controlling the fate of moisture over roorkee the d excess in ground level vapor glv reveals the supply of recycled moisture from continental water bodies and evapo transpiration as additional moisture sources to the study area the intensive depletion in isotopic ratios was associated with the large scale convective activity and low pressure cyclonic depression systems formed over bay of bengal keywords d excess moisture source convection cyclone relative humidity 1 introduction the climate of northern india is governed by the indian summer monsoon ism western disturbance and the regional scale processes owing to the warm and temperate nature of the climate ajayamohan and goswami 2003 gadgil and sajani 1998 the inconsistency of these meteorological processes can cause clear impact on a large population dependent on agriculture the economy of the region is highly dependent on agriculture sector which in turn on water availability for irrigation the hydrological cycle plays an integral role in the movement and transport of water throughout the earth system atmospheric water vapor is an important constituent of the hydrological cycle and the climate regime of the earth deshpande et al 2010 hoffmann et al 2005 houghton et al 2001 oltmans and hoffmann 1995 with the rise in global temperature as an effect of climate change the amount of vapor in the atmosphere is also expected to increase because of the enhanced evaporation rates hence atmospheric vapor is being studied in different realms of science to unveil the role of changing distribution pattern of moisture on continental areas thus affecting the regional climate hoffmann et al 2005 the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of atmospheric vapor depends on precipitation evaporation and wind pattern that varies throughout the year tuinenburg et al 2012 the exact processes determining the variation of atmospheric moisture at a given location are not yet understood mainly due to the regional scale variations in meteorological parameters topography and moisture source roderick and farquhar 2002 trenberth 2002 stable isotopic compositions of water δ18o and δd can be used to study the various components of hydrological cycle including evaporation precipitation moisture sources and moisture recycling rozanski et al 1993 johnson and ingram 2004 peng et al 2011 in regions where precipitation is usually a discrete event spatially and temporally precipitation studies can only provide limited information regarding the characteristics of local moisture laskar et al 2010 hence studies on isotopic composition of precipitation are not ideal in all instances especially in regions where evapotranspiration can also play significant role in the hydrological cycle thus isotopic fractionation during air parcel transport needs to be thoroughly evaluated in order to understand the exact processes that alter the source signatures chakraborty et al 2016 the concept of global meteoric water line gmwl introduced by craig 1961 based on the relationship between δ18o and δ2d values of precipitation data from different locations around the globe reflecting the influence of non equilibrium fractionation this parameter is defined as deuterium excess d excess dansgaard 1964 which is defined by the intercept of meteoric water line d excess provides information on the climatic conditions at the oceanic source region but can be modified by the vapor evaporated in continental basins through air parcel trajectory araguas araguas et al 2000 cyclonic and depression systems are well known for propagating the variations of δ values these depleted ratios can propagate as the cyclonic system moves and the changes in the isotopic values through the air mass trajectory are found during the moisture transport to inland areas gedzelman et al 2003 good et al 2014 tremoy et al 2012 recently the increased isotopic depletion over peninsular region during north east monsoon season was attributed to the cyclonic activity over bay of bengal bob lekshmy et al 2015 rahul et al 2016 over kolkata located along eastern region of the country this cyclonic effect is observed as masking the amount effect sengupta and sarkar 2006 also many recent studies are highlighting the role of organized convective activities in controlling the isotope ratios in precipitation samples chakraborty et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2014 moerman et al 2013 risi et al 2008 in fact many of the factors influencing the isotopic variation in the atmosphere and thus in moisture transport and precipitation are related to atmospheric convection emanuel and zivkovic rothman 1999 garreaud 2000 bony et al 2008 the present understanding of convective systems explain its role in the isotopic depletion of atmospheric water in tropical regions this observed depletion is mainly attributed to the entrainment of depleted environmental air and the subsequent downdraft re evaporation of falling raindrops and the succeeding feedback mechanism during intense condensation brings about further isotopic depletion in the atmospheric moisture risi et al 2008 so far in india the role of organized convective activity in isotopic depletion has observed along the peninsular region lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 and the andaman islands chakraborty et al 2016 where the usual meteorological factors failed to show any simple relationship with isotopic values however the control of convective moisture transport towards isotopic depletion is yet to be understood in major parts of the country roorkee is situated in the northern side of india bordered by himalayas on the north and north east the city developed on the banks of the ganges is influenced by a warm and temperate climate system the vapor isotopic compositions and its control over roorkee are not well understood especially in terms of the convective activity here we made an attempt to evaluate the water vapor isotopic compositions and its controls with special reference to indian summer monsoon ism season 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the studies were carried out in the national institute of hydrology roorkee uttarakhand india fig 1 the study area falls under latitude 29o52 n longitude 77o53 e and altitude 268 m the meteorological parameters of roorkee are normal rainfall is 1156 4 mm per annum the monthly average maximum temperature is 28 8 c monthly average minimum temperature is 15 5 c average relative humidity is 78 2 2 sampling there are two established methods of collection of ground level vapor glv cryogenic trapping using liquid nitrogen and condensation method using ice krishan et al 2011 deshpande et al 2013 purushothaman et al 2012 and shahul hameed et al 2016 however using cryogenic trap is constrained to sophisticated laboratory facilities purushothaman et al 2012 hence as part of generating more isotopic data and understanding the controls in isotopic composition liquid condensation lc method was established although collecting samples using lc method results in minor fractionations depending on temperature and humidity but isotopic composition of air moisture collected using lc method has significant correlation with meteorological parameters in comparison to that of cryogenic trapping puroshothaman et al 2012 therefore lc method can be used when the objective is to understand the influence of different moisture sources and meteorological parameters in the present study air moisture was collected using lc method in this method the air moisture sample is collected using the conical condensation device the conical condensation device comprises i aluminium cone ii metallic stand for holding and vertically aligning the aluminium cone at desired height iii a lid with knob for covering the aluminium cone and iv a cylindrical wire mesh cover for protecting the cone and the sample bottles in the conical condensation device a 5 ml sampling bottle is placed into the groove at the base of the stand and ensured that the bottle is open stub and cap removed completely inserted into the groove and not shaking freely the ice cubes are put into the cone up to the top leaving little more space required for fixing the lid the lid on the aluminium cone is fixed by slightly pushing it into the cone so that melt water from the cone cannot flow out if the cone is tilted accidentally the aluminium cone filled with ice cubes and sealed by lid in the stand is placed such that the axis of the aluminium cone is vertically aligned with the bottle placed in the groove the position of the cone is adjusted such that the tip of the aluminium cone is centered at 0 5 cm above the mouth of the bottle this will ensure that droplets of moisture condensing outside the aluminium cone can fall straight into the bottle and the falling droplets can be seen depending on prevalent relative humidity it takes 30 min to 60 min for collecting 5 10 ml of liquid condensate however during the rainy season when relative humidity is very high the sampling bottle is filled even within 30 min the conical condensation device is set up at around 9 am and the moisture sample is collected at around 10 10 30 am after setting up the conical condensation device accordingly the date time temperature and relative humidity is recorded using thermo hygrometer 2 3 isotopic analysis and meteorological information stable isotopes 2h or d and 18o in water were analysed using gv isoprime dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δd analysis 400 μl of the water sample is equilibrated with h2 along with pt catalyst at 40 c for 3 h and the gas is introduced into the mass spectrometer the δ18o of the sample is measured by equilibrating 400 μl of water with co2 gas at 40 c for 7 h and the equilibrated gas is introduced into the mass spectrometer the measured values are reported as delta δ values relative to vsmow coplen 1996 the precision of measurement for δ2h is 1 and that for δ18o is 0 1 the weather parameters of the study site during the study period were collected from the weather observatory operating at the national institute of hydrology campus 2 4 backward trajectory analysis for moisture sources the origin of air masses as diagnosed from the back trajectory analysis is assumed to be approximate to the moisture source direction for the water vapor and precipitation at the study site draxler et al 2010 the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model soderberg et al 2013 which calculates air mass position through time using pressure temperature wind speed vertical motion and solar radiation inputs was used to retrieve the backward track of the air parcel during the precipitation event the windows based hysplit program was acquired from the air resource laboratory of noaa usa http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php the hysplit compatible data set of global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 with spatial resolution of 1 was used as the meteorological data to run the hysplit model interface since the mean residence time of water vapor in the stratosphere is about 10 days gat 2000 trenberth 1999 the backward duration was set as 240 h 2 5 other sources of data in order to analyze the convective activity interpolated outgoing longwave radiation olr data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 latitude 2 5 longitude and a temporal resolution of 24 h is used to identify the extent of clouds and their propagation http www esrl noaa gov psd in addition in order to figure out the track of wind to the study site during each of the events the daily wind vector data were plotted using 0 75 0 75 grid resolution data from european centre for medium range weather forecast http apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily 3 results and discussion the δd and δ18o of the vapor samples for roorkee during the study period is given in fig 2 the most depleted samples belonged to 3 successive days in september 2007 i e 26 27 and 28th which were associated with tropical cyclones this depletion was also noticed in precipitation samples collected during the same period however these samples were avoided while calculating the equation for lmwl isotope water vapour line isoval was drawn together with the gmwl the best fit line was δd 5 42 δ18o 27 86 also precipitation samples collected during the study period was best fitted with δd 8 20 0 18 δ18o 9 04 1 16 in the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl established in the present study is very close to the lmwl observed by kumar et al 2010 as δd 8 23 0 43 δ18o 11 72 2 33 the slightly higher intercept observed in the present study indicates the interannual variability in the precipitation pattern in the present study all the samples belonged to the same year i e 2007 while that of kumar et al 2010 belonged to different years in addition the lmwl is very close to the regional meteoric water line rmwl having the equation δd 8 15 0 12 δ18o 9 55 0 80 kumar et al 2010 the slopes and intercepts were significantly different from that of the gmwl for both vapor and rain changes in slope and intercept are mostly due to the non equilibrium processes and kinetic fractionation respectively it is known that sub cloud evaporation decreases the d excess of precipitation while moisture recycling increases it froehlich et al 2008 hence the precipitation samples collected from roorkee are reflecting the process of sub cloud evaporation while vapor samples are signifying the influence of moisture recycling 3 1 air parcel trajectory analysis as mentioned elsewhere krishan et al 2012a b 2013 2014 the back trajectory analysis of respective vapor samples it is unambiguous that three major sources viz local vapor western disturbance and monsoon vapor are controlling the fate of moisture over roorkee the details of trajectory analysis will be discussed at a later stage of the article see section 3 5 backward air mass trajectories 200 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m above mean sea level representing western disturbance ismr and local moisture at roorkee are shown in fig 3 a c it was found that approximately up to 500 m above mean sea level amsl the moisture supply for roorkee region is dominated by local air circulation for the constant time set up of 240 h however during western disturbance period the moisture has travelled far distance starting from western russia western disturbance winds have passed even through polar region if this is the case the resultant moisture that is reaching roorkee is a result of cumulative parcel from all these regions however the maximum influence is expected to come from nearby regions with higher relative humidity or saturation index since these parameters are very significant in determining the fate of moisture purushothaman et al 2012 in monsoon season higher starting heights of 1500 2000 and 2500 m amsl and the moisture has covered the arabian sea peninsular india and further proceeding through the north western coastal region 3 2 tropical cyclone impact on isotopic variation tropical cyclone rainwater and vapor are prominent with intense isotopic depletions compared to monsoonal and thunderstorm rain due to the extensive isotopic fractionation of atmospheric moisture munksgaard et al 2015 rahul et al 2016 in fig 4 the anomalous depletions spotted in δ18o values made us to analyze the wind fields covering the arabian sea and bob during the respective periods these depletions were identified with smooth v shaped profiles sudden depletion in the heavier isotopes due to abrupt changes in the rainout and moisture entrainment which were followed by an increase in the isotopic values to see if any passing cyclone was present during these depletion events wind vectors have been plotted which revealed the presence of cyclonic circulations either in the bob else over land regions fig 5 a continuous depletion period was observed starting 22nd june extending till mid of july on 21st june when the depression developed over bob vapor δ18o was 13 06 fig 4 during the successive days the cyclonic depression moved towards the odisha and andhra pradesh coast and dissipated into inland regions fig 5 the δ18o values started depleting from 16 65 on 22nd june to 22 13 on 29th june another cyclonic depression formed in bob started moving through the inland regions through central and northern india on 4th of july during this depression the δ18o depleted to a maximum of 25 35 on 9th july due to the closeness of the cyclonic system to the study area during 8th and 9th of july the depletion was maximum 24 31 on 8th and 25 35 on 9th after the dissipation of the cyclonic depression the δ values started enriching and reached to 17 35 during 17th of the month also during end of september month a depletion in vapor δ values started on 21st with δ18o of 16 81 and reached maximum depletion on 27th with δ18o of 31 61 further onwards the vapor started enriching due to the dissipation of the depression system for the particular case of this period the depression was formed in the bob on 21st the next day it made landfall near puri in odisha coast even after making landfall the moisture further travelled to inland region towards north west direction δ18o depletion became maximum when the dissipating fractioned moisture was closest to roorkee 3 3 convective system one of the conventionally interpreted mechanism that controls the isotopic ratios in precipitation is the anti correlation with the amount of rainfall and the fraction of heavier isotopes cited as amount effect dansgaard 1964 amount effect is the basis of various studies on past monsoon dynamics by means of isotopic proxy based monsoon reconstruction paulsen et al 2003 cheng et al 2006 yadava et al 2004 yadava and ramesh 2005 when we plotted the amount of rainfall with δ18o values for linear regression no significant correlation was observed among the two parameters fig 6 many recent studies on precipitation events have also failed to establish any relation of δ values with amount of rainfall instead they found good correlation with large scale convective activity lekshmy et al 2014 permana et al 2016 rahul et al 2016 vimeux et al 2011 the time series of vapor δ18o shows the most depleted values during monsoon season over the indian region this relation was observed over peninsular regions chakraborty et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 the air moisture over roorkee marked with most depleted samples during the monsoon period of mid of june to first week of october hence the convective activity was analyzed to fill the knowledge gap existing over northern region of india owing to its relation with isotopic depletion according to gadgil 2003 olr values less than 240 w m2 is indicative of large scale organized convection hovemöllar diagram fig 7 for the study region during the study period indicates the presence of organized convective activity especially during june to october months a maximum depletion in vapor samples was also observed during this period hence elucidating the significance of organized convective activity in temporal variation of δ values a continuous depletion observed during last week of june to mid of july ie 23rd june to 15th of july 3rd to 13th of august 20th of august to 5th of september and were all associated with convective activities which were the result of depression systems formed over the nearby oceanic surface during the course of the depressions the convective system has uplifted and further moved towards the continental mass fig 8 moisture fractionation within the convective system makes the vapor depleted in isotopic composition also each convective event associated with rainout slightly increases the depletion of glv causing a memory effect chakraborty et al 2016 moerman et al 2013 risi et al 2008 vimeux et al 2001 this means that the isotopic composition of a particular day for a specific time is associated with convective system which is the cumulative outcome of the earlier convections also while comparing with the isotopic ratios of non monsoon period a general trend of depleted moisture was prevalent in the location this depletion was started one week prior to the onset of ism associated with the shift in wind circulation pattern however the intra seasonal variability in moisture pattern pertaining to monsoon period was accompanied with particular instances of continuous dips for shorter time periods fig 4 these dips are then followed by gradual increase in the heavier isotopes 3 4 temperature effect the variation of δd and δ18o are intimately related to physical processes especially evaporation and condensation schotterer et al 1997 these processes in turn depend on a major factor temperature the correlation of δ values in vapor and temperature is popularly known as temperature effect correlation analysis between temperature and δ values in vapor samples show a negative relation with a correlation coefficient of 0 55 for δ18o and 0 38 for δd which indicates the presence of an inverse temperature effect in roorkee during phase transition the different rates of kinetic energy levels between hydrogen and oxygen bring an imbalanced evaporation between these parameters wang et al 2015 and resulting in the higher value of δ18o compared to δd values indicating the more feasibility of δ18o in understanding the isotopic fractionation processes in fig 9 the d excess values were in positive correlation with temperature 0 76 dansgaard 1964 also established a linear relationship between surface air temperatures and δ values for mean annual precipitation on a global basis the lowest temperatures were observed during winter month of february and the highest during june during monsoon season the mean temperatures were about 29 30 c and the d excess values were also high in addition to the temperature variations the humidity variations were also found higher absolute humidity was observed during the monsoon season as compared to the winter and summer seasons 3 5 d excess in water vapor the intercept of gmwl d excess provides information regarding the synoptic conditions at the vapor oceanic source region and is governed by the kinetic fractionation occurring during non equilibrium processes craig 1961 the d excess can also be modified by the vapor evaporated in continental basins and the d excess values in roorkee vapor ranged from 19 8 to 90 0 with an average of 58 5 especially higher values of d excess were observed during monsoon period of june to september the plots of relative humidity measured at roorkee revealed a positive trend with that of d excess during jjas june july august and september period fig 9 while during the remaining months there was no significant correlation among these parameters the rh values along the trajectory fig 10 were also higher during these months hence the high d excess cannot be attributed to the general relation of lower rh and to increased kinetic fractionation further to higher d excess deshpande et al 2010 however this d excess variability can be attributed to the change in moisture sources during jjas period the back trajectory analysis reveals the monsoon and inland sources of moisture also the modeled rh plots suggests the dehydration of westerly air parcels while crossing the southern peninsular region and further gained moisture after entering bob fig 10a c hence during jjas period the major portions of the south westerly winds have gained moisture from bob although upon entering the north eastern region further dehydration has occurred due to the relatively dry air in the land mass but the air parcel was more saturated compared to the other seasons however the higher values of d excess in vapor during the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr could be attributed to the isotopic fractionation owing to the excess evaporation flux due to the more availability of water in the lower atmosphere as well as in water bodies and as soil moisture component the large amounts of liquid water moving through the lower atmosphere interact with the water vapor due to which the ground level vapor glv bears the isotopic composition of rainwater as well as the evaporative fraction deshpande et al 2010 even though indian summer monsoon ism period is dominated by oceanic source of moisture local moisture plays significant role in the total vapor budget which is evident from the back trajectory analysis land surface process like evapotranspiration over a region provides additional moisture to the local atmosphere which leads to precipitation in the same region i e recycled precipitation an increase in moisture circulation has been observed over gangetic plain during jjas period that promote the use of evapo transpired water in recycling of precipitation pathak et al 2014 and recycling of the local evaporated moisture krishan et al 2012b this explains the higher values of d excess during jjas period due to the higher evaporative flux d excess in the water bodies and soil moisture lowered and the expanding vapor got higher d excess during the remaining months due to the reduced soil moisture reduced availability of water in turn would have reduced the rate of evaporation which resulted in low fractionation of δ18o and δd and thus comparatively reduced d excess also the dominant moisture source during these periods was western disturbance originating in the mid latitudes even though these disturbances are well known for their higher d excess values gat and carmi 1970 pande et al 2000 tian et al 2005 reduced moisture recycling has resulted in the low d excess values during these periods this is also evident from the high vapor pressure during monsoon period and comparatively reduced during the remaining months but the striking point to be noted from the plots of rh and vp is that during monsoon vp was highest which started declining since mid of september fig 9 however rh was almost similarly since mid of june till the end of winter and the atmosphere was almost saturated during this period with an average rh of 85 hence it can be inferred that the excess vp during monsoon season is the result of the motion of water vapor molecules that were added to the air through evaporation this excess water vapor through evaporation enhanced the d excess value in the glv 4 conclusions the results of the study have brought forward the importance of vapor isotopic measurements using ice based liquid condensation unit in the present study ground level water vapor over roorkee during the year 2007 showed clear seasonal variability in terms of isotopic ratio and meteorological variables the study indicates that local meteorological parameters do not have only limited influence on the isotopic ratios but have control over the sources of air moisture with specific reference to indian summer monsoon while large scale convective activity and low pressure depression systems have some control especially during the indian summer monsoon ism period also the high d excess values during this period cannot be attributed to the general relation of lower rh to increased kinetic fractionation further to higher d excess evaporation from water bodies and subsequent recycling of moisture during monsoon season enhanced the d excess values during this period the analysis of low pressure systems and δ values δ18o and δd of air moisture during this period indicates the mixing of depleted bob moisture and continental vapor producing extreme depletion in the isotopic values the present study displays the feasibility of using stable isotope proxies to improve our understanding on cyclonic and low pressure systems and their further potentiality in paleotempestology in earlier work krishan et al 2012a 2013 2014 the moisture sources were identified using linear wind trajectory data deshpande et al 2013 and purushothaman et al 2012 focused on the two sampling methods but air moisture transport was not interpreted using the convective activities and cloud movement in this study authors have used the condensation method as system is portable and incurs very low cost compared to cryogenic vapor cryo trapping authors further strengthen the use of this simple liquid condensation method by demonstrating importance of observations obtained from it showing long range signal transfer between cyclonic event on sea and its observation at far off point at roorkee therefore this simple system can lift the technical hindrance in the use of cryo system and can help in filling the huge paucity on isotopic observations on

7517,the study evaluates the water vapor isotopic compositions and its controls with special reference to indian summer monsoon ism season at roorkee india precipitation is usually a discrete event spatially and temporally in this part of the country therefore the information provided is limited while the vapors have all time availability and have a significant contribution in the hydrological cycle locally or over a regional scale hence for understanding the processes altering the various sources its isotopic signatures were studied the isotope water vapour line iso val was drawn together with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the best fit line was δd 5 42 δ18o 27 86 the precipitation samples were also collected during the study period and were best fitted with δd 8 20 0 18 δ18o 9 04 1 16 in the local meteoric water line lmwl from the back trajectory analysis of respective vapor samples it is unambiguous that three major sources viz local vapor western disturbance and monsoon vapor are controlling the fate of moisture over roorkee the d excess in ground level vapor glv reveals the supply of recycled moisture from continental water bodies and evapo transpiration as additional moisture sources to the study area the intensive depletion in isotopic ratios was associated with the large scale convective activity and low pressure cyclonic depression systems formed over bay of bengal keywords d excess moisture source convection cyclone relative humidity 1 introduction the climate of northern india is governed by the indian summer monsoon ism western disturbance and the regional scale processes owing to the warm and temperate nature of the climate ajayamohan and goswami 2003 gadgil and sajani 1998 the inconsistency of these meteorological processes can cause clear impact on a large population dependent on agriculture the economy of the region is highly dependent on agriculture sector which in turn on water availability for irrigation the hydrological cycle plays an integral role in the movement and transport of water throughout the earth system atmospheric water vapor is an important constituent of the hydrological cycle and the climate regime of the earth deshpande et al 2010 hoffmann et al 2005 houghton et al 2001 oltmans and hoffmann 1995 with the rise in global temperature as an effect of climate change the amount of vapor in the atmosphere is also expected to increase because of the enhanced evaporation rates hence atmospheric vapor is being studied in different realms of science to unveil the role of changing distribution pattern of moisture on continental areas thus affecting the regional climate hoffmann et al 2005 the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of atmospheric vapor depends on precipitation evaporation and wind pattern that varies throughout the year tuinenburg et al 2012 the exact processes determining the variation of atmospheric moisture at a given location are not yet understood mainly due to the regional scale variations in meteorological parameters topography and moisture source roderick and farquhar 2002 trenberth 2002 stable isotopic compositions of water δ18o and δd can be used to study the various components of hydrological cycle including evaporation precipitation moisture sources and moisture recycling rozanski et al 1993 johnson and ingram 2004 peng et al 2011 in regions where precipitation is usually a discrete event spatially and temporally precipitation studies can only provide limited information regarding the characteristics of local moisture laskar et al 2010 hence studies on isotopic composition of precipitation are not ideal in all instances especially in regions where evapotranspiration can also play significant role in the hydrological cycle thus isotopic fractionation during air parcel transport needs to be thoroughly evaluated in order to understand the exact processes that alter the source signatures chakraborty et al 2016 the concept of global meteoric water line gmwl introduced by craig 1961 based on the relationship between δ18o and δ2d values of precipitation data from different locations around the globe reflecting the influence of non equilibrium fractionation this parameter is defined as deuterium excess d excess dansgaard 1964 which is defined by the intercept of meteoric water line d excess provides information on the climatic conditions at the oceanic source region but can be modified by the vapor evaporated in continental basins through air parcel trajectory araguas araguas et al 2000 cyclonic and depression systems are well known for propagating the variations of δ values these depleted ratios can propagate as the cyclonic system moves and the changes in the isotopic values through the air mass trajectory are found during the moisture transport to inland areas gedzelman et al 2003 good et al 2014 tremoy et al 2012 recently the increased isotopic depletion over peninsular region during north east monsoon season was attributed to the cyclonic activity over bay of bengal bob lekshmy et al 2015 rahul et al 2016 over kolkata located along eastern region of the country this cyclonic effect is observed as masking the amount effect sengupta and sarkar 2006 also many recent studies are highlighting the role of organized convective activities in controlling the isotope ratios in precipitation samples chakraborty et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2014 moerman et al 2013 risi et al 2008 in fact many of the factors influencing the isotopic variation in the atmosphere and thus in moisture transport and precipitation are related to atmospheric convection emanuel and zivkovic rothman 1999 garreaud 2000 bony et al 2008 the present understanding of convective systems explain its role in the isotopic depletion of atmospheric water in tropical regions this observed depletion is mainly attributed to the entrainment of depleted environmental air and the subsequent downdraft re evaporation of falling raindrops and the succeeding feedback mechanism during intense condensation brings about further isotopic depletion in the atmospheric moisture risi et al 2008 so far in india the role of organized convective activity in isotopic depletion has observed along the peninsular region lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 and the andaman islands chakraborty et al 2016 where the usual meteorological factors failed to show any simple relationship with isotopic values however the control of convective moisture transport towards isotopic depletion is yet to be understood in major parts of the country roorkee is situated in the northern side of india bordered by himalayas on the north and north east the city developed on the banks of the ganges is influenced by a warm and temperate climate system the vapor isotopic compositions and its control over roorkee are not well understood especially in terms of the convective activity here we made an attempt to evaluate the water vapor isotopic compositions and its controls with special reference to indian summer monsoon ism season 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the studies were carried out in the national institute of hydrology roorkee uttarakhand india fig 1 the study area falls under latitude 29o52 n longitude 77o53 e and altitude 268 m the meteorological parameters of roorkee are normal rainfall is 1156 4 mm per annum the monthly average maximum temperature is 28 8 c monthly average minimum temperature is 15 5 c average relative humidity is 78 2 2 sampling there are two established methods of collection of ground level vapor glv cryogenic trapping using liquid nitrogen and condensation method using ice krishan et al 2011 deshpande et al 2013 purushothaman et al 2012 and shahul hameed et al 2016 however using cryogenic trap is constrained to sophisticated laboratory facilities purushothaman et al 2012 hence as part of generating more isotopic data and understanding the controls in isotopic composition liquid condensation lc method was established although collecting samples using lc method results in minor fractionations depending on temperature and humidity but isotopic composition of air moisture collected using lc method has significant correlation with meteorological parameters in comparison to that of cryogenic trapping puroshothaman et al 2012 therefore lc method can be used when the objective is to understand the influence of different moisture sources and meteorological parameters in the present study air moisture was collected using lc method in this method the air moisture sample is collected using the conical condensation device the conical condensation device comprises i aluminium cone ii metallic stand for holding and vertically aligning the aluminium cone at desired height iii a lid with knob for covering the aluminium cone and iv a cylindrical wire mesh cover for protecting the cone and the sample bottles in the conical condensation device a 5 ml sampling bottle is placed into the groove at the base of the stand and ensured that the bottle is open stub and cap removed completely inserted into the groove and not shaking freely the ice cubes are put into the cone up to the top leaving little more space required for fixing the lid the lid on the aluminium cone is fixed by slightly pushing it into the cone so that melt water from the cone cannot flow out if the cone is tilted accidentally the aluminium cone filled with ice cubes and sealed by lid in the stand is placed such that the axis of the aluminium cone is vertically aligned with the bottle placed in the groove the position of the cone is adjusted such that the tip of the aluminium cone is centered at 0 5 cm above the mouth of the bottle this will ensure that droplets of moisture condensing outside the aluminium cone can fall straight into the bottle and the falling droplets can be seen depending on prevalent relative humidity it takes 30 min to 60 min for collecting 5 10 ml of liquid condensate however during the rainy season when relative humidity is very high the sampling bottle is filled even within 30 min the conical condensation device is set up at around 9 am and the moisture sample is collected at around 10 10 30 am after setting up the conical condensation device accordingly the date time temperature and relative humidity is recorded using thermo hygrometer 2 3 isotopic analysis and meteorological information stable isotopes 2h or d and 18o in water were analysed using gv isoprime dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δd analysis 400 μl of the water sample is equilibrated with h2 along with pt catalyst at 40 c for 3 h and the gas is introduced into the mass spectrometer the δ18o of the sample is measured by equilibrating 400 μl of water with co2 gas at 40 c for 7 h and the equilibrated gas is introduced into the mass spectrometer the measured values are reported as delta δ values relative to vsmow coplen 1996 the precision of measurement for δ2h is 1 and that for δ18o is 0 1 the weather parameters of the study site during the study period were collected from the weather observatory operating at the national institute of hydrology campus 2 4 backward trajectory analysis for moisture sources the origin of air masses as diagnosed from the back trajectory analysis is assumed to be approximate to the moisture source direction for the water vapor and precipitation at the study site draxler et al 2010 the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model soderberg et al 2013 which calculates air mass position through time using pressure temperature wind speed vertical motion and solar radiation inputs was used to retrieve the backward track of the air parcel during the precipitation event the windows based hysplit program was acquired from the air resource laboratory of noaa usa http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php the hysplit compatible data set of global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 with spatial resolution of 1 was used as the meteorological data to run the hysplit model interface since the mean residence time of water vapor in the stratosphere is about 10 days gat 2000 trenberth 1999 the backward duration was set as 240 h 2 5 other sources of data in order to analyze the convective activity interpolated outgoing longwave radiation olr data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 latitude 2 5 longitude and a temporal resolution of 24 h is used to identify the extent of clouds and their propagation http www esrl noaa gov psd in addition in order to figure out the track of wind to the study site during each of the events the daily wind vector data were plotted using 0 75 0 75 grid resolution data from european centre for medium range weather forecast http apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily 3 results and discussion the δd and δ18o of the vapor samples for roorkee during the study period is given in fig 2 the most depleted samples belonged to 3 successive days in september 2007 i e 26 27 and 28th which were associated with tropical cyclones this depletion was also noticed in precipitation samples collected during the same period however these samples were avoided while calculating the equation for lmwl isotope water vapour line isoval was drawn together with the gmwl the best fit line was δd 5 42 δ18o 27 86 also precipitation samples collected during the study period was best fitted with δd 8 20 0 18 δ18o 9 04 1 16 in the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl established in the present study is very close to the lmwl observed by kumar et al 2010 as δd 8 23 0 43 δ18o 11 72 2 33 the slightly higher intercept observed in the present study indicates the interannual variability in the precipitation pattern in the present study all the samples belonged to the same year i e 2007 while that of kumar et al 2010 belonged to different years in addition the lmwl is very close to the regional meteoric water line rmwl having the equation δd 8 15 0 12 δ18o 9 55 0 80 kumar et al 2010 the slopes and intercepts were significantly different from that of the gmwl for both vapor and rain changes in slope and intercept are mostly due to the non equilibrium processes and kinetic fractionation respectively it is known that sub cloud evaporation decreases the d excess of precipitation while moisture recycling increases it froehlich et al 2008 hence the precipitation samples collected from roorkee are reflecting the process of sub cloud evaporation while vapor samples are signifying the influence of moisture recycling 3 1 air parcel trajectory analysis as mentioned elsewhere krishan et al 2012a b 2013 2014 the back trajectory analysis of respective vapor samples it is unambiguous that three major sources viz local vapor western disturbance and monsoon vapor are controlling the fate of moisture over roorkee the details of trajectory analysis will be discussed at a later stage of the article see section 3 5 backward air mass trajectories 200 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m above mean sea level representing western disturbance ismr and local moisture at roorkee are shown in fig 3 a c it was found that approximately up to 500 m above mean sea level amsl the moisture supply for roorkee region is dominated by local air circulation for the constant time set up of 240 h however during western disturbance period the moisture has travelled far distance starting from western russia western disturbance winds have passed even through polar region if this is the case the resultant moisture that is reaching roorkee is a result of cumulative parcel from all these regions however the maximum influence is expected to come from nearby regions with higher relative humidity or saturation index since these parameters are very significant in determining the fate of moisture purushothaman et al 2012 in monsoon season higher starting heights of 1500 2000 and 2500 m amsl and the moisture has covered the arabian sea peninsular india and further proceeding through the north western coastal region 3 2 tropical cyclone impact on isotopic variation tropical cyclone rainwater and vapor are prominent with intense isotopic depletions compared to monsoonal and thunderstorm rain due to the extensive isotopic fractionation of atmospheric moisture munksgaard et al 2015 rahul et al 2016 in fig 4 the anomalous depletions spotted in δ18o values made us to analyze the wind fields covering the arabian sea and bob during the respective periods these depletions were identified with smooth v shaped profiles sudden depletion in the heavier isotopes due to abrupt changes in the rainout and moisture entrainment which were followed by an increase in the isotopic values to see if any passing cyclone was present during these depletion events wind vectors have been plotted which revealed the presence of cyclonic circulations either in the bob else over land regions fig 5 a continuous depletion period was observed starting 22nd june extending till mid of july on 21st june when the depression developed over bob vapor δ18o was 13 06 fig 4 during the successive days the cyclonic depression moved towards the odisha and andhra pradesh coast and dissipated into inland regions fig 5 the δ18o values started depleting from 16 65 on 22nd june to 22 13 on 29th june another cyclonic depression formed in bob started moving through the inland regions through central and northern india on 4th of july during this depression the δ18o depleted to a maximum of 25 35 on 9th july due to the closeness of the cyclonic system to the study area during 8th and 9th of july the depletion was maximum 24 31 on 8th and 25 35 on 9th after the dissipation of the cyclonic depression the δ values started enriching and reached to 17 35 during 17th of the month also during end of september month a depletion in vapor δ values started on 21st with δ18o of 16 81 and reached maximum depletion on 27th with δ18o of 31 61 further onwards the vapor started enriching due to the dissipation of the depression system for the particular case of this period the depression was formed in the bob on 21st the next day it made landfall near puri in odisha coast even after making landfall the moisture further travelled to inland region towards north west direction δ18o depletion became maximum when the dissipating fractioned moisture was closest to roorkee 3 3 convective system one of the conventionally interpreted mechanism that controls the isotopic ratios in precipitation is the anti correlation with the amount of rainfall and the fraction of heavier isotopes cited as amount effect dansgaard 1964 amount effect is the basis of various studies on past monsoon dynamics by means of isotopic proxy based monsoon reconstruction paulsen et al 2003 cheng et al 2006 yadava et al 2004 yadava and ramesh 2005 when we plotted the amount of rainfall with δ18o values for linear regression no significant correlation was observed among the two parameters fig 6 many recent studies on precipitation events have also failed to establish any relation of δ values with amount of rainfall instead they found good correlation with large scale convective activity lekshmy et al 2014 permana et al 2016 rahul et al 2016 vimeux et al 2011 the time series of vapor δ18o shows the most depleted values during monsoon season over the indian region this relation was observed over peninsular regions chakraborty et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 the air moisture over roorkee marked with most depleted samples during the monsoon period of mid of june to first week of october hence the convective activity was analyzed to fill the knowledge gap existing over northern region of india owing to its relation with isotopic depletion according to gadgil 2003 olr values less than 240 w m2 is indicative of large scale organized convection hovemöllar diagram fig 7 for the study region during the study period indicates the presence of organized convective activity especially during june to october months a maximum depletion in vapor samples was also observed during this period hence elucidating the significance of organized convective activity in temporal variation of δ values a continuous depletion observed during last week of june to mid of july ie 23rd june to 15th of july 3rd to 13th of august 20th of august to 5th of september and were all associated with convective activities which were the result of depression systems formed over the nearby oceanic surface during the course of the depressions the convective system has uplifted and further moved towards the continental mass fig 8 moisture fractionation within the convective system makes the vapor depleted in isotopic composition also each convective event associated with rainout slightly increases the depletion of glv causing a memory effect chakraborty et al 2016 moerman et al 2013 risi et al 2008 vimeux et al 2001 this means that the isotopic composition of a particular day for a specific time is associated with convective system which is the cumulative outcome of the earlier convections also while comparing with the isotopic ratios of non monsoon period a general trend of depleted moisture was prevalent in the location this depletion was started one week prior to the onset of ism associated with the shift in wind circulation pattern however the intra seasonal variability in moisture pattern pertaining to monsoon period was accompanied with particular instances of continuous dips for shorter time periods fig 4 these dips are then followed by gradual increase in the heavier isotopes 3 4 temperature effect the variation of δd and δ18o are intimately related to physical processes especially evaporation and condensation schotterer et al 1997 these processes in turn depend on a major factor temperature the correlation of δ values in vapor and temperature is popularly known as temperature effect correlation analysis between temperature and δ values in vapor samples show a negative relation with a correlation coefficient of 0 55 for δ18o and 0 38 for δd which indicates the presence of an inverse temperature effect in roorkee during phase transition the different rates of kinetic energy levels between hydrogen and oxygen bring an imbalanced evaporation between these parameters wang et al 2015 and resulting in the higher value of δ18o compared to δd values indicating the more feasibility of δ18o in understanding the isotopic fractionation processes in fig 9 the d excess values were in positive correlation with temperature 0 76 dansgaard 1964 also established a linear relationship between surface air temperatures and δ values for mean annual precipitation on a global basis the lowest temperatures were observed during winter month of february and the highest during june during monsoon season the mean temperatures were about 29 30 c and the d excess values were also high in addition to the temperature variations the humidity variations were also found higher absolute humidity was observed during the monsoon season as compared to the winter and summer seasons 3 5 d excess in water vapor the intercept of gmwl d excess provides information regarding the synoptic conditions at the vapor oceanic source region and is governed by the kinetic fractionation occurring during non equilibrium processes craig 1961 the d excess can also be modified by the vapor evaporated in continental basins and the d excess values in roorkee vapor ranged from 19 8 to 90 0 with an average of 58 5 especially higher values of d excess were observed during monsoon period of june to september the plots of relative humidity measured at roorkee revealed a positive trend with that of d excess during jjas june july august and september period fig 9 while during the remaining months there was no significant correlation among these parameters the rh values along the trajectory fig 10 were also higher during these months hence the high d excess cannot be attributed to the general relation of lower rh and to increased kinetic fractionation further to higher d excess deshpande et al 2010 however this d excess variability can be attributed to the change in moisture sources during jjas period the back trajectory analysis reveals the monsoon and inland sources of moisture also the modeled rh plots suggests the dehydration of westerly air parcels while crossing the southern peninsular region and further gained moisture after entering bob fig 10a c hence during jjas period the major portions of the south westerly winds have gained moisture from bob although upon entering the north eastern region further dehydration has occurred due to the relatively dry air in the land mass but the air parcel was more saturated compared to the other seasons however the higher values of d excess in vapor during the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr could be attributed to the isotopic fractionation owing to the excess evaporation flux due to the more availability of water in the lower atmosphere as well as in water bodies and as soil moisture component the large amounts of liquid water moving through the lower atmosphere interact with the water vapor due to which the ground level vapor glv bears the isotopic composition of rainwater as well as the evaporative fraction deshpande et al 2010 even though indian summer monsoon ism period is dominated by oceanic source of moisture local moisture plays significant role in the total vapor budget which is evident from the back trajectory analysis land surface process like evapotranspiration over a region provides additional moisture to the local atmosphere which leads to precipitation in the same region i e recycled precipitation an increase in moisture circulation has been observed over gangetic plain during jjas period that promote the use of evapo transpired water in recycling of precipitation pathak et al 2014 and recycling of the local evaporated moisture krishan et al 2012b this explains the higher values of d excess during jjas period due to the higher evaporative flux d excess in the water bodies and soil moisture lowered and the expanding vapor got higher d excess during the remaining months due to the reduced soil moisture reduced availability of water in turn would have reduced the rate of evaporation which resulted in low fractionation of δ18o and δd and thus comparatively reduced d excess also the dominant moisture source during these periods was western disturbance originating in the mid latitudes even though these disturbances are well known for their higher d excess values gat and carmi 1970 pande et al 2000 tian et al 2005 reduced moisture recycling has resulted in the low d excess values during these periods this is also evident from the high vapor pressure during monsoon period and comparatively reduced during the remaining months but the striking point to be noted from the plots of rh and vp is that during monsoon vp was highest which started declining since mid of september fig 9 however rh was almost similarly since mid of june till the end of winter and the atmosphere was almost saturated during this period with an average rh of 85 hence it can be inferred that the excess vp during monsoon season is the result of the motion of water vapor molecules that were added to the air through evaporation this excess water vapor through evaporation enhanced the d excess value in the glv 4 conclusions the results of the study have brought forward the importance of vapor isotopic measurements using ice based liquid condensation unit in the present study ground level water vapor over roorkee during the year 2007 showed clear seasonal variability in terms of isotopic ratio and meteorological variables the study indicates that local meteorological parameters do not have only limited influence on the isotopic ratios but have control over the sources of air moisture with specific reference to indian summer monsoon while large scale convective activity and low pressure depression systems have some control especially during the indian summer monsoon ism period also the high d excess values during this period cannot be attributed to the general relation of lower rh to increased kinetic fractionation further to higher d excess evaporation from water bodies and subsequent recycling of moisture during monsoon season enhanced the d excess values during this period the analysis of low pressure systems and δ values δ18o and δd of air moisture during this period indicates the mixing of depleted bob moisture and continental vapor producing extreme depletion in the isotopic values the present study displays the feasibility of using stable isotope proxies to improve our understanding on cyclonic and low pressure systems and their further potentiality in paleotempestology in earlier work krishan et al 2012a 2013 2014 the moisture sources were identified using linear wind trajectory data deshpande et al 2013 and purushothaman et al 2012 focused on the two sampling methods but air moisture transport was not interpreted using the convective activities and cloud movement in this study authors have used the condensation method as system is portable and incurs very low cost compared to cryogenic vapor cryo trapping authors further strengthen the use of this simple liquid condensation method by demonstrating importance of observations obtained from it showing long range signal transfer between cyclonic event on sea and its observation at far off point at roorkee therefore this simple system can lift the technical hindrance in the use of cryo system and can help in filling the huge paucity on isotopic observations on

7518,the interaction between surface water and groundwater through the hyporheic zone is recognized to be important as it impacts the water quantity and quality in both flow systems three dimensional 3d modeling is the most complete representation of a real world hyporheic zone however 3d modeling requires extreme computational power and efforts the sophistication is often significantly compromised by not being able to obtain the required input data accurately simplifications are therefore often needed the objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the vertically averaged approximation compared to a more complete vertically resolved model of the hyporheic zone the groundwater flow was modeled by either a simple one dimensional 1d dupuit approach or a two dimensional 2d horizontal vertical model in boundary fitted coordinates with the latter considered as a reference model both groundwater models were coupled with a 1d surface water model via the surface water depth applying the two models to an idealized pool riffle sequence showed that the 1d dupuit approximation gave comparable results in determining the characteristics of the hyporheic zone to the reference model when the stratum thickness is not very large compared to the surface water depth conditions under which the 1d model can provide reliable estimate of the seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharges and locations the hyporheic flow and the residence time were determined keywords coupled groundwater and surface water modeling vertically averaged hyporheic flux upwelling and downwelling residence time pool riffle bedform 1 introduction the surface water body and the groundwater body interlock together in an active dynamic zone called the hyporheic zone existing beneath and alongside many river beds the streambed topography such as pool riffle sequence induces water surface variation which in turn creates pressure differential along the streambed and drives the surface to subsurface flow in and out of the hyporheic zone lawler et al 2009 the hyporheic zone has been widely recognized as vital for the water quantity and quality management in both the stream and the aquifer systems e g kania et al 2006 boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 it also greatly influences many key ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and primary productivity boulton et al 2010 upwelling subsurface water provides stream organisms with nutrients and removes waste and downwelling stream water provides dissolved oxygen and organic matters to microbes invertebrates and fish eggs within the hyporheic zone boulton et al 2010 water quality also depends on the residence time of the hyporheic flow path which is the time it takes for the hyporheic flow to travel from the downwelling region to the upwelling region shorter residence time indicates that the hyporheic zone is dominated by surface water characterized by low alkalinity and high concentration of dissolved oxygen shields and malcom 2009 while longer residence time facilitates the transformation of nutrients in the streambed marzadri et al 2011 2012 since the hyporheic zone is the preferred incubation environment for many fisheries this in turn may affect the burial depth of fish eggs and survival of embryos robert 2003 therefore researchers have been highly motivated to study the characteristics of the hyporheic zone wondzell 2015 provides a review of the development of the science of the hyporheic zone over the past 20 years the hyporheic zone can be classified according to spatial scale as sediment scale reach scale and catchment scale boulton et al 1998 this study focuses on the reach scale at which the hyporheic exchange is a function of river morphology and individual topographic elements numerical models have been extensively utilized to study the hyporheic zone one approach to quantify hyporheic exchange is to analyze stream tracer using transient storage models conventional storage models consider the in stream storage zone and the hyporheic zone as a single compartment e g wӧrman 1998 while choi et al 2000 showed that they need to be distinguished when the two zones have completely different characteristics westhoff et al 2011 analyzed temperature variations using a coupled 1d transient storage and energy balance model to quantify hyporheic dynamics another approach utilizes surface water and groundwater models earlier studies modelled the two systems separately while in fact they are hydraulically interconnected liang et al 2007 more recently various coupling methods of the surface water and groundwater models have been developed modeling the interaction between the two flow systems is commonly based on the conductance concept that separates the surface from the subsurface domain where the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient drive the exchange flux kollet and maxwell 2006 the two flow systems may be solved in separate matrices while improving the solution iteratively or simultaneously in a single global matrix e g gunduz and aral 2005 peyard et al 2008 li et al 2016 the coupled models have been developed with variable complexities in terms of the dimensions of the model the most complex models involve 3d modeling of both surface flow and groundwater flow for example menichino and hester 2014 used a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics model of surface water and groundwater to study the effect of hydraulic conductivity on hyporheic exchange induced by in stream weir approximate and reduced dimension models have also been developed for example yuan et al 2008 coupled 2d vertically averaged surface flow model and groundwater model simultaneously for simulating the flood inundation extent on wetlands and floodplains gunduz and aral 2005 coupled a 1d longitudinal surface flow component and a 2d vertical averaged groundwater model and applied it to simulate the flow conditions in a watershed in southeastern united states the characteristics of the hyporheic flow induced by various bedforms have been investigated using 3d numerical models for example the hyporheic flow had been modeled under varying stream and ambient groundwater flow conditions in pool riffle system tonina and buffington 2011 trauth et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 investigated the effects of bed permeability on hyporheic flow characteristics over river dunes käser et al 2014 modeled three pool riffle sites on the river leith in the north west of england and evaluated the effect of different morphology on the hyporheic flux however the sophistications gained by conducting a full 3d analysis is often compromised by the difficulty of obtaining accurate representation of the highly variable real world scenarios e g the hydraulic conductivity of the stratum a vertically averaged dupuit model on the other hand is less data intensive due to the elimination of the vertical dimension and can still provide information on key characteristics of the hyporheic zone therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate for a simple case how a vertically averaged dupuit model compares to a more complete vertically resolved model although the ultimate goal is to evaluate the accuracy of a 2d dupuit groundwater model against full 3d models for the present study a simple 1d groundwater model based on dupuit approach was developed and compared with a 2d vertically resolved groundwater model both groundwater models were coupled with a 1d surface water model linked via the surface water depth the 1d dupuit model therefore reduced to a simple calculation of flow rates using the water surface head solved by the surface water model the 1d surface water model was verified with hec ras us army corps of engineers and the 2d groundwater model was verified with seep w one of the geo slope model applications that solves 2d groundwater problems the 2d groundwater model was considered accurate and taken as the reference model pool riffle sequence was chosen to assess the model as it is one of the common bedforms where hyporheic flow is particularly important and can be approximated as a simple longitudinal structure the results from the proposed 1d dupuit model for an idealized pool riffle sequence were compared to the reference model in terms of seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharge and location hyporheic flow and residence time 2 model domain an idealized periodic pool riffle structure was employed to assess the proposed model fig 1 the periodic ground level for one wavelength is given by a sinusoidal form as follows 1 z z 0 a sin 2 π x λ δ s o x where z is the ground level x is the distance in the stream flow direction so is the average bed slope of the channel and λ is the wavelength of the pool riffle sequence z 0 is a base elevation required to shift the mean value of the sine function a and δ are the amplitude and phase angle of the sine function respectively based on many river morphology studies leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 rosgen 1994 robert 2003 the pool riffle was constructed in a 10 m wide straight channel with the wavelength λ 72 m z 0 was taken to be 9 84359 so that the model domain started with a riffle crest at bed elevation of 10 m a and δ were set at 0 15646 and 1 55856 respectively the sinusoidal shape was chosen not only because it is representative of the shape of the pool riffle bedform but also because its smoothness eliminates noises when calculating derivatives the upper boundary of the modelled domain was the river bed which has a pool riffle nature that links the surface water and the groundwater model the domain extends downward to the impervious layer to include the local flow system where the pool riffle form is effective in driving the hyporheic flow tóth 1963 two average mild bed slopes of 0 001736 and 0 003472 were tested as they correspond to a wide range of froude numbers in the subcritical stream flow regime for the surface water discharges tested qsurf 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 m3 s the corresponding froude numbers range from 0 10 to 0 58 and 0 11 to 0 80 for the average bed slope of 0 001736 and 0 003472 with the maximum froude number occurring over the riffle and minimum froude number occurring over the pool a constant manning s n of 0 033 was used for bed roughness the pool and riffle form usually exists in low gradient streams where surface water is shallow in all scenarios the stream width was greater than ten times of the maximum water depth thus the stream was considered as wide channel and the hydraulic radius was approximated to be equal to the water depth in the surface water model to investigate the effect of the vertical position of the impervious layer five average stratum thicknesses d 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 m were tested these were corresponding to a relative stratum thickness ratio λ d ranging between 9 and 144 the hydraulic conductivity of the stratum was kept at constant assuming a homogeneous subsurface stratum 3 methodology 3 1 surface water model the link between the surface water and groundwater is the water heads above the channel bed which was simulated using a 1d surface water model the idealized pool riffle structure was modeled assuming a steady flow condition and the surface discharge lost to or gained from the hyporheic zone is negligible the surface water depths were determined by solving the conservation of energy equation using the standard step method chow 1959 newton raphson method was applied to solve the water heads iteratively the modelled water heads were then used as a constant boundary condition for the groundwater flow model 3 2 groundwater model 3 2 1 1d groundwater model in the 1d groundwater model dupuit assumption was considered valid as the groundwater flow is mainly horizontal groundwater flow was kept laminar re 1 in all scenarios thus darcy s equation was used to account for the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width 2 q x 1 d k h d where h is the hydraulic gradient k is the hydraulic conductivity taken as 1 mm s for gravel delleur 2007 the selected k value is on the large side but still ensures that the seepage discharge is significantly smaller than the surface discharge the upwelling downwelling discharge per unit length dw 1d was given by the slope of the horizontal seepage discharge curve 3 dw 1 d δ q x 1 d δ x where δqx 1d is the difference of horizontal seepage discharges between two consequent computational nodes with a spatial difference of δx the hyporheic flow along one wave length hf 1d was determined as half of the integrated absolute values of the upwelling downwelling discharges assuming that the integrated downwelling and upwelling discharges are equal 4 hf 1 d 0 5 0 λ dw 1 d dx 3 2 2 2d groundwater model in the 2d model the groundwater flow equation reduces to laplace equation in terms of groundwater potential as the flow condition is assumed to be inviscid irrotational steady and incompressible and the saturated porous media was assumed isotropic and homogeneous the boundary fitted coordinate system is appropriate for the non uniform curvilinear grid that literally wrapped around the domain thus was used to transform the grid from the physical x y plane to the computational ξ η plane which involves uniform δξ and δη fletcher 1988 the upstream and lower boundaries of the domain at the vertical plane of the riffle crest and the impervious layer become coordinate lines denoted by ξ and η the transformed 2d laplace equation for the computational domain is 5 h ξ 2 ξ h η 2 η h ξ ξ α h η η γ h ξ η β 0 where h is the groundwater potential or the piezometric head α ξ x 2 ξ y 2 β 2 η x ξ x η y ξ y γ η x 2 η y 2 2 ξ ξ xx ξ yy and 2 η η xx η yy eq 5 was finite differenced and the resulting system of linear equations was solved using gaussian elimination method consequently the computed water heads were transferred back to the physical plane at the corresponding nodes the seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharge upwelling downwelling location and hyporheic flow were calculated as 6 q x 2 d k h x δ y 7 q y 2 d k h y δ x where qx 2d and qy 2d are the horizontal and vertical seepage discharges per unit width hx and hy are the head gradients along any two consequent nodes where the distance between any two nodes in the x and y directions is δx and δy the total upwelling downwelling discharge was calculated by integrating the vertical seepage discharge at each section thus the hyporheic flow along one wavelength was determined as half of the integration absolute values of the upwelling downwelling discharges for 2d flow assuming that the integrated downwelling and upwelling discharges are equal within the one wavelength 8 hf 2 d 0 5 0 λ 0 d q y 2 d dydx 3 2 3 upwelling downwelling locations and residence time the surface flow enters the substrate at the downwelling location where the hyporheic flow started to travel underground for a distance before leaving the substrate at the upwelling location and re entering the surface water in the 1d groundwater model the mean travel distance l 1d was approximated as the horizontal distance between any two alternative and consequent upwelling downwelling zones where the mean values of the upwelling discharge curve and the downwelling discharge curve exist as shown in fig 2 in the 2d groundwater model the mean travel distance l 2d was approximated as the length of a defined seepage line that divides the amount of flow within the hyporheic zone into two equal parts fig 3 the total difference in water heads through the mean travel distance between the upwelling and downwelling locations were defined as δh 1d and δh 2d for the two models respectively the residence time in the 1d model t 1d can be determined by equating the rate of displacement with darcy s law 9 t 1 d l 1 d 2 k δ h 1 d where the average head gradient within the mean travel distance δh 1d l 1d was used in the darcy s equation similarly the residence time in the 2d model t 2d can be calculated as 10a t 2 d l 2 d 2 k δ h 2 d using the average head gradient to calculate the residence time in the 1d model is adequate however it is more accurate to use the local head gradient δh δx in the 2d model 10b t 2 d 0 l 2 d 1 k δ h δ x d x 3 3 model discretization the model grid discretization was tested for mesh size δx 0 5 0 25 0 125 0 0625 and 0 03125 m the corresponding relative mesh ratios normalized by the wavelength were λ δs 144 288 576 1152 and 2304 respectively the effect of the mesh increment on the horizontal seepage the upwelling downwelling discharges and the residence time of the hyporheic flow path were evaluated the full range of surface water discharge and average stratum thickness as described in the previous section was tested while the only average stream bed slope tested was so 0 003472 results showed that the mesh size of 0 25 m optimized accuracy and solution time when compared to the most accurate finest mesh size of 0 03125 m the relative error in calculating the upwelling downwelling discharges in the 1d and 2d models were within 2 the relative error in calculating the average residence time was within 2 in the 2d model and 6 in the 1d model 4 results and discussion 4 1 example model results example results of the two models are shown in figs 4 and 5 for the case of average stratum thicknesses of 8 m and surface discharges of 1 and 10 m3 s respectively each figure shows the water surface profile the corresponding froude number calculated from the surface water model the seepage flow lines seepage discharge and downwelling discharge as calculated by the groundwater model the positive downwelling discharges indicate that the flow transports from the channel to the underground domain and the negative downwelling discharges mean that the flow moves from the underground domain back again to the channel it can be seen that the width and pattern of the seepage discharge and downwelling discharge are similar in both models the magnitude is larger in the 1d model compared to the 2d model and the difference is more pronounced for the low surface water discharge case 4 2 horizontal seepage discharge the percentage error of the 1d groundwater model in simulating the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width was calculated at the location where the maximum horizontal seepage discharge existed normalized by the value calculated in the reference 2d model fig 6 shows the percentage error of the 1d model plotted against the ratio between the surface water depth and the stratum thickness ym d where ym is the mean surface water depth within one wavelength various presentations of the data were attempted using different combination of parameters of the surface water and the groundwater body the best data collapse was achieved with ym d log log scale was used for a clearer presentation it can be seen that the 1d model always overestimated the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width compared to the 2d model indicated by the positive values of percentage error the percentage error increased as either λ d or ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the maximum error was 35 9 for so 0 001736 and 39 4 for so 0 003472 therefore the 1d groundwater model is less accurate in capturing the horizontal discharge when the stratum thickness is larger the accuracy of the 1d model also decreases as the bed slope gets steeper but to a much less extent compared to the stratum thickness the relationship between the percentage error and ym d can be well described by fitting a simple power equation to the modelled data shown as the solid straight line in fig 6 the regression equations for the power curves are 11 q x 2 d peak q x 1 d peak q x 2 d peak 0 3011 y m d 1 588 s o 0 001736 0 3679 y m d 1 543 s o 0 003472 the applicable range of the 1d model can be determined from these regression equations based on the acceptable error for example an accuracy of within 20 can be achieved with the 1d model for ym d 0 071 and within 10 for ym d 0 110 if the average bed slope is 0 001736 the thresholds of the ratio increase to ym d 0 075 and ym d 0 118 if the average bed slope is 0 003472 it is also interesting to see that the slope of each group of data with the same λ d is different than the overall slope of all data that is the slope caused by the surface water discharge is different than the slope caused by the stratum thickness the difference is particularly larger for the case with steeper bed slope this is likely due to the higher velocity associated with the steep slope case causing stronger dynamic effect of the surface water flow which leads to stronger variation in water surface and more complicated hyporheic flow 4 3 peak upwelling downwelling discharge and hyporheic flow the same approach described above was used to calculate the percentage error of the 1d dupuit model in calculating the peak upwelling downwelling discharges and the hyporheic flow it can be seen from figs 7 9 that the 1d model always produced overestimation in comparison to the reference 2d model the percentage error all increased as λ d or ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the percentage error in calculating the peak downwelling discharge was up to 69 7 for so 0 001736 and 49 9 for so 0 003472 the percentage error was up to 39 0 for so 0 001736 and 42 2 for so 0 003472 when calculating hyporheic flow it is worth noticing that the percentage error in calculating the peak upwelling discharge was much larger which was up to 117 5 for so 0 001736 and 219 9 for so 0 003472 therefore the 1d dupuit model should be used with caution when calculating peak upwelling discharge for cases where stratum thickness is greater the relationship between the percentage error and ym d can be well described by fitting a power curve to the modelled data in most of the cases the fitness was not as good for the peak downwelling discharge with average bed slope of 0 003472 fig 7b again this is likely due to the dynamic effect of surface water in the steeper channel the regression equations for peak downwelling discharge are 12 q y 2 d peak dw 1 d peak q y 2 d peak 0 3424 y m d 1 759 s o 0 001736 0 2549 y m d 1 721 s o 0 003472 for peak upwelling discharge 13 q y 2 d peak dw 1 d peak q y 2 d peak 1 0176 y m d 1 558 s o 0 001736 2 273 y m d 1 444 s o 0 003472 and for hyporheic flow per wavelength 14 hf 2 d hf 1 d hf 2 d 0 3421 y m d 1 619 s o 0 001736 0 3967 y m d 1 573 s o 0 003472 table 1 lists all the threshold values of ym d corresponding to 20 and 10 accuracy of the 1d dupuit model in calculating the peak upwelling downwelling discharge and the hyporheic flow as calculated from the above regression equations a relationship between the 1d and 2d model results of the hyporheic flow per wavelength was established through data regression 15 hf 2 d hf 1 d 0 03786 y m d 0 6811 1 043 r 2 0 9289 this equation allows application of a correction factor to the 1d model result to get a more accurate estimate of hyporheic flow the hyporheic flows obtained from the 1d model corrected with eq 15 are within 10 2 to those calculated with the reference 2d model for all tested scenarios 4 4 upwelling downwelling locations the horizontal distance between the upwelling and downwelling locations denoted as δs uw and δs dw in fig 3 was normalized by the wavelength to obtain the percentage difference between the 1d and 2d models δsdw λ and δs uw λ were plotted against ym d in figs 10 and 11 respectively it can be seen that even though the data does not collapse well to a single curve the percentage error of the 1d model for determining the upwelling downwelling locations are relatively small the maximum percentage error was 2 4 for upwelling location and 5 7 for downwelling location for the full range of the tested parameters therefore the 1d dupuit model provides very good estimation of the upwelling and downwelling locations compared to the reference model 4 5 mean travel distance and residence time the mean travel distance was calculated as the distance between the downwelling and upwelling locations fig 12 shows the mean travel distance normalized by wavelength as calculated in the 1d and 2d models for so 0 001736 it can be seen that the mean travel distance was generally shorter in the 1d model compared to that in the 2d model but the difference diminished as λ d and ym d increased only results for so 0 001736 are shown since similar results were observed for so 0 003472 the residence time calculated by eqs 9 and 10 for the two models respectively was scaled by the residence time in the reference model to get the percentage error of the 1d model fig 13 the percentage error increased with decreasing λ d and ym d again regression equations were developed for the relationship between the percentage error and ym d by fitting a power curve to the modelled data 16 t 2 d t 1 d t 2 d 1 9382 y m d 1 208 s o 0 001736 1 7422 y m d 1 213 s o 0 003472 the correlation coefficients for these regression equations were lower compared to the regression equations previously developed for the other variables r 2 0 8650 and 0 7201 for the two bed slopes based on these equations the thresholds of ym d for 20 and 10 accuracy were estimated and are shown in table 1 as well similar to the hyporheic flow an equation was developed for the purpose of better estimating the residence time using only the 1d model results a relationship between t 1d and t 2d can be obtained from eqs 9 and 10a assuming that the average travel distance in the 2d flow model is proportional to the stratum thickness and the water head gradients in the 1d and the 2d models are approximately equal δ h 1 d δ h 2 d 17 t 2 d c 2 2 t 1 d l 1 d d 2 where the correction coefficient c 2 l 2 d d was determined by linear regression of the 1d and 2d model calculated l d 18 c 2 0 977 l 1 d d 0 9382 r 2 0 9981 the residence time obtained from 1d model corrected with eqs 17 and 18 is within 7 4 of that calculated using the reference model for all tested scenarios 4 6 effect of pool riffle configuration the amplitude of the pool riffle sequence was increased by 50 to assess the effect of different pool riffle configuration the steeper average bed slope so 0 003472 was used for this test the froude number was 0 94 over the riffle and 0 08 over the pool all the other variables were kept at the same as the base configuration fig 14 shows the percentage error of the 1d dupuit model for this new configuration compared to that of the base configuration only the error in the calculated hyporheic flow is shown as an example as previously observed the 1d model always produced overestimation in comparison to the reference 2d model the percentage error increased as ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the percentage error in calculating the hyporheic flow was up to 75 1 in comparison to the 42 2 for the base configuration a power curve fits well to the data for the new pool riffle configuration from which the threshold values of ym d corresponding to 20 and 10 accuracy of the 1d dupuit model were calculated to be 0 155 and 0 246 in comparison to 0 083 and 0 129 for the base configuration the regression equations describing the relationship between the 1d modeling error in each hyporheic flow characteristics and the ym d are limited to the specific pool riffle configuration and should be re developed if the configuration changes 5 conclusion hyporheic zone due to the active interchange between groundwater and surface water has been recognized to be critical to many hydrological and ecological processes 3d modeling methods have been employed to assess the 3d flow patterns and characteristics of the hyporheic zone but their sophistication can be greatly compromised by inaccurate input data and numerical difficulties therefore it is often necessary to make simplifications the objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of vertically averaged approximation against the more complete vertically resolved model a simple 1d groundwater model based on dupuit approach and a 2d groundwater model were developed and applied to the hyporheic zone beneath an idealized periodic pool riffle sequence for a range of stratum thickness average channel bed slope and surface discharge it was found that the vertically averaged 1d model provided comparable results with the 2d reference model for the key characteristics of the hyporheic zone except when the stratum thickness is very large compared to the average surface water flow depth threshold values of relative depth ym d above which the 1d model results are within 20 and 10 of the reference model results were determined for seepage discharge peak downwelling upwelling discharge hyporheic flow and residence time based on the results from the two models correction equations were developed to calculate hyporheic flow and residence time using only information obtained from 1d model with 10 2 and 7 4 accuracy for all tested scenarios therefore it is appropriate to consider using vertically averaged models to simulate hyporheic zone for simple cases where the stratum thickness is not too big and the average bed slope is relatively mild future work can include applying the proposed modeling method to real cases for example the field data and 3d modeling results presented by käser et al 2014 can be used to facilitate a further evaluation of the 1d dupuit model by comparing to the 3d modeling results the simplification in not only the vertical direction but also the horizontal transverse direction can be assessed in addition this study demonstrated that it is promising to apply the dupuit assumption to 2d horizontal domains similar to the 1d model in this study only the surface flow needs to be solved while the hyporheic flow is still estimated by post processing step the computational effort will be significantly reduced compared to a full 3d groundwater model while comparable results can be achieved for a wide range of stream and stratum conditions it is worth noticing that data non smoothness can have an impact on model accuracy since the hyporheic flow is derived as first derivative and the upwelling downwelling discharge is derived as second derivative of the piezometric head numerical evaluation of these derivatives will introduce noise in this study the chosen idealized pool riffle bedform is very smooth and these problems are avoided in practical cases smoothing or filtering will likely be required acknowledgements this work was supported by a grant from the ministry of

7518,the interaction between surface water and groundwater through the hyporheic zone is recognized to be important as it impacts the water quantity and quality in both flow systems three dimensional 3d modeling is the most complete representation of a real world hyporheic zone however 3d modeling requires extreme computational power and efforts the sophistication is often significantly compromised by not being able to obtain the required input data accurately simplifications are therefore often needed the objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the vertically averaged approximation compared to a more complete vertically resolved model of the hyporheic zone the groundwater flow was modeled by either a simple one dimensional 1d dupuit approach or a two dimensional 2d horizontal vertical model in boundary fitted coordinates with the latter considered as a reference model both groundwater models were coupled with a 1d surface water model via the surface water depth applying the two models to an idealized pool riffle sequence showed that the 1d dupuit approximation gave comparable results in determining the characteristics of the hyporheic zone to the reference model when the stratum thickness is not very large compared to the surface water depth conditions under which the 1d model can provide reliable estimate of the seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharges and locations the hyporheic flow and the residence time were determined keywords coupled groundwater and surface water modeling vertically averaged hyporheic flux upwelling and downwelling residence time pool riffle bedform 1 introduction the surface water body and the groundwater body interlock together in an active dynamic zone called the hyporheic zone existing beneath and alongside many river beds the streambed topography such as pool riffle sequence induces water surface variation which in turn creates pressure differential along the streambed and drives the surface to subsurface flow in and out of the hyporheic zone lawler et al 2009 the hyporheic zone has been widely recognized as vital for the water quantity and quality management in both the stream and the aquifer systems e g kania et al 2006 boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 it also greatly influences many key ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and primary productivity boulton et al 2010 upwelling subsurface water provides stream organisms with nutrients and removes waste and downwelling stream water provides dissolved oxygen and organic matters to microbes invertebrates and fish eggs within the hyporheic zone boulton et al 2010 water quality also depends on the residence time of the hyporheic flow path which is the time it takes for the hyporheic flow to travel from the downwelling region to the upwelling region shorter residence time indicates that the hyporheic zone is dominated by surface water characterized by low alkalinity and high concentration of dissolved oxygen shields and malcom 2009 while longer residence time facilitates the transformation of nutrients in the streambed marzadri et al 2011 2012 since the hyporheic zone is the preferred incubation environment for many fisheries this in turn may affect the burial depth of fish eggs and survival of embryos robert 2003 therefore researchers have been highly motivated to study the characteristics of the hyporheic zone wondzell 2015 provides a review of the development of the science of the hyporheic zone over the past 20 years the hyporheic zone can be classified according to spatial scale as sediment scale reach scale and catchment scale boulton et al 1998 this study focuses on the reach scale at which the hyporheic exchange is a function of river morphology and individual topographic elements numerical models have been extensively utilized to study the hyporheic zone one approach to quantify hyporheic exchange is to analyze stream tracer using transient storage models conventional storage models consider the in stream storage zone and the hyporheic zone as a single compartment e g wӧrman 1998 while choi et al 2000 showed that they need to be distinguished when the two zones have completely different characteristics westhoff et al 2011 analyzed temperature variations using a coupled 1d transient storage and energy balance model to quantify hyporheic dynamics another approach utilizes surface water and groundwater models earlier studies modelled the two systems separately while in fact they are hydraulically interconnected liang et al 2007 more recently various coupling methods of the surface water and groundwater models have been developed modeling the interaction between the two flow systems is commonly based on the conductance concept that separates the surface from the subsurface domain where the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient drive the exchange flux kollet and maxwell 2006 the two flow systems may be solved in separate matrices while improving the solution iteratively or simultaneously in a single global matrix e g gunduz and aral 2005 peyard et al 2008 li et al 2016 the coupled models have been developed with variable complexities in terms of the dimensions of the model the most complex models involve 3d modeling of both surface flow and groundwater flow for example menichino and hester 2014 used a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics model of surface water and groundwater to study the effect of hydraulic conductivity on hyporheic exchange induced by in stream weir approximate and reduced dimension models have also been developed for example yuan et al 2008 coupled 2d vertically averaged surface flow model and groundwater model simultaneously for simulating the flood inundation extent on wetlands and floodplains gunduz and aral 2005 coupled a 1d longitudinal surface flow component and a 2d vertical averaged groundwater model and applied it to simulate the flow conditions in a watershed in southeastern united states the characteristics of the hyporheic flow induced by various bedforms have been investigated using 3d numerical models for example the hyporheic flow had been modeled under varying stream and ambient groundwater flow conditions in pool riffle system tonina and buffington 2011 trauth et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 investigated the effects of bed permeability on hyporheic flow characteristics over river dunes käser et al 2014 modeled three pool riffle sites on the river leith in the north west of england and evaluated the effect of different morphology on the hyporheic flux however the sophistications gained by conducting a full 3d analysis is often compromised by the difficulty of obtaining accurate representation of the highly variable real world scenarios e g the hydraulic conductivity of the stratum a vertically averaged dupuit model on the other hand is less data intensive due to the elimination of the vertical dimension and can still provide information on key characteristics of the hyporheic zone therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate for a simple case how a vertically averaged dupuit model compares to a more complete vertically resolved model although the ultimate goal is to evaluate the accuracy of a 2d dupuit groundwater model against full 3d models for the present study a simple 1d groundwater model based on dupuit approach was developed and compared with a 2d vertically resolved groundwater model both groundwater models were coupled with a 1d surface water model linked via the surface water depth the 1d dupuit model therefore reduced to a simple calculation of flow rates using the water surface head solved by the surface water model the 1d surface water model was verified with hec ras us army corps of engineers and the 2d groundwater model was verified with seep w one of the geo slope model applications that solves 2d groundwater problems the 2d groundwater model was considered accurate and taken as the reference model pool riffle sequence was chosen to assess the model as it is one of the common bedforms where hyporheic flow is particularly important and can be approximated as a simple longitudinal structure the results from the proposed 1d dupuit model for an idealized pool riffle sequence were compared to the reference model in terms of seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharge and location hyporheic flow and residence time 2 model domain an idealized periodic pool riffle structure was employed to assess the proposed model fig 1 the periodic ground level for one wavelength is given by a sinusoidal form as follows 1 z z 0 a sin 2 π x λ δ s o x where z is the ground level x is the distance in the stream flow direction so is the average bed slope of the channel and λ is the wavelength of the pool riffle sequence z 0 is a base elevation required to shift the mean value of the sine function a and δ are the amplitude and phase angle of the sine function respectively based on many river morphology studies leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 rosgen 1994 robert 2003 the pool riffle was constructed in a 10 m wide straight channel with the wavelength λ 72 m z 0 was taken to be 9 84359 so that the model domain started with a riffle crest at bed elevation of 10 m a and δ were set at 0 15646 and 1 55856 respectively the sinusoidal shape was chosen not only because it is representative of the shape of the pool riffle bedform but also because its smoothness eliminates noises when calculating derivatives the upper boundary of the modelled domain was the river bed which has a pool riffle nature that links the surface water and the groundwater model the domain extends downward to the impervious layer to include the local flow system where the pool riffle form is effective in driving the hyporheic flow tóth 1963 two average mild bed slopes of 0 001736 and 0 003472 were tested as they correspond to a wide range of froude numbers in the subcritical stream flow regime for the surface water discharges tested qsurf 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 m3 s the corresponding froude numbers range from 0 10 to 0 58 and 0 11 to 0 80 for the average bed slope of 0 001736 and 0 003472 with the maximum froude number occurring over the riffle and minimum froude number occurring over the pool a constant manning s n of 0 033 was used for bed roughness the pool and riffle form usually exists in low gradient streams where surface water is shallow in all scenarios the stream width was greater than ten times of the maximum water depth thus the stream was considered as wide channel and the hydraulic radius was approximated to be equal to the water depth in the surface water model to investigate the effect of the vertical position of the impervious layer five average stratum thicknesses d 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 m were tested these were corresponding to a relative stratum thickness ratio λ d ranging between 9 and 144 the hydraulic conductivity of the stratum was kept at constant assuming a homogeneous subsurface stratum 3 methodology 3 1 surface water model the link between the surface water and groundwater is the water heads above the channel bed which was simulated using a 1d surface water model the idealized pool riffle structure was modeled assuming a steady flow condition and the surface discharge lost to or gained from the hyporheic zone is negligible the surface water depths were determined by solving the conservation of energy equation using the standard step method chow 1959 newton raphson method was applied to solve the water heads iteratively the modelled water heads were then used as a constant boundary condition for the groundwater flow model 3 2 groundwater model 3 2 1 1d groundwater model in the 1d groundwater model dupuit assumption was considered valid as the groundwater flow is mainly horizontal groundwater flow was kept laminar re 1 in all scenarios thus darcy s equation was used to account for the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width 2 q x 1 d k h d where h is the hydraulic gradient k is the hydraulic conductivity taken as 1 mm s for gravel delleur 2007 the selected k value is on the large side but still ensures that the seepage discharge is significantly smaller than the surface discharge the upwelling downwelling discharge per unit length dw 1d was given by the slope of the horizontal seepage discharge curve 3 dw 1 d δ q x 1 d δ x where δqx 1d is the difference of horizontal seepage discharges between two consequent computational nodes with a spatial difference of δx the hyporheic flow along one wave length hf 1d was determined as half of the integrated absolute values of the upwelling downwelling discharges assuming that the integrated downwelling and upwelling discharges are equal 4 hf 1 d 0 5 0 λ dw 1 d dx 3 2 2 2d groundwater model in the 2d model the groundwater flow equation reduces to laplace equation in terms of groundwater potential as the flow condition is assumed to be inviscid irrotational steady and incompressible and the saturated porous media was assumed isotropic and homogeneous the boundary fitted coordinate system is appropriate for the non uniform curvilinear grid that literally wrapped around the domain thus was used to transform the grid from the physical x y plane to the computational ξ η plane which involves uniform δξ and δη fletcher 1988 the upstream and lower boundaries of the domain at the vertical plane of the riffle crest and the impervious layer become coordinate lines denoted by ξ and η the transformed 2d laplace equation for the computational domain is 5 h ξ 2 ξ h η 2 η h ξ ξ α h η η γ h ξ η β 0 where h is the groundwater potential or the piezometric head α ξ x 2 ξ y 2 β 2 η x ξ x η y ξ y γ η x 2 η y 2 2 ξ ξ xx ξ yy and 2 η η xx η yy eq 5 was finite differenced and the resulting system of linear equations was solved using gaussian elimination method consequently the computed water heads were transferred back to the physical plane at the corresponding nodes the seepage discharge upwelling downwelling discharge upwelling downwelling location and hyporheic flow were calculated as 6 q x 2 d k h x δ y 7 q y 2 d k h y δ x where qx 2d and qy 2d are the horizontal and vertical seepage discharges per unit width hx and hy are the head gradients along any two consequent nodes where the distance between any two nodes in the x and y directions is δx and δy the total upwelling downwelling discharge was calculated by integrating the vertical seepage discharge at each section thus the hyporheic flow along one wavelength was determined as half of the integration absolute values of the upwelling downwelling discharges for 2d flow assuming that the integrated downwelling and upwelling discharges are equal within the one wavelength 8 hf 2 d 0 5 0 λ 0 d q y 2 d dydx 3 2 3 upwelling downwelling locations and residence time the surface flow enters the substrate at the downwelling location where the hyporheic flow started to travel underground for a distance before leaving the substrate at the upwelling location and re entering the surface water in the 1d groundwater model the mean travel distance l 1d was approximated as the horizontal distance between any two alternative and consequent upwelling downwelling zones where the mean values of the upwelling discharge curve and the downwelling discharge curve exist as shown in fig 2 in the 2d groundwater model the mean travel distance l 2d was approximated as the length of a defined seepage line that divides the amount of flow within the hyporheic zone into two equal parts fig 3 the total difference in water heads through the mean travel distance between the upwelling and downwelling locations were defined as δh 1d and δh 2d for the two models respectively the residence time in the 1d model t 1d can be determined by equating the rate of displacement with darcy s law 9 t 1 d l 1 d 2 k δ h 1 d where the average head gradient within the mean travel distance δh 1d l 1d was used in the darcy s equation similarly the residence time in the 2d model t 2d can be calculated as 10a t 2 d l 2 d 2 k δ h 2 d using the average head gradient to calculate the residence time in the 1d model is adequate however it is more accurate to use the local head gradient δh δx in the 2d model 10b t 2 d 0 l 2 d 1 k δ h δ x d x 3 3 model discretization the model grid discretization was tested for mesh size δx 0 5 0 25 0 125 0 0625 and 0 03125 m the corresponding relative mesh ratios normalized by the wavelength were λ δs 144 288 576 1152 and 2304 respectively the effect of the mesh increment on the horizontal seepage the upwelling downwelling discharges and the residence time of the hyporheic flow path were evaluated the full range of surface water discharge and average stratum thickness as described in the previous section was tested while the only average stream bed slope tested was so 0 003472 results showed that the mesh size of 0 25 m optimized accuracy and solution time when compared to the most accurate finest mesh size of 0 03125 m the relative error in calculating the upwelling downwelling discharges in the 1d and 2d models were within 2 the relative error in calculating the average residence time was within 2 in the 2d model and 6 in the 1d model 4 results and discussion 4 1 example model results example results of the two models are shown in figs 4 and 5 for the case of average stratum thicknesses of 8 m and surface discharges of 1 and 10 m3 s respectively each figure shows the water surface profile the corresponding froude number calculated from the surface water model the seepage flow lines seepage discharge and downwelling discharge as calculated by the groundwater model the positive downwelling discharges indicate that the flow transports from the channel to the underground domain and the negative downwelling discharges mean that the flow moves from the underground domain back again to the channel it can be seen that the width and pattern of the seepage discharge and downwelling discharge are similar in both models the magnitude is larger in the 1d model compared to the 2d model and the difference is more pronounced for the low surface water discharge case 4 2 horizontal seepage discharge the percentage error of the 1d groundwater model in simulating the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width was calculated at the location where the maximum horizontal seepage discharge existed normalized by the value calculated in the reference 2d model fig 6 shows the percentage error of the 1d model plotted against the ratio between the surface water depth and the stratum thickness ym d where ym is the mean surface water depth within one wavelength various presentations of the data were attempted using different combination of parameters of the surface water and the groundwater body the best data collapse was achieved with ym d log log scale was used for a clearer presentation it can be seen that the 1d model always overestimated the horizontal seepage discharge per unit width compared to the 2d model indicated by the positive values of percentage error the percentage error increased as either λ d or ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the maximum error was 35 9 for so 0 001736 and 39 4 for so 0 003472 therefore the 1d groundwater model is less accurate in capturing the horizontal discharge when the stratum thickness is larger the accuracy of the 1d model also decreases as the bed slope gets steeper but to a much less extent compared to the stratum thickness the relationship between the percentage error and ym d can be well described by fitting a simple power equation to the modelled data shown as the solid straight line in fig 6 the regression equations for the power curves are 11 q x 2 d peak q x 1 d peak q x 2 d peak 0 3011 y m d 1 588 s o 0 001736 0 3679 y m d 1 543 s o 0 003472 the applicable range of the 1d model can be determined from these regression equations based on the acceptable error for example an accuracy of within 20 can be achieved with the 1d model for ym d 0 071 and within 10 for ym d 0 110 if the average bed slope is 0 001736 the thresholds of the ratio increase to ym d 0 075 and ym d 0 118 if the average bed slope is 0 003472 it is also interesting to see that the slope of each group of data with the same λ d is different than the overall slope of all data that is the slope caused by the surface water discharge is different than the slope caused by the stratum thickness the difference is particularly larger for the case with steeper bed slope this is likely due to the higher velocity associated with the steep slope case causing stronger dynamic effect of the surface water flow which leads to stronger variation in water surface and more complicated hyporheic flow 4 3 peak upwelling downwelling discharge and hyporheic flow the same approach described above was used to calculate the percentage error of the 1d dupuit model in calculating the peak upwelling downwelling discharges and the hyporheic flow it can be seen from figs 7 9 that the 1d model always produced overestimation in comparison to the reference 2d model the percentage error all increased as λ d or ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the percentage error in calculating the peak downwelling discharge was up to 69 7 for so 0 001736 and 49 9 for so 0 003472 the percentage error was up to 39 0 for so 0 001736 and 42 2 for so 0 003472 when calculating hyporheic flow it is worth noticing that the percentage error in calculating the peak upwelling discharge was much larger which was up to 117 5 for so 0 001736 and 219 9 for so 0 003472 therefore the 1d dupuit model should be used with caution when calculating peak upwelling discharge for cases where stratum thickness is greater the relationship between the percentage error and ym d can be well described by fitting a power curve to the modelled data in most of the cases the fitness was not as good for the peak downwelling discharge with average bed slope of 0 003472 fig 7b again this is likely due to the dynamic effect of surface water in the steeper channel the regression equations for peak downwelling discharge are 12 q y 2 d peak dw 1 d peak q y 2 d peak 0 3424 y m d 1 759 s o 0 001736 0 2549 y m d 1 721 s o 0 003472 for peak upwelling discharge 13 q y 2 d peak dw 1 d peak q y 2 d peak 1 0176 y m d 1 558 s o 0 001736 2 273 y m d 1 444 s o 0 003472 and for hyporheic flow per wavelength 14 hf 2 d hf 1 d hf 2 d 0 3421 y m d 1 619 s o 0 001736 0 3967 y m d 1 573 s o 0 003472 table 1 lists all the threshold values of ym d corresponding to 20 and 10 accuracy of the 1d dupuit model in calculating the peak upwelling downwelling discharge and the hyporheic flow as calculated from the above regression equations a relationship between the 1d and 2d model results of the hyporheic flow per wavelength was established through data regression 15 hf 2 d hf 1 d 0 03786 y m d 0 6811 1 043 r 2 0 9289 this equation allows application of a correction factor to the 1d model result to get a more accurate estimate of hyporheic flow the hyporheic flows obtained from the 1d model corrected with eq 15 are within 10 2 to those calculated with the reference 2d model for all tested scenarios 4 4 upwelling downwelling locations the horizontal distance between the upwelling and downwelling locations denoted as δs uw and δs dw in fig 3 was normalized by the wavelength to obtain the percentage difference between the 1d and 2d models δsdw λ and δs uw λ were plotted against ym d in figs 10 and 11 respectively it can be seen that even though the data does not collapse well to a single curve the percentage error of the 1d model for determining the upwelling downwelling locations are relatively small the maximum percentage error was 2 4 for upwelling location and 5 7 for downwelling location for the full range of the tested parameters therefore the 1d dupuit model provides very good estimation of the upwelling and downwelling locations compared to the reference model 4 5 mean travel distance and residence time the mean travel distance was calculated as the distance between the downwelling and upwelling locations fig 12 shows the mean travel distance normalized by wavelength as calculated in the 1d and 2d models for so 0 001736 it can be seen that the mean travel distance was generally shorter in the 1d model compared to that in the 2d model but the difference diminished as λ d and ym d increased only results for so 0 001736 are shown since similar results were observed for so 0 003472 the residence time calculated by eqs 9 and 10 for the two models respectively was scaled by the residence time in the reference model to get the percentage error of the 1d model fig 13 the percentage error increased with decreasing λ d and ym d again regression equations were developed for the relationship between the percentage error and ym d by fitting a power curve to the modelled data 16 t 2 d t 1 d t 2 d 1 9382 y m d 1 208 s o 0 001736 1 7422 y m d 1 213 s o 0 003472 the correlation coefficients for these regression equations were lower compared to the regression equations previously developed for the other variables r 2 0 8650 and 0 7201 for the two bed slopes based on these equations the thresholds of ym d for 20 and 10 accuracy were estimated and are shown in table 1 as well similar to the hyporheic flow an equation was developed for the purpose of better estimating the residence time using only the 1d model results a relationship between t 1d and t 2d can be obtained from eqs 9 and 10a assuming that the average travel distance in the 2d flow model is proportional to the stratum thickness and the water head gradients in the 1d and the 2d models are approximately equal δ h 1 d δ h 2 d 17 t 2 d c 2 2 t 1 d l 1 d d 2 where the correction coefficient c 2 l 2 d d was determined by linear regression of the 1d and 2d model calculated l d 18 c 2 0 977 l 1 d d 0 9382 r 2 0 9981 the residence time obtained from 1d model corrected with eqs 17 and 18 is within 7 4 of that calculated using the reference model for all tested scenarios 4 6 effect of pool riffle configuration the amplitude of the pool riffle sequence was increased by 50 to assess the effect of different pool riffle configuration the steeper average bed slope so 0 003472 was used for this test the froude number was 0 94 over the riffle and 0 08 over the pool all the other variables were kept at the same as the base configuration fig 14 shows the percentage error of the 1d dupuit model for this new configuration compared to that of the base configuration only the error in the calculated hyporheic flow is shown as an example as previously observed the 1d model always produced overestimation in comparison to the reference 2d model the percentage error increased as ym d decreased for the scenarios tested the percentage error in calculating the hyporheic flow was up to 75 1 in comparison to the 42 2 for the base configuration a power curve fits well to the data for the new pool riffle configuration from which the threshold values of ym d corresponding to 20 and 10 accuracy of the 1d dupuit model were calculated to be 0 155 and 0 246 in comparison to 0 083 and 0 129 for the base configuration the regression equations describing the relationship between the 1d modeling error in each hyporheic flow characteristics and the ym d are limited to the specific pool riffle configuration and should be re developed if the configuration changes 5 conclusion hyporheic zone due to the active interchange between groundwater and surface water has been recognized to be critical to many hydrological and ecological processes 3d modeling methods have been employed to assess the 3d flow patterns and characteristics of the hyporheic zone but their sophistication can be greatly compromised by inaccurate input data and numerical difficulties therefore it is often necessary to make simplifications the objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of vertically averaged approximation against the more complete vertically resolved model a simple 1d groundwater model based on dupuit approach and a 2d groundwater model were developed and applied to the hyporheic zone beneath an idealized periodic pool riffle sequence for a range of stratum thickness average channel bed slope and surface discharge it was found that the vertically averaged 1d model provided comparable results with the 2d reference model for the key characteristics of the hyporheic zone except when the stratum thickness is very large compared to the average surface water flow depth threshold values of relative depth ym d above which the 1d model results are within 20 and 10 of the reference model results were determined for seepage discharge peak downwelling upwelling discharge hyporheic flow and residence time based on the results from the two models correction equations were developed to calculate hyporheic flow and residence time using only information obtained from 1d model with 10 2 and 7 4 accuracy for all tested scenarios therefore it is appropriate to consider using vertically averaged models to simulate hyporheic zone for simple cases where the stratum thickness is not too big and the average bed slope is relatively mild future work can include applying the proposed modeling method to real cases for example the field data and 3d modeling results presented by käser et al 2014 can be used to facilitate a further evaluation of the 1d dupuit model by comparing to the 3d modeling results the simplification in not only the vertical direction but also the horizontal transverse direction can be assessed in addition this study demonstrated that it is promising to apply the dupuit assumption to 2d horizontal domains similar to the 1d model in this study only the surface flow needs to be solved while the hyporheic flow is still estimated by post processing step the computational effort will be significantly reduced compared to a full 3d groundwater model while comparable results can be achieved for a wide range of stream and stratum conditions it is worth noticing that data non smoothness can have an impact on model accuracy since the hyporheic flow is derived as first derivative and the upwelling downwelling discharge is derived as second derivative of the piezometric head numerical evaluation of these derivatives will introduce noise in this study the chosen idealized pool riffle bedform is very smooth and these problems are avoided in practical cases smoothing or filtering will likely be required acknowledgements this work was supported by a grant from the ministry of

7519,frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes is needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities as well as water resources management a multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of these extremes however no single distribution has been accepted as a global standard employing the entropy theory this study derived five generalized distributions for frequency analysis that used different kinds of information encoded as constraints these distributions were the generalized gamma gg the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 and the halphen type a distribution hal a halphen type b distribution hal b and halphen type inverse b distribution hal ib among which the gg and gb2 distribution were previously derived by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 and the halphen family was first derived using entropy theory in this paper the entropy theory allowed to estimate parameters of the distributions in terms of the constraints used for their derivation the distributions were tested using extreme daily and hourly rainfall data results show that the root mean square error rmse values were very small which indicated that the five generalized distributions fitted the extreme rainfall data well among them according to the akaike information criterion aic values generally the gb2 and halphen family gave a better fit therefore those general distributions are one of the best choices for frequency analysis the entropy based derivation led to a new way for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes keywords entropy theory generalized distributions frequency analysis hydrometeorological extremes rainfall 1 introduction frequency analyses of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes are needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities for example rainfall and flood extremes are used for designing urban drainage culverts road embankments parking lots spillways and dams the goal of frequency analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of quantiles corresponding to return periods of specific relevance rao and hamed 2000 although frequency analysis can be done in more than one dimension the current practice entails the employment of univariate frequency analysis univariate frequency analysis in a specific region is usually performed based on an appropriate probability distribution which is selected on the basis of statistical tests for extreme hydrometeorological data collected yoon et al 2013 beven and hornberger 1982 reasoned that selecting a suitable frequency distribution was the key step in frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes a multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes such as gumbel gamma generalized extreme value gev pearson type iii p iii log pearson type iii lp iii weibull and log normal ln some of these distributions have been adopted in different countries for example the pearson type three p iii distribution is recommended in china chen et al 2010 2012 2015 the log pearson type three lpt 3 is used in the u s and the generalized extreme value gev distribution is usually employed in europe however no single distribution has gained global acceptance perreault et al 1999 the traditional method is to try a variety of distributions for the data at hand and choose the best fitted distribution using a particular goodness of fit measure papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 one of the disadvantages of this method is that too many different distributions need to be tried and the selected distribution may be the best based on one goodness of fit criterion but not based on another criterion in order to overcome this disadvantage some generalized frequency distributions have been recently used for hydrometeorological frequency analysis the greatest advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions for example the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 includes exponential weibull and gamma distributions as special cases papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 concluded that the gb2 distribution was a suitable model for rainfall frequency analysis because of its ability to describe both j shaped and bell shaped data in addition papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 investigated the performance of gg distribution and the burr type xii distribution a simplification of the gb2 in a massive analysis of approximately 170 000 monthly daily precipitation records at more than 14 000 stations from all over the globe and demonstrated that those two distributions perform very well with the former even better than the latter entropy theory can be used to derive more generalized distributions using different constraints and provides a unified approach to derive any desired distribution for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes these distributions include commonly used distributions such as gamma distribution pearson type three distribution and gev distribution as well as more generalized distributions singh 1998 the theory also provides a way to estimate distribution parameters from the specified constraints and show connections between different distributions an appropriate probability distribution is derived by maximizing the value of entropy given the observed data and a set of constraints in accordance with the principle of maximum entropy pome chen et al 2013 2014a b when using the entropy theory two problems need to be addressed one is to select appropriate constraints to derive the distribution for a specific location and the other is to estimate distribution parameters using pome singh 1998 which has been shown to be efficient the objective of this study is therefore to derive generalized distributions for hydrometeorological extremes using the entropy theory estimate their parameters using pome choose the most appropriate distribution and test the distributions using annual maximum hourly and daily precipitation data from mississippi river basin usa 2 entropy theory entropy is a measure of uncertainty of a random variable or its probability distribution for a continuous random variable x such as rainfall or streamflow it is greater than 0 therefore the domain ranges from 0 to the shannon entropy of x h x can be expressed as shannon 1948 1 h x 0 f x log f x d x where f x is the probability density function pdf of x the objective is to derive f x which is done by maximizing entropy subject to given information expressed as constraints in concert with the principle of maximum entropy singh 2011 2013 2015 thus the entropy based method can be expressed as 2 maxh x 0 f x d x 1 0 g i x f x d x c i i 1 m where gi x is some function of x and c i is the expectation of gi x pome states that the most appropriate pdf is the one that maximizes entropy for given data and constraints for different constraints different distributions are obtained in other words for a given set of constraints a unique distribution can be defined therefore finding appropriate constraints is critical to the pome based method singh 2013 2015 employing the method of lagrange multipliers the pdf of x from eqs 1 and 2 can be derived as 3 f x exp λ 0 λ 1 g 1 x λ 2 g 2 x λ m g m x where m is the number of constraints and λ0 λm are the lagrange multipliers eq 3 shows that the choice of constraints is fundamental for deriving distributions five pairs of constraints were considered in this study which lead to the generalized gamma distribution generalized beta distribution of the second kind and halphen family of distributions including types a b and ib the method of derivation is now illustrated for these distributions 3 entropy based derivation of generalized distributions in this section an entropy based derivation of five generalized distributions is developed parameters of these distributions were determined using the principle of maximum entropy pome first a generalized distribution is given second based on specific constraints the probability density function is defined using the maximum entropy method described in section 2 third the equations that can be used to estimate the parameters are derived in the appendix we derive the relation between lagrange multipliers and constraints the relation between lagrange multipliers and parameters and the relation between parameters and constraints 3 1 derivation of generalized gamma distribution 3 1 1 generalized gamma distribution the generalized gamma distribution gg was first introduced by stacy 1962 who also proposed a parameter estimation method for gg distribution stacy and mihram 1965 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 used the generalized gamma distribution for rainfall frequency analysis across the world and showed that this distribution was appropriate for worldwide rainfall data in this section the gg distribution was discussed let x be a random variable and x be its specific value the probability density function pdf of the generalized gamma gg distribution is given by 4 f x r 2 β γ r 1 r 2 x β r 1 1 exp x β r 2 where γ is the gamma function r 1 and r 2 are the shape parameters r 1 0 r 2 0 and β is the scale parameter β 0 3 1 2 derivation of generalized gamma distributions using entropy method the gg distribution parameters were determined using the principle of maximum entropy pome papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 proposed to use ln x and x q as constraints which can be expressed as 5a 0 f x d x 1 5b 0 f x ln x d x e ln x 5c 0 f x x q d x e x q if g 1 x ln x and g 2 x x q then the pdf of x can be obtained from eq 3 as 6 f x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x q the derivation of gg distribution from eq 6 is discussed below substitution of eq 6 in eq 5a yields 7 0 f x d x 0

exp λ 2 x q let λ 1 1 q r 1 r 2 and λ 2 1 β r 2 then r 2 q and r 1 λ 1 1 eq 10 can now be written as 11 f x r 2 1 β r 2 r 1 r 2 γ r 1 r 2 x r 1 1 exp 1 β r 2 x r 2 r 2 β γ r 1 r 2 x β r 1 1 exp x β r 2 eq 11 is the same as the generalized gamma distribution given by eq 4 according to the deduction in the appendix the following relationships can be obtained to estimate the parameters of the gg distribution from the specified constraints 12 1 r 2 ln β r 2 1 r 2 φ r 1 r 2 e ln x β r 2 r 1 r 2 e ln x r 2 1 r 2 2 φ r 1 r 2 var ln x where φ is the digamma function and φ is the tri gamma function eq 16 shows that the gg parameters can be obtained from the specified constraints 3 2 derivation of generalized beta distribution of the second kind 3 2 1 generalized beta distribution of the second kind the generalized beta distribution of the second kind was first used in hydrology by mielke and johnson 1974 then papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 used the generalized beta distribution of the second kind for rainfall frequency analysis across the world and showed that this distribution was appropriate for worldwide rainfall data let x be a random variable and x be its specific value the pdf of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 is given by 13 f x r 3 b b r 1 r 2 x b r 1 r 3 1 1 x b r 3 r 2 r 1 where b is the beta function r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the shape parameters r 1 0 r 2 0 and r 3 0 and b is the scale parameter b 0 3 2 2 derivation of generalized gamma distributions using entropy method for the gb2 distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 proposed ln x and ln 1 px q 1 p as constraints which can be expressed as 14a 0 f x d x 1 14b 0 f x ln x d x e ln x 14c 0 f x ln 1 px q 1 p d x e ln 1 px q 1 p with the use of these constraints the pdf of x can be obtained from eq 3 as 15 f x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 ln 1 px q 1 p the derivation of gb2 distribution from eq 15 is now discussed substitution of eq 15 in eq 14a yields 16 0 f x d x 0 exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ

parameter r 3 represents the overall shape parameter r 1 governs the left tail parameter r 2 controls the right tail and b is a scale parameter these parameters allow the distribution to be able to fit data having very different histogram shapes parameters r 1 and r 2 together determine the skewness of the distribution by fixing certain parameters the gb2 distribution can yield some well known distributions such as the beta distribution of the second kind b2 the burr type xii generalized gamma gg and so on these distributions can be treated as special or limiting cases of the gb2 distribution as shown in fig 1 mcdonald and butler 1987 according to the deduction in the appendix he following equation was derived to estimate the parameters of the gb2 distribution from the specified constraints 23 ln β 1 r 3 φ r 1 1 r 3 φ r 2 e ln x φ r 2 φ r 1 r 2 e ln 1 x β r 3 1 r 3 2 φ r 1 1 γ 3 2 φ r 2 var ln x φ r 2 φ r 1 r 2 var ln 1 x β r 3 3 3 derivation of halphen distribution family 3 3 1 halphen distribution family the halphen family of distributions introduced by halphen 1941 is a flexible and complete system to fit observations that are independent and identically distributed chebana et al 2010 the family has three kinds of distributions namely halphen type a halphen type b and halphen type inverse b which were briefly introduced by seshadri 2006 it has recently been shown that this family of distributions represents a potential alternative to the generalized extreme value gev distribution to model extreme hydrometeorological and hydrological events chebana et al 2010 bobée et al 1994 and bobée and rasmussen 1995 indicates that the halphen family of distributions which are not yet familiar to hydrologists would probably make them more popular in the future because of the appealing statistical properties of these distributions perreault et al 1999 presented the halphen family for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes they concluded that these three distributions provided sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets the pdf of the halphen type a hal a distribution is given by 24 f x 1 2 m v k v 2 α x v 1

the timescales range from hourly to yearly the daily timescale is important for hydrological design since thousands of records exist and some of them are over a century long papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 the united states historical climatology network ushc provides high quality daily and monthly precipitation records mishra and singh 2010 daily rainfall data from several gauging station was used in this study the annual maximum daily series were extracted for frequency analysis and detailed information of daily data is shown in table 1 in addition hourly rainfall data was used since usually rainfall does not occur for the whole day and hourly data can reflect much more information about the characteristics of rainfall hourly rainfall data was obtained from the noaa s national weather service and these data are of high quality and have been used for precipitation frequency analysis by the hydrometeorological design studies center the annual maximum am data was sampled and detailed information of am hourly data is also shown in table 1 4 2 fitting different distributions to data the gg gb2 halphen a halphen b and halphen ib distributions with parameters estimated as discussed earlier were fitted to the observed distributions of daily and hourly annual maximum rainfall series a full newton method was used to find the solution of the non linear equation set derived before the nleqslv package in r language was used to solve the equation set the initial value was set as 1 for all potential parameters the parameters were estimated by pome for canton 221389 and arkabutla dam station 220237 as listed in table 2 4 3 goodness of fit measures for assessing the performance of the generalized distributions quantitatively the root mean square error rmse between the empirical probabilities and theoretical probabilities was calculated the rmse values are frequently used for measuring the difference between empirical and theoretical values if the theoretical distribution fits the data well the rmse values should be small in addition rmse can estimate the performance of the distributions with the same number of parameters if the distribution families under comparison do not have the same number of parameters then the akaike information criterion aic is more appropriate the root mean square error rmse was calculated by 54 rmse p 1 n i 1 n p emp p the 2 where p emp i is the empirical probability of an observed data point x i where i denotes the i th smallest observation p the i representing the values of p x x i is the theoretical probability of the observed data and n is the sample size a smaller value indicates better model performance the empirical probabilities of observed data p emp were computed by the gringorten plotting position formula as 55 p emp i i 0 44 n 0 12 where pemp i is the cumulative empirical frequency the probability that a given value is less than the ith smallest observation in the data set of n observations second the aic value was calculated as 56 aic 2 ln l 2 k where k is the number of parameters of a given model and l is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the given model 4 4 evaluation of models 4 4 1 evaluations of the fitting performance first the adequacy of parameter estimation equations was evaluated substituting the estimated parameters into the equations derived by pome method it is seen that the left hand side of these equations equals the right hand side which demonstrates that solutions of the sets of equations are correct in order to testify the performance of these distributions rmse was calculated for daily and hourly data and results are given in tables 3 and 4 for all the stations the rmse values ranged from 0 014 to 0 08 the mean values of rmse for all the involved stations were 0 0345 which were not large indicating that the theoretical probability was approaching the empirical probability results of fitting for daily values for canton 221389 station are shown in fig 2 which indicates that all the five generalized distributions fitted the observed data well and the differences between observed and fitted distributions were not large most of the generalized distributions fitted the data well in order to select the best fitted distribution for each data series the aic values were used for model selection as given in tables 3 and 4 compared with the gg distribution the gb2 and halphen family distributions gave a better fit for daily and hourly data for daily data generally the halphen a distribution fitted better than the other halphen distributions for hourly data however the haplhen ib distribution fitted better than the other halphen distributions for example for daily data from canton 221389 station the gb2 and hal a distributions performed better and for hourly data from arkabutla dam station 220237 the gb2 and hal ib distributions performed better observed histograms of daily and hourly annual maximum rainfall series and fitted pdfs are shown in fig 3 which shows some differences when using different distributions therefore for each series it is better to select the best fitted distribution for design rainfall calculation according to the data sets from the 12 stations it is indicated that the gb2 and halphen distributions were more appropriate for rainfall frequency analysis besides the five generalized distributions mentioned above the four parameter kappa was also considered in this study the 4 parameter kappa family of distributions is an interesting one because it includes many useful distributions frequently used in hydrological frequency analysis such as the gev the generalized pareto and the generalized logistic therefore this distribution was applied to daily and hourly data results given in tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that the kappa distribution fitted better the six generalized distributions were therefore comparable 4 4 2 comparisons between the maximum likelihood and pome methods for parameter estimation the maximum likelihood ml estimation is widely used for parameter estimation in order to compare the proposed pome method with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method both methods were used to estimate the parameters of the five generalized distributions for daily data from the site forest 223107 the rmse and aic values were calculated as listed in table 5 which indicated that for gb2 hal b and hal ib distributions the rmse and aic values obtained by the pome method were smaller and for the gg and hal a distributions the rmse and aic values obtained by the two methods were nearly the same therefore the proposed pome method is slightly better than the traditional mle method in order to further compare the pome method with the traditional mle method a simulation test was carried out take the gb2 as an example the samples were generated from a pre defined gb2 distribution and the parameters of gb2 distribution were set as r 1 2 r 2 2 5 r 3 3 and β 3 5 the sample sizes are equal to 100 and 200 respectively the pome and mle methods were used to estimate the parameters of the generated samples the whole simulation test with the sample sizes 100 and 200 respectively was repeated for 100 times the mean standard deviation and variation of the parameters estimated by pome and mle methods were calculated as shown in table 6 the mean fitting results for the 100 time simulation test were evaluated using rmse aic and k s test and the results are given in table 7 it is indicated from table 6 that the mean values standard deviation sd variance bias of the estimated parameters based on the two methods do not show significant differences from the goodness of fit measures the rmse aic and k s values of the two methods are nearly the same actually sometime the mle method give a better fit and sometime the pome method gives a getter fit according to the simulation results of the 100 tests for each sample size the two methods are comparable however the resolution of the mle system is complex because it requires some manipulations of the derivatives of the certain functions such as bessel and exponential factorial for halphen systems therefore the pome method is recommended in this study 4 4 3 comparisons of different distributions the proposed generalized distributions were compared with the commonly used 11 distributions including exponential distribution gamma distribution gev distribution generalized logistic glo distribution generalized normal gno distribution generalized pareto gpa distribution gumbel distribution three parameter lognormal ln3 distribution normal distribution pearson type three distribution and weibull distribution the results are given in table 9 which indicate that the rmse value of gb2 distribution is the smallest but the aic value of the hal a distribution is the smallest therefore the generalized distribution fitted better than the commonly used distributions 4 4 4 calculation of t year design rainfall the t year design values of the daily data from canton gauging and hourly data from arkabutla dam were calculated as given in table 9 which indicates that the difference is large when selecting different distributions for t year design rainfall calculation in the following the canton gauging station was taken as an example to illustrate the behavior of the generalized distribution besides the aic and rmse values from table 3 it is indicated that compared with the four generalized distributions discussed in this study the hal a give a better fit for the canton station however for the hydrological frequency analysis we mainly focus on the hydrometeorological extreme events and want to derive the magnitudes of the t year design rainfall or flood since the interest is for large return periods t generally larger than 100 years which is located in the tail of the distribution the extreme value modeling is associated to the study of distributions with tail behavior papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 demonstrated that heavier tailed distributions were in better agreement with the observed rainfall extremes than the more often used lighter tailed distributions a heavy tail means that this kind of the distribution produces outliers at a greater rate a light tail means that this kind of the distribution produces outliers at a reduced rate embrechts et al 2003 divided the heavy tail behavior types into several chasses namely class e for exponential tail type class d for subexponential distribution and class c for regularly varying distributions class b for pareto tail class a for stable distributions gg distribution belongs to the class c of regularly varying distributions el adlouni et al 2008 gb2 distribution was assigned to the class c of regularly varying distributions hal a and hal b distribution belong to the class d of subexponential distributions and hal ib belongs to the class c of regularly varying distributions fig 4 displayed the distributions classed with respect to their tail behaviors in probability theory heavy tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are heavier than the exponential distribution asmussen 2003 from this point of view these five generalized distributions discussed in this paper belonging to heavy tailed distribution the tail index for class c namely gg gb2 and halphen ib is great than zero as shown in fig 4 compared with halphen ib gg and gb2 distributions the tail behaviors of halphen a and b distributions are lighter tailed therefore for the gg gb2 and halphen ib distributions a heavier tail behavior can be simulated based on different distribution parameters recent global analyses on extremes papalexiou et al 2013 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2013 serinaldi kilsby 2014 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2016 show that the heavy tailed distribution is more suitable since the halphen a and b distributions are lighter tailed and halphen a distribution was recommended for the canton station it is better to check the tail behavior before application the p p plot calculated by hal a distribution for the canton station was drawn and given in fig 5 in which the formula log 1 f x has been used to calculate the empirical and theoretical probabilities values shown in x axis and y axis it is indicated that the hal a distribution fits the data well and no obvious heavy tail behavior is shown for extreme rainfall frequency analysis we focus on the largest rainfall sample among the whole rainfall data set the three largest rainfall samples were given in table 10 their corresponding theoretical probabilities based on the five generalized distributions were also given in table 8 as well it is indicated from table 10 that the results based on the gb2 and hal a distributions are nearly the same and the probabilities calculated by hal a are greater than the empirical ones which it is indicated that the fitting curve is higher than the empirical plot in addition the length of the data is 117 years the largest rainfall values within the study period is 6 8 in from table 9 the estimated 100 year design rainfall values based on hal a distribution is 6 82 in according to the analysis above if the hal a distribution used it cannot underestimate the design rainfall values for the canton station 5 conclusions using entropy theory this paper derives five generalized distributions for hydrometeorological extremes estimates their parameters and chooses the most appropriate distribution based on the rmse and aic values daily and hourly rainfall data from 12 stations were selected for testing the distributions the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the generalized distributions including the gg gb2 hal a hal b and hal ib distributions use different constraints the pome method was introduced here to estimate the parameters of the five generalized distributions relations between distribution parameters and constraints and relations between lagrange multipliers and constraints were deduced then relations between parameters and constraints were obtained which can be used for parameter estimation results of fitting between observed and theoretical data show that the estimated parameters were reasonable the five generalized distributions fitted extreme rainfall data well and can be chosen for frequency analysis for daily data used in this study the gb2 and hal a distributions are better than other distributions for hourly data used in this study the gb2 and hal ib distributions were better than the gg hal a and hal b distributions generally the gb2 and halphen family distributions give a better fit the proposed pome method was compared with the traditional mle method results show that the two methods are comparable although the mle method only requires the pdf of the generalized distribution it needs some more manipulations of the derivatives of the certain functions the pome method proposed in this study only needs to find the solutions of the derived equations set all the analysis in this study was carried out by assuming that the past and future data sets are stationary and have no apparent trend however many studies such as dominguez et al 2012 donat et al 2016 and min et al 2011 indicated the non stationarities for the future of precipitation extremes thus a non stationary approach for constructing the distributions may be an option for hydrometeorological frequency analysis in the future acknowledgement this

7519,frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes is needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities as well as water resources management a multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of these extremes however no single distribution has been accepted as a global standard employing the entropy theory this study derived five generalized distributions for frequency analysis that used different kinds of information encoded as constraints these distributions were the generalized gamma gg the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 and the halphen type a distribution hal a halphen type b distribution hal b and halphen type inverse b distribution hal ib among which the gg and gb2 distribution were previously derived by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 and the halphen family was first derived using entropy theory in this paper the entropy theory allowed to estimate parameters of the distributions in terms of the constraints used for their derivation the distributions were tested using extreme daily and hourly rainfall data results show that the root mean square error rmse values were very small which indicated that the five generalized distributions fitted the extreme rainfall data well among them according to the akaike information criterion aic values generally the gb2 and halphen family gave a better fit therefore those general distributions are one of the best choices for frequency analysis the entropy based derivation led to a new way for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes keywords entropy theory generalized distributions frequency analysis hydrometeorological extremes rainfall 1 introduction frequency analyses of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes are needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities for example rainfall and flood extremes are used for designing urban drainage culverts road embankments parking lots spillways and dams the goal of frequency analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of quantiles corresponding to return periods of specific relevance rao and hamed 2000 although frequency analysis can be done in more than one dimension the current practice entails the employment of univariate frequency analysis univariate frequency analysis in a specific region is usually performed based on an appropriate probability distribution which is selected on the basis of statistical tests for extreme hydrometeorological data collected yoon et al 2013 beven and hornberger 1982 reasoned that selecting a suitable frequency distribution was the key step in frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes a multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes such as gumbel gamma generalized extreme value gev pearson type iii p iii log pearson type iii lp iii weibull and log normal ln some of these distributions have been adopted in different countries for example the pearson type three p iii distribution is recommended in china chen et al 2010 2012 2015 the log pearson type three lpt 3 is used in the u s and the generalized extreme value gev distribution is usually employed in europe however no single distribution has gained global acceptance perreault et al 1999 the traditional method is to try a variety of distributions for the data at hand and choose the best fitted distribution using a particular goodness of fit measure papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 one of the disadvantages of this method is that too many different distributions need to be tried and the selected distribution may be the best based on one goodness of fit criterion but not based on another criterion in order to overcome this disadvantage some generalized frequency distributions have been recently used for hydrometeorological frequency analysis the greatest advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions for example the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 includes exponential weibull and gamma distributions as special cases papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 concluded that the gb2 distribution was a suitable model for rainfall frequency analysis because of its ability to describe both j shaped and bell shaped data in addition papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 investigated the performance of gg distribution and the burr type xii distribution a simplification of the gb2 in a massive analysis of approximately 170 000 monthly daily precipitation records at more than 14 000 stations from all over the globe and demonstrated that those two distributions perform very well with the former even better than the latter entropy theory can be used to derive more generalized distributions using different constraints and provides a unified approach to derive any desired distribution for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes these distributions include commonly used distributions such as gamma distribution pearson type three distribution and gev distribution as well as more generalized distributions singh 1998 the theory also provides a way to estimate distribution parameters from the specified constraints and show connections between different distributions an appropriate probability distribution is derived by maximizing the value of entropy given the observed data and a set of constraints in accordance with the principle of maximum entropy pome chen et al 2013 2014a b when using the entropy theory two problems need to be addressed one is to select appropriate constraints to derive the distribution for a specific location and the other is to estimate distribution parameters using pome singh 1998 which has been shown to be efficient the objective of this study is therefore to derive generalized distributions for hydrometeorological extremes using the entropy theory estimate their parameters using pome choose the most appropriate distribution and test the distributions using annual maximum hourly and daily precipitation data from mississippi river basin usa 2 entropy theory entropy is a measure of uncertainty of a random variable or its probability distribution for a continuous random variable x such as rainfall or streamflow it is greater than 0 therefore the domain ranges from 0 to the shannon entropy of x h x can be expressed as shannon 1948 1 h x 0 f x log f x d x where f x is the probability density function pdf of x the objective is to derive f x which is done by maximizing entropy subject to given information expressed as constraints in concert with the principle of maximum entropy singh 2011 2013 2015 thus the entropy based method can be expressed as 2 maxh x 0 f x d x 1 0 g i x f x d x c i i 1 m where gi x is some function of x and c i is the expectation of gi x pome states that the most appropriate pdf is the one that maximizes entropy for given data and constraints for different constraints different distributions are obtained in other words for a given set of constraints a unique distribution can be defined therefore finding appropriate constraints is critical to the pome based method singh 2013 2015 employing the method of lagrange multipliers the pdf of x from eqs 1 and 2 can be derived as 3 f x exp λ 0 λ 1 g 1 x λ 2 g 2 x λ m g m x where m is the number of constraints and λ0 λm are the lagrange multipliers eq 3 shows that the choice of constraints is fundamental for deriving distributions five pairs of constraints were considered in this study which lead to the generalized gamma distribution generalized beta distribution of the second kind and halphen family of distributions including types a b and ib the method of derivation is now illustrated for these distributions 3 entropy based derivation of generalized distributions in this section an entropy based derivation of five generalized distributions is developed parameters of these distributions were determined using the principle of maximum entropy pome first a generalized distribution is given second based on specific constraints the probability density function is defined using the maximum entropy method described in section 2 third the equations that can be used to estimate the parameters are derived in the appendix we derive the relation between lagrange multipliers and constraints the relation between lagrange multipliers and parameters and the relation between parameters and constraints 3 1 derivation of generalized gamma distribution 3 1 1 generalized gamma distribution the generalized gamma distribution gg was first introduced by stacy 1962 who also proposed a parameter estimation method for gg distribution stacy and mihram 1965 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 used the generalized gamma distribution for rainfall frequency analysis across the world and showed that this distribution was appropriate for worldwide rainfall data in this section the gg distribution was discussed let x be a random variable and x be its specific value the probability density function pdf of the generalized gamma gg distribution is given by 4 f x r 2 β γ r 1 r 2 x β r 1 1 exp x β r 2 where γ is the gamma function r 1 and r 2 are the shape parameters r 1 0 r 2 0 and β is the scale parameter β 0 3 1 2 derivation of generalized gamma distributions using entropy method the gg distribution parameters were determined using the principle of maximum entropy pome papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 proposed to use ln x and x q as constraints which can be expressed as 5a 0 f x d x 1 5b 0 f x ln x d x e ln x 5c 0 f x x q d x e x q if g 1 x ln x and g

exp λ 2 x q let λ 1 1 q r 1 r 2 and λ 2 1 β r 2 then r 2 q and r 1 λ 1 1 eq 10 can now be written as 11 f x r 2 1 β r 2 r 1 r 2 γ r 1 r 2 x r 1 1 exp 1 β r 2 x r 2 r 2 β γ r 1 r 2 x β r 1 1 exp x β r 2 eq 11 is the same as the generalized gamma distribution given by eq 4 according to the deduction in the appendix the following relationships can be obtained to estimate the parameters of the gg distribution from the specified constraints 12 1 r 2 ln β r 2 1 r 2 φ r 1 r 2 e ln x β r 2 r 1 r 2 e ln x r 2 1 r 2 2 φ r 1 r 2 var ln x where φ is the digamma function and φ is the tri gamma function eq 16 shows that the gg parameters can be obtained from the specified constraints 3 2 derivation of generalized beta distribution of the second kind 3 2 1 generalized beta distribution of the second kind the generalized beta distribution of the second kind was first used in hydrology by mielke and johnson 1974 then papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 used the generalized beta distribution of the second kind for rainfall frequency analysis across the world and showed that this distribution was appropriate for worldwide rainfall data let x be a random variable and x be its specific value the pdf of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind gb2 is given by 13 f x r 3 b b r 1 r 2 x b r 1 r 3 1 1 x b r 3 r 2 r 1 where b is the beta function r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the shape parameters r 1 0 r 2 0 and r 3 0 and b is the scale parameter b 0 3 2 2 derivation of generalized gamma distributions using entropy method for the gb2 distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 proposed ln x

parameter r 3 represents the overall shape parameter r 1 governs the left tail parameter r 2 controls the right tail and b is a scale parameter these parameters allow the distribution to be able to fit data having very different histogram shapes parameters r 1 and r 2 together determine the skewness of the distribution by fixing certain parameters the gb2 distribution can yield some well known distributions such as the beta distribution of the second kind b2 the burr type xii generalized gamma gg and so on these distributions can be treated as special or limiting cases of the gb2 distribution as shown in fig 1 mcdonald and butler 1987 according to the deduction in the appendix he following equation was derived to estimate the parameters of the gb2 distribution from the specified constraints 23 ln β 1 r 3 φ r 1 1 r 3 φ r 2 e ln x φ r 2 φ r 1 r 2 e ln 1 x β r 3 1 r 3 2 φ r 1 1 γ 3 2 φ r 2 var ln x φ r 2 φ r 1 r 2 var ln 1 x β r 3 3 3 derivation of halphen distribution family 3 3 1 halphen distribution family the halphen family of distributions introduced by halphen 1941 is a flexible and complete system to fit observations that are independent and identically distributed chebana et al 2010 the family has three kinds of distributions namely halphen type a halphen type b and halphen type inverse b which were briefly introduced by seshadri 2006 it has recently been shown that this family of distributions represents a potential alternative to the generalized extreme value gev distribution to model extreme hydrometeorological and hydrological events chebana et al 2010 bobée et al 1994 and bobée and rasmussen 1995 indicates that the halphen family of distributions which are not yet familiar to hydrologists would probably make them more popular in the future because of the appealing statistical properties of these distributions perreault et al 1999 presented the halphen family for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes they concluded that these three distributions provided sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets the pdf of the halphen type a hal a distribution is given by 24 f x 1 2 m v k v 2 α x v 1

the timescales range from hourly to yearly the daily timescale is important for hydrological design since thousands of records exist and some of them are over a century long papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 the united states historical climatology network ushc provides high quality daily and monthly precipitation records mishra and singh 2010 daily rainfall data from several gauging station was used in this study the annual maximum daily series were extracted for frequency analysis and detailed information of daily data is shown in table 1 in addition hourly rainfall data was used since usually rainfall does not occur for the whole day and hourly data can reflect much more information about the characteristics of rainfall hourly rainfall data was obtained from the noaa s national weather service and these data are of high quality and have been used for precipitation frequency analysis by the hydrometeorological design studies center the annual maximum am data was sampled and detailed information of am hourly data is also shown in table 1 4 2 fitting different distributions to data the gg gb2 halphen a halphen b and halphen ib distributions with parameters estimated as discussed earlier were fitted to the observed distributions of daily and hourly annual maximum rainfall series a full newton method was used to find the solution of the non linear equation set derived before the nleqslv package in r language was used to solve the equation set the initial value was set as 1 for all potential parameters the parameters were estimated by pome for canton 221389 and arkabutla dam station 220237 as listed in table 2 4 3 goodness of fit measures for assessing the performance of the generalized distributions quantitatively the root mean square error rmse between the empirical probabilities and theoretical probabilities was calculated the rmse values are frequently used for measuring the difference between empirical and theoretical values if the theoretical distribution fits the data well the rmse values should be small in addition rmse can estimate the performance of the distributions with the same number of parameters if the distribution families under comparison do not have the same number of parameters then the akaike information criterion aic is more appropriate the root mean square error rmse was calculated by 54 rmse p 1 n i 1 n p emp p the 2 where p emp i is the empirical probability of an observed data point x i where i denotes the i th smallest observation p the i representing the values of p x x i is the theoretical probability of the observed data and n is the sample size a smaller value indicates better model performance the empirical probabilities of observed data p emp were computed by the gringorten plotting position formula as 55 p emp i i 0 44 n 0 12 where pemp i is the cumulative empirical frequency the probability that a given value is less than the ith smallest observation in the data set of n observations second the aic value was calculated as 56 aic 2 ln l 2 k where k is the number of parameters of a given model and l is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the given model 4 4 evaluation of models 4 4 1 evaluations of the fitting performance first the adequacy of parameter estimation equations was evaluated substituting the estimated parameters into the equations derived by pome method it is seen that the left hand side of these equations equals the right hand side which demonstrates that solutions of the sets of equations are correct in order to testify the performance of these distributions rmse was calculated for daily and hourly data and results are given in tables 3 and 4 for all the stations the rmse values ranged from 0 014 to 0 08 the mean values of rmse for all the involved stations were 0 0345 which were not large indicating that the theoretical probability was approaching the empirical probability results of fitting for daily values for canton 221389 station are shown in fig 2 which indicates that all the five generalized distributions fitted the observed data well and the differences between observed and fitted distributions were not large most of the generalized distributions fitted the data well in order to select the best fitted distribution for each data series the aic values were used for model selection as given in tables 3 and 4 compared with the gg distribution the gb2 and halphen family distributions gave a better fit for daily and hourly data for daily data generally the halphen a distribution fitted better than the other halphen distributions for hourly data however the haplhen ib distribution fitted better than the other halphen distributions for example for daily data from canton 221389 station the gb2 and hal a distributions performed better and for hourly data from arkabutla dam station 220237 the gb2 and hal ib distributions performed better observed histograms of daily and hourly annual maximum rainfall series and fitted pdfs are shown in fig 3 which shows some differences when using different distributions therefore for each series it is better to select the best fitted distribution for design rainfall calculation according to the data sets from the 12 stations it is indicated that the gb2 and halphen distributions were more appropriate for rainfall frequency analysis besides the five generalized distributions mentioned above the four parameter kappa was also considered in this study the 4 parameter kappa family of distributions is an interesting one because it includes many useful distributions frequently used in hydrological frequency analysis such as the gev the generalized pareto and the generalized logistic therefore this distribution was applied to daily and hourly data results given in tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that the kappa distribution fitted better the six generalized distributions were therefore comparable 4 4 2 comparisons between the maximum likelihood and pome methods for parameter estimation the maximum likelihood ml estimation is widely used for parameter estimation in order to compare the proposed pome method with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method both methods were used to estimate the parameters of the five generalized distributions for daily data from the site forest 223107 the rmse and aic values were calculated as listed in table 5 which indicated that for gb2 hal b and hal ib distributions the rmse and aic values obtained by the pome method were smaller and for the gg and hal a distributions the rmse and aic values obtained by the two methods were nearly the same therefore the proposed pome method is slightly better than the traditional mle method in order to further compare the pome method with the traditional mle method a simulation test was carried out take the gb2 as an example the samples were generated from a pre defined gb2 distribution and the parameters of gb2 distribution were set as r 1 2 r 2 2 5 r 3 3 and β 3 5 the sample sizes are equal to 100 and 200 respectively the pome and mle methods were used to estimate the parameters of the generated samples the whole simulation test with the sample sizes 100 and 200 respectively was repeated for 100 times the mean standard deviation and variation of the parameters estimated by pome and mle methods were calculated as shown in table 6 the mean fitting results for the 100 time simulation test were evaluated using rmse aic and k s test and the results are given in table 7 it is indicated from table 6 that the mean values standard deviation sd variance bias of the estimated parameters based on the two methods do not show significant differences from the goodness of fit measures the rmse aic and k s values of the two methods are nearly the same actually sometime the mle method give a better fit and sometime the pome method gives a getter fit according to the simulation results of the 100 tests for each sample size the two methods are comparable however the resolution of the mle system is complex because it requires some manipulations of the derivatives of the certain functions such as bessel and exponential factorial for halphen systems therefore the pome method is recommended in this study 4 4 3 comparisons of different distributions the proposed generalized distributions were compared with the commonly used 11 distributions including exponential distribution gamma distribution gev distribution generalized logistic glo distribution generalized normal gno distribution generalized pareto gpa distribution gumbel distribution three parameter lognormal ln3 distribution normal distribution pearson type three distribution and weibull distribution the results are given in table 9 which indicate that the rmse value of gb2 distribution is the smallest but the aic value of the hal a distribution is the smallest therefore the generalized distribution fitted better than the commonly used distributions 4 4 4 calculation of t year design rainfall the t year design values of the daily data from canton gauging and hourly data from arkabutla dam were calculated as given in table 9 which indicates that the difference is large when selecting different distributions for t year design rainfall calculation in the following the canton gauging station was taken as an example to illustrate the behavior of the generalized distribution besides the aic and rmse values from table 3 it is indicated that compared with the four generalized distributions discussed in this study the hal a give a better fit for the canton station however for the hydrological frequency analysis we mainly focus on the hydrometeorological extreme events and want to derive the magnitudes of the t year design rainfall or flood since the interest is for large return periods t generally larger than 100 years which is located in the tail of the distribution the extreme value modeling is associated to the study of distributions with tail behavior papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 demonstrated that heavier tailed distributions were in better agreement with the observed rainfall extremes than the more often used lighter tailed distributions a heavy tail means that this kind of the distribution produces outliers at a greater rate a light tail means that this kind of the distribution produces outliers at a reduced rate embrechts et al 2003 divided the heavy tail behavior types into several chasses namely class e for exponential tail type class d for subexponential distribution and class c for regularly varying distributions class b for pareto tail class a for stable distributions gg distribution belongs to the class c of regularly varying distributions el adlouni et al 2008 gb2 distribution was assigned to the class c of regularly varying distributions hal a and hal b distribution belong to the class d of subexponential distributions and hal ib belongs to the class c of regularly varying distributions fig 4 displayed the distributions classed with respect to their tail behaviors in probability theory heavy tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are heavier than the exponential distribution asmussen 2003 from this point of view these five generalized distributions discussed in this paper belonging to heavy tailed distribution the tail index for class c namely gg gb2 and halphen ib is great than zero as shown in fig 4 compared with halphen ib gg and gb2 distributions the tail behaviors of halphen a and b distributions are lighter tailed therefore for the gg gb2 and halphen ib distributions a heavier tail behavior can be simulated based on different distribution parameters recent global analyses on extremes papalexiou et al 2013 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2013 serinaldi kilsby 2014 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2016 show that the heavy tailed distribution is more suitable since the halphen a and b distributions are lighter tailed and halphen a distribution was recommended for the canton station it is better to check the tail behavior before application the p p plot calculated by hal a distribution for the canton station was drawn and given in fig 5 in which the formula log 1 f x has been used to calculate the empirical and theoretical probabilities values shown in x axis and y axis it is indicated that the hal a distribution fits the data well and no obvious heavy tail behavior is shown for extreme rainfall frequency analysis we focus on the largest rainfall sample among the whole rainfall data set the three largest rainfall samples were given in table 10 their corresponding theoretical probabilities based on the five generalized distributions were also given in table 8 as well it is indicated from table 10 that the results based on the gb2 and hal a distributions are nearly the same and the probabilities calculated by hal a are greater than the empirical ones which it is indicated that the fitting curve is higher than the empirical plot in addition the length of the data is 117 years the largest rainfall values within the study period is 6 8 in from table 9 the estimated 100 year design rainfall values based on hal a distribution is 6 82 in according to the analysis above if the hal a distribution used it cannot underestimate the design rainfall values for the canton station 5 conclusions using entropy theory this paper derives five generalized distributions for hydrometeorological extremes estimates their parameters and chooses the most appropriate distribution based on the rmse and aic values daily and hourly rainfall data from 12 stations were selected for testing the distributions the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the generalized distributions including the gg gb2 hal a hal b and hal ib distributions use different constraints the pome method was introduced here to estimate the parameters of the five generalized distributions relations between distribution parameters and constraints and relations between lagrange multipliers and constraints were deduced then relations between parameters and constraints were obtained which can be used for parameter estimation results of fitting between observed and theoretical data show that the estimated parameters were reasonable the five generalized distributions fitted extreme rainfall data well and can be chosen for frequency analysis for daily data used in this study the gb2 and hal a distributions are better than other distributions for hourly data used in this study the gb2 and hal ib distributions were better than the gg hal a and hal b distributions generally the gb2 and halphen family distributions give a better fit the proposed pome method was compared with the traditional mle method results show that the two methods are comparable although the mle method only requires the pdf of the generalized distribution it needs some more manipulations of the derivatives of the certain functions the pome method proposed in this study only needs to find the solutions of the derived equations set all the analysis in this study was carried out by assuming that the past and future data sets are stationary and have no apparent trend however many studies such as dominguez et al 2012 donat et al 2016 and min et al 2011 indicated the non stationarities for the future of precipitation extremes thus a non stationary approach for constructing the distributions may be an option for hydrometeorological frequency analysis in the future acknowledgement this
