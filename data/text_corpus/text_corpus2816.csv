development of highly efficient visible light active photocatalysts is the current need 17 22 it is found that along with hydrogen peroxide porous titanosilicate ts is an ideal material to catalyze

present at 13 1 and 27 4 closely corresponding to g c3n4 jcpds number 87 1526 38 which also indicates the presence of pure cn from fig 1b the three one larger and two smaller peaks around 1 5 are observed for the mesoporous 100 110 and 200 plane reflections the presence of porous titanosilicate was confirmed by the broad peak at 23 jcpds number 29 0085 all the observed diffraction peaks of the prepared fe3o4 are clearly matching with the crystal phase data jcpds no 01 1111 of the bulk fe3o4 39 the pure fe3o4 formation confirmed by the no availability of no other phase of impurity peaks parallel peaks have occurred in fe3o4 ts g c3n4 hybrid nanocomposites ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 any other diffraction peaks of additional phases not perceived the detailed morphologies and microstructures of the ternary ftscn hybrid nanocomposites have been studied by fe sem tem and hr tem fig 2 shows that the pure fo particles fts and ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 nanocomposites fig 2a shows agglomeration of the spherical shape of the pure fo magnetic nanoparticles titanosilicate was successfully coated on the fe3o4 nanoparticles of as prepared fts composite shown in fig 2b the fe sem image fig 2c clearly shown that several particles in homogeneous size were settled down on the g c3n4 the layered structure of g c3n4 was clearly distinguished in the fe sem image fig 2d f improper dispersion and severe aggregation of the fts nanoparticles across the g c3n4 surface is because of the high loading concentration of fe3o4 from the tem analysis spherical structure of the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles was confirmed and shown in fig 3 a and b c shows that the pomegranate like structure of the fe3o4 titanosilicate nanocomposite the surfaces of fe3o4 titanosillicate microspheres were rough and porous it is clearly shown in the below pictures a large number of fe3o4nanoparticles are encapsulated in the core of the titanosilicate shell forming the pomegranate like structure the core s inter planar spacing is 0 25 nm measured by xrd and confirmed by the plane is 311 which corresponds to the fe3o4 fig 3 d e shows pomegranate like structure of the fe3o4 titanosilicate settle down on the surface of g c3n4 nano sheets it is clearly useful that the catalysts can directly contact with the dyes so degradation can easily occur fig 3f indications the observed spacing between the planes is 0 32 nm it is attributed to the g c3n4 002 plane the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm is given in fig 4 and surface area of the compounds are given in table 1 it shows titanosilicate surface area and pore volume are very high g c3n4 and fe3o4 are less 446 36 30 m2 g and pore width 3 to 0 nm the surface area of the ternary nanocomposites are tested and calculated to be slightly higher than them 450 480 and 503 m2 g and pore width 3 3 5 nm this is demonstrated in the figure as we have noticed that the specific surface area offers more surface coordination for the degradation of dye therefore it provides more active reaction sites to exhibit enhanced in photo degradation activity as adsorption desorption of the organics before photocatalytic activity plays a major role the fig 5 shows ft ir spectrum of the pure fo pure cn fts ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 nanocomposites the ftir spectrum of pure carbon nitride contains broadband peaks in between 1200 to 1640 cm 1 which is caused by two main bands in the products we have observed a single peak at 1638 cm 1 which can be attributed to the sp2 stretching vibrations of the double bond present in the cn group moreover three different peaks were observed at binding energy values of 1242 cm 1 1324 cm 1 and 1411 cm 1 respectively which are mainly because of the presence of cn group in the cn moiety another peak appeared at a binding energy value of 807 cm 1 represents the triazine moiety s skeletal bending vibrations with out of plane mode 40 41 in the case of pure fe3o4 ftir spectrum the appearance of broadband between 750 to 520 cm 1 represents the vibrations of fe o lattice 42 ft ir spectra of the fts nanocomposite here we have noticed that the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups appear at 1700 and 3430 cm 1respectively the strong peaks show at 1100 802 and 467 cm 1 agree to the si o si band 960 cm 1bands are observed that the ti peak in titanosilicate thangarajet al have verified that the 960 cm 1 bands shown by ts zeolites can also be attributed to a stretching mode of a sio4 unit bonded to a ti 4 ion o3sioti the characteristic peaks of fts and cn have retained in the ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 hybrid nanocomposites 16 43 in general the optical absorption assets of photo catalyst show a significant part in defining the photocatalytic activity mainly for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of visible light the fig 6 shows uv vis drs studies of pure fo pure cn fts and the ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 nanocomposites pure g c3n4 showed a broader photo absorption from uv to visible light and its bandgap energy is 2 80 ev the absorption edge was around 450 nm which caused from the charge transfer response from the valence band drifted by n 2p orbit to the conduction band obtained by c 2p orbit 44 in ftscn the fts is present on the surface of the g c3n4 this was supported by the wider absorption edge data of ftscn and its extension up to visible region than pure fts it is also observed that the amount of melamine in the precursors shows an impact on the uv vis absorption edge the improvement of melamine content results in the redshift of the absorption edge for all prepared ftscn nanocomposites indicating the reduction in the bandgap 45 in this present work the bandgap energies are assessed to be 1 ev for pure fe3o4 2 74 ev for pure g c3n4 and 1 71 ev 2 24 ev 2 39 ev and 2 57 ev for fts ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 compounds respectively this is obtained from the f absorption edge data the photoluminescence spectra fig 7 of the synthesized pure g c3n4 ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 recorded at rt with a hike in wavelength of 365 nm as shown in fig 6 a decrease in photoluminescence intensity for ftscn3 5 clearly shows more concentration and increase the lifespan of electron hole pairs the photoluminescence data backing improved the catalytic activity of ftscn3 5 on the rhb photo degradation experiment it is clearly proven that the efficient photo generated electron hole pair separation is responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic behavior of the catalyst in the semiconductor catalysts lifetime and recombination rate of photo generated electron hole might be investigated by pl study photo catalytic performance of all the synthesized compounds were screened under uv visible and direct sun light irradiation from all the results it was found that ftscn3 5 shows better activity compared to other composites tested hence we are giving ftscn3 5 results in fig 8 fig 8a c represents the uv vis spectral data of rhb dye solution with ftscn 3 5 nanocomposite under the irradiation of uv visible and direct sun light at different time intervals respectively from these results it can be observed that the time of degradation of rhb dye under uv is about 90 min whereas in case of visible light irradiation it took 50 min only the time of degradation in case of direct sun light irradiation is 30 min approximately the consumption of time for the degradation is lessened by 70 in case of direct sunlight irradiation compared to uv irradiation and around 50 compared to visible light irradiation to determine the impact of g c3n4 on photo degradation the photo degradation of rhb with pure fts was studied in the presence of visible light fig 8d indicating that the variation of c c0 with time for pure samples and hybrid nanocomposites where c0 is the concentration of the dye solution before degradation and c is the concentration of the dye solution after the degradation time t it is clear from fig 8d that the rate of degradation was quite faster in the case of ftscn3 5 composite under sun light irradiation than the pure samples and other ftscn nanocomposites which indicates the positive effect of g c3n4 on the ability of photocatalytic behavior of the hybrid nanocomposite mostly reactive species oh o2 and h are played a significant role in the photocatalysis as shown in fig 9 the addition of tertbutanol t buoh it is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger the rate of photo degradation was considerably suppressed for rhb degradation compared with only photo catalyst without scavenger the addition of n2 purging acting as a superoxide radical scavenger a major variation was detected in the rate of degradation meanwhile the addition of ammonium oxalate ao was conducted which acting as a hole scavenger some variation in the photo degradation of rhb was observed these results are revealed that the oh o2 and h are significant reactive species in ftscn hybrid nanocomposites the photocatalysts are photo stable and reusable in rhb solution five successive cyclic runs fig 10 in detail way the aqueous solution of rhb 5 ppm 100 ml and 0 1 g of photo catalyst were taken in 250 ml beaker and photocatalytic degradations were performed by maintaining the similar conditions which are used in photocatalytic activity test the magnetically separable catalyst was separated after the first cycle by using an outward magnetic field and cleaned with methanol this recovered compound was transferred into another beaker along with a freshly prepared rhb 5 ppm and 100 ml solution before treating with uv light the rhb catalyst solution was stirred for about 30 min using a magnetic stirrer in the dark this process was performed repeatedly for five times the room temperature magnetization pure fo ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite is shown in fig 11 the magnetization curve has a sigmoid shape without a hysteresis loop is indicates the superparamagnetic character of the as prepared samples the saturation magnetization value for ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite is 9 emu g the ftscn3 5 saturation magnetization value reduced compared to the pure fo due to a less concentration of fo nps in ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite to accumulate and recover the catalyst in several cycles its synthesis with worthy superparamagnetism is needed fig 11 inset shows the separation of ftscn3 5 nanocomposite from aqueous solution by using an external magnetic field therefore the ftscn3 5 photocatalysts can be readily separated by using an applied external magnetic field a plausible physical and chemical mechanism and structure are given in figs 12 and 13 they show synergism between the triple functional groups and their enhanced activity over the rhodamine b degradation the degraded products are found to be unharmful small inorganic molecules such as co2 h2o and nh3 these are conformed by the lcms analysis actually we did not observe any peak for rhodamine b degradation as its concentration is less further small inorganic molecules are unobservable through lcms this confirms the formation of such products 15 4 conclusions the ftscn tertiary hybrid nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized via a simplistic in situ growth mechanism the visible light photocatalysis performance of ftscn is enhanced by prolonging the lifetime of charge carrier transfer at the composite s interface for this the photocatalytic mechanism also proposed by trapping of photo induced electrons and holes under visible light irradiation the photo stability of synthesized ftscn hybrid nanocomposite is found high this facilitates the production of this hybrid nanocomposite through the environmentally benign and eco friendly process the ftscn hybrid nanocomposite is applicable

prepared fe3o4 are clearly matching with the crystal phase data jcpds no 01 1111 of the bulk fe3o4 39 the pure fe3o4 formation confirmed by the no availability of no other phase of impurity peaks parallel peaks have occurred in fe3o4 ts g c3n4 hybrid nanocomposites ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 any other diffraction peaks of additional phases not perceived the detailed morphologies and microstructures of the ternary ftscn hybrid nanocomposites have been studied by fe sem tem and hr tem fig 2 shows that the pure fo particles fts and ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 nanocomposites fig 2a shows agglomeration of the spherical shape of the pure fo magnetic nanoparticles titanosilicate was successfully coated on the fe3o4 nanoparticles of as prepared fts composite shown in fig 2b the fe sem image fig 2c clearly shown that several particles in homogeneous size were settled down on the g c3n4 the layered structure of g c3n4 was clearly distinguished in the fe sem image fig 2d f improper dispersion and severe aggregation of the fts nanoparticles across the g c3n4 surface is because of the high loading concentration of fe3o4 from the tem analysis spherical structure of the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles was confirmed and shown in fig 3 a and b c shows that the pomegranate like structure of the fe3o4 titanosilicate nanocomposite the surfaces of fe3o4 titanosillicate microspheres were rough and porous it is clearly shown in the below pictures a large number of fe3o4nanoparticles are encapsulated in the core of the titanosilicate shell forming the pomegranate like structure the core s inter planar spacing is 0 25 nm measured by xrd and confirmed by the plane is 311 which corresponds to the fe3o4 fig 3 d e shows pomegranate like structure of the fe3o4 titanosilicate settle down on the surface of g c3n4 nano sheets it is clearly useful that the catalysts can directly contact with the dyes so degradation can easily occur fig 3f indications the observed spacing between the planes is 0 32 nm it is attributed to the g c3n4 002 plane the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm is given in fig 4 and surface area of the compounds are given in table 1 it shows titanosilicate surface area and pore volume are very high g c3n4 and fe3o4 are less 446 36 30 m2 g and pore width 3 to 0 nm the surface area of the ternary nanocomposites are tested and calculated to be slightly higher than them 450 480 and 503 m2 g and pore width 3 3 5 nm this is demonstrated in the figure as we have noticed that the specific surface area offers more surface coordination for the degradation of dye therefore it provides more active reaction sites to exhibit enhanced in photo degradation activity as adsorption desorption of the organics before photocatalytic activity plays a major role the fig 5 shows ft ir spectrum of the pure fo pure cn fts ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 nanocomposites the ftir spectrum of pure carbon nitride contains broadband peaks in between 1200 to 1640 cm 1 which is caused by two main bands in the products we have observed a single peak at 1638 cm 1 which can be attributed to the sp2 stretching vibrations of the double bond present in the cn group moreover three different peaks were observed at binding energy values of 1242 cm 1 1324 cm 1 and 1411 cm 1 respectively which are mainly because of the presence of cn group in the cn moiety another peak appeared at a binding energy value of 807 cm 1 represents the triazine moiety s skeletal bending vibrations with out of plane mode 40 41 in the case of pure fe3o4 ftir spectrum the appearance of broadband between 750 to 520 cm 1 represents the vibrations of fe o lattice 42 ft ir spectra of the fts nanocomposite here we have noticed that the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups appear at 1700 and 3430 cm 1respectively the strong peaks show at 1100 802 and 467 cm 1 agree to the si o si band 960 cm 1bands are observed that the ti peak in titanosilicate thangarajet al have verified that the 960 cm 1 bands shown by ts zeolites can also be attributed to a stretching mode of a sio4 unit bonded to a ti 4 ion o3sioti the characteristic peaks of fts and cn have retained in the ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 hybrid nanocomposites 16 43 in general the optical absorption assets of photo catalyst show a significant part in defining the photocatalytic activity mainly for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of visible light the fig 6 shows uv vis drs studies of pure fo pure cn fts and the ftscn3 ftscn3 5 ftscn4 nanocomposites pure g c3n4 showed a broader photo absorption from uv to visible light and its bandgap energy is 2 80 ev the absorption edge was around 450 nm which caused from the charge transfer response from the valence band drifted by n 2p orbit to the conduction band obtained by c 2p orbit 44 in ftscn the fts is present on the surface of the g c3n4 this was supported by the wider absorption edge data of ftscn and its extension up to visible region than pure fts it is also observed that the amount of melamine in the precursors shows an impact on the uv vis absorption edge the improvement of melamine content results in the redshift of the absorption edge for all prepared ftscn nanocomposites indicating the reduction in the bandgap 45 in this present work the bandgap energies are assessed to be 1 ev for pure fe3o4 2 74 ev for pure g c3n4 and 1 71 ev 2 24 ev 2 39 ev and 2 57 ev for fts ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 compounds respectively this is obtained from the f absorption edge data the photoluminescence spectra fig 7 of the synthesized pure g c3n4 ftscn3 ftscn3 5 and ftscn4 recorded at rt with a hike in wavelength of 365 nm as shown in fig 6 a decrease in photoluminescence intensity for ftscn3 5 clearly shows more concentration and increase the lifespan of electron hole pairs the photoluminescence data backing improved the catalytic activity of ftscn3 5 on the rhb photo degradation experiment it is clearly proven that the efficient photo generated electron hole pair separation is responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic behavior of the catalyst in the semiconductor catalysts lifetime and recombination rate of photo generated electron hole might be investigated by pl study photo catalytic performance of all the synthesized compounds were screened under uv visible and direct sun light irradiation from all the results it was found that ftscn3 5 shows better activity compared to other composites tested hence we are giving ftscn3 5 results in fig 8 fig 8a c represents the uv vis spectral data of rhb dye solution with ftscn 3 5 nanocomposite under the irradiation of uv visible and direct sun light at different time intervals respectively from these results it can be observed that the time of degradation of rhb dye under uv is about 90 min whereas in case of visible light irradiation it took 50 min only the time of degradation in case of direct sun light irradiation is 30 min approximately the consumption of time for the degradation is lessened by 70 in case of direct sunlight irradiation compared to uv irradiation and around 50 compared to visible light irradiation to determine the impact of g c3n4 on photo degradation the photo degradation of rhb with pure fts was studied in the presence of visible light fig 8d indicating that the variation of c c0 with time for pure samples and hybrid nanocomposites where c0 is the concentration of the dye solution before degradation and c is the concentration of the dye solution after the degradation time t it is clear from fig 8d that the rate of degradation was quite faster in the case of ftscn3 5 composite under sun light irradiation than the pure samples and other ftscn nanocomposites which indicates the positive effect of g c3n4 on the ability of photocatalytic behavior of the hybrid nanocomposite mostly reactive species oh o2 and h are played a significant role in the photocatalysis as shown in fig 9 the addition of tertbutanol t buoh it is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger the rate of photo degradation was considerably suppressed for rhb degradation compared with only photo catalyst without scavenger the addition of n2 purging acting as a superoxide radical scavenger a major variation was detected in the rate of degradation meanwhile the addition of ammonium oxalate ao was conducted which acting as a hole scavenger some variation in the photo degradation of rhb was observed these results are revealed that the oh o2 and h are significant reactive species in ftscn hybrid nanocomposites the photocatalysts are photo stable and reusable in rhb solution five successive cyclic runs fig 10 in detail way the aqueous solution of rhb 5 ppm 100 ml and 0 1 g of photo catalyst were taken in 250 ml beaker and photocatalytic degradations were performed by maintaining the similar conditions which are used in photocatalytic activity test the magnetically separable catalyst was separated after the first cycle by using an outward magnetic field and cleaned with methanol this recovered compound was transferred into another beaker along with a freshly prepared rhb 5 ppm and 100 ml solution before treating with uv light the rhb catalyst solution was stirred for about 30 min using a magnetic stirrer in the dark this process was performed repeatedly for five times the room temperature magnetization pure fo ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite is shown in fig 11 the magnetization curve has a sigmoid shape without a hysteresis loop is indicates the superparamagnetic character of the as prepared samples the saturation magnetization value for ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite is 9 emu g the ftscn3 5 saturation magnetization value reduced compared to the pure fo due to a less concentration of fo nps in ftscn3 5 hybrid nanocomposite to accumulate and recover the catalyst in several cycles its synthesis with worthy superparamagnetism is needed fig 11 inset shows the separation of ftscn3 5 nanocomposite from aqueous solution by using an external magnetic field therefore the ftscn3 5 photocatalysts can be readily separated by using an applied external magnetic field a plausible physical and chemical mechanism and structure are given in figs 12 and 13 they show synergism between the triple functional groups and their enhanced activity over the rhodamine b degradation the degraded products are found to be unharmful small inorganic molecules such as co2 h2o and nh3 these are conformed by the lcms analysis actually we did not observe any peak for rhodamine b degradation as its concentration is less further small inorganic molecules are unobservable through lcms this confirms the formation of such products 15 4 conclusions the ftscn tertiary hybrid nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized via a simplistic in situ growth mechanism the visible light photocatalysis performance of ftscn is enhanced by prolonging the lifetime of charge carrier transfer at the composite s interface for this the photocatalytic mechanism also proposed by trapping of photo induced electrons and holes under visible light irradiation the photo stability of synthesized ftscn hybrid nanocomposite is found high this facilitates the production of this hybrid nanocomposite through the environmentally benign and eco friendly process the ftscn hybrid nanocomposite is applicable

14081,the aim of this study is to treat the tannery unhairing wastewaters ww issued from an important leather tanning plant which is a large environmental threat and a severe industrial issue high levels of ph chemical oxygen demand cod mainly as alkaline proteins conductivity suspended solids and sulfide are the main characteristics of these highly polluted wastewaters this study is based on the coupling of co2 neutralization with zn2 precipitation the use of co2 leads to the neutralization of the ww alkalinities and the precipitation of ca2 and cod to caco3 and solid proteins respectively while zn2 leads to the precipitation of sulfide as zns avoiding any h2s gas evolution the originality of this paper comes from the simultaneous capture of greenhouse gas the removal of ww pollution and the recycling of treated water the pollutants removal efficiency is evident and can be seen through the decrease of ph from 13 to 6 5 a decrease in the conductivity from 8000 to 2000 μs and in cod from 20000 to 80000 to 3000 mg o2 l 1 as well as obtaining pristine final water for recycling in addition to the simplicity and cost effectiveness of these results the kinetics of the co2 and zn2 reactions is instantaneous contrary to the conventional biological slow process and the catalytic sulfide oxidation reaction co2 and zn2 have never been studied as a treatment method for tannery ww this will open promising perspectives for industrial applications keywords carbon dioxide neutralization tannery unhairing wastewater treatment zinc sulfide precipitation recycling 1 introduction chemical unhairing chromium tanning and dye finishing are the main wet steps for animal hides processing before the leather production 1 2 the latter is strongly linked to the daily human diet garment and comfort this ancient industry remains indispensable dynamic and progressing but yet very polluting and water consuming indeed the world leather production exceeds 551 thousand tons year 3 which requires more than 30 m3 of fresh water per ton of raw hides 4 and many chemicals it ends up generating highly polluted wastewaters the future of the leather industry is then intimately linked to pollution prevention and environmental protection the leather industry is mainly located in italy and developing countries 4 after massive delocalization for pollution reasons this industry presents serious industrial issue and environmental threat the reason for which authorities concentrate and isolate tanning activities in specific zones in tanning processes a series of chemicals are used such as surfactants acids dyes salts and especially tanning agents such as chromium a carcinogenic body 5 7 high pollution of the unhairing wastewaters is mainly due to the calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and sodium sulfide na2s utilization 1 8 hair removal operation generates heavily polluted solutions in fact in addition to the remaining chemicals na2s and ca oh 2 salinity and high ph this unhairing operation generates brownish and malodorous aqueous liquids with very high concentrations in biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and by products of the chemical attack of hairs and epidermis keratin these wastewaters have been widely treated to remove pollutants various industrial treatments are currently applied sulfide oxidation aerobic and anaerobic biological treatments coagulation flocculation and sedimentation and other emerging alternatives are still under study 9 currently catalytic air mnso4 oxidation of sulfides 10 and acidification precipitation of proteins cod constitute the main treatment in algerian tanneries however these processes have several drawbacks such as heavy investment low reaction kinetic corrosion problems degradation of tanks over time high chemicals and energy consumption and non recyclable treated waters due to high final cod biological treatment processes are also widely used worldwide unfortunately their slow kinetics constituted a serious downside 2 clean emergent technologies membranes advanced oxidation processes aop and electrochemistry have not given significant impetus to the treatment of unhairing wastewaters in the leather industry 2 11 the main drawbacks that have seriously limited the performance of such methods are membrane fouling 12 significant pre treatment costs 2 13 and unknown organic by products after an aop or electrochemical oxidation in this context the co2 zn2 neutralization precipitation method is proposed as an economical and environmentally friendly alternative this novel chemical approach is an effective simple inexpensive and very fast alternative treatment the neutralization of co2 has already been largely studied however studies on co2 applications in tanneries were limited only to hide deliming 14 according to literature the feasibility of co2 capture using various kinds of sorbents has been investigated for alkaline wastewaters and solid waste ion exchange resins and alkaline wastewaters issued from the ammonia urea process have been treated by captured co2 the results showed a reduction in carbon emission 15 the absorption of co2 in alkaline solutions mea nh3 naoh and lacto serum proteins are also well known and accepted solutions 16 19 to the best of our knowledge there is no focused work on the treatment of unhairing alkaline wastewaters using recovered co2 the experimental part of the study is followed by a numerical optimization to determine the optimal conditions of precipitation and neutralization besides this co2 application the proposed treatment is completed with sulfides precipitation by zn2 one of the least toxic heavy metals at ph 10 12 thus avoiding any emission of hydrogen sulfide h2s further neutralization by co2 lower ph and total precipitation of proteins at their respective isoelectric ph values sulfide precipitation by fe2 from domestic wastewaters in sewers as fes has mainly been used for odor removal and corrosion prevention 20 21 however the use of zn2 presents evident advantages because of the zns good characteristics such as low solubility excellent coagulation decantation separation and its white color 2 material and methods 2 1 analytical methods in order to assess unhairing bath wastewaters an analysis of different parameters is performed on several samples first the reduction agent sulfides is analyzed by iodometric titration where concentrations are obtained by the titration of the excess iodine using the na2s2o3 solution 1 22 the cod is determined according to the dichromate reflux method for 2 h on sulphuric acid medium followed by a colorimetric titration at 600 nm to remove chlorides interference hgso4 is added and for the high content of cod samples are diluted with a 1 20 1 30 and 1 50 ratio total suspended solids tss are determined by gravimetric method ph and conductivity are measured using a ph meter model inolab series wtw and a conductivity meter series hanna respectively for other ions chloride and calcium are determined according to conventional methods 22 2 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 which presents the laboratory setup used in this experimental study the operating principle is based on the co2 bubbling into the glass tank containing the solution to be treated the co2 used is available as a compressed gas cylinder in order to introduce the co2 gas into the solution a plastic tube is used to ensure the transfer of co2 from a compressed gas cylinder to the tank containing the wastewaters pressure and flow rate are maintained and controlled by emplacing a manometer and a flow meter respectively the ph and conductivity of the solution are measured and monitored in real time using a ph meter and a conductivity meter respectively an agitator is regularly rotated 150 rpm to ensure the uniformity distribution of absorption in the solution it should be noted that the monitoring of calcium and sulfide concentrations is performed using several samples during the experiment 2 3 different stages of the proposed treatment process the proposed treatment steps are summarized in the following scheme fig 2 the integration of co2 neutralization precipitation process to the unhairing liming operation combines the treatment and recycling of the bath wastewaters treated wastewaters can meet standards while reducing costs consuming fewer chemicals and recycling more wastewaters 2 4 theory calculations 2 4 1 co2 reaction in unhairing solution the theories of co2 water interaction in aquatic systems and the corresponding calco carbonic equilibrium are well known and developed they are necessary steps for a better understanding of the co2 excess environmental impacts ph changes in oceans corrosion the following theoretical study is limited to our present specific problem which is the dissolution reaction of co2 with unhairing wastewaters charged with ca oh 2 na2s and alkaline proteins beyond the evident acid basic reactions of oh s2 hs and organic bases with added co2 the precipitation of caco3 remains the main reaction 1 c a aq 2 c o 3 aq 2 cac o 3 s pks 8 35 the expected reactions are very quantitative and rapid where the reaction ca oh 2 h2co3 couples two successive reactions a neutralization reaction followed by a caco3

o 6 c a 2 c o 3 2 cac o 3 s pks 8 35 the following figures figs 3 and 4 show that caco3 precipitated entirely at high ph however is that a stable complex of protein with calcium ion this will be verified through experiment the solubility of caco3 is also calculated by combining the above reactions with the formation of hydro complexes reactions in alkaline medium which allows plotting the following curve it can be observed that the solubility of caco3 is minimal in a ph range of 10 12 this behavior due to ca oh 2 pka which is also a ph buffer zone permitting good precipitation of caco3 of unhairing solution furthermore the co2 reacts easily with coo and nh2 the absorption reactions of co2 by proteins peptides and amino acids are 7 n h 2 crhco o c o 2 h 2 o n h 3 crhco o hc o 3

apparent solubility product can predict the precipitation and the dissolving of the corresponding precipitate with the high pks value zinc salt is suitable for the precipitation of sulfides the ph can affect the precipitation of zns fig 5 shows that zns is less soluble than zn oh 2 precipitate regardless of the ph value therefore zn salt is suitable for the fixation and possible recovery of sulfide ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of unhairing bath wastewaters from the batna unit in order to evaluate the unhairing bath wastewaters several samples are taken the sampling is done after the evacuation process of an unhairing bath the analysis of various parameters is carried out after decantation of the wastewaters table 1 shows the values and ranges of concerned parameters obtained after our analysis as can be seen the features of the unhairing wastewaters from batna tannery are high ph 12 13 and high conductivity 6 15 ms cm also the high rates of some toxic substances such as cod and sulfide are clearly observed these reported values depend on the number and nature of the treated hides sheep goat overall these analysis results indicate the toxicity of unhairing bath wastewaters where practical and economical treatment is highly required 3 2 1st alternative treatment treatment using co2 in this part the use of co2 is proposed to neutralize and treat the unhairing wastewaters to study the efficiency of this technique the ph variation with the co2 addition is discussed as well as the variation in calcium concentration conductivity and sulfide concentration as a function of ph and the volume of co2 added 3 3 ph variation various titrations are carried out using hcl 1 m and co2 g the alkaline wastewaters titration curves are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as shown in the following curves different buffering zones and ph jumps are observed this information is handy for characterization of the solution proteins pka and nature alkaline charges it can also be observed that hcl and co2 have the same role as a neutralizing agent where co2 can reduce the ph from 12 to 13 to 6 7 in addition the low lead time of the corresponding process is the main benefit drawn from this experiment this neutralization curve can be divided into three parts part 1 this part corresponds to a buffer zone at ph 13 this buffer is fixed by the two basic compounds s2 hs and ca oh 2 beyond this zone ph scarcely varies according to the addition of the acid co2 up to ph 11 then this zone corresponds to the simultaneous neutralization of sulfide and lime part 2 the second part corresponds to the first equivalent point ph 11 67 where we can conclude the concentration of lime and sulfide and the amount of co2 necessary for their neutralization part 3 the presence of two buffer zone can be observed the first at ph 9 10 and the second at ph 8 9 where the ph scarcely varies with the addition of co2 both zones are bound to pka of proteins 3 4 conductivity variation as shown in fig 8 a reduction in the electric conductivity of the unhairing bath sample is observed in addition the efficiency range is 30 60 0 5 table 2 these increases in conductivity are mainly due to the elimination of different ions oh ca2 and s2 sh according to the data of corresponding molar ionic electrical conductivities 23 it can be seen that oh has the highest value 19 84 ms mol 1 m2 it can be thus concluded that the decrease in conductivity is mainly due to the neutralization of oh alkalinity beyond ph 8 5 a slight increase in conductivity is observed this behavior is mainly due to the acid base character of the aqueous solution 4 calcium and sulfide variation 4 1 study of synthetic solutions in this part the experiments are carried out on different solutions of lime with an initial conductivity of 8 48 ms cm and 4 12 ms cm fig 9 the influence of the presence of organic matter as peptone on calcium removal efficiency was also studied the calcium concentration affects its removal efficiency and can reach 98 1 96 for the synthetic lime sample with an optimum ph of 10 5 in the presence of peptone a mixture of proteins peptides and amino acids the calcium removal efficiency decreases from 98 to 75 80 1 4 this result shows the influence that the presence of nitrogenous organic matter like peptone can have we can thus explain the efficiency decrease by the complex formation between ca2 and proteins which is confirmed by previous research works bivalent metallic ions especially ca2 form chelates with proteins 4 2 study of unhairing bath wastewaters solutions fig 10 a and b show the behavior of the calcium concentration as a function of ph values of a given unhairing wastewaters sample the calcium concentration decreases with the addition of co2 this behavior can be explained as a result of the reaction between calcium and carbonate ion as explained above one can also observe the existence of an optimal ph value whose efficiency of elimination of calcium is utmost 77 and 75 the optimal ph range is 10 5 9 in addition with the decrease in ph the calcium concentration increases in a weak and stable manner during this experiment it can be observed that it is easy to remove caco3 by simple filtration or decantation also fig 11 shows that removal of 75 1 5 of calcium with 1460 mg l requires 7 5 l equal to 0 31 mol of co2 based on these experimental results fig 10 it is found that the flow rate has a low effect on the efficiency of removal of calcium while 1 5 l min of flow rate reduces the process time as can be seen in the curves the decreases in ph imply a decrease in sulfide concentration the tendency for sulfide removal is similar to that observed with calcium there is a rapid increase in removal during the initial period of operation and then reaching the steady state the time required to reach steady state is however different for different flow rates in water dissolved co2 reacts with sulfide and bisulfite ions as per the following reactions 14 s 2 c o 2 h 2 o h s hc o 3 pka 1 13 15 h s c o 2 h 2 o h 2 s hc o 3 pka 2 7 reaction 15 is reported to be favored in the backward at ph 4 5 or less however in the present study the average sulfide removal efficiency can reach 60 70 at ph 7 in this medium the presence of hco3 buffer medium and the various nitrogen organic matter causes stagnation or a slight decrease of ph 4 3 2nd alternative treatment treatment using co2 and zinc salt in this process it is proposed to use zinc salt 1 m as a precipitating agent for sulfide ion after the elimination of calcium caco3 at the optimal ph at first the ph decrease is done by co2 and was followed and controlled by a ph meter unlike strong acids co2 offers a smoothly decrease in ph consequently the control of ph reduction is more practical then reaching at optimal ph the bubbling can be stopped then zinc salt and wastewater are first mixed rapidly 600 rpm for a short period of about one minute the resulting mixture is stirred slowly 60 rpm for 20 30 min after this step the decantation process occurs resulting in the appearance of a more or less diffuse front separating the liquid volume in two the particles gather at the bottom while above we have the supernatant we can summarize the processing steps below 1 neutralization of alkaline unhairing wastewaters with co2 stopping at an optimal ph ph range 10 5 9 5 2 elimination of caco3 after decantation or filtration 3 introduction of zinc salt that leads to the precipitation of sulfide as zns 4 elimination of zns after decantation the different parameters are analyzed before and after treatment results are shown in the following table table 3 the main benefits brought by the use of zn as a precipitating agent are 1 zn2 with s2 makes an excellent precipitate high pks 16 zns z n 2 s 2 pks 23 8 2 zns is an excellent decanting precipitate 3 zns precipitation process is very fast and only requires a simple dosing and stirring device 4 untreated zns sludge can be stored without any pollution zns being very stable sulfides stored as zns can thus be recycled at the desired moment combination of the two methods co2 neutralization and precipitation gave the following results 1 elimination of calcium in the form of caco3 with a high average efficiency of 78 2 rapid elimination of sulfide in the form of zns with an excellent average efficiency of more than 92 3 resulting wastewaters are very rich in clean cod protein peptides and free amino acids the recovery of this cod is possible 4 recovery and reuse of sulfides are possible 4 4 estimation of co2 needs for neutralization and co2 emissions reduction the amount of co2 captured by unhairing wastewaters is variable and depends first and foremost on the characteristics of the tannery wastewater the number of treated head and its load of basic chemicals lime and sulfides according to the neutralization data from fig 6 an average of 8 l of co2 may be captured per liter of wastewaters according to the world statistical compendium for raw hides skins and leather provided by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2013 world tannery production reached 7190 thousand tons of raw hide skins bovine and sheep the generated unhairing baths are between 4 and 6 m3 per ton of raw hide our results show that one liter of unhairing wastewaters captures 8 l 0 32 mol of co2 therefor if brought to 2013 figure co2 capture would be between 2 29 1011 l 9 18 109 mol and 3 44 1011 l 1 37 1010 mol 5 conclusion in this paper a new method is proposed to neutralize alkaline industrial wastewaters the effluent of tannery unhairing processes by the direct use of captured co2 that has been partly transformed to solid caco3 as a precipitate and partly used to neutralize the remaining alkalinities oh sulfides and proteins the efficiency of this novel technique has been experimentally demonstrated indeed the following results are obtained a carbon emission reduction through a direct and easy way to capture co2 effective treatment of heavily polluted unhairing wastewaters a genuinely clean technology that saves water recovers by products cod and protects the environment the following experimental results illustrate this evident success of using co2 as an efficient and cost effective chemical for ww treatment on a laboratory scale treated wastewaters are recyclable the ph from 13 to 6 7 conductivity from 8000 to 2000 μs cod 20000 80000 to 3000 mg o2 l turbidity pristine final water are drastically reduced only with captured co2 the injected co2 permitted to precipitate caco3 selectively then different proteins according to their pka these precipitated proteins are an excellent bio resource agriculture the treated water contains free valuable and recoverable identified collagen amino acids which could be valorized in future studies furthermore in the case of the combination co2 zinc salts for sulfide precipitation before h2s evolution more than 80 of sulfide has been removed as zns precipitate that could be reused on site as perspective research the combination co2 pre treatment membrane processes

diet garment and comfort this ancient industry remains indispensable dynamic and progressing but yet very polluting and water consuming indeed the world leather production exceeds 551 thousand tons year 3 which requires more than 30 m3 of fresh water per ton of raw hides 4 and many chemicals it ends up generating highly polluted wastewaters the future of the leather industry is then intimately linked to pollution prevention and environmental protection the leather industry is mainly located in italy and developing countries 4 after massive delocalization for pollution reasons this industry presents serious industrial issue and environmental threat the reason for which authorities concentrate and isolate tanning activities in specific zones in tanning processes a series of chemicals are used such as surfactants acids dyes salts and especially tanning agents such as chromium a carcinogenic body 5 7 high pollution of the unhairing wastewaters is mainly due to the calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and sodium sulfide na2s utilization 1 8 hair removal operation generates heavily polluted solutions in fact in addition to the remaining chemicals na2s and ca oh 2 salinity and high ph this unhairing operation generates brownish and malodorous aqueous liquids with very high concentrations in biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and by products of the chemical attack of hairs and epidermis keratin these wastewaters have been widely treated to remove pollutants various industrial treatments are currently applied sulfide oxidation aerobic and anaerobic biological treatments coagulation flocculation and sedimentation and other emerging alternatives are still under study 9 currently catalytic air mnso4 oxidation of sulfides 10 and acidification precipitation of proteins cod constitute the main treatment in algerian tanneries however these processes have several drawbacks such as heavy investment low reaction kinetic corrosion problems degradation of tanks over time high chemicals and energy consumption and non recyclable treated waters due to high final cod biological treatment processes are also widely used worldwide unfortunately their slow kinetics constituted a serious downside 2 clean emergent technologies membranes advanced oxidation processes aop and electrochemistry have not given significant impetus to the treatment of unhairing wastewaters in the leather industry 2 11 the main drawbacks that have seriously limited the performance of such methods are membrane fouling 12 significant pre treatment costs 2 13 and unknown organic by products after an aop or electrochemical oxidation in this context the co2 zn2 neutralization precipitation method is proposed as an economical and environmentally friendly alternative this novel chemical approach is an effective simple inexpensive and very fast alternative treatment the neutralization of co2 has already been largely studied however studies on co2 applications in tanneries were limited only to hide deliming 14 according to literature the feasibility of co2 capture using various kinds of sorbents has been investigated for alkaline wastewaters and solid waste ion exchange resins and alkaline wastewaters issued from the ammonia urea process have been treated by captured co2 the results showed a reduction in carbon emission 15 the absorption of co2 in alkaline solutions mea nh3 naoh and lacto serum proteins are also well known and accepted solutions 16 19 to the best of our knowledge there is no focused work on the treatment of unhairing alkaline wastewaters using recovered co2 the experimental part of the study is followed by a numerical optimization to determine the optimal conditions of precipitation and neutralization besides this co2 application the proposed treatment is completed with sulfides precipitation by zn2 one of the least toxic heavy metals at ph 10 12 thus avoiding any emission of hydrogen sulfide h2s further neutralization by co2 lower ph and total precipitation of proteins at their respective isoelectric ph values sulfide precipitation by fe2 from domestic wastewaters in sewers as fes has mainly been used for odor removal and corrosion prevention 20 21 however the use of zn2 presents evident advantages because of the zns good characteristics such as low solubility excellent coagulation decantation separation and its white color 2 material and methods 2 1 analytical methods in order to assess unhairing bath wastewaters an analysis of different parameters is performed on several samples first the reduction agent sulfides is analyzed by iodometric titration where concentrations are obtained by the titration of the excess iodine using the na2s2o3 solution 1 22 the cod is determined according to the dichromate reflux method for 2 h on sulphuric acid medium followed by a colorimetric titration at 600 nm to remove chlorides interference hgso4 is added and for the high content of cod samples are diluted with a 1 20 1 30 and 1 50 ratio total suspended solids tss are determined by gravimetric method ph and conductivity are measured using a ph meter model inolab series wtw and a conductivity meter series hanna respectively for other ions chloride and calcium are determined according to conventional methods 22 2 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 which presents the laboratory setup used in this experimental study the operating principle is based on the co2 bubbling into the glass tank containing the solution to be treated the co2 used is available as a compressed gas cylinder in order to introduce the co2 gas into the solution a plastic tube is used to ensure the transfer of co2 from a compressed gas cylinder to the tank containing the wastewaters pressure and flow rate are maintained and controlled by emplacing a manometer and a flow meter respectively the ph and conductivity of the solution are measured and monitored in real time using a ph meter and a conductivity meter respectively an agitator is regularly rotated 150 rpm to ensure the uniformity distribution of absorption in the solution it should be noted that the monitoring of calcium and sulfide concentrations is performed using several samples during the experiment 2 3 different stages of the proposed treatment process the proposed treatment steps are summarized in the following scheme fig 2 the integration of co2 neutralization precipitation process to the unhairing liming operation combines the treatment and recycling of the bath wastewaters treated wastewaters can meet standards while reducing costs consuming fewer chemicals and recycling more wastewaters 2 4 theory calculations 2 4 1 co2 reaction in unhairing solution the theories of co2 water interaction in aquatic systems and the corresponding calco carbonic equilibrium are well known and developed they are necessary steps for a better understanding of the co2 excess environmental impacts ph changes in oceans corrosion the following theoretical study is limited to our present specific problem which is the dissolution reaction of co2 with unhairing wastewaters charged with ca oh 2 na2s and alkaline proteins beyond the evident acid basic reactions of oh s2 hs and organic bases with added co2 the precipitation of caco3 remains the main reaction 1 c a aq 2 c o 3 aq 2 cac o 3 s pks 8 35 the expected reactions are very quantitative and rapid where the reaction ca oh 2 h2co3 couples two successive reactions a neutralization reaction followed by a caco3

o 6 c a 2 c o 3 2 cac o 3 s pks 8 35 the following figures figs 3 and 4 show that caco3 precipitated entirely at high ph however is that a stable complex of protein with calcium ion this will be verified through experiment the solubility of caco3 is also calculated by combining the above reactions with the formation of hydro complexes reactions in alkaline medium which allows plotting the following curve it can be observed that the solubility of caco3 is minimal in a ph range of 10 12 this behavior due to ca oh 2 pka which is also a ph buffer zone permitting good precipitation of caco3 of unhairing solution furthermore the co2 reacts easily with coo and nh2 the absorption reactions of co2 by proteins peptides and amino acids are 7 n h 2 crhco o c o 2 h 2 o n h 3 crhco o hc o 3

apparent solubility product can predict the precipitation and the dissolving of the corresponding precipitate with the high pks value zinc salt is suitable for the precipitation of sulfides the ph can affect the precipitation of zns fig 5 shows that zns is less soluble than zn oh 2 precipitate regardless of the ph value therefore zn salt is suitable for the fixation and possible recovery of sulfide ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of unhairing bath wastewaters from the batna unit in order to evaluate the unhairing bath wastewaters several samples are taken the sampling is done after the evacuation process of an unhairing bath the analysis of various parameters is carried out after decantation of the wastewaters table 1 shows the values and ranges of concerned parameters obtained after our analysis as can be seen the features of the unhairing wastewaters from batna tannery are high ph 12 13 and high conductivity 6 15 ms cm also the high rates of some toxic substances such as cod and sulfide are clearly observed these reported values depend on the number and nature of the treated hides sheep goat overall these analysis results indicate the toxicity of unhairing bath wastewaters where practical and economical treatment is highly required 3 2 1st alternative treatment treatment using co2 in this part the use of co2 is proposed to neutralize and treat the unhairing wastewaters to study the efficiency of this technique the ph variation with the co2 addition is discussed as well as the variation in calcium concentration conductivity and sulfide concentration as a function of ph and the volume of co2 added 3 3 ph variation various titrations are carried out using hcl 1 m and co2 g the alkaline wastewaters titration curves are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as shown in the following curves different buffering zones and ph jumps are observed this information is handy for characterization of the solution proteins pka and nature alkaline charges it can also be observed that hcl and co2 have the same role as a neutralizing agent where co2 can reduce the ph from 12 to 13 to 6 7 in addition the low lead time of the corresponding process is the main benefit drawn from this experiment this neutralization curve can be divided into three parts part 1 this part corresponds to a buffer zone at ph 13 this buffer is fixed by the two basic compounds s2 hs and ca oh 2 beyond this zone ph scarcely varies according to the addition of the acid co2 up to ph 11 then this zone corresponds to the simultaneous neutralization of sulfide and lime part 2 the second part corresponds to the first equivalent point ph 11 67 where we can conclude the concentration of lime and sulfide and the amount of co2 necessary for their neutralization part 3 the presence of two buffer zone can be observed the first at ph 9 10 and the second at ph 8 9 where the ph scarcely varies with the addition of co2 both zones are bound to pka of proteins 3 4 conductivity variation as shown in fig 8 a reduction in the electric conductivity of the unhairing bath sample is observed in addition the efficiency range is 30 60 0 5 table 2 these increases in conductivity are mainly due to the elimination of different ions oh ca2 and s2 sh according to the data of corresponding molar ionic electrical conductivities 23 it can be seen that oh has the highest value 19 84 ms mol 1 m2 it can be thus concluded that the decrease in conductivity is mainly due to the neutralization of oh alkalinity beyond ph 8 5 a slight increase in conductivity is observed this behavior is mainly due to the acid base character of the aqueous solution 4 calcium and sulfide variation 4 1 study of synthetic solutions in this part the experiments are carried out on different solutions of lime with an initial conductivity of 8 48 ms cm and 4 12 ms cm fig 9 the influence of the presence of organic matter as peptone on calcium removal efficiency was also studied the calcium concentration affects its removal efficiency and can reach 98 1 96 for the synthetic lime sample with an optimum ph of 10 5 in the presence of peptone a mixture of proteins peptides and amino acids the calcium removal efficiency decreases from 98 to 75 80 1 4 this result shows the influence that the presence of nitrogenous organic matter like peptone can have we can thus explain the efficiency decrease by the complex formation between ca2 and proteins which is confirmed by previous research works bivalent metallic ions especially ca2 form chelates with proteins 4 2 study of unhairing bath wastewaters solutions fig 10 a and b show the behavior of the calcium concentration as a function of ph values of a given unhairing wastewaters sample the calcium concentration decreases with the addition of co2 this behavior can be explained as a result of the reaction between calcium and carbonate ion as explained above one can also observe the existence of an optimal ph value whose efficiency of elimination of calcium is utmost 77 and 75 the optimal ph range is 10 5 9 in addition with the decrease in ph the calcium concentration increases in a weak and stable manner during this experiment it can be observed that it is easy to remove caco3 by simple filtration or decantation also fig 11 shows that removal of 75 1 5 of calcium with 1460 mg l requires 7 5 l equal to 0 31 mol of co2 based on these experimental results fig 10 it is found that the flow rate has a low effect on the efficiency of removal of calcium while 1 5 l min of flow rate reduces the process time as can be seen in the curves the decreases in ph imply a decrease in sulfide concentration the tendency for sulfide removal is similar to that observed with calcium there is a rapid increase in removal during the initial period of operation and then reaching the steady state the time required to reach steady state is however different for different flow rates in water dissolved co2 reacts with sulfide and bisulfite ions as per the following reactions 14 s 2 c o 2 h 2 o h s hc o 3 pka 1 13 15 h s c o 2 h 2 o h 2 s hc o 3 pka 2 7 reaction 15 is reported to be favored in the backward at ph 4 5 or less however in the present study the average sulfide removal efficiency can reach 60 70 at ph 7 in this medium the presence of hco3 buffer medium and the various nitrogen organic matter causes stagnation or a slight decrease of ph 4 3 2nd alternative treatment treatment using co2 and zinc salt in this process it is proposed to use zinc salt 1 m as a precipitating agent for sulfide ion after the elimination of calcium caco3 at the optimal ph at first the ph decrease is done by co2 and was followed and controlled by a ph meter unlike strong acids co2 offers a smoothly decrease in ph consequently the control of ph reduction is more practical then reaching at optimal ph the bubbling can be stopped then zinc salt and wastewater are first mixed rapidly 600 rpm for a short period of about one minute the resulting mixture is stirred slowly 60 rpm for 20 30 min after this step the decantation process occurs resulting in the appearance of a more or less diffuse front separating the liquid volume in two the particles gather at the bottom while above we have the supernatant we can summarize the processing steps below 1 neutralization of alkaline unhairing wastewaters with co2 stopping at an optimal ph ph range 10 5 9 5 2 elimination of caco3 after decantation or filtration 3 introduction of zinc salt that leads to the precipitation of sulfide as zns 4 elimination of zns after decantation the different parameters are analyzed before and after treatment results are shown in the following table table 3 the main benefits brought by the use of zn as a precipitating agent are 1 zn2 with s2 makes an excellent precipitate high pks 16 zns z n 2 s 2 pks 23 8 2 zns is an excellent decanting precipitate 3 zns precipitation process is very fast and only requires a simple dosing and stirring device 4 untreated zns sludge can be stored without any pollution zns being very stable sulfides stored as zns can thus be recycled at the desired moment combination of the two methods co2 neutralization and precipitation gave the following results 1 elimination of calcium in the form of caco3 with a high average efficiency of 78 2 rapid elimination of sulfide in the form of zns with an excellent average efficiency of more than 92 3 resulting wastewaters are very rich in clean cod protein peptides and free amino acids the recovery of this cod is possible 4 recovery and reuse of sulfides are possible 4 4 estimation of co2 needs for neutralization and co2 emissions reduction the amount of co2 captured by unhairing wastewaters is variable and depends first and foremost on the characteristics of the tannery wastewater the number of treated head and its load of basic chemicals lime and sulfides according to the neutralization data from fig 6 an average of 8 l of co2 may be captured per liter of wastewaters according to the world statistical compendium for raw hides skins and leather provided by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2013 world tannery production reached 7190 thousand tons of raw hide skins bovine and sheep the generated unhairing baths are between 4 and 6 m3 per ton of raw hide our results show that one liter of unhairing wastewaters captures 8 l 0 32 mol of co2 therefor if brought to 2013 figure co2 capture would be between 2 29 1011 l 9 18 109 mol and 3 44 1011 l 1 37 1010 mol 5 conclusion in this paper a new method is proposed to neutralize alkaline industrial wastewaters the effluent of tannery unhairing processes by the direct use of captured co2 that has been partly transformed to solid caco3 as a precipitate and partly used to neutralize the remaining alkalinities oh sulfides and proteins the efficiency of this novel technique has been experimentally demonstrated indeed the following results are obtained a carbon emission reduction through a direct and easy way to capture co2 effective treatment of heavily polluted unhairing wastewaters a genuinely clean technology that saves water recovers by products cod and protects the environment the following experimental results illustrate this evident success of using co2 as an efficient and cost effective chemical for ww treatment on a laboratory scale treated wastewaters are recyclable the ph from 13 to 6 7 conductivity from 8000 to 2000 μs cod 20000 80000 to 3000 mg o2 l turbidity pristine final water are drastically reduced only with captured co2 the injected co2 permitted to precipitate caco3 selectively then different proteins according to their pka these precipitated proteins are an excellent bio resource agriculture the treated water contains free valuable and recoverable identified collagen amino acids which could be valorized in future studies furthermore in the case of the combination co2 zinc salts for sulfide precipitation before h2s evolution more than 80 of sulfide has been removed as zns precipitate that could be reused on site as perspective research the combination co2 pre treatment membrane processes

14082,in present study an efficient method was used to synthesis au and pt nanoparticles on ni modified mos2 mni mos2 m au and pt the morphology and structure of the prepared products were characterized using different microscopic and spectroscopic methods the as synthesized mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for catalytic reduction of p nitrophenol p np in the presence of nabh4 p np is one of the prevalent contaminants in wastewaters while its corresponding aromatic amine 4 aminophenol is a precious intermediate for manufacturing of important materials such as pharmaceuticals the obtained catalytic results indicated that noble metal nanoparticles significantly affect catalytic performance of mos2 synergistic effect between metal nanoparticles and mos2 was introduced as the origin of this improved catalytic activity of metals decorated mos2 particles the enhanced catalytic activity of ni modified mos2 particles in comparison to that of unmodified mos2 nanocomposites emphasis on the role of ni in catalytic efficiency keywords p nitrophenol catalytic reduction ni promoted mos2 noble metal nanoparticles 1 introduction nitroaromatic compounds as one of the most prevalent contaminants in industrial and agricultural effluent are hazardous and resistant to natural degradation in the environment 1 it has been reported that remained nitroaromatic materials in the environment may cause many health issues such as blood disorder in animals 2 removing of nitro groups through the catalytic reduction of these compounds in the presence of a reducing agent is an effective solution to decrease their toxicity 3 on the other hand the reduction products aromatic amines are used as precious intermediate for manufacturing of dyes fungicides cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 4 7 the mainly reported catalysts for catalytic transformation of nitroaromatic compounds into their corresponding aromatic amines are expensive noble metals such as au pt ag and pd 8 11 serious trend to aggregation of colloidal noble metal nanoparticles nps is the major obstacle for using of these materials in practical application 12 to overcome agglomeration trend of noble metal nps and limit their utilization during the catalytic reaction the immobilization of noble metal nps has been widely investigated as an effective procedure for this propose diverse kind of organic and inorganic materials such as graphene oxide 13 14 metal organic frameworks 15 16 and metal oxides 17 19 were applied as promising support to stabilize noble metal nps additionally along with other materials transition metal dichalcogenides such as res2 20 and mos2 21 have been introduced as favorable materials for anchoring of noble metal nps recently molybdenum disulfide mos2 has been widely investigated as a promising material in electrocatalysis 22 23 supercapacitors 24 25 lithium ion batteries 26 and photocatalysis 27 29 due to its appealing properties however mos2 is an inexpensive material with earth abundant composition negligible intrinsic of mos2 conductivity limits fast electron transport during the catalytic process 30 on the other hand only the sulfur atoms at the edges of mosx have been reported as active sites for catalytic reaction 31 32 therefore higher number of exposed edge sites of molybdenum sulfide materials means higher catalytic activity incorporation with transition metals such as co ni and fe has been reported as an effective way to improve catalytic activity of mos2 particles 33 34 it has been reported that addition of ni atoms to the mos2 matrix elevate structural stability and exposed more reaction site for catalysis of reactions 35 there are just a few reported researches on cocatalytic role of noble metal nps on catalytic activity of mos2 36 39 in this work we proposed an efficient method to synthesis noble metal nps on ni modified mos2 particles mni mos2 m au and pt the as synthesized mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for catalytic reduction of p np with nabh4 efficient catalytic activities were achieved in the presence of ni promoted mos2 catalysts in comparison to that of unmodified mos2 nanocomposites possible mechanism for catalytic reaction was explored and the source of the excellent catalytic performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect between mos2 and anchored metal nps on its surface 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals absolute ethanol ch3ch2oh chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate k2ptcl6 6h2o gold iii chloride trihydrate haucl4 3h2o sodium borohydride nabh4 and p nitrophenol p np were prepared from merck germany ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and thiourea ch4n2s were prepared from sigma aldrich uk 2 2 synthesis of mos2 mos2 particles were prepared according to the previous reports 36 in a typical experiment 40 ml aqueous solution containing 1 mmol of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and 30 mmol of thiourea was stirred at room temperature for 30 min the resulting clear solution was poured into a stainless steel teflon lined autoclave and heated at 180 for 24 h then the resulting black product was separated washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 80 2 3 synthesis of ni mos2 and mni mos2 m au and pt ni20 mos2 nps were prepared as follows 40 mg of the synthesized mos2 particles were ultrasonically dispersed into 20 ml mixed solution of water and ethanol volume ratio 18 2 respectively then 100 mg of ni no3 6h2o was poured into the obtained black suspension and the resulted mixture was stirred for 24 h afterwards 30 mg of nabh4 was added to the reaction mixture and kept under vigorous magnetic stirring for another 30 min to get ni mos2 nps m mos2 nanocomposites m au and pt were synthesized with the same procedures using haucl4 3h2o and h2ptcl6 6h2o instead of ni no3 6h2o for the preparation of m50ni50 mos2 nanocomposite 50 mg of ni no3 6h2o and a specified amount of aqueous solution of noble metals haucl4 3h2o 1 1 ml 0 047 m and h2ptcl6 6h2o 2 56 ml 0 01 m were added to the as prepared mos2 mixture 40 mg mos2 into 20 ml water and ethanol mixed solution and the resulted suspension was stirred for 24 h subsequently 30 mg of nabh4 was poured to the above suspension and kept under intense magnetic stirring for another 30 min finally resulted powders were separated washed and dried to obtain mni mos2 nanocomposite pt and au content in the pt50ni50 mos2 and au50ni50 mos2 composites were calculated by icp analysis to be 5 3 wt and 5 7 wt the as prepared mn mos2 nanocomposites are listed in table 1 2 4 characterization x ray diffraction xrd analysis for characterizing the phase structure of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated using a philips x pert instrument with a cu k radiation 0 15406 nm at 40 kv 40 ma field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx measurements of the obtained samples were studied by using a xl30 equipped with an edx detector brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of the catalysts and barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size analyses of corresponding samples were calculated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k on a belsorb mini ii inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was conducted using perkin elmer dv 4300 spectrometer hydrochloric acid was used to prepare samples for icp oes ultrasonic processes were performed on an ultrasonic instrument parsonic 2600s ultrasonic frequency 28 khz and output power of 70 w 2 5 catalytic reduction reactions the mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of p np to its correspond aminophenol as the first step 3 ml of p np aqueous solution 0 1 mm was added to a quartz cell 1 0 cm path length and 4 ml volume introduction of nabh4 solution 0 15 ml 0 1 m to the reaction cell caused formation of p nitrophenolate ions which change the color of the solution immediately catalytic reactions was started by adding 1 mg of mos2 nanocomposites into the above solution and reduction reaction was monitored by uv vis absorption spectra of p np at 400 nm at specified time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization xrd analysis was used to evaluate phase structure of the mos2 nanocomposites fig 1 xrd patterns of mos2 demonstrate diffraction peaks at around 13 32 2 34 8 and 57 2 which belong to the 002 100 103 and 110 crystal planes of mos2 40 compare to the pure mos2 xrd patterns the 002 peak at 13 is disappear when ni atoms are introduced to the mos2 surface two new characteristic peaks at 7 7 and 15 5 are obvious in xrd patterns of ni mos2 composite which can be attributed to the first and second order reflections from the 002 plane emerging of these two peaks can be indexed to the enlarged interlayer spacing in ni mos2 structure compared with pristine 2h mos2 30 41 these two peaks also appear in the xrd patterns of auni mos2 and ptni mos2 whereas characteristic peaks related to mos2 in the xrd patterns of au mos2 and pt mos2 are the same as xrd patterns of the unmodified mos2 for noble metals modified mos2 materials xrd patterns demonstrate new characteristic peaks at 38 2 and 39 8 which implied to the 111 planes of cubic au jcpds no 89 3697 and pt jcpds no 87 0642 respectively 37 it should be noted that in the xrd patterns of mni mos2 there is not any obvious peaks related to the auni or ptni alloys scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem were used to investigate morphology and structure of the mos2 nanocomposites fig 2 indicate fe sem images of flower like mos2 fig 2a mos2 decorated with ni fig 2b au fig 2c pt fig 2d auni fig 2e and ptni fig 2f the elemental mapping images of auni mos2 fig 2g and ptni mos2 fig 2h demonstrate that ni and noble metal nps were uniformly distributed on the mos2 surface a comparison between tem images of pure mos2 fig 3 a and mos2 nanocomposites fig 3b 3f also emphasize on the presence of metal nanoparticles on the surface of mos2 sem images of the samples indicate the lateral size of mos2 is around 1 μm based on the tem images the size of metal nanoparticles falls in the range of 5 nm 40 nm from the sem images of mos2 and mos2 nanocomposites it can be deduced that ni does not have any obvious effect on the morphology of mos2 particles the edx analyses of as synthesized nanocomposites truly revealed the presence of au fig 4 a and pt fig 4b along with mo s and ni fig 5 indicates bet analysis of mos2 and auni mos2 which were obtained from n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 k the bet surface area of mos2 ni mos2 ptni mos2 and auni mos2 were measured to be of 3 70 3 64 3 73 and 3 67 m2 g respectively these results are comparable with previous reported surface area of mos2 particles 42 43 pore size distributions of corresponding samples the inset were calculated by the bjh method 3 2 catalytic activity of mni mos2 nanocomposites the as prepared nanocomposites were applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of p np to p ap uv vis absorption spectra of p np demonstrates a peak at 317 nm in neutral aqueous solution in the presence of nabh4 this maximum peak is observed at 400 nm which emphasis on the formation of p nitrophenolate ions in the presence of reducing agent the time taken for reduction of p np in the presence of nabh4 without any catalysts is 90 min after addition of mos2 nanocomposites into the reaction cell the absorption peak at 400 nm gradually diminished by slight increase of p nitrophenolate ions absorption peak that appears at 300 nm fig 6 due to the high initial concentration of nabh4 the concentration of bh4 is nearly stable within the reaction time and the reduction reaction could be supposed to follow a pseudo ﬁrst order kinetics the kinetics of the catalytic reactions were studied by the plot of ln ct c0 against reaction time where c0 and ct are the p np concentrations at initial time and t min after that respectively fig 7 apparent rate constant values of the reactions k a p p were calculated from slopes of fitted plots and reported in table 2 in order to study the effect of noble metals and ni composition on catalytic properties of mos2 particles various noble metal and ni ratios were introduced on the mos2 surface fig 8 according to the apparent rate constant values of the reactions table 2 the best catalytic activities were obtained when the weight percentage ratio of noble metals and ni was 50 50 au25ni75 mos2 and pt75ni25 mos2 exposed the lowest catalytic performance between as prepared metal decorated mos2 catalysts comparison of mn mos2 catalytic activity with some of other reported materials revealed that these new synthesized catalysts demonstrated significant performance for p np reduction reaction table 3 in order to evaluate the reusability of ni modified mos2 nanocomposites three sequential catalytic reaction runs were carried out with recovered auni mos2 and ptni mos2 for this purpose after each catalytic reaction run the catalyst powder was collected by centrifugation washed with water dried and used in the new catalytic cycle in third reduction reaction cycles catalytic efficiency of ptni mos2 fig 9 a and auni mos2 fig 9b were decreased to around 61 and 66 efficiency of the first reaction runs respectively it should be noted that leaching tests by icp analysis revealed that no amount of pt ni and au can be detected in the resulted p ap solutions these decrease of catalytic activity of ni modified mos2 composites can be resulted from losing of catalysts during the recovering process according to the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism catalytic reduction of p np requires the adsorption of the bh4 and p np ions onto the surface of the catalyst adsorbed bh4 ions play electron donor role and provide hydrogen atoms to the surface of catalyst for reduction of adsorbed p np ions bh4 ions can react with the edge sites of mos2 to discharge electrons and hydrogen species on their surface 31 whereas noble metal nps can transfer electron to the adsorbed p np ions when noble metal nps are decorated on the surface of mos2 a fermi level alignment will happen at the semiconductor metal interface 50 the fermi level of au 5 1 ev 51 and pt 5 65 ev 52 are higher than that of mos2 4 0 4 7 ev 53 then an electron migration will happen in noble metal mos2 junctions these electron transformations create an electron enriched area around the noble metal nps which terminate to a vacant region in the noble metal mos2 interface the accumulated electrons on the noble metal nps surface can accelerate electron transition among the metal nps and adsorbed p np ions on the other hand ni atoms on the mos2 surface exposed more reaction sites for catalysis of reaction and also affect electron transformation from bh4 to mos2 as a result the origin of the excellent catalytic activity of the noble metals decorated mos2 can be resulted from synergistic effects between metal nps and mos2 proposed electron transformation process of p np reduction over mni mos2 composites is shown by scheme 1 4 conclusion in this study ni promoted mos2 particles were applied as proper support for noble metal nps to prepare efficient catalysts for catalytic reduction of p np with nabh4 catalytic results asserted that as synthesized ni modified mos2

14082,in present study an efficient method was used to synthesis au and pt nanoparticles on ni modified mos2 mni mos2 m au and pt the morphology and structure of the prepared products were characterized using different microscopic and spectroscopic methods the as synthesized mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for catalytic reduction of p nitrophenol p np in the presence of nabh4 p np is one of the prevalent contaminants in wastewaters while its corresponding aromatic amine 4 aminophenol is a precious intermediate for manufacturing of important materials such as pharmaceuticals the obtained catalytic results indicated that noble metal nanoparticles significantly affect catalytic performance of mos2 synergistic effect between metal nanoparticles and mos2 was introduced as the origin of this improved catalytic activity of metals decorated mos2 particles the enhanced catalytic activity of ni modified mos2 particles in comparison to that of unmodified mos2 nanocomposites emphasis on the role of ni in catalytic efficiency keywords p nitrophenol catalytic reduction ni promoted mos2 noble metal nanoparticles 1 introduction nitroaromatic compounds as one of the most prevalent contaminants in industrial and agricultural effluent are hazardous and resistant to natural degradation in the environment 1 it has been reported that remained nitroaromatic materials in the environment may cause many health issues such as blood disorder in animals 2 removing of nitro groups through the catalytic reduction of these compounds in the presence of a reducing agent is an effective solution to decrease their toxicity 3 on the other hand the reduction products aromatic amines are used as precious intermediate for manufacturing of dyes fungicides cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 4 7 the mainly reported catalysts for catalytic transformation of nitroaromatic compounds into their corresponding aromatic amines are expensive noble metals such as au pt ag and pd 8 11 serious trend to aggregation of colloidal noble metal nanoparticles nps is the major obstacle for using of these materials in practical application 12 to overcome agglomeration trend of noble metal nps and limit their utilization during the catalytic reaction the immobilization of noble metal nps has been widely investigated as an effective procedure for this propose diverse kind of organic and inorganic materials such as graphene oxide 13 14 metal organic frameworks 15 16 and metal oxides 17 19 were applied as promising support to stabilize noble metal nps additionally along with other materials transition metal dichalcogenides such as res2 20 and mos2 21 have been introduced as favorable materials for anchoring of noble metal nps recently molybdenum disulfide mos2 has been widely investigated as a promising material in electrocatalysis 22 23 supercapacitors 24 25 lithium ion batteries 26 and photocatalysis 27 29 due to its appealing properties however mos2 is an inexpensive material with earth abundant composition negligible intrinsic of mos2 conductivity limits fast electron transport during the catalytic process 30 on the other hand only the sulfur atoms at the edges of mosx have been reported as active sites for catalytic reaction 31 32 therefore higher number of exposed edge sites of molybdenum sulfide materials means higher catalytic activity incorporation with transition metals such as co ni and fe has been reported as an effective way to improve catalytic activity of mos2 particles 33 34 it has been reported that addition of ni atoms to the mos2 matrix elevate structural stability and exposed more reaction site for catalysis of reactions 35 there are just a few reported researches on cocatalytic role of noble metal nps on catalytic activity of mos2 36 39 in this work we proposed an efficient method to synthesis noble metal nps on ni modified mos2 particles mni mos2 m au and pt the as synthesized mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for catalytic reduction of p np with nabh4 efficient catalytic activities were achieved in the presence of ni promoted mos2 catalysts in comparison to that of unmodified mos2 nanocomposites possible mechanism for catalytic reaction was explored and the source of the excellent catalytic performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect between mos2 and anchored metal nps on its surface 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals absolute ethanol ch3ch2oh chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate k2ptcl6 6h2o gold iii chloride trihydrate haucl4 3h2o sodium borohydride nabh4 and p nitrophenol p np were prepared from merck germany ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and thiourea ch4n2s were prepared from sigma aldrich uk 2 2 synthesis of mos2 mos2 particles were prepared according to the previous reports 36 in a typical experiment 40 ml aqueous solution containing 1 mmol of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and 30 mmol of thiourea was stirred at room temperature for 30 min the resulting clear solution was poured into a stainless steel teflon lined autoclave and heated at 180 for 24 h then the resulting black product was separated washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 80 2 3 synthesis of ni mos2 and mni mos2 m au and pt ni20 mos2 nps were prepared as follows 40 mg of the synthesized mos2 particles were ultrasonically dispersed into 20 ml mixed solution of water and ethanol volume ratio 18 2 respectively then 100 mg of ni no3 6h2o was poured into the obtained black suspension and the resulted mixture was stirred for 24 h afterwards 30 mg of nabh4 was added to the reaction mixture and kept under vigorous magnetic stirring for another 30 min to get ni mos2 nps m mos2 nanocomposites m au and pt were synthesized with the same procedures using haucl4 3h2o and h2ptcl6 6h2o instead of ni no3 6h2o for the preparation of m50ni50 mos2 nanocomposite 50 mg of ni no3 6h2o and a specified amount of aqueous solution of noble metals haucl4 3h2o 1 1 ml 0 047 m and h2ptcl6 6h2o 2 56 ml 0 01 m were added to the as prepared mos2 mixture 40 mg mos2 into 20 ml water and ethanol mixed solution and the resulted suspension was stirred for 24 h subsequently 30 mg of nabh4 was poured to the above suspension and kept under intense magnetic stirring for another 30 min finally resulted powders were separated washed and dried to obtain mni mos2 nanocomposite pt and au content in the pt50ni50 mos2 and au50ni50 mos2 composites were calculated by icp analysis to be 5 3 wt and 5 7 wt the as prepared mn mos2 nanocomposites are listed in table 1 2 4 characterization x ray diffraction xrd analysis for characterizing the phase structure of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated using a philips x pert instrument with a cu k radiation 0 15406 nm at 40 kv 40 ma field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx measurements of the obtained samples were studied by using a xl30 equipped with an edx detector brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of the catalysts and barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size analyses of corresponding samples were calculated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k on a belsorb mini ii inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was conducted using perkin elmer dv 4300 spectrometer hydrochloric acid was used to prepare samples for icp oes ultrasonic processes were performed on an ultrasonic instrument parsonic 2600s ultrasonic frequency 28 khz and output power of 70 w 2 5 catalytic reduction reactions the mni mos2 nanocomposites were applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of p np to its correspond aminophenol as the first step 3 ml of p np aqueous solution 0 1 mm was added to a quartz cell 1 0 cm path length and 4 ml volume introduction of nabh4 solution 0 15 ml 0 1 m to the reaction cell caused formation of p nitrophenolate ions which change the color of the solution immediately catalytic reactions was started by adding 1 mg of mos2 nanocomposites into the above solution and reduction reaction was monitored by uv vis absorption spectra of p np at 400 nm at specified time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization xrd analysis was used to evaluate phase structure of the mos2 nanocomposites fig 1 xrd patterns of mos2 demonstrate diffraction peaks at around 13 32 2 34 8 and 57 2 which belong to the 002 100 103 and 110 crystal planes of mos2 40 compare to the pure mos2 xrd patterns the 002 peak at 13 is disappear when ni atoms are introduced to the mos2 surface two new characteristic peaks at 7 7 and 15 5 are obvious in xrd patterns of ni mos2 composite which can be attributed to the first and second order reflections from the 002 plane emerging of these two peaks can be indexed to the enlarged interlayer spacing in ni mos2 structure compared with pristine 2h mos2 30 41 these two peaks also appear in the xrd patterns of auni mos2 and ptni mos2 whereas characteristic peaks related to mos2 in the xrd patterns of au mos2 and pt mos2 are the same as xrd patterns of the unmodified mos2 for noble metals modified mos2 materials xrd patterns demonstrate new characteristic peaks at 38 2 and 39 8 which implied to the 111 planes of cubic au jcpds no 89 3697 and pt jcpds no 87 0642 respectively 37 it should be noted that in the xrd patterns of mni mos2 there is not any obvious peaks related to the auni or ptni alloys scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem were used to investigate morphology and structure of the mos2 nanocomposites fig 2 indicate fe sem images of flower like mos2 fig 2a mos2 decorated with ni fig 2b au fig 2c pt fig 2d auni fig 2e and ptni fig 2f the elemental mapping images of auni mos2 fig 2g and ptni mos2 fig 2h demonstrate that ni and noble metal nps were uniformly distributed on the mos2 surface a comparison between tem images of pure mos2 fig 3 a and mos2 nanocomposites fig 3b 3f also emphasize on the presence of metal nanoparticles on the surface of mos2 sem images of the samples indicate the lateral size of mos2 is around 1 μm based on the tem images the size of metal nanoparticles falls in the range of 5 nm 40 nm from the sem images of mos2 and mos2 nanocomposites it can be deduced that ni does not have any obvious effect on the morphology of mos2 particles the edx analyses of as synthesized nanocomposites truly revealed the presence of au fig 4 a and pt fig 4b along with mo s and ni fig 5 indicates bet analysis of mos2 and auni mos2 which were obtained from n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 k the bet surface area of mos2 ni mos2 ptni mos2 and auni mos2 were measured to be of 3 70 3 64 3 73 and 3 67 m2 g respectively these results are comparable with previous reported surface area of mos2 particles 42 43 pore size distributions of corresponding samples the inset were calculated by the bjh method 3 2 catalytic activity of mni mos2 nanocomposites the as prepared nanocomposites were applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of p np to p ap uv vis absorption spectra of p np demonstrates a peak at 317 nm in neutral aqueous solution in the presence of nabh4 this maximum peak is observed at 400 nm which emphasis on the formation of p nitrophenolate ions in the presence of reducing agent the time taken for reduction of p np in the presence of nabh4 without any catalysts is 90 min after addition of mos2 nanocomposites into the reaction cell the absorption peak at 400 nm gradually diminished by slight increase of p nitrophenolate ions absorption peak that appears at 300 nm fig 6 due to the high initial concentration of nabh4 the concentration of bh4 is nearly stable within the reaction time and the reduction reaction could be supposed to follow a pseudo ﬁrst order kinetics the kinetics of the catalytic reactions were studied by the plot of ln ct c0 against reaction time where c0 and ct are the p np concentrations at initial time and t min after that respectively fig 7 apparent rate constant values of the reactions k a p p were calculated from slopes of fitted plots and reported in table 2 in order to study the effect of noble metals and ni composition on catalytic properties of mos2 particles various noble metal and ni ratios were introduced on the mos2 surface fig 8 according to the apparent rate constant values of the reactions table 2 the best catalytic activities were obtained when the weight percentage ratio of noble metals and ni was 50 50 au25ni75 mos2 and pt75ni25 mos2 exposed the lowest catalytic performance between as prepared metal decorated mos2 catalysts comparison of mn mos2 catalytic activity with some of other reported materials revealed that these new synthesized catalysts demonstrated significant performance for p np reduction reaction table 3 in order to evaluate the reusability of ni modified mos2 nanocomposites three sequential catalytic reaction runs were carried out with recovered auni mos2 and ptni mos2 for this purpose after each catalytic reaction run the catalyst powder was collected by centrifugation washed with water dried and used in the new catalytic cycle in third reduction reaction cycles catalytic efficiency of ptni mos2 fig 9 a and auni mos2 fig 9b were decreased to around 61 and 66 efficiency of the first reaction runs respectively it should be noted that leaching tests by icp analysis revealed that no amount of pt ni and au can be detected in the resulted p ap solutions these decrease of catalytic activity of ni modified mos2 composites can be resulted from losing of catalysts during the recovering process according to the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism catalytic reduction of p np requires the adsorption of the bh4 and p np ions onto the surface of the catalyst adsorbed bh4 ions play electron donor role and provide hydrogen atoms to the surface of catalyst for reduction of adsorbed p np ions bh4 ions can react with the edge sites of mos2 to discharge electrons and hydrogen species on their surface 31 whereas noble metal nps can transfer electron to the adsorbed p np ions when noble metal nps are decorated on the surface of mos2 a fermi level alignment will happen at the semiconductor metal interface 50 the fermi level of au 5 1 ev 51 and pt 5 65 ev 52 are higher than that of mos2 4 0 4 7 ev 53 then an electron migration will happen in noble metal mos2 junctions these electron transformations create an electron enriched area around the noble metal nps which terminate to a vacant region in the noble metal mos2 interface the accumulated electrons on the noble metal nps surface can accelerate electron transition among the metal nps and adsorbed p np ions on the other hand ni atoms on the mos2 surface exposed more reaction sites for catalysis of reaction and also affect electron transformation from bh4 to mos2 as a result the origin of the excellent catalytic activity of the noble metals decorated mos2 can be resulted from synergistic effects between metal nps and mos2 proposed electron transformation process of p np reduction over mni mos2 composites is shown by scheme 1 4 conclusion in this study ni promoted mos2 particles were applied as proper support for noble metal nps to prepare efficient catalysts for catalytic reduction of p np with nabh4 catalytic results asserted that as synthesized ni modified mos2 particles demonstrated remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in comparison to that of unmodified mos2 particles synergistic effect between metal nps and mos2 was introduced as the origin of excellent catalytic activity of the metal decorated mos2 particles on the other hand ni atoms on the surface of catalyst expose more reaction sites along with the edge sites of mos2 for reduction reaction ni

14083,this study investigated the microbial community structure on the anode surface of four dual chamber bio electrochemical systems these systems were microbial fuel cell mfc and microbial electrolysis cell mec the systems were inoculated with activated sludge and operated for electricity generation hydrogen h2 production and phosphorus p recovery the mfc achieved a maximum power output of 185 mw m2 1 62 kw h m2 whilst the mec achieved a maximum h2 production rate of 0 28 m3 h2 m3 d results from illumina high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that the microbial community structure of the mfcs was more diverse than that of the mecs and this variation may be attributed to the differences in the operational conditions of the mfc and the mec mfc and mec shared the same dominant bacterial phyla bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes with the most abundant bacterial genus in both systems belonging to desulfovibrio however the abundance of desulfovibrio in the mecs 13 2 0 7 was greater than that in the mfcs 4 25 0 2 keywords microbial fuel cell microbial electrolysis cell microbial community analysis bioelectricity hydrogen desulfovibrio 1 introduction microorganisms in bio electrochemical systems bes convert the chemical energy in organic matter to electrical energy or hydrogen gas typically the operation of bes is influenced by different parameters such as the activity of microorganisms cell design and cell materials bacteria community and electron transfer in bes are important parameters that affect energy generation and hydrogen production bacteria such as anode respiring bacteria and electrochemically active bacteria have both been shown to transfer electrons from the substrate to the electrodes without the aid of any external mediator that is mediator less bes 1 in contrast mediators are used in the presence of electrochemically inactive bacteria in bess to facilitate electron transfer between the electrode and the bacteria 2 the anaerobic electrochemically active biofilm that develops on the anode plays an important role in bes performance recent studies have focused on improving bes design and materials but very little has been paid to the microbial community aspects in the system 3 consequently microbial communities and their effects on bes operation and performance remain largely unknown it is therefore important to understand the microbial community and identify the dominant species contributing to electron transfer in the anode biofilm in order to improve bes performance different communities of microorganism can be found in bes and this is due to the fact that operational and environmental conditions can change the microbial communities in the system 4 this implies that the changes in microbial communities in bes are linked to the environmental and operational conditions microbial fuel cells mfc and microbial electrolysis cells mec are bes that have recently generated a lot of interest this is due to their ability to generate energy from different waste streams mfcs comprise of an anaerobic anode chamber and aerobic cathode chamber both separated by a cation exchange membrane on the other hand mec comprises of an anaerobic anode chamber and anaerobic cathode chamber the anode chambers in both systems contain exoelectrogenic bacteria which are the bacteria responsible for transferring electrons to the anode either through direct contact or using an electron soluble shuttle in bes microbial species such as geobacte shewanella and phototrophic bacteria can be found in the anode electrode as in mecs the growth of anaerobic bacteria such as methanogenic microorganisms can be promoted due to the anaerobic condition in both the anode and cathode chambers most bes use wastewater as inoculum and wastewater contains different bacteria communities the microbial community is expected to change when this is changed in order to adapt to the new environment in addition bacteria community and composition can be affected by operational conditions such as solution ph during the operation of bes anode and cathode ph might fluctuate and this is due to reduction oxidation reactions that could affect the bacteria community there are different techniques that have been used to characterize microbial communities in bes for example techniques such as 16s rrna gene analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish have been used to describe and quantify both anodic and cathodic communities in bes 5 however these techniques are limited by the number of samples and the amount of sequence data that they can achieve recently new technologies such as high throughput next generation sequencing ngs has been developed to improve this capability and to help understand complex microbial communities in environmental systems ngs of 16s rrna genes has the potential to describe the full diversity and composition of complex microbial communities in mfc and mec daghio et al 5 studied the microbial community in a single chamber mfc fed with acetate and inoculated with a biogas digestate in this study illumina sequencing of a fragment of the 16s rrna gene was used to characterize the microbial communities the results showed that geovibrio and purple non sulfur pns bacteria were the dominant species in the anodic biofilm whereas the alkaliphilic genus nitrincola and anaerobic microorganisms belonging to porphyromonadaceae family were the most abundant bacteria in the cathodic biofilm geovibrio genus belongs to iron reducing bacteria which can conserve energy for anaerobic growth by coupling the oxidation reaction of organic compounds to the reduction of iron 6 in another study by xia et al 7 the microbial community was studied using sequencing analysis in mfc inoculated with wastewater the mfc showed high power density 543 75 mw m2 and high removal rates of chemical oxygen demand 75 59 the sequencing analysis revealed that the mfc inoculated was rich in the microbial community and some bacteria such as saprospiraceae and caldilineaceae enhanced its performance furthermore sciarria et al 8 monitored the development of the microbial communities during the start up of mfc wastewater from an urban wastewater treatment plant was used to inoculate the system the 16s rdna gene profiling showed that the microbial communities was enriched with acinetobacter azospirillum arcobacter and comamonas at the beginning of mfc activation however the main genera detected after three days were azospirillum acinetobacter enterococcus and dysgonomonas genera such as acinetobacter and azospirillum are electrochemically active communities and can be found in many mfc studies they are to contribute to electricity generation in another study lee et al 9 identified the microbial community in mec and anaerobic digester the results showed that members of the clostridia class were more abundant than the bacteroidia class compared to the anaerobic digester mec showed a 40 increase in the overall bacterial population increasing the removal of organic matter and the conversion of volatile fatty acids vfas the study showed that the mec reactions converts organic matters to vfas more effectively and it activates microbial communities favourable for methane production furthermore flayac et al 10 studied the microbial community in dual chamber mec inoculated with activated sludge and fed in batch mode with acetate the results showed that the anodic biofilms were mainly dominated by geobacter often times geobacter is the most common genus in bes studies and it contributes directly to electricity generation the different operational conditions of the mfc and mec are reflected by the other changes in microbial communities kiely et al 11 tracked the changes in microbial communities when mfc was converted to mec the systems were fed with complex organic matter source potato and dairy wastewater the results showed that the proportion of geobacteraceae remained constant when mfcs were converted into mecs but the percentage of clones belonging to g sulfurreducens decreased and the percentage of g metallireducens clones increased recently mec and mfc were investigated for h2 electricity production and phosphorus p recovery 12 13 however these studies focused on assessing concurrent h2 electricity production and p recovery rather than studying the microbial community therefore the aim of this study is to identify and compare the microbial community structure in both an mfc and mec it is important to identify the community structure and composition of the biofilm in order to achieve a better performance of bes and to also increase our understanding of how different microbes affect bes performance therefore the objectives of this study are i to identify and understand the structure and community of microorganisms that develop in mfcs and mecs that were operated for 400 days using ngs and ii to link the relative abundance of known exoelectrogenic microorganism species with bes performance 2 material and methods 2 1 mediator less bes construction four sets of dual chamber h type bottles adams chittenden scientific glass berkeley ca usa were used to construct two mfcs and two mecs anode and cathode electrodes were made of carbon cloth 2 5 5 cm projected area of 25 cm2 with a volume of 300 ml for each chamber see figs 1 and 2 the ph of the anode and the cathode ph were monitored during the operation of the bess the cathode contained a pt catalyst 0 5 mg cm2 10 pt on carbon cloth electrode whilst the anode was plain carbon cloth electrodes were connected with a titanium wire 0 5 mm purity 99 98 alfa aesar heysham uk a nafion membrane nafion 117 sigma aldrich london uk was placed in the middle of the anode and the cathode the bess were maintained at 20 c in a temperature controlled room a dc power supply psd 30 3b caltek hong kong was used to apply a voltage 0 5 1 1 v for the mec the external power source is needed to force thermodynamically unfavourable reactions to occur and produce hydrogen in mec at least 0 2 v is required to produce h2 and this amount of energy is lower than that required for water electrolysis 1 2 v the voltage was added by connecting the positive pole of the power source to the anodes while the negative pole led to a high precision resistor 10 x and the cathodes electrodes were connected to 1000 ω of external resistance at the inoculation stage and this was then changed to 407 ω mfc and 10 ω mec during the operational stage a fresh medium combined with inoculum mixture was used to replace the anolyte after each mec cycle the anode chamber was drained and exposed to atmospheric air for 20 45 min to inhibit methanogen growth 2 2 bes inoculation and operation condition the anode chambers were inoculated with a 1 1 mixture of activated sludge and anolyte medium containing ch₃coona 3 28 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l kcl 0 13 g l h2po4 2 69 g l na2hpo4 4 33 g l 10 ml vitamins

environment lack of free oxygen using a glove box to maintain the anaerobic environment for the anode biofilms after the inoculation period the anolyte medium was replaced with synthetic wastewater which contained ch₃coona 0 5 2 g l depending on cod concentration kh2po4 0 65 g l k2hpo4 0 65 g l kcl 0 74 g l nacl 0 58 g l nh4cl 0 375 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l 0 1 ml vitamins solution and 0 1 ml trace element solution in the mfc the bes were operated in two stage feed batch mode at room temperature the synthetic wastewater was fed to the anode chamber for organic matter removal at the first stage at the end of each cycle the anode effluent was filtered using a 0 2 μm filter membrane fisher scientific uk and then transferred into the cathode chamber where air is supplied aeration was provided to the cathode chamber using an aquarium pump a new batch of synthetic wastewater was then introduced into the anode chamber similar to the mecs the cathode synthetic wastewater contained ch₃coona 0 5 g l kh2po4 0 25 g l k2hpo4 0 25 g l kcl 0 74 g l nacl 0 58 g l nh4cl 0 375 g l mgcl2 0 32 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l anode and cathode influent were adjusted to ph 7 0 the volume of the produced gas in the cathode chamber was measured using the displacement method 2 3 analytical methods the voltage across the external resistance 407 ω mfc and 10 ω mec was recorded every 15 min using an adc 20 data logger system pico technology saint neots uk which was connected to a computer based on the recorded voltage current i and power p iv were calculated according to ohm s law the current and power densities were calculated by dividing the current and power by the anode area 25 cm2 coulombic efficiency ce was calculated by integrating the measured

pcr and illumina sequencing all anode electrodes four electrodes were removed from the anode chambers of the mfc and mec both of which have been in stable operation for more than 400 days these were then stored at 20 c until further processing genomic dna was extracted using a metagenomic dna isolation kit cambio ltd cambridge uk the size and quantity of the extracted dna fragments were determined respectively using an agilent tape station genomic dna screentape hsd 1000 and genomic dna reagents agilent santa clara ca usa and a qubit assay machine qubit assays life technologies sweden following the dna extraction a single step amplification and sequencing library creation pcr was performed for bacterial 16s rrna genes using primers targeting the v4 variable region in a 96 well pcr plate as described by kozich et al 15 each well contained 17 μl of accuprime pfx supermix 1 μl of template dna and 2 μl of each paired set of index primers thereafter 1 μl of pcr grade h2o was added to the negative control and 1 μl of mock community bei resources virginia usa was added to the positive control the following programme was then used for the thermal cycling an initial 2 min at 95 c 30 cycles of 20 s at 95 c 15 s at 55 c and 5 min at 72 c and a final step of 72 c for 10 min in total 12 dna samples were analysed using illumina sequencing illumina san diego ca usa illumina sequencing was performed using 2 250 bp paired end flow cells and reagent cartridges the data generated from the illumina sequencing was analysed using mothur v1 38 1 16 in accordance with the miseq standard operating procedure 15 in summary the analytical process started with the contigs formation and then sequences filtration to remove ambiguous reads shorter than 245 bp and longer than 275 bp the resulting sequences were reduced to generate a unique set of sequences and then aligned with the silva database the sequences were assigned taxonomy and then a distance matrix was generated between the aligned sequences all sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units otus at 95 sequence similarity 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed to understand the microbial community and the difference between mfcs and mecs shannon index and chao1 were used to identify the species diversity and richness for each sample respectively in addition weighted unifrac analysis was performed to compute the difference between the microbial communities based on phylogenetic information principal coordinates analysis pcoa was used to visualise the similarities in the microbial community relationships based on the distance matrix after clustering the heat map was generated via r studio software to reflect any similarities and differences in the community composition among bacterial samples at the family level a venn diagram with shared and unique otus was used to depict the similarities and differences between the two communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 mfc and mec general performance mfcs and mecs were operated for concurrent h2 energy production and p recovery map hexahydrate struvite was precipitated in the cathode chambers of both mec and mfc the mec achieved a maximum hydrogen production rate of 0 28 m3 h2 m3 d fig 3 in a similar study cusick and logan 17 achieved a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2 3 m3 h2 m3 d using a single chamber mec reactor on the other hand the mfc achieved a maximum power output of 185 mw m2 or 1 62 kw h m2 fig 4 this is comparable to another study in which the dual chamber mfc treating domestic wastewater and recovering nutrients achieved a maximum power density of 253 84 mw m2 18 the variation in power density between the two studies can be attributed to the high influent cod concentration in this study which exerted significant impacts on the catholyte ph the h2 energy production efficiency of both systems was affected by the precipitation of struvite on the cathode electrodes 3 2 diversity of microbial community and composition in total 12 samples were analysed electrodes and water samples from each anode chamber in the mfcs and the mecs each electrode was divided into 2 parts a and b after removing the low quality reads there were 29362 88108 effective reads the sequencing obtained 230 383 otus from the samples each with 95 similarity chao1 estimator ranged from 240 to 300 for the mfc and from 195 to 280 for the mecs this indicates that the mfcs had greater richness than the mecs the shannon diversity index was used to determine community diversity and it varied between 3 1 3 6 for the mfcs and 2 3 for the mecs similar values of the shannon index for the anode communities were obtained by 11 the shannon index shows that the microbial diversity in anode mfcs is greater than in the anode mecs the sequencing results indicate that microbial communities in mfcs are more diverse than in mecs similarly chae et al 19 confirmed that lower species richness of bacteria was found in mecs compared to mfcs each system mfc or mec was operated under certain operational conditions generally the mfc was operated with an aerobic cathode whereas the mec cathode was operated under anaerobic conditions and an external power source the operational conditions of these systems highly influenced the diversity and richness of the microorganisms operational conditions such as applied voltage and ph have been shown to impact on microbial communities in bes 20 applied voltage influences microbial activity in two ways on one hand it stimulates the microorganisms to grow and degrade organic matter on the other hand it inhibits microorganisms if the current is too high in addition chae et al 19 showed that using an external power source in mecs can result in a change or damage to the biofilm 3 3 bacterial taxonomic identification sequences were assigned taxonomy to identify the different communities in mfcs and mecs and classified from phyla to genera the relative abundance of a given bacteria group was set as the number of sequences affiliated with that group divided by the total number of sequences per sample in the mfcs a total of 19 bacteria phyla were identified 19 phyla in mfc 1 and 17 phyla in mfc 2 the microbial populations belonged to 33 classes and 78 genera the results showed that overall communities of the anodic biofilms in mfcs had similar bacterial species synergistetes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the anode chambers of the mfcs the sum of the four dominant phyla accounted for 75 9 2 6 in mfc 1 and mfc 2 synergistetes 29 5 2 5 bacteroidetes 23 4 proteobacteria 14 4 1 4 and firmicutes 9 2 5 of the total reads this was followed by other major phyla such as chloroflexi 6 0 3 and ignavibacteriae 2 0 1 in addition other minor phyla were found with low abundance in the community such as cloacimonetes 0 5 and acidobacteria 0 2 it should be noted that around 11 1 of the total reads were not classified at the phylum level similarly 18 bacteria phyla were identified in mec 1 18 phyla and mec 2 16 phyla and the microbial populations belonged to 33 classes and 77 genera the anodic biofilm in the mecs was also shown to have similar bacterial species and community structure proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla in the anode chambers of the mecs this result is consistent with the composition found in another mec study 21 where proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla were the dominant bacteria at phyla level mecs comprised proteobacteria 32 5 8 firmicutes 17 5 2 5 bacteroidetes 6 0 1 and synergistetes 6 0 1 of the total reads other phyla with small quantities were found and these include chloroflexi 0 6 spirochaetes 0 3 and actinobacteria 0 2 bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla are commonly found in mfc and mec studies 22 23 however the microbial structure is not consistent throughout all bes studies various phyla in the community have the ability to transfer electrons to the anode electrode bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria are the most common phyla in bio electrochemical studies and this result was consistent with previous research that used acetate as the main source of carbon 23 a surprisingly high abundance of the phylum synergistetes was found in the mfc communities and less than 6 in the mecs communities previous studies have shown that synergistetes were the dominant phyla in multiple mfc studies 24 25 the main source of this phylum in this study might be the anaerobic digester sludge used during the inoculation process 26 the synergistetes phylum is commonly found in bess fed with acetate 25 but often at low abundance however one study did report a high abundance of synergistetes 33 in mfcs fed with acetate 24 the bacteroidetes phylum was detected as the dominant phylum in the mfcs 19 27 and in the mecs the percentage of bacteroidetes 6 was low compared to the mfcs bacteroidetes and synergistetes are fermentative bacteria that were induced in the anaerobic environment of the anode and are known to be capable of the biodegradation of organic pollutants 27 in the present study electrochemically active bacteria such as proteobacteria firmicutes and acidobacteria were present in the anodic chambers of both the mfcs and the mecs proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla have been shown to have the ability to directly transfer the electrons to the anode electrode for example wrighton et al 28 stated that the functional role of firmicutes in mfcs was current production in addition the firmicutes phylum is commonly abundant in dual chamber mfcs and is responsible for power production 29 the relative abundance of firmicutes in the mecs was higher than in the mfcs and this is probably due to the different operational conditions of each system cathode aeration in mfc and applied voltage in mec the classes synergistia clostridia and deltaproteobacteria were dominant in both mfc and mec these classes have been reported to be dominant in bess and with energy generation 30 deltaproteobacteria are electrochemically active bacteria that play an important role in generating protons and electrons during metabolism and they are involved in energy generation 31 the deltaproteobacteria class is commonly found in acetate enriched mfcs and it is responsible for the direct electron transfer to the electrode 32 the class clostridia has been reported to play an important role in power generation and for being responsible for converting fermentable substrate into simple organics 33 at the genera level 78 genera were observed in each mfc the mfcs anodic community comprised desulfovibrio 4 25 0 2 butyricicoccus 5 5 1 petrimonas 4 0 6 propionivibrio 1 5 0 3 desulfovirga 1 5 0 1 and geobacter 0 8 0 3 around 59 of the total composition was assigned as unclassified at the genus level the community of mecs included desulfovibrio 13 2 0 7 acidaminococcus 2 0 2 desulfocapsa 1 5 0 3 acetobacterium 1 0 1 and cloacibacillus 0 8 0 1 more than 62 of the total composition was not classified due to the complexity of the community fig 5 different microorganism species can be found in the anode chamber but not all of those species are involved in energy or current production in terms of electricity generation desulfovibrio which belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class was the dominant genus among the classified genera in both systems however the presence of desulfovibrio in the mecs 13 2 0 7 was greater than in the mfcs 4 25 0 2 in addition the relative abundance of desulfovibrio in mfc 1 was higher than in mfc 2 desulfovibrio is important in current production and it was reported to be involved in both current production and organic matter degradation 22 desulfovibrio was the common predominant exoelectrogen in the anodic biofilm in both systems thus demonstrating that this genus was well adapted to the operating conditions furthermore it also contributes to the current generation as the main exoelectrogen in the electrodes desulfovibrio has been reported to be the dominant gene in different bes studies and its role in electricity generation has been confirmed desulfovibrio is responsible for transferring the electrons from the substrate to the electrode surface via the outer membrane cytochrome kang et al 34 stated that in mediator less mfcs desulfovibrio was observed to enhance the current generation and it was able to transfer the electrons more efficiently than geobacter in addition to the role of desulfovibrio for electricity generation geobacter species are well known exoelectrogenic bacteria geobacter s role is crucial indirect electron transfer without the aid of any mediators geobacter is one of the most important genera for electron transport between the bacteria and electrode the percentages of geobacter 1 detected in both systems were low compared to previous studies and it showed a higher percentage in single chamber mfcs 58 10 35 however low percentages of exoelectrogens such as geobacter and shewanella have been reported in different studies 36 many species that are capable of generating electricity were found in the anode biofilm however these species were not numerically abundant and they accounted for 0 2 in addition shewanella which is commonly present in bes was not detected in either the mfcs nor the mecs shewanella has been reported to grow in low nutrient environments 37 but the synthetic wastewater in this study contains high concentrations of nutrients and this tends to inhibit the growth of shewanella thormann et al 37 stated that the presence of oxygen with a high concentration of nutrients leads organisms to catabolize the nutrients aerobically rather than investing energy in the formation of the biofilm shewanella has not been detected in many mfc and mec studies 38 butyricicoccus from the class clostridia of the phylum firmicutes was found with approximately the same percentage in both systems butyricicoccus was reported to utilise acetate and produce butyrate h2 and co2 39 in terms of organic matter removal the pathway of organic matter degradation in an mfc is similar to the anaerobic digestion process hydrolysis and fermentation as mentioned earlier ce was low in this study and the cod removal efficiency was over 70 in both systems this suggests that there was competition for the substrate among exoelectogens and other microbial communities in the system this implies that most of the substrate was not involved in the current generation bacteroides is one of the fermentative bacteria responsible for producing metabolites for exoelectrogenes and hydrolysing complex organics 40 bacteroides is one of the dominant classes found in the mfcs the presence of this genus is crucial for mfc performance and organic matter degradation 41 in addition fermentative bacteria petrimonas are another genus that showed the ability to improve h2 production in mecs 42 small quantities of fermentative bacteria were observed in the anode community paludibacter petrimonas and anaerovorax these species were responsible for utilising sugars and amines to produce organic acids which are subsequently metabolised by exoelectrogens for electricity generation 38 furthermore zoogloea and dechloromonas both of which are responsible for wastewater treatment were found in small percentages 1 in addition some of the species that were observed in bess do not have clear functions for instance cloacibacillus was found mainly in the mec bacteria community and this species might have been introduced into the system during the inoculation process with anaerobic digester sludge 43 table 1 shows the differences and similarities in microbial communities at phylum and genus level between mfc and mec proteobacteria in the mecs were observed in higher percentages 32 5 8 than in the mfcs 14 4 1 4 as proteobacteria species are well known for their ability to produce and consume h2 44 the presence of chloroflexi in mfcs and mecs is not unusual and they are quite common in biological nutrient removal processes in this study it was present in the mfcs 6 at higher percentages than in the mecs 1 chloroflexi plays an important role in wastewater treatment responsible for the degradation of carbohydrates and nitrogen removal 45 finally the abundance of synergistetes in the mfcs 29 5 2 5 was higher than in the mecs 6 further studies are needed to understand the role of synergistetes in bess to provide a better understanding of the systems the genera were analysed a hierarchy cluster heat map highlighted the top 50 families and these account for the most read sequences fig 6 the heat map showed clear distinctions in community structure between the anode of the mfcs and the anode of the mecs despite the fact that they were inoculated with the same wastewater in genus level analysis the dominant genera in both systems were different there were some genus present in the mfcs only which were not detected in the mecs in total 1037 otus were detected in both the mfcs and the mecs fig 7 mfcs and mecs shared 259 otus accounting for 25 of the total otus and the majority of the shared otus were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in addition 318 otus were detected only in the mfcs whereas only 201 otus were detected in the mecs proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are commonly found as dominant phyla in bes fed with artificial wastewater 46 and industrial wastewater 11 proteobacteria which include deltaproteobacteria species were responsible for direct electricity production similarly in the bacteroidetes phylum shimoyama et al 46 stated that bacteroidetes which is responsible for electricity generation from artificial wastewater was an abundant phylum in a continuous flow cassette electrode mfc therefore proteobacteria and bacteroidetes phyla are the most important phyla in bes at the genera level statistical analysis was conducted to identify the difference in genus between the microbial communities in the mfcs and the mecs there was a statistically significant difference p 0 05 t test between the two communities as some genera were found in one system but were not be found in the other bacteroides which are known to be produce h2 by fermentation and electricity in mfcs 47 were found only in the mfcs in small quantities 1 desulfobulbus is a well known gene that plays an important role in transferring electrons to the anode it belongs to the sulphate reducer class and it is involved in electricity generation in bes in this study it was observed that the mfcs and the mecs contained a low percentage of desulfobulbus in addition it has been reported that desulfobulbus is able to produce electricity in an mfc using the anode electrode as a direct electron acceptor 49 in addition pseudomonas was found in both systems at a low percentage 1 however it was present in the mecs at a higher percentage than in the mfcs pseudomonas have commonly been found in mec studies the presence of pseudomonas can support electricity generation by self producing mediators to shuttle electrons outside the cell or between cells 50 in addition pseudomonas is responsible for organic matter degradation and metal resistance the thauera which belongs to betaproteobacteria was observed in both mfcs 3 1 it is well known as a denitrifier that is able to degrade aromatic compounds 51 different studies have reported the presence of thauera in mfcs treating wastewater with high nitrogen concentration where it has demonstrated the ability to degrade organic compounds in wastewater and enhance nitrogen removal 52 propionivibrio which belongs to the class betaproteobacteria was only detected in the mfcs therefore these bacteria could be used in bioenergy production 53 acidaminococcus are fermentative bacteria responsible for amino acid degradation and are involved in enhancing hydrogen production 48 the acidaminococcus gene was detected only in the mecs and the presence of this gene might be linked to the system operational conditions methanogens were not detected in high percentages in either of the systems and this is because the anodes were exposed to air for 20 min after each batch cluster analysis of the anodic biofilm of both the mfcs and the mecs showed that the bacterial communities were different as with the acidaminococcus gene the differences found between the communities in the mfcs and the mecs might be due to the differences in the system operational conditions all the reactors had the same design and the anode chambers were inoculated with the same wastewater and fed with the same synthetic wastewater pcoa was used to visualise and compare the dissimilarity between the two different systems fig 8 the first two coordination axes explained 41 of the variability found in the microbial community compositions the duplicate reactor mfcs were clustered together and this means that the microbial communities were similar the same observation was found with the mecs pcoa showed a clear separation between the communities in the mfcs and those in the mecs the analysis shows greater diversity in the communities of the anode in the mfcs and in the mecs these results showed the impact of the reactor operating conditions on the community structure in fig 8 it can be seen clearly that the biofilm communities of the mecs are located in the top right corner and the biofilm communities of the mfcs are located in the top left corner of the plot 3 4 the impact of operation conditions on microbial community in bes the mfcs and mecs were operated with the same synthetic wastewater and both systems had a similar design however as mentioned previously the operational conditions such as hydraulic retention time and ph were different hydraulic retention time is an important factor that impact on the microbial community the change of hydraulic retention time might lead to changes in the cellular physiology and the community level some bacteria species can survive for short hydraulic retention time whereas some may disappear 54 in the mfcs the cycle duration was 48 h whereas in the mec the cycle duration was between 3 6 days the difference in the retention time between mfc and mec was due to the difference in the operating conditions in mec both anode and cathode are operated under anaerobic conditions and this requires long retention time to fully degrade the organic compounds however the mfc cathode is operated under aerobic condition and this accelerates organic compounds degradation due to the diffusion of oxygen to the anode compartments therefore variations in the microbial community could be observed between the mfcs and the mecs furthermore the power source that is mainly used in mecs to overcome the thermodynamic limit for hydrogen evolution has an effect on the microbial community in this case applying high voltage to the circuit can be harmful to the living organisms and might inhibit their existence 20 furthermore a high voltage might reduce biofilm density on the anode electrode and this would result in changes to the microbial community in addition ph is another important parameter that influences microbial community due to reduction oxidation redox reactions the ph around the anode decreased and reached 5 in some cases due to the accumulation of protons in the anode chamber solution ph has a great influence on bacteria community and bacterial growth therefore any changes in the environmental ph could affect the microbial community 19 low ph inhibits the microbial activity and biofilm formation and it reduces system performance in addition variations in solution ph may affect the distribution of bacteria on the electrode and as a result change the microbial structure the growth of exoelectrogenic geobacter was observed to be inhibited at ph below 6 4 and there was no growth below ph 5 5 55 thus a low percentage of exoelectrogenic geobacter 1 was observed in this study furthermore cathode aeration had a great impact on the microbial community the diffusion of oxygen from the cathode to the anode may affect the presence of different bacteria species thus the diversity of microbial species in mfcs was greater than that of the mecs many bacteria species can contribute significantly to energy generation and the low presence of the exoelectrogenic microbes such as geobacter in the system does not mean low system performance the positive correlation between the key microbes in the anode and electricity generation performance is not always observed 11 many minor bacterial communities may be involved in electricity production and enhance performance among the 60 of unclassified genera there could be an exoelectogens species that play a role in electricity generation however the electricity producing ability of unclassified bacteria has not been ascertained 38 4 conclusion the main findings from this study have indicated that the microbial community structures of bes are complex with mfcs having a more diverse community than mecs however while the structure of the mfc community was different from that of the mec community both shared the same dominant species in addition microbial community structure analysis indicated that the functional bacteria of the genera desulfovibrio butyricicoccus petrimonas and propionivibrio predominated in the mfcs anodic biofilm whereas desulfovibrio acidaminococcus desulfocapsa and acetobacterium predominated in the mecs anodic biofilm results further indicate remarkable differences in the diversity and structure of the bacterial communities principle coordinate analysis further showed that the community of the mfcs was different from that of the mecs and this variation might be due to the differences in the operational conditions anoxic versus oxic of the mfcs and the mecs in addition due to organic matter oxidation hydraulic retention time and applied voltage anode ph had an

14083,this study investigated the microbial community structure on the anode surface of four dual chamber bio electrochemical systems these systems were microbial fuel cell mfc and microbial electrolysis cell mec the systems were inoculated with activated sludge and operated for electricity generation hydrogen h2 production and phosphorus p recovery the mfc achieved a maximum power output of 185 mw m2 1 62 kw h m2 whilst the mec achieved a maximum h2 production rate of 0 28 m3 h2 m3 d results from illumina high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that the microbial community structure of the mfcs was more diverse than that of the mecs and this variation may be attributed to the differences in the operational conditions of the mfc and the mec mfc and mec shared the same dominant bacterial phyla bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes with the most abundant bacterial genus in both systems belonging to desulfovibrio however the abundance of desulfovibrio in the mecs 13 2 0 7 was greater than that in the mfcs 4 25 0 2 keywords microbial fuel cell microbial electrolysis cell microbial community analysis bioelectricity hydrogen desulfovibrio 1 introduction microorganisms in bio electrochemical systems bes convert the chemical energy in organic matter to electrical energy or hydrogen gas typically the operation of bes is influenced by different parameters such as the activity of microorganisms cell design and cell materials bacteria community and electron transfer in bes are important parameters that affect energy generation and hydrogen production bacteria such as anode respiring bacteria and electrochemically active bacteria have both been shown to transfer electrons from the substrate to the electrodes without the aid of any external mediator that is mediator less bes 1 in contrast mediators are used in the presence of electrochemically inactive bacteria in bess to facilitate electron transfer between the electrode and the bacteria 2 the anaerobic electrochemically active biofilm that develops on the anode plays an important role in bes performance recent studies have focused on improving bes design and materials but very little has been paid to the microbial community aspects in the system 3 consequently microbial communities and their effects on bes operation and performance remain largely unknown it is therefore important to understand the microbial community and identify the dominant species contributing to electron transfer in the anode biofilm in order to improve bes performance different communities of microorganism can be found in bes and this is due to the fact that operational and environmental conditions can change the microbial communities in the system 4 this implies that the changes in microbial communities in bes are linked to the environmental and operational conditions microbial fuel cells mfc and microbial electrolysis cells mec are bes that have recently generated a lot of interest this is due to their ability to generate energy from different waste streams mfcs comprise of an anaerobic anode chamber and aerobic cathode chamber both separated by a cation exchange membrane on the other hand mec comprises of an anaerobic anode chamber and anaerobic cathode chamber the anode chambers in both systems contain exoelectrogenic bacteria which are the bacteria responsible for transferring electrons to the anode either through direct contact or using an electron soluble shuttle in bes microbial species such as geobacte shewanella and phototrophic bacteria can be found in the anode electrode as in mecs the growth of anaerobic bacteria such as methanogenic microorganisms can be promoted due to the anaerobic condition in both the anode and cathode chambers most bes use wastewater as inoculum and wastewater contains different bacteria communities the microbial community is expected to change when this is changed in order to adapt to the new environment in addition bacteria community and composition can be affected by operational conditions such as solution ph during the operation of bes anode and cathode ph might fluctuate and this is due to reduction oxidation reactions that could affect the bacteria community there are different techniques that have been used to characterize microbial communities in bes for example techniques such as 16s rrna gene analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish have been used to describe and quantify both anodic and cathodic communities in bes 5 however these techniques are limited by the number of samples and the amount of sequence data that they can achieve recently new technologies such as high throughput next generation sequencing ngs has been developed to improve this capability and to help understand complex microbial communities in environmental systems ngs of 16s rrna genes has the potential to describe the full diversity and composition of complex microbial communities in mfc and mec daghio et al 5 studied the microbial community in a single chamber mfc fed with acetate and inoculated with a biogas digestate in this study illumina sequencing of a fragment of the 16s rrna gene was used to characterize the microbial communities the results showed that geovibrio and purple non sulfur pns bacteria were the dominant species in the anodic biofilm whereas the alkaliphilic genus nitrincola and anaerobic microorganisms belonging to porphyromonadaceae family were the most abundant bacteria in the cathodic biofilm geovibrio genus belongs to iron reducing bacteria which can conserve energy for anaerobic growth by coupling the oxidation reaction of organic compounds to the reduction of iron 6 in another study by xia et al 7 the microbial community was studied using sequencing analysis in mfc inoculated with wastewater the mfc showed high power density 543 75 mw m2 and high removal rates of chemical oxygen demand 75 59 the sequencing analysis revealed that the mfc inoculated was rich in the microbial community and some bacteria such as saprospiraceae and caldilineaceae enhanced its performance furthermore sciarria et al 8 monitored the development of the microbial communities during the start up of mfc wastewater from an urban wastewater treatment plant was used to inoculate the system the 16s rdna gene profiling showed that the microbial communities was enriched with acinetobacter azospirillum arcobacter and comamonas at the beginning of mfc activation however the main genera detected after three days were azospirillum acinetobacter enterococcus and dysgonomonas genera such as acinetobacter and azospirillum are electrochemically active communities and can be found in many mfc studies they are to contribute to electricity generation in another study lee et al 9 identified the microbial community in mec and anaerobic digester the results showed that members of the clostridia class were more abundant than the bacteroidia class compared to the anaerobic digester mec showed a 40 increase in the overall bacterial population increasing the removal of organic matter and the conversion of volatile fatty acids vfas the study showed that the mec reactions converts organic matters to vfas more effectively and it activates microbial communities favourable for methane production furthermore flayac et al 10 studied the microbial community in dual chamber mec inoculated with activated sludge and fed in batch mode with acetate the results showed that the anodic biofilms were mainly dominated by geobacter often times geobacter is the most common genus in bes studies and it contributes directly to electricity generation the different operational conditions of the mfc and mec are reflected by the other changes in microbial communities kiely et al 11 tracked the changes in microbial communities when mfc was converted to mec the systems were fed with complex organic matter source potato and dairy wastewater the results showed that the proportion of geobacteraceae remained constant when mfcs were converted into mecs but the percentage of clones belonging to g sulfurreducens decreased and the percentage of g metallireducens clones increased recently mec and mfc were investigated for h2 electricity production and phosphorus p recovery 12 13 however these studies focused on assessing concurrent h2 electricity production and p recovery rather than studying the microbial community therefore the aim of this study is to identify and compare the microbial community structure in both an mfc and mec it is important to identify the community structure and composition of the biofilm in order to achieve a better performance of bes and to also increase our understanding of how different microbes affect bes performance therefore the objectives of this study are i to identify and understand the structure and community of microorganisms that develop in mfcs and mecs that were operated for 400 days using ngs and ii to link the relative abundance of known exoelectrogenic microorganism species with bes performance 2 material and methods 2 1 mediator less bes construction four sets of dual chamber h type bottles adams chittenden scientific glass berkeley ca usa were used to construct two mfcs and two mecs anode and cathode electrodes were made of carbon cloth 2 5 5 cm projected area of 25 cm2 with a volume of 300 ml for each chamber see figs 1 and 2 the ph of the anode and the cathode ph were monitored during the operation of the bess the cathode contained a pt catalyst 0 5 mg cm2 10 pt on carbon cloth electrode whilst the anode was plain carbon cloth electrodes were connected with a titanium wire 0 5 mm purity 99 98 alfa aesar heysham uk a nafion membrane nafion 117 sigma aldrich london uk was placed in the middle of the anode and the cathode the bess were maintained at 20 c in a temperature controlled room a dc power supply psd 30 3b caltek hong kong was used to apply a voltage 0 5 1 1 v for the mec the external power source is needed to force thermodynamically unfavourable reactions to occur and produce hydrogen in mec at least 0 2 v is required to produce h2 and this amount of energy is lower than that required for water electrolysis 1 2 v the voltage was added by connecting the positive pole of the power source to the anodes while the negative pole led to a high precision resistor 10 x and the cathodes electrodes were connected to 1000 ω of external resistance at the inoculation stage and this was then changed to 407 ω mfc and 10 ω mec during the operational stage a fresh medium combined with inoculum mixture was used to replace the anolyte after each mec cycle the anode chamber was drained and exposed to atmospheric air for 20 45 min to inhibit methanogen growth 2 2 bes inoculation and operation condition the anode chambers were inoculated with a 1 1 mixture of activated sludge and anolyte medium containing ch₃coona 3 28 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l kcl 0 13 g l h2po4 2 69 g l na2hpo4 4 33 g l 10 ml vitamins solution 10 ml trace element solution the bes were operated in feed batch mode at room temperature anode influent ph was adjusted to ph 7 0 media replacement was carried out in an anaerobic environment lack of free oxygen using a glove box to maintain the anaerobic environment for the anode biofilms after the inoculation period the anolyte medium was replaced with synthetic wastewater which contained ch₃coona 0 5 2 g l depending on cod concentration kh2po4 0 65 g l k2hpo4 0 65 g l kcl 0 74 g l nacl 0 58 g l nh4cl 0 375 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l 0 1 ml vitamins solution and 0 1 ml trace element solution in the mfc the bes were operated in two stage feed batch mode at room temperature the synthetic wastewater was fed to the anode chamber for organic matter removal at the first stage at the end of each cycle the anode effluent was filtered using a 0 2 μm filter membrane fisher scientific uk and then transferred into the cathode chamber where air is supplied aeration was provided to the cathode chamber using an aquarium pump a new batch of synthetic wastewater was then introduced into the anode chamber similar to the mecs the cathode synthetic wastewater contained ch₃coona 0 5 g l kh2po4 0 25 g l k2hpo4 0 25 g l kcl 0 74 g l nacl 0 58 g l nh4cl 0 375 g l mgcl2 0 32 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l anode and cathode influent were adjusted to ph 7 0 the volume of the produced gas in the cathode chamber was measured using the displacement method 2 3 analytical methods the voltage across the external resistance 407 ω mfc and 10 ω mec was recorded every 15 min using an adc 20 data logger system pico technology saint neots uk which was connected to a computer based on the recorded voltage current i and power p iv were calculated according to ohm s law the current and power densities were calculated by dividing the current and power by the anode area 25 cm2 coulombic efficiency ce was calculated by integrating the measured

pcr and illumina sequencing all anode electrodes four electrodes were removed from the anode chambers of the mfc and mec both of which have been in stable operation for more than 400 days these were then stored at 20 c until further processing genomic dna was extracted using a metagenomic dna isolation kit cambio ltd cambridge uk the size and quantity of the extracted dna fragments were determined respectively using an agilent tape station genomic dna screentape hsd 1000 and genomic dna reagents agilent santa clara ca usa and a qubit assay machine qubit assays life technologies sweden following the dna extraction a single step amplification and sequencing library creation pcr was performed for bacterial 16s rrna genes using primers targeting the v4 variable region in a 96 well pcr plate as described by kozich et al 15 each well contained 17 μl of accuprime pfx supermix 1 μl of template dna and 2 μl of each paired set of index primers thereafter 1 μl of pcr grade h2o was added to the negative control and 1 μl of mock community bei resources virginia usa was added to the positive control the following programme was then used for the thermal cycling an initial 2 min at 95 c 30 cycles of 20 s at 95 c 15 s at 55 c and 5 min at 72 c and a final step of 72 c for 10 min in total 12 dna samples were analysed using illumina sequencing illumina san diego ca usa illumina sequencing was performed using 2 250 bp paired end flow cells and reagent cartridges the data generated from the illumina sequencing was analysed using mothur v1 38 1 16 in accordance with the miseq standard operating procedure 15 in summary the analytical process started with the contigs formation and then sequences filtration to remove ambiguous reads shorter than 245 bp and longer than 275 bp the resulting sequences were reduced to generate a unique set of sequences and then aligned with the silva database the sequences were assigned taxonomy and then a distance matrix was generated between the aligned sequences all sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units otus at 95 sequence similarity 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed to understand the microbial community and the difference between mfcs and mecs shannon index and chao1 were used to identify the species diversity and richness for each sample respectively in addition weighted unifrac analysis was performed to compute the difference between the microbial communities based on phylogenetic information principal coordinates analysis pcoa was used to visualise the similarities in the microbial community relationships based on the distance matrix after clustering the heat map was generated via r studio software to reflect any similarities and differences in the community composition among bacterial samples at the family level a venn diagram with shared and unique otus was used to depict the similarities and differences between the two communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 mfc and mec general performance mfcs and mecs were operated for concurrent h2 energy production and p recovery map hexahydrate struvite was precipitated in the cathode chambers of both mec and mfc the mec achieved a maximum hydrogen production rate of 0 28 m3 h2 m3 d fig 3 in a similar study cusick and logan 17 achieved a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2 3 m3 h2 m3 d using a single chamber mec reactor on the other hand the mfc achieved a maximum power output of 185 mw m2 or 1 62 kw h m2 fig 4 this is comparable to another study in which the dual chamber mfc treating domestic wastewater and recovering nutrients achieved a maximum power density of 253 84 mw m2 18 the variation in power density between the two studies can be attributed to the high influent cod concentration in this study which exerted significant impacts on the catholyte ph the h2 energy production efficiency of both systems was affected by the precipitation of struvite on the cathode electrodes 3 2 diversity of microbial community and composition in total 12 samples were analysed electrodes and water samples from each anode chamber in the mfcs and the mecs each electrode was divided into 2 parts a and b after removing the low quality reads there were 29362 88108 effective reads the sequencing obtained 230 383 otus from the samples each with 95 similarity chao1 estimator ranged from 240 to 300 for the mfc and from 195 to 280 for the mecs this indicates that the mfcs had greater richness than the mecs the shannon diversity index was used to determine community diversity and it varied between 3 1 3 6 for the mfcs and 2 3 for the mecs similar values of the shannon index for the anode communities were obtained by 11 the shannon index shows that the microbial diversity in anode mfcs is greater than in the anode mecs the sequencing results indicate that microbial communities in mfcs are more diverse than in mecs similarly chae et al 19 confirmed that lower species richness of bacteria was found in mecs compared to mfcs each system mfc or mec was operated under certain operational conditions generally the mfc was operated with an aerobic cathode whereas the mec cathode was operated under anaerobic conditions and an external power source the operational conditions of these systems highly influenced the diversity and richness of the microorganisms operational conditions such as applied voltage and ph have been shown to impact on microbial communities in bes 20 applied voltage influences microbial activity in two ways on one hand it stimulates the microorganisms to grow and degrade organic matter on the other hand it inhibits microorganisms if the current is too high in addition chae et al 19 showed that using an external power source in mecs can result in a change or damage to the biofilm 3 3 bacterial taxonomic identification sequences were assigned taxonomy to identify the different communities in mfcs and mecs and classified from phyla to genera the relative abundance of a given bacteria group was set as the number of sequences affiliated with that group divided by the total number of sequences per sample in the mfcs a total of 19 bacteria phyla were identified 19 phyla in mfc 1 and 17 phyla in mfc 2 the microbial populations belonged to 33 classes and 78 genera the results showed that overall communities of the anodic biofilms in mfcs had similar bacterial species synergistetes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the anode chambers of the mfcs the sum of the four dominant phyla accounted for 75 9 2 6 in mfc 1 and mfc 2 synergistetes 29 5 2 5 bacteroidetes 23 4 proteobacteria 14 4 1 4 and firmicutes 9 2 5 of the total reads this was followed by other major phyla such as chloroflexi 6 0 3 and ignavibacteriae 2 0 1 in addition other minor phyla were found with low abundance in the community such as cloacimonetes 0 5 and acidobacteria 0 2 it should be noted that around 11 1 of the total reads were not classified at the phylum level similarly 18 bacteria phyla were identified in mec 1 18 phyla and mec 2 16 phyla and the microbial populations belonged to 33 classes and 77 genera the anodic biofilm in the mecs was also shown to have similar bacterial species and community structure proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla in the anode chambers of the mecs this result is consistent with the composition found in another mec study 21 where proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla were the dominant bacteria at phyla level mecs comprised proteobacteria 32 5 8 firmicutes 17 5 2 5 bacteroidetes 6 0 1 and synergistetes 6 0 1 of the total reads other phyla with small quantities were found and these include chloroflexi 0 6 spirochaetes 0 3 and actinobacteria 0 2 bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla are commonly found in mfc and mec studies 22 23 however the microbial structure is not consistent throughout all bes studies various phyla in the community have the ability to transfer electrons to the anode electrode bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria are the most common phyla in bio electrochemical studies and this result was consistent with previous research that used acetate as the main source of carbon 23 a surprisingly high abundance of the phylum synergistetes was found in the mfc communities and less than 6 in the mecs communities previous studies have shown that synergistetes were the dominant phyla in multiple mfc studies 24 25 the main source of this phylum in this study might be the anaerobic digester sludge used during the inoculation process 26 the synergistetes phylum is commonly found in bess fed with acetate 25 but often at low abundance however one study did report a high abundance of synergistetes 33 in mfcs fed with acetate 24 the bacteroidetes phylum was detected as the dominant phylum in the mfcs 19 27 and in the mecs the percentage of bacteroidetes 6 was low compared to the mfcs bacteroidetes and synergistetes are fermentative bacteria that were induced in the anaerobic environment of the anode and are known to be capable of the biodegradation of organic pollutants 27 in the present study electrochemically active bacteria such as proteobacteria firmicutes and acidobacteria were present in the anodic chambers of both the mfcs and the mecs proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla have been shown to have the ability to directly transfer the electrons to the anode electrode for example wrighton et al 28 stated that the functional role of firmicutes in mfcs was current production in addition the firmicutes phylum is commonly abundant in dual chamber mfcs and is responsible for power production 29 the relative abundance of firmicutes in the mecs was higher than in the mfcs and this is probably due to the different operational conditions of each system cathode aeration in mfc and applied voltage in mec the classes synergistia clostridia and deltaproteobacteria were dominant in both mfc and mec these classes have been reported to be dominant in bess and with energy generation 30 deltaproteobacteria are electrochemically active bacteria that play an important role in generating protons and electrons during metabolism and they are involved in energy generation 31 the deltaproteobacteria class is commonly found in acetate enriched mfcs and it is responsible for the direct electron transfer to the electrode 32 the class clostridia has been reported to play an important role in power generation and for being responsible for converting fermentable substrate into simple organics 33 at the genera level 78 genera were observed in each mfc the mfcs anodic community comprised desulfovibrio 4 25 0 2 butyricicoccus 5 5 1 petrimonas 4 0 6 propionivibrio 1 5 0 3 desulfovirga 1 5 0 1 and geobacter 0 8 0 3 around 59 of the total composition was assigned as unclassified at the genus level the community of mecs included desulfovibrio 13 2 0 7 acidaminococcus 2 0 2 desulfocapsa 1 5 0 3 acetobacterium 1 0 1 and cloacibacillus 0 8 0 1 more than 62 of the total composition was not classified due to the complexity of the community fig 5 different microorganism species can be found in the anode chamber but not all of those species are involved in energy or current production in terms of electricity generation desulfovibrio which belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class was the dominant genus among the classified genera in both systems however the presence of desulfovibrio in the mecs 13 2 0 7 was greater than in the mfcs 4 25 0 2 in addition the relative abundance of desulfovibrio in mfc 1 was higher than in mfc 2 desulfovibrio is important in current production and it was reported to be involved in both current production and organic matter degradation 22 desulfovibrio was the common predominant exoelectrogen in the anodic biofilm in both systems thus demonstrating that this genus was well adapted to the operating conditions furthermore it also contributes to the current generation as the main exoelectrogen in the electrodes desulfovibrio has been reported to be the dominant gene in different bes studies and its role in electricity generation has been confirmed desulfovibrio is responsible for transferring the electrons from the substrate to the electrode surface via the outer membrane cytochrome kang et al 34 stated that in mediator less mfcs desulfovibrio was observed to enhance the current generation and it was able to transfer the electrons more efficiently than geobacter in addition to the role of desulfovibrio for electricity generation geobacter species are well known exoelectrogenic bacteria geobacter s role is crucial indirect electron transfer without the aid of any mediators geobacter is one of the most important genera for electron transport between the bacteria and electrode the percentages of geobacter 1 detected in both systems were low compared to previous studies and it showed a higher percentage in single chamber mfcs 58 10 35 however low percentages of exoelectrogens such as geobacter and shewanella have been reported in different studies 36 many species that are capable of generating electricity were found in the anode biofilm however these species were not numerically abundant and they accounted for 0 2 in addition shewanella which is commonly present in bes was not detected in either the mfcs nor the mecs shewanella has been reported to grow in low nutrient environments 37 but the synthetic wastewater in this study contains high concentrations of nutrients and this tends to inhibit the growth of shewanella thormann et al 37 stated that the presence of oxygen with a high concentration of nutrients leads organisms to catabolize the nutrients aerobically rather than investing energy in the formation of the biofilm shewanella has not been detected in many mfc and mec studies 38 butyricicoccus from the class clostridia of the phylum firmicutes was found with approximately the same percentage in both systems butyricicoccus was reported to utilise acetate and produce butyrate h2 and co2 39 in terms of organic matter removal the pathway of organic matter degradation in an mfc is similar to the anaerobic digestion process hydrolysis and fermentation as mentioned earlier ce was low in this study and the cod removal efficiency was over 70 in both systems this suggests that there was competition for the substrate among exoelectogens and other microbial communities in the system this implies that most of the substrate was not involved in the current generation bacteroides is one of the fermentative bacteria responsible for producing metabolites for exoelectrogenes and hydrolysing complex organics 40 bacteroides is one of the dominant classes found in the mfcs the presence of this genus is crucial for mfc performance and organic matter degradation 41 in addition fermentative bacteria petrimonas are another genus that showed the ability to improve h2 production in mecs 42 small quantities of fermentative bacteria were observed in the anode community paludibacter petrimonas and anaerovorax these species were responsible for utilising sugars and amines to produce organic acids which are subsequently metabolised by exoelectrogens for electricity generation 38 furthermore zoogloea and dechloromonas both of which are responsible for wastewater treatment were found in small percentages 1 in addition some of the species that were observed in bess do not have clear functions for instance cloacibacillus was found mainly in the mec bacteria community and this species might have been introduced into the system during the inoculation process with anaerobic digester sludge 43 table 1 shows the differences and similarities in microbial communities at phylum and genus level between mfc and mec proteobacteria in the mecs were observed in higher percentages 32 5 8 than in the mfcs 14 4 1 4 as proteobacteria species are well known for their ability to produce and consume h2 44 the presence of chloroflexi in mfcs and mecs is not unusual and they are quite common in biological nutrient removal processes in this study it was present in the mfcs 6 at higher percentages than in the mecs 1 chloroflexi plays an important role in wastewater treatment responsible for the degradation of carbohydrates and nitrogen removal 45 finally the abundance of synergistetes in the mfcs 29 5 2 5 was higher than in the mecs 6 further studies are needed to understand the role of synergistetes in bess to provide a better understanding of the systems the genera were analysed a hierarchy cluster heat map highlighted the top 50 families and these account for the most read sequences fig 6 the heat map showed clear distinctions in community structure between the anode of the mfcs and the anode of the mecs despite the fact that they were inoculated with the same wastewater in genus level analysis the dominant genera in both systems were different there were some genus present in the mfcs only which were not detected in the mecs in total 1037 otus were detected in both the mfcs and the mecs fig 7 mfcs and mecs shared 259 otus accounting for 25 of the total otus and the majority of the shared otus were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in addition 318 otus were detected only in the mfcs whereas only 201 otus were detected in the mecs proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are commonly found as dominant phyla in bes fed with artificial wastewater 46 and industrial wastewater 11 proteobacteria which include deltaproteobacteria species were responsible for direct electricity production similarly in the bacteroidetes phylum shimoyama et al 46 stated that bacteroidetes which is responsible for electricity generation from artificial wastewater was an abundant phylum in a continuous flow cassette electrode mfc therefore proteobacteria and bacteroidetes phyla are the most important phyla in bes at the genera level statistical analysis was conducted to identify the difference in genus between the microbial communities in the mfcs and the mecs there was a statistically significant difference p 0 05 t test between the two communities as some genera were found in one system but were not be found in the other bacteroides which are known to be produce h2 by fermentation and electricity in mfcs 47 were found only in the mfcs in small quantities 1 desulfobulbus is a well known gene that plays an important role in transferring electrons to the anode it belongs to the sulphate reducer class and it is involved in electricity generation in bes in this study it was observed that the mfcs and the mecs contained a low percentage of desulfobulbus in addition it has been reported that desulfobulbus is able to produce electricity in an mfc using the anode electrode as a direct electron acceptor 49 in addition pseudomonas was found in both systems at a low percentage 1 however it was present in the mecs at a higher percentage than in the mfcs pseudomonas have commonly been found in mec studies the presence of pseudomonas can support electricity generation by self producing mediators to shuttle electrons outside the cell or between cells 50 in addition pseudomonas is responsible for organic matter degradation and metal resistance the thauera which belongs to betaproteobacteria was observed in both mfcs 3 1 it is well known as a denitrifier that is able to degrade aromatic compounds 51 different studies have reported the presence of thauera in mfcs treating wastewater with high nitrogen concentration where it has demonstrated the ability to degrade organic compounds in wastewater and enhance nitrogen removal 52 propionivibrio which belongs to the class betaproteobacteria was only detected in the mfcs therefore these bacteria could be used in bioenergy production 53 acidaminococcus are fermentative bacteria responsible for amino acid degradation and are involved in enhancing hydrogen production 48 the acidaminococcus gene was detected only in the mecs and the presence of this gene might be linked to the system operational conditions methanogens were not detected in high percentages in either of the systems and this is because the anodes were exposed to air for 20 min after each batch cluster analysis of the anodic biofilm of both the mfcs and the mecs showed that the bacterial communities were different as with the acidaminococcus gene the differences found between the communities in the mfcs and the mecs might be due to the differences in the system operational conditions all the reactors had the same design and the anode chambers were inoculated with the same wastewater and fed with the same synthetic wastewater pcoa was used to visualise and compare the dissimilarity between the two different systems fig 8 the first two coordination axes explained 41 of the variability found in the microbial community compositions the duplicate reactor mfcs were clustered together and this means that the microbial communities were similar the same observation was found with the mecs pcoa showed a clear separation between the communities in the mfcs and those in the mecs the analysis shows greater diversity in the communities of the anode in the mfcs and in the mecs these results showed the impact of the reactor operating conditions on the community structure in fig 8 it can be seen clearly that the biofilm communities of the mecs are located in the top right corner and the biofilm communities of the mfcs are located in the top left corner of the plot 3 4 the impact of operation conditions on microbial community in bes the mfcs and mecs were operated with the same synthetic wastewater and both systems had a similar design however as mentioned previously the operational conditions such as hydraulic retention time and ph were different hydraulic retention time is an important factor that impact on the microbial community the change of hydraulic retention time might lead to changes in the cellular physiology and the community level some bacteria species can survive for short hydraulic retention time whereas some may disappear 54 in the mfcs the cycle duration was 48 h whereas in the mec the cycle duration was between 3 6 days the difference in the retention time between mfc and mec was due to the difference in the operating conditions in mec both anode and cathode are operated under anaerobic conditions and this requires long retention time to fully degrade the organic compounds however the mfc cathode is operated under aerobic condition and this accelerates organic compounds degradation due to the diffusion of oxygen to the anode compartments therefore variations in the microbial community could be observed between the mfcs and the mecs furthermore the power source that is mainly used in mecs to overcome the thermodynamic limit for hydrogen evolution has an effect on the microbial community in this case applying high voltage to the circuit can be harmful to the living organisms and might inhibit their existence 20 furthermore a high voltage might reduce biofilm density on the anode electrode and this would result in changes to the microbial community in addition ph is another important parameter that influences microbial community due to reduction oxidation redox reactions the ph around the anode decreased and reached 5 in some cases due to the accumulation of protons in the anode chamber solution ph has a great influence on bacteria community and bacterial growth therefore any changes in the environmental ph could affect the microbial community 19 low ph inhibits the microbial activity and biofilm formation and it reduces system performance in addition variations in solution ph may affect the distribution of bacteria on the electrode and as a result change the microbial structure the growth of exoelectrogenic geobacter was observed to be inhibited at ph below 6 4 and there was no growth below ph 5 5 55 thus a low percentage of exoelectrogenic geobacter 1 was observed in this study furthermore cathode aeration had a great impact on the microbial community the diffusion of oxygen from the cathode to the anode may affect the presence of different bacteria species thus the diversity of microbial species in mfcs was greater than that of the mecs many bacteria species can contribute significantly to energy generation and the low presence of the exoelectrogenic microbes such as geobacter in the system does not mean low system performance the positive correlation between the key microbes in the anode and electricity generation performance is not always observed 11 many minor bacterial communities may be involved in electricity production and enhance performance among the 60 of unclassified genera there could be an exoelectogens species that play a role in electricity generation however the electricity producing ability of unclassified bacteria has not been ascertained 38 4 conclusion the main findings from this study have indicated that the microbial community structures of bes are complex with mfcs having a more diverse community than mecs however while the structure of the mfc community was different from that of the mec community both shared the same dominant species in addition microbial community structure analysis indicated that the functional bacteria of the genera desulfovibrio butyricicoccus petrimonas and propionivibrio predominated in the mfcs anodic biofilm whereas desulfovibrio acidaminococcus desulfocapsa and acetobacterium predominated in the mecs anodic biofilm results further indicate remarkable differences in the diversity and structure of the bacterial communities principle coordinate analysis further showed that the community of the mfcs was different from that of the mecs and this variation might be due to the differences in the operational conditions anoxic versus oxic of the mfcs and the mecs in addition due to organic matter oxidation hydraulic retention time and applied voltage anode ph had an

14084,a biological spatial temporal phase separation system without an additional anaerobic reactor was devised for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the process was operated at hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h solids retention time srt of 10 days and cycle time of 4 h anoxic anaerobic periods aerobic period 1 5 2 5 three types of influents were examined namely glucose glucose acetate propionate and domestic wastewater they were used to evaluate the contribution of organic composition and loading on the system performance nitrogen removal was strongly affected by the organic composition upon low influent c n ratio however for influent c n of 9 2 11 7 and c p of 53 0 88 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal noticeably improved regardless of the organic composition biological reactions including nitrification denitrification phosphate release and uptake and pha synthesis and utilization were clearly observed during the cycle with high organic loading without any decline on organics removal furthermore significant phosphate release and uptake were successfully accomplished without any nitrate interference and carbon competition under high organic loading therefore organic loading is essential for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in biological spatial temporal phase separation keywords organic loading organic composition biological spatial temporal phase separation nutrient removal domestic wastewater 1 introduction biological nutrient removal bnr is widely known as an economical and sustainable method for the treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus whose indiscriminate discharge can lead to eutrophication 1 2 bnr processes for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus must be spatially or temporally divided into anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions to achieve organic oxidation nitrification denitrification and phosphate uptake and release 3 well known bnr processes using spatial phase separation include a2 o university of cape town uct virginia initiative plant vip 5 stage bardenpho etc bnr processes employing temporal or spatial temporal phase separation with intermittent aeration and flow path change such as sequencing batch reactor sbr biodenitro and biodenipho can also be used these processes have some advantages 1 elimination of internal nitrate recycle and 2 flexibility for influent fluctuation by controlling the phase period 4 7 previous studies 8 12 establish that temporal phase separation can be a good substitute for spatial phase separation however even if temporal phase separation has advantages the declining process performance due to coexistence issues is a major limitation an example of coexistence issue is the carbon competition between denitrifying bacteria and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in a single compartment 13 14 many researches on nutrient removal confirm that organic loading can be a limiting factor for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus denitrification can uptake organic compounds prior to phosphate release in the presence of an electron acceptor nitrate 15 16 in general the organic loading significantly affects nutrient removal irrespective of the phase separation method because the anaerobic or anoxic phase is normally conducted at the fore part of both spatial and temporal separated bnr processes in korea both spatial and temporal separated bnr have been used for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus however poor nutrient removal has been reported due to the lack of organic compounds 17 in addition phosphorus removal is mostly accomplished by chemical precipitation 18 in this study therefore biological spatial temporal phase separation without additional anaerobic reactor was devised and its applicability and treatability potential were analyzed furthermore the effects of organic composition and loading on the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus were also evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 biological phase separation the operational sequence comprises four steps a b c and d in series for one complete cycle a and c are the main steps and b and d are the intermediate steps steps c and d are mirror images of steps a and b respectively in step a one reactor is in the aerobic phase and the other is in the anoxic anaerobic phase during the aerobic phase nitrification and phosphate uptake occur and residual organics are removed during the anoxic anaerobic phase denitrification and phosphate release occur and influent organics are continuously supplied in step b both reactors are in the aerobic phase each phase length can be controlled to achieve a treatment purpose in this study one complete cycle including all four steps lasted 4 h a cycle in the anoxic anaerobic and aerobic phases lasted 1 5 and 2 5 h respectively the biological phase separation system included two completely mixed reactors one clarifier one aerator four peristaltic pumps model no 7553 75 cole parmer inc for wastewater and mixed liquor transfer and four solenoid valves the phase separation was automatically controlled by a programmable logic controller master k30s lg electronics the simultaneous removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus was accomplished by alternating anaerobic anoxic and aerobic phases during four different steps as illustrated in fig 1 the reactors had a total liquid volume of 11 2 l and each reactor was 150 mm long 100 mm wide and 300 mm tall the clarifier had a total liquid volume of 8 l and was 265 mm tall with a diameter of 180 mm the bottom of the clarifier had an inverted circular cone shape for easier separation of solids from the effluent the process was inoculated with activated sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in seoul korea 2 2 operational methods the biological phase separation was performed at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h solids retention time srt of 10 days and cycle time of 4 h and influent flowrate sludge recycle ratio of 1 three types of influent including 1 glucose 2 glucose acetate propionate and 3 domestic wastewater were used to evaluate the effects of organic composition on nutrients removal the performance responses to different organic loads were also investigated to assess treatability reliability and applicability fig 2 presents a flow chart to evaluate the effect of organic composition and loading on nutrients removal chemical oxygen demand cod of 200 mg l c n ratio mg as soluble cod mg as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of 6 7 and c p ratio mg as soluble cod mg as ortho phosphate ratio of 34 3 were established in influent as low organic loading also influent cod of 330 mg l influent c n ratio of 11 1 and influent c p ratio of 56 7 were set in influent as high organic loading 2 3 preparation of feed water various organic compounds were introduced into the process to validate the contribution of organic composition and loading on nutrient removal a synthetic feed was prepared and used to represent typical organics nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of combined wastewater in korea in addition domestic wastewater was also used to evaluate the efficiency of the process the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing chemicals as follows 122 mg l of glucose c6h12o6 for 131 mg l of cod 70 mg l of l glutamic acid c5h9o4n for 69 mg l of cod and 6 7 mg l of organic nitrogen 87 mg l of nh4cl for 23 mg l of ammonia 8 5 mg l of kh2po4 and 21 8 mg l of k2hpo4 for 5 8 mg l of ortho phosphate 275 mg l of nahco3 for 200 mgcaco3 l of alkalinity and 0 2 mg l of fecl3 6h2o 27 5 mg l of cacl2 and 22 5 mg l of mgso4 7h2o for trace elements the theoretical concentrations of cod tkn and ortho phosphate in the synthetic feed were 200 mg l 30 mg l and 5 8 mg l respectively for high organic loading 244 64 mg l of glucose was also used when the process used glucose acetate propionate as the carbon source the basic carbon composition for the combined carbon source influent was composed of 61 4 mg l of glucose 42 55 mg l of sodium acetate and 29 53 mg l of sodium propionate the high organic load influent was also synthesized by blending glucose sodium acetate and sodium propionate dosages in a respective ratio of 2 1 1 other compound dosages were the same as mentioned above domestic wastewater representing the metropolitan combined wastewater was collected from a wastewater treatment plant in seoul korea the effluent from the primary clarifier was used performance response to readily biodegradable organics rbcods addition to domestic wastewater was also analyzed by supplying 61 4 92 1 mg l of glucose 42 55 63 83 mg l of sodium acetate and 29 53 44 3 mg l of sodium propionate 2 4 analytical methods normally poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha is produced in the anaerobic phase and consumed in the aerobic phase by paos therefore a pha analysis can validate the activity of paos the pha analysis was conducted as per the procedure in werker et al 19 approximately 20 mg of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was disposed poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid co 3 hydroxyvaleric acid sigma aldrich natural origin phv content 12 mol was used as the standard material for the pha analysis standard and retained biomass were dried at 60 c for 24 h dried samples were also combined with 1 5 ml of normal butyl alcohol and 0 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid the samples were sealed and heated at 100 c for 8 h and subsequently cooled to 25 c after cooling 2 5 ml of normal hexane and 4 ml of deionized water were added and mixed with a vortex mixer after the phase separation the upper solvent phase containing 1 μl of pha methyl esters was transferred directly to the gas chromatography hewlett packard 5890 series ⅱ with a flame ionization detector fid and a hp 1 column 25 m 0 320 mm with 0 52 μm film thickness agilent technologies the operating conditions of the gas chromatography with fid are summarized in table 1 all analyses except pha were conducted as per the procedures in the american public health association apha standard methods 20 3 results and discussion the overall performances of the process using glucose glucose acetate propionate and domestic wastewater as carbon sources are summarized in table 2 when glucose was used the removal of total cod tcod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp was 82 96 69 82 and 0 50 for low organic loading and 89 98 83 88 and 97 100 for high organic loading respectively when glucose acetate propionate was used the removal of tcod tn and tp was 89 92 65 77 and 0 98 for low organic loading and 89 95 80 86 and 98 100 for high organic loading respectively in contrast the process employing domestic wastewater presented lower removal rates with tcod tn and tp removal at 80 85 33 42 and 0 11 for raw domestic wastewater and 87 95 77 79 and 32 81 for domestic wastewater supplied with rbcods respectively the effects of influent c n ratio and organic composition on tn removal are exhibited in fig 3 the decline on overall tn removal by organics complexity under low influent c n ratio can be clearly observed in fig 3 a when domestic wastewater was used the process presented an effluent tn concentration of 20 7 22 6 mg l in general organics in wastewater vary from simple compounds to complex polymers 21 and complex polymers are primarily decomposed into simple substances 22 23 xu et al 24 also emphasized that most denitrifying bacteria utilized preferentially simple substances such as acetate as carbon source thus the poor tn removal can be attributed to the organic composition of domestic wastewater tn removal decreased when the organic composition of the influent was diversified despite the application of rbcods when glucose was used significant tn removal was observed unrelated to organic loading in contrast when glucose acetate propionate was used there was a relatively poor tn removal for influent c n ratio of 6 2 6 9 under low influent c n ratio the tn removal difference was likely due to the deviation of organic utilization rate for denitrification the organic characteristics are significantly related to denitrification 24 elefsiniotis and wareham 25 also reported that acetic acid is the preferred volatile fatty acids vfas for denitrification over propionic acid which was utilized later than acetic acid thus the organic composition of influents was likely essential for tn removal at the low influent c n ratio the c n ratio of 4 is widely known as a theoretical c n ratio for denitrification 26 as presented in fig 3 the process operated under the condition of influent c n ratio in the range of 9 2 11 7 showed the highest tn removal in this study relatively higher c n ratio compared to theoretical c n ratio was applied due to the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus as shown in fig 3 b the tn removal for influent c n ratio of 9 2 11 7 was likely the tendency of tn removal by organics complexity as shown in fig 3 a however tn removal improved as the organic loading increased under high influent c n ratio the tn removal difference between synthetic wastewaters also decreased irrespective of the organic composition as the average influent c n ratio increased from 6 6 10 4 the average effluent tn concentration decreased from 6 0 4 5 mg l for glucose and from 8 4 5 0 mg l for glucose acetate propionate particularly the lowest effluent tn was approximately 9 4 mg l and it was produced upon use of domestic wastewater with rbcods based on these results it can be concluded that the organic composition was not important for tn removal at high influent c n ratio however it was essential at low influent c n ratio the effect of influent c p ratio and organic composition on ortho phosphate removal is depicted in fig 4 particularly the process using rbcods as carbon source obtained an effluent with 0 2 mg l or less of ortho phosphate under high influent c p ratio oehmen et al 27 insisted that a c p ratio of 10 20 should be more favorable for paos compared to higher c p ratios likewise many researches on biological phosphorus removal exclude nitrogen removal however the u s epa 28 reported a minimal influent c p ratio of 60 for soluble phosphorus removal in this study an influent c p ratio of 60 is reasonable considering the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus numerous studies on biological phosphorus removal emphasize that enough vfas can be helpful for biological phosphorus removal 8 27 29 when the process employed glucose acetate propionate with low organic loading ortho phosphate removal gradually decreased as shown in fig 4 c despite the excellent efficacy of vfas for biological phosphorus removal this result could be explained by the carbon competition among denitrifying bacteria and paos in the anoxic anaerobic phase both denitrifying bacteria and paos demand a carbon source for denitrification and phosphorus release respectively because there was no additional anaerobic reactor in this study denitrification and phosphorus release were performed in the same reactor furthermore denitrification could occur prior to phosphorus release due to presence of electron acceptors i e nitrate which have an adverse effect on the paos activity 30 31 therefore it should be noted that the decline on phosphorus removal could be caused by insufficient organic loading meanwhile when domestic wastewater supplied with rbcods was used as influent a dramatic improvement on ortho phosphate removal was not observed due to the high influent tn level in domestic wastewater fig 5 presents profiles of ammonia and nitrate along a cycle with high organic loading both reduction of nitrate by denitrification and generation of nitrate by nitrification were clearly observed ammonia and nitrate distributions well matched each phase the different ammonia and nitrate levels between synthetic and domestic wastewater due to influent tkn concentration were also clearly observed however at the end of the anoxic phase nitrate levels were similar despite the different initial nitrate concentration as mentioned above fig 5 b clearly shows that organic composition is not essential for high influent c n ratio the specific nitrification and denitrification rates for each case are summarized in table 3 the highest rates were observed for domestic wastewater with rbcods due to the high influent nitrogen concentration when glucose was used settleability problems such as sludge bulking occurred and the concentration of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss decreased although the process employing synthetic wastewaters could perform similar nitrogen removal for influent c n ratio of 9 2 11 7 the rates were different from each other as presented in table 3 the specific denitrification rate varied with c n ratios and process configurations in especial many studies 33 34 emphasize the differences of specific denitrification rate according to type of organics under low influent c n ratio the denitrification with various carbon sources applied in this study could be expressed as follows 1 glucose no3 0 208c6h12o6 0 5n2 1 25co2 0 75h2o oh 2 acetic acid 8no3 5ch3cooh 4n2 10co2 6h2o 8oh 3 propionic acid 6no3 2ch3ch2cooh 3n2 6co2 2h2o 8oh from compilations of thermodynamic data 37 38 a standard free energy δg⁰ value could be calculated for each carbon sources from eqs 1 3 respectively the δg⁰ value are 3446 63 kj mol for glucose 1147 04 kj mol for acetic acid 1715 7 kj mol for propionic acid among them therefore glucose could be considered good for denitrification in terms of thermodynamics in domestic wastewater case however the co existence of too various kinds of organics makes difficult to express with one equation and to calculate δg⁰ value usually paos use the energy derived from poly phosphate hydrolysis during the anaerobic phase they use that energy to uptake vfas and synthesize the internally stored carbohydrate pha which is used in the aerobic phase 26 in the aerobic phase synthesized pha is used for paos growth and as energy source for ortho phosphate uptake 10 39 the profiles of ortho phosphate and pha during the cycle with high organic loading are illustrated in fig 6 phosphate uptake and release did not occur in the process operated under low influent c p ratio when the process was operated at influent c p ratio of 53 0 88 1 phosphate distributions well matched each phase during the initial anoxic anaerobic phase of 15 min phosphate release was postponed due to phase alternation and nitrate subsequently significant phosphate release and uptake and pha synthesis and utilization were successfully accomplished without any nitrate interference and carbon competition numerous studies reported the decline in biological phosphorus removal when using glucose as the carbon source 40 41 however when glucose was used with high organic loading the highest specific phosphate uptake and release rates of this study were observed the specific phosphate uptake and release rates are presented in table 4 when glucose acetate propionate was used the lowest rates were observed however the highest rates were obtained when glucose was utilized as the carbon source as mentioned above different rates occurred due to the mlvss concentration issue associated with the settleability problems the rates can be affected by the type of organic compounds and process configurations as summarized in table 4 the pha distribution also well matched each phase as shown in fig 6 b synthesized pha increased with vfas the highest rates were obtained using glucose as the carbon source however the lowest pha concentration was also observed under the same condition it is commonly believed that glucose is fermented to vfas prior to substrate uptake by paos 45 46 pijuan et al 8 reported a pha concentration of 3 2 8 6 mmol c l using glucose as the carbon source however as mentioned above the pha concentration was low for the same organic composition condition in this case low synthesized pha concentration was a consequence of organics consumption by denitrification lopez vazquez et al 47 also reported a maximum pha of 12 5 mmol c l in a reactor enriched with paos at the end of the anaerobic phase in addition li et al 39 presented the average synthesized pha of 10 mmol c l at same acetate to propionate ratio the pha synthesis was affected by organic composition however noticeable phosphate uptake and release could be achieved under high influent c p ratio as presented in fig 6 4 conclusions a biological spatial temporal phase separation system without an additional anaerobic reactor was devised and used to evaluate the contribution of organic composition and loading on nutrient removal an excellent removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus was clearly observed at high organic loading without additional internal nitrate recycle or anaerobic reactor the organic composition was not essential for the nitrogen removal under high influent c n ratio however it was important for the nitrogen removal at low influent c n ratio according to previous research vfas are important for biological phosphorus removal however in the present study phosphorus removal gradually decreased due to carbon competition between denitrifying bacteria and paos under low influent c p ratio however the phosphorus removal dramatically increased in proportion to incremental organic load and a stable removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was achieved all reactions in the process including nitrification denitrification and phosphorus uptake and release were clearly independent from organic composition with high organic loading thus organic loading is essential for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in a biological spatial temporal phase separation process without an additional anaerobic reactor declaration of competing interest none 
14084,a biological spatial temporal phase separation system without an additional anaerobic reactor was devised for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the process was operated at hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h solids retention time srt of 10 days and cycle time of 4 h anoxic anaerobic periods aerobic period 1 5 2 5 three types of influents were examined namely glucose glucose acetate propionate and domestic wastewater they were used to evaluate the contribution of organic composition and loading on the system performance nitrogen removal was strongly affected by the organic composition upon low influent c n ratio however for influent c n of 9 2 11 7 and c p of 53 0 88 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal noticeably improved regardless of the organic composition biological reactions including nitrification denitrification phosphate release and uptake and pha synthesis and utilization were clearly observed during the cycle with high organic loading without any decline on organics removal furthermore significant phosphate release and uptake were successfully accomplished without any nitrate interference and carbon competition under high organic loading therefore organic loading is essential for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in biological spatial temporal phase separation keywords organic loading organic composition biological spatial temporal phase separation nutrient removal domestic wastewater 1 introduction biological nutrient removal bnr is widely known as an economical and sustainable method for the treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus whose indiscriminate discharge can lead to eutrophication 1 2 bnr processes for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus must be spatially or temporally divided into anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions to achieve organic oxidation nitrification denitrification and phosphate uptake and release 3 well known bnr processes using spatial phase separation include a2 o university of cape town uct virginia initiative plant vip 5 stage bardenpho etc bnr processes employing temporal or spatial temporal phase separation with intermittent aeration and flow path change such as sequencing batch reactor sbr biodenitro and biodenipho can also be used these processes have some advantages 1 elimination of internal nitrate recycle and 2 flexibility for influent fluctuation by controlling the phase period 4 7 previous studies 8 12 establish that temporal phase separation can be a good substitute for spatial phase separation however even if temporal phase separation has advantages the declining process performance due to coexistence issues is a major limitation an example of coexistence issue is the carbon competition between denitrifying bacteria and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in a single compartment 13 14 many researches on nutrient removal confirm that organic loading can be a limiting factor for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus denitrification can uptake organic compounds prior to phosphate release in the presence of an electron acceptor nitrate 15 16 in general the organic loading significantly affects nutrient removal irrespective of the phase separation method because the anaerobic or anoxic phase is normally conducted at the fore part of both spatial and temporal separated bnr processes in korea both spatial and temporal separated bnr have been used for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus however poor nutrient removal has been reported due to the lack of organic compounds 17 in addition phosphorus removal is mostly accomplished by chemical precipitation 18 in this study therefore biological spatial temporal phase separation without additional anaerobic reactor was devised and its applicability and treatability potential were analyzed furthermore the effects of organic composition and loading on the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus were also evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 biological phase separation the operational sequence comprises four steps a b c and d in series for one complete cycle a and c are the main steps and b and d are the intermediate steps steps c and d are mirror images of steps a and b respectively in step a one reactor is in the aerobic phase and the other is in the anoxic anaerobic phase during the aerobic phase nitrification and phosphate uptake occur and residual organics are removed during the anoxic anaerobic phase denitrification and phosphate release occur and influent organics are continuously supplied in step b both reactors are in the aerobic phase each phase length can be controlled to achieve a treatment purpose in this study one complete cycle including all four steps lasted 4 h a cycle in the anoxic anaerobic and aerobic phases lasted 1 5 and 2 5 h respectively the biological phase separation system included two completely mixed reactors one clarifier one aerator four peristaltic pumps model no 7553 75 cole parmer inc for wastewater and mixed liquor transfer and four solenoid valves the phase separation was automatically controlled by a programmable logic controller master k30s lg electronics the simultaneous removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus was accomplished by alternating anaerobic anoxic and aerobic phases during four different steps as illustrated in fig 1 the reactors had a total liquid volume of 11 2 l and each reactor was 150 mm long 100 mm wide and 300 mm tall the clarifier had a total liquid volume of 8 l and was 265 mm tall with a diameter of 180 mm the bottom of the clarifier had an inverted circular cone shape for easier separation of solids from the effluent the process was inoculated with activated sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in seoul korea 2 2 operational methods the biological phase separation was performed at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h solids retention time srt of 10 days and cycle time of 4 h and influent flowrate sludge recycle ratio of 1 three types of influent including 1 glucose 2 glucose acetate propionate and 3 domestic wastewater were used to evaluate the effects of organic composition on nutrients removal the performance responses to different organic loads were also investigated to assess treatability reliability and applicability fig 2 presents a flow chart to evaluate the effect of organic composition and loading on nutrients removal chemical oxygen demand cod of 200 mg l c n ratio mg as soluble cod mg as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of 6 7 and c p ratio mg as soluble cod mg as ortho phosphate ratio of 34 3 were established in influent as low organic loading also influent cod of 330 mg l influent c n ratio of 11 1 and influent c p ratio of 56 7 were set in influent as high organic loading 2 3 preparation of feed water various organic compounds were introduced into the process to validate the contribution of organic composition and loading on nutrient removal a synthetic feed was prepared and used to represent typical organics nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of combined wastewater in korea in addition domestic wastewater was also used to evaluate the efficiency of the process the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing chemicals as follows 122 mg l of glucose c6h12o6 for 131 mg l of cod 70 mg l of l glutamic acid c5h9o4n for 69 mg l of cod and 6 7 mg l of organic nitrogen 87 mg l of nh4cl for 23 mg l of ammonia 8 5 mg l of kh2po4 and 21 8 mg l of k2hpo4 for 5 8 mg l of ortho phosphate 275 mg l of nahco3 for 200 mgcaco3 l of alkalinity and 0 2 mg l of fecl3 6h2o 27 5 mg l of cacl2 and 22 5 mg l of mgso4 7h2o for trace elements the theoretical concentrations of cod tkn and ortho phosphate in the synthetic feed were 200 mg l 30 mg l and 5 8 mg l respectively for high organic loading 244 64 mg l of glucose was also used when the process used glucose acetate propionate as the carbon source the basic carbon composition for the combined carbon source influent was composed of 61 4 mg l of glucose 42 55 mg l of sodium acetate and 29 53 mg l of sodium propionate the high organic load influent was also synthesized by blending glucose sodium acetate and sodium propionate dosages in a respective ratio of 2 1 1 other compound dosages were the same as mentioned above domestic wastewater representing the metropolitan combined wastewater was collected from a wastewater treatment plant in seoul korea the effluent from the primary clarifier was used performance response to readily biodegradable organics rbcods addition to domestic wastewater was also analyzed by supplying 61 4 92 1 mg l of glucose 42 55 63 83 mg l of sodium acetate and 29 53 44 3 mg l of sodium propionate 2 4 analytical methods normally poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha is produced in the anaerobic phase and consumed in the aerobic phase by paos therefore a pha analysis can validate the activity of paos the pha analysis was conducted as per the procedure in werker et al 19 approximately 20 mg of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was disposed poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid co 3 hydroxyvaleric acid sigma aldrich natural origin phv content 12 mol was used as the standard material for the pha analysis standard and retained biomass were dried at 60 c for 24 h dried samples were also combined with 1 5 ml of normal butyl alcohol and 0 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid the samples were sealed and heated at 100 c for 8 h and subsequently cooled to 25 c after cooling 2 5 ml of normal hexane and 4 ml of deionized water were added and mixed with a vortex mixer after the phase separation the upper solvent phase containing 1 μl of pha methyl esters was transferred directly to the gas chromatography hewlett packard 5890 series ⅱ with a flame ionization detector fid and a hp 1 column 25 m 0 320 mm with 0 52 μm film thickness agilent technologies the operating conditions of the gas chromatography with fid are summarized in table 1 all analyses except pha were conducted as per the procedures in the american public health association apha standard methods 20 3 results and discussion the overall performances of the process using glucose glucose acetate propionate and domestic wastewater as carbon sources are summarized in table 2 when glucose was used the removal of total cod tcod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp was 82 96 69 82 and 0 50 for low organic loading and 89 98 83 88 and 97 100 for high organic loading respectively when glucose acetate propionate was used the removal of tcod tn and tp was 89 92 65 77 and 0 98 for low organic loading and 89 95 80 86 and 98 100 for high organic loading respectively in contrast the process employing domestic wastewater presented lower removal rates with tcod tn and tp removal at 80 85 33 42 and 0 11 for raw domestic wastewater and 87 95 77 79 and 32 81 for domestic wastewater supplied with rbcods respectively the effects of influent c n ratio and organic composition on tn removal are exhibited in fig 3 the decline on overall tn removal by organics complexity under low influent c n ratio can be clearly observed in fig 3 a when domestic wastewater was used the process presented an effluent tn concentration of 20 7 22 6 mg l in general organics in wastewater vary from simple compounds to complex polymers 21 and complex polymers are primarily decomposed into simple substances 22 23 xu et al 24 also emphasized that most denitrifying bacteria utilized preferentially simple substances such as acetate as carbon source thus the poor tn removal can be attributed to the organic composition of domestic wastewater tn removal decreased when the organic composition of the influent was diversified despite the application of rbcods when glucose was used significant tn removal was observed unrelated to organic loading in contrast when glucose acetate propionate was used there was a relatively poor tn removal for influent c n ratio of 6 2 6 9 under low influent c n ratio the tn removal difference was likely due to the deviation of organic utilization rate for denitrification the organic characteristics are significantly related to denitrification 24 elefsiniotis and wareham 25 also reported that acetic acid is the preferred volatile fatty acids vfas for denitrification over propionic acid which was utilized later than acetic acid thus the organic composition of influents was likely essential for tn removal at the low influent c n ratio the c n ratio of 4 is widely known as a theoretical c n ratio for denitrification 26 as presented in fig 3 the process operated under the condition of influent c n ratio in the range of 9 2 11 7 showed the highest tn removal in this study relatively higher c n ratio compared to theoretical c n ratio was applied due to the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus as shown in fig 3 b the tn removal for influent c n ratio of 9 2 11 7 was likely the tendency of tn removal by organics complexity as shown in fig 3 a however tn removal improved as the organic loading increased under high influent c n ratio the tn removal difference between synthetic wastewaters also decreased irrespective of the organic composition as the average influent c n ratio increased from 6 6 10 4 the average effluent tn concentration decreased from 6 0 4 5 mg l for glucose and from 8 4 5 0 mg l for glucose acetate propionate particularly the lowest effluent tn was approximately 9 4 mg l and it was produced upon use of domestic wastewater with rbcods based on these results it can be concluded that the organic composition was not important for tn removal at high influent c n ratio however it was essential at low influent c n ratio the effect of influent c p ratio and organic composition on ortho phosphate removal is depicted in fig 4 particularly the process using rbcods as carbon source obtained an effluent with 0 2 mg l or less of ortho phosphate under high influent c p ratio oehmen et al 27 insisted that a c p ratio of 10 20 should be more favorable for paos compared to higher c p ratios likewise many researches on biological phosphorus removal exclude nitrogen removal however the u s epa 28 reported a minimal influent c p ratio of 60 for soluble phosphorus removal in this study an influent c p ratio of 60 is reasonable considering the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus numerous studies on biological phosphorus removal emphasize that enough vfas can be helpful for biological phosphorus removal 8 27 29 when the process employed glucose acetate propionate with low organic loading ortho phosphate removal gradually decreased as shown in fig 4 c despite the excellent efficacy of vfas for biological phosphorus removal this result could be explained by the carbon competition among denitrifying bacteria and paos in the anoxic anaerobic phase both denitrifying bacteria and paos demand a carbon source for denitrification and phosphorus release respectively because there was no additional anaerobic reactor in this study denitrification and phosphorus release were performed in the same reactor furthermore denitrification could occur prior to phosphorus release due to presence of electron acceptors i e nitrate which have an adverse effect on the paos activity 30 31 therefore it should be noted that the decline on phosphorus removal could be caused by insufficient organic loading meanwhile when domestic wastewater supplied with rbcods was used as influent a dramatic improvement on ortho phosphate removal was not observed due to the high influent tn level in domestic wastewater fig 5 presents profiles of ammonia and nitrate along a cycle with high organic loading both reduction of nitrate by denitrification and generation of nitrate by nitrification were clearly observed ammonia and nitrate distributions well matched each phase the different ammonia and nitrate levels between synthetic and domestic wastewater due to influent tkn concentration were also clearly observed however at the end of the anoxic phase nitrate levels were similar despite the different initial nitrate concentration as mentioned above fig 5 b clearly shows that organic composition is not essential for high influent c n ratio the specific nitrification and denitrification rates for each case are summarized in table 3 the highest rates were observed for domestic wastewater with rbcods due to the high influent nitrogen concentration when glucose was used settleability problems such as sludge bulking occurred and the concentration of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss decreased although the process employing synthetic wastewaters could perform similar nitrogen removal for influent c n ratio of 9 2 11 7 the rates were different from each other as presented in table 3 the specific denitrification rate varied with c n ratios and process configurations in especial many studies 33 34 emphasize the differences of specific denitrification rate according to type of organics under low influent c n ratio the denitrification with various carbon sources applied in this study could be expressed as follows 1 glucose no3 0 208c6h12o6 0 5n2 1 25co2 0 75h2o oh 2 acetic acid 8no3 5ch3cooh 4n2 10co2 6h2o 8oh 3 propionic acid 6no3 2ch3ch2cooh 3n2 6co2 2h2o

synthesized pha concentration was a consequence of organics consumption by denitrification lopez vazquez et al 47 also reported a maximum pha of 12 5 mmol c l in a reactor enriched with paos at the

however noticeable phosphate uptake and release could be achieved under high influent c p ratio as presented in fig 6 4 conclusions a biological spatial temporal phase separation system without an
