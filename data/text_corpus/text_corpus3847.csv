19235,despite that sulfate radical based activated peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation processes e g uv pms co2 pms etc have been widely applied for decontamination the direct oxidation of organic contaminants by pms per se is less known this contribution reports that certain contaminants such as sulfonamides sas are amendable to direct oxidation by pms without activation using sulfamethoxazole smx as a representative kinetics and density functional theory dft based computational methods were applied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathways through which smx was transformed by direct pms oxidation high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc analyses using authentic standards were adopted to qualifying and quantifying smx transformation products our results reveal that nonradical oxidation of smx by pms was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such

4 nitro sulfamethoxazole peroxymonosulfate sulfamethoxazole sulfonamide antibiotics transformation 1 introduction peroxymonosulfate pms is a commercially available peroxide with the trade name oxone which is comprised of triple salt with the composition of 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 pms bears a peroxide bond in its molecule except that a hydrogen atom is substituted by a sulfonate group the redox potential of pms is 1 82 v which is comparative with other oxidants commonly used in water and wastewater treatment such as ozone o3 2 07 v permanganate kmno4 1 68 v and hypochlorous acid hocl 1 48 v von gunten 2003 deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2009 pms can be activated by various approaches including uv light transition metals hydroxylions minerals metal and carbon based catalysts to generate sulfate radical so4 a highly reactive oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 guan et al 2011 qi et al 2016 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 2017 yao et al 2017 application of activated pms processes for water and wastewater treatment has received increasing interest recently because so4 is more oxidizing than pms alone and it reacts with a broad rang of contaminants at second order rate constants ranging from 106 to 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 tistonaki et al 2010 while direct oxidation of contaminants by pms alone is relatively slow it can oxidize a variety of inorganic chemicals in waters such as halides firouzabadi et al 2009 li et al 2017 arsenite as iii wang et al 2014 and odor causing compounds betterton and hoffmann 1990 yang et al 2016 for example pms oxidizes bromide br at a second order rate constant of 1 04 m 1s 1 much higher than that of h2o2 reaction with br 2 3 10 5 m 1s 1 fortnum et al 1960 in addition pms has also been utilized either as a substituent oxidant of h2o2 to control the odorous reductive sulfur species or as a bleaching agent in the paper and pulp industry to replace chlorine anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 more recently pms was also used as a broad spectrum disinfectant to inactivate disease associated pathogens chesney et al 2016 although pms oxidation has been utilized for removal of inorganic chemicals as well as inactivation of pathogens studies reporting pms reactions with organic contaminants such as endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals are limited the comparatively high redox potential of pms enables its direct oxidation with many organics thermodynamically feasible several studies have reported the direct pms oxidation of organics such as β lactam antibiotics through a nonradical mechanism chen et al 2018 reaction pathways and product distributions of direct pms oxidation of organic contaminants may differ from those of activated pms processes in which so4 often dominates reactions nevertheless up to now only few studies have investigated the reaction kinetics and underlying mechanisms of direct pms oxidation with organic contaminants chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 indeed during activated pms oxidation of organic contaminants the direct oxidation of pms could not be well differentiated and in some cases overlooked mahdi ahmed et al 2012 therefore it is essential to investigate non activated pms oxidation of organic contaminants in particular those frequently detected in environmental waters cui et al 2016 previous studies using other oxidant such as ferrate and permanganate have indicated that oxidation was initiated by forming a precursor complex which undergoes sequential reactions to generate products sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2009 electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines and olefins are reactive sites typically susceptible to electrophilic attack of oxidants huber et al 2003 dodd et al 2006 in addition reaction kinetics is usually found to be first order with respect to both oxidant and substrate hu et al 2009 2010 these findings are conducive to better understand the kinetics and mechanisms of direct oxidation of organic contaminants by pms in this contribution we attempted to evaluate the kinetics mechanisms and products of non activiated pms oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and other sulfonamides of concern the motivation of this study is to evaluate the potential of employing direct pms oxidation to remediate water and wastewater contaminated by micropollutants e g antibiotics and to assess potential risks associated with utilization of this oxidants sulfonamide antibiotics sas are frequently detected in environmental compartments such as surface water groundwater soils and sediments due to their extensive use as both human and veterinary drugs boxall et al 2003 michael et al 2013 sas are persistent in the environment due to their high solubility chemical stability and resistance to natural attenuation processes such as hydrolysis biotransformation and photolysis kümmerer 2009 sas have the potential for disseminating antibacterial resistance thus may cause subtle chromic and unpredicted effects on both human health and ecosystem baran et al 2011 rizzo et al 2013 by using sulfamethoxazole smx as a representative the present work aims to i identify and quantify smx transformation products by direct pms oxidation ii elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathways of smx transformation and iii evaluate the effects of pms dosage solution ph and natural water matrices on smx transformation our results suggested that while pms has a potential to transform a suite of sas with similar molecular structures the formation of potential hazardous nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized before this technology can be safely used for water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chemicals suppliers and purities are provided in text s1 of supplementary material hereafter sm all the stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the chemical agents into milli q water 18 mω cm prepared from a millipore milli q system millipore corporation bedford ma usa and used within one week 2 2 natural water samples natural lake water was sampled from tai lake a typical shallow eutrophication lake located in jiangsu province china natural groundwater water was collected from a shallow aquifer from hunan province china the natural waters were filtered by 0 2 μm membrane filter and stored at 4 c prior to use properties of the two natural waters are provided in table s1 sm 2 3 batch degradation experiments batch experiments were carried out in a series of 33 ml sealed epa vials containing 15 μm sulfonamide e g smx or substructural analogs initial solution ph was adjusted by 10 mm phosphate buffer to desired values it should be noted that phosphate ions at 10 mm had no effect on direct pms oxidation of antibiotics chen et al 2018 the vials were immersed in a thermo regulated water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 c over the reaction reactions were initiated by spiking appropriate amount of pms stock solution to the vials aliquots 0 5 ml were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and spiked in hplc vials which contained 20 μl 1m na2s2o3 initially to quench the residual pms anipsitakis et al 2006 samples were refrigerated at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h all degradation experiments were conducted with two duplicate samples and average data were reported solution ph was measured by a combination glass electrode e 201 c leici connected to a phs 3cw microprocessor ph mv meter bante instrument co ltd shanghai concentrations of sulfonamides an sam 3a5mi and 5a34dmi were measured by a hitachi l 2000 high performance liquid chromatography hitachi japan coupled with an l 2455 diode array detector detailed operational parameters were provided in sm table s2 quantification of the target compounds was based on multipoint standard calibration curves 2 4 qualification and quantification of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms analyses were performed to identify the primary oxidation products of smx a waters q tof mass spectrometer in negative ionization modes esi was used which was coupled to an hplc waters alliance system consisting of a 2695 module for compounds separation and a 2998 photodiode array detector formation of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx was quantified by the same hitachi hplc as described above analytical separation was performed by an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 5 0 μm particle size 250 mm 4 6 mm i d elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 with h2o containing 0 1 v v formic acid as eluent a and meoh containing 0 1 v v formic acid as eluent b employing a linear gradient from 5 b to 65 b in 0 27 min 65 b to 95 b in 27 28 min 95 b in 28 33 min 95 b to 5 b in 33 34 min 5 b in 34 45 min under these conditions the retention times of smx 4 no2 smx and 4 no smx were 17 9 26 4 and 27 5 min respectively 2 5 computational method all the density functional theory dft calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package of program using the m06 2x hybrid meta exchange correlation functional in conjunction with the 6 31 g d basis set zhao and truhlar 2008 the solvent effect of water was considered with the smd model based on the self consistent reaction field scrf method marenich et al 2009 frequency calculations were performed with the same method to determine the character of stationary points transition states ts were characterized with one imaginary vibrational frequency intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculations were also performed to verify that transition states are connected to reactants and intermediates on the potential energy surfaces of reactions in this study δh was calculated instead of δg because of the well known erroneous computational description of the variation of entropy watson and eisenstein 2002 the δh values were corrected by zero point energy and thermal energy at 298 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 nonradical oxidation preliminary experiment revealed that pms alone was capable of transforming smx in aqueous solution under a typical reaction condition of 15 μm smx 1 mm pms and ph 7 more than 65 of smx could be transformed within 80 min fig s1 sm which was consistent with previous studies cui et al 2016 prior studies have reported the involvement of several reactive species including so4 hydroxyl radical ho and singlet oxygen 1o2 in pms based oxidation of contaminants anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 zhou et al 2015 as electrophilic oxidants so4 ho and 1o2 tend to react with smx with second order rate constants determined to be 1 61 0 17 1010 5 8 0 2 109 2 1 104 m 1s 1 respectively boreen et al 2004 zhang et al 2015b to discern whether these species were also involved in non activated pms oxidation of smx experiments with scavengers were conducted methanol meoh that reacts with so4 and ho at a second order rate constant of 2 5 107 and 9 7 108 m 1s 1 respectively was used to determine the contribution of free radicals i e so4 and ho neta et al 1977 liang and su 2009 as shown in fig s1 sm no significant reduce in smx concentration was observed upon addition of meoh 10 mm molar ratio of scavenger substrate was 667 1 implying that free radicals i e so4 and ho were not responsible for smx transformation furthermore increasing the concentration of meoh up to 100 mm molar ratio of scavenger substrate was 6667 1 did not influence the transformation of smx fig s2 sm furfuryl alcohol ffa that reacts with 1o2 at a second order rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1s 1 was also employed to probe the contribution of 1o2 haag et al 1984 result of fig s1 suggests that the contribution of 1o2 was negligible therefore the oxidation of smx by pms possibly occurred through a nonradical pathway which was overlooked previously nonradical based pms oxidation of contaminants such as as iii and 2 4 dichlorophenol has been documented previously wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 3 2 transformation products the reaction sample of smx treated by pms oxidation was tentatively analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms exact masses corresponding to 4 no smx m h 266 03434 and 4 no2 smx m h 282 02985 were identified as shown in fig 1 further structural assignments of these products were confirmed by hplc analyses using commercially available reference standards cas 29699 89 6 for 4 no2 smx and cas 131549 85 4 for 4 no smx fig s3 sm oxidation of smx to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx should process through the intermediate n 4 oh smx after a two electron oxidation of the aniline group as observed in other oxidation processes such as ferrate and chlorine dioxide sharma et al 2006 ben et al 2017 formation of n 4 oh smx was indeed confirmed by hplc analysis using a reference standard cas 114438 33 4 data not shown therefore non activated pms oxidation of smx occurred through a pathway described as follows smx n 4 oh smx 4 no smx 4 no2 smx however the difficulty to separate n 4 oh smx and smx in chromatograph spectrum even a gradient eluent was applied hampered its quantification cribb and spielberg 1992 previous studies have indicated that n 4 oh smx was extremely unstable especially in neutral and basic oxygen containing solutions and transformed to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx rapidly bonvin et al 2013 the instability of n 4 oh smx was also justified by our hplc measurement because 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx were observed during the analysis of a n 4 oh smx standard data not shown the identified transformation products suggested that the aniline moiety of smx was selectively oxidized by pms leading to the formation of n 4 oh smx 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx sequentially fig 2 shows the time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx generated during non activated pms oxidation of smx the concentration of 4 no smx exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing pattern with maximum 0 51 μm occurring at 20 min however the concentration of 4 no2 smx increased steadily as the reaction progressed due to electron withdrawing effect the nitro group of 4 no2 smx is expected to deactivate the aromatic ring making it less susceptible toward further oxidation as a result 4 no2 smx appeared to be resistant to direct pms oxidation and thus accumulated in the reaction solution considering that n 4 oh smx was unstable and quickly transformed to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx the reaction pathway can be simplified as follows r1 s m x k 1 4 n o s m x k 2 4 n o 2 s m x where k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and degradation rate constants of 4 no smx respectively according to r1 time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx can be described by sequential kinetic equations jiang et al 2018 1 4 n o s m x k 1 s m x 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 2 4 n o 2 s m x s m x 0 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t fig 2 also illustrates that time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx can be well described by fitting the experimental data to these equations with least squares nonlinear regression green and red lines in fig 2 this result corroborates the fact that 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx were generated sequentially during smx transformation by pms 3 3 reactive site and reaction mechanism to further support that the aniline moiety of smx was the reactive site with respect to pms oxidation the transformation of smx by pms was compared with those of its substructural analogs including aniline an sulfanilamide sam and 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole 3a5mi fig 3 experimental result shows that pms oxidized an quickly consistent with its electron rich property cui et al 2016 the slower oxidation of sam as compared to an can be attributable to the electron withdrawing effect of sulfonamide moiety attached at the para position sulfonamide moiety within sam molecule is capable of reducing the electron density of aromatic ring via inductive effect ji et al 2015 interestingly 3a5mi was almost inert toward pms oxidation suggesting that the heterocyclic ring of smx was not the reactive site susceptible to pms oxidation overall our result provides strong evidence that pms selectively oxidized the aniline moiety of smx resulting in 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx as major products such oxidation differed appreciably with radical based oxidation of smx in which aniline moiety hydroxylation oxidation sulfonamide bond so2 nh cleavage as well as isoxazole ring oxidation and cleavage were commonly observed hu et al 2007 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 ji et al 2014 yang et al 2017 based on the experimental results obtained from hplc and hr ms analyses it can be concluded that the amino group nh2 of smx can initially be oxidized to a hydroxylamine nhoh via direct pms oxidation a recent study investigating direct pms oxidation of β lactam antibiotics proposed that such reaction proceed through two electron transfer which involved the heterolytic breakage of pms peroxide bond and an oxygen atom transfer from pms to nucleophiles chen et al 2018 to better understand such process dft calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which smx was transformed via direct pms oxidation fig s4 s12 initially we calculated the interaction process of only pms with smx in which pms acted as an o atom donor for the oxidation process as it can be seen in fig 4 red line the initial step was hydroxyl transfer from pms to n atom of the aniline moiety through a transition state ts1 leading to the formation of a new n o bond im in fig 4 however the calculation results indicated that such an oxidation process needed to overcome an energy barrier of 24 5 kcal mol 1 which was too high for a fast reaction to occur it has been reported that water molecules may reduce the energy barrier cordes and bull 1974 zhang et al 2015a wang et al 2015 therefore we further considered the water molecule assisted transformation of smx by pms black line in fig 4 the calculation results suggested that in the presence of two water molecules the δh value for the hydroxyl transfer process generation of im water via ts1 water dropped to 15 3 kcal mol 1 far less than that without water such energy barrier was more easily to overcome at ambient temperature 25 c afterwards im water underwent h atom abstraction from water and electron transfer process simultaneously through the transition state ts2 water yielding pc water with a corresponding barrier of only 1 5 kcal mol 1 pc water could release two molecules of water and finally generated the oxidation intermediate n 4 oh smx such an oxidation process was exergonic by 23 5 kcal mol 1 providing a thermodynamic driving force for this reaction overall our dft calculation shows that the transformation of smx was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such process was assisted by two water molecules which significantly reduced energy barrier sequential heterolytic breakage of the peroxide bond of pms and electron transfer led to the formation of the intermediate n 4 oh smx 3 4 reaction kinetics preliminary experiments indicated that the oxidation of smx by pms followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics eq 3 3 l n s m x t s m x 0 k o b s t where k obs is the pseudo first order rate constant smx 0 and smx t are the concentrations of smx at time zero and t respectively 3 4 1 effects of pms dosage the effects of pms dosage on smx transformation was evaluated by varying the concentration of pms from 0 2 to 3 0 mm fig 5 across the initial pms concentration examined the reaction of pms with smx was first order with respect to smx concentration in addition the value of k obs was positively proportional to pms concentration fig s13 sm suggesting that the reaction was also first order with respect to pms concentration therefore the overall reaction followed a second order kinetic model eq 4 4 l n s m x t s m x 0 k p m s s m x p m s 0 t 5 k p m s s m x k o b s p m s 0 these findings are consistent with the oxidation of antibiotics by other oxidants commonly applied in water and wastewater treatment such as ferrate and permanganate sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2010 the second order rate constant for reaction of pms with smx was determined to be 0 23 m 1s 1 by linear regression of plot of k obs vs pms concentration eq 5 fig s13 sm this value was lower than that of the β lactam antibiotics cefalexin 71 7 3 76 m 1 s 1 as reported by chen et al 2018 it should be noted that such value was also lower than smx reaction with ferrate 1 70 0 2 102 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 2006 and ozone 2 5 106 m 1s 1 or 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 dodd et al 2006 suggesting that pms has a weaker potential for oxidizing sulfonamide antibiotics as compared to other oxidants despite that pms is a weaker oxidant it is more selective toward certain organic contaminant and is less susceptible to scavenging by natural water matrices chen et al 2018 3 4 2 effects of solution ph solution ph affects the oxidation of target compound by altering the speciation of both substrate and oxidant sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2010 fig 6 shows that the transformation of smx was accelerated with increasing ph values when ph was increased from 4 5 0 0042 min 1 to 8 0 0 0146 0 0003 min 1 the k obs value was enhanced by up to approximately 3 5 fold the increase in transformation rate of smx can be attributable to the deprotonation of sulfonamide nh that can activate the aniline moiety which was favorable toward electrophilic attack of oxidants such as o3 dodd et al 2006 sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole possess two pk a values corresponding to the protonation of aniline nh2 pk a1 1 85 and deprotonation of sulfonamide nh pk a2 5 60 respectively boreen et al 2004 qiang and adams 2004 the species distribution of smx in water can be expressed as follows r2 r2 s m x h p k a 1 s m x p k a 2 s m x h where smx h smx and smx h represent the cationic neutral and anionic species of smx respectively the fraction of each species concentration is dependent on the ph which can be described by following equations 6 α h 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 7 α 0 k a 1 h h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 8 α k a 1 k a 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 where α α 0 and α are the molar fractions of the cationic smx h neutral smx and anionic smx h species respectively therefore the total concentration of smx i e smx tot can be calculated by following equation 9 s m x t o t α s m x 0 α 0 s m x 0 α s m x 0 pms has two pk as with pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 guan et al 2011 therefore across the ph range examined 4 5 8 0 pms was present dominantly as hso5 the rate of smx transformation can be illustrated by following equation 10 d s m x d t k p m s s m x p m s 0 s m x t o t k α α k α 0 α 0 k α α p m s 0 s m x 0 therefore second order rate constant of pms reaction with smx k pms smx can be described as follows 11 k p m s s m x k α α k α 0 α 0 k α α where k α k α0 and k α represent species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of pms with smx h smx and smx h respectively because smx h species is negligible under the ph range explored k pms smx can be simplified as follows 12 k p m s s m x k α 0 α 0 k α α values of k α0 and k α were calculated by the least squares nonlinear regression of kinetic data with eq 12 kinetic modelling dash line in fig 6 shows that the contribution of k α0 0 0279 m 1s 1 to the overall k pms smx was less important relative to that of k α 0 2300 m 1s 1 this result suggests that the anionic form of smx smx h was much more reactive toward pms oxidation therefore an enhancement in ph resulted in greater fraction of smx h thus favoring the transformation of smx by pms 3 4 3 effects of natural water matrices two natural waters one lake water and one low aquifer groundwater were utilized to investigate the effects of water matrices on the transformation of smx by pms the lake water derived from a eutrophication lake is rich of natural organic matter nom our previous research showed that the lake water significantly inhibited the degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics by so4 based oxidation presumably due to radical scavenging and reductive conversion of intermediates jiang et al 2016 in the present study however a slight inhibitory effect was observed when smx was oxidized by pms in the lake water as compared to the milli q water fig 7 suggesting that pms suffered less interference from natural surface water constituents such as nom chen et al 2018 in contrast the transformation rate of smx in the groundwater was appreciably lower than that in the milli q water although the exact reason accounting for this phenomenon was unclear previous studies reported that reducing substances such as mn2 and h2s could markedly inhibit permanganate oxidation of organic contaminants including certain antibiotics and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine hu et al 2009 2010 therefore we assumed that the reducing substances present in groundwater might consume a fraction of pms which inhibited the transformation of smx however further research is required to identify the chemicals that caused a decrease in pms oxidation efficiency 3 5 comparison with other sulfonamides the transformation of smx by pms was compared with those of other sas typically detected in natural waters see table 1 except for sulfisoxazole six the rate of loss of sas including smx sulfamethizole smt sulfapyridine spd sulfadiazine sdz and sulfachloropyridazine scp all fall into a range with variation less than 10 therefore the reactivity of sas containing different heterocyclic rings was indeed similar because sas possess an aniline structure in common their similar reactivity implies that pms reacts preferentially with this moiety rather than with heterocyclic rings results from recent studies also demonstrated that pms reaction with a series of sas generated both their corresponding nitroso and nitro products jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 the fast rate of six transformation by pms was interesting this phenomenon also observed previously in so4 based oxidation systems can be attributable to the presence of two methyl substituents in the isoxazole ring ji et al 2014 2015 previous studies provided evidence that methylation of the oxazole or isoxazole ring appreciably increased the ring electron density thus favoring the electrophilic attack of reactive radicals or oxidants dogan et al 1990 therefore in the case of six both aniline and dimethylisoxazole ring were expected to be reactive sites with respect to pms attack this hypothesis was confirmed by additional experiment with 5 amino 3 4 dimethylisoxazole 5a34dmi serving as a substructural analog of six experimental result shows that the transformation rate of 5a34dmi was high with pseudo first order rate constant determined to be 0 0912 min 1 3 6 implications for water treatment it is well known that bacteriostatic effect of sulfonamides originates from antagonistic competition with p aminobenzoic acid for dihydropteroate synthase enzyme which is essential for bacterial folic synthesis modification of aniline moiety to produce nitroso and nitro derivatives by pms oxidation is expected to diminish the antimicrobial activity of smx and other sas of concern dodd and huang 2004 however a recent study by majewsky et al 2014 showed that transformation products with para amino position modified still exhibited clear antibacterial effects for example 4 no2 smx was found to inhibit vibrio fischeri growth to a greater extent than the parent compound majewsky et al 2014 ecological activity relationship ecosar program based on quantitative structure activity relationship analysis also revealed that smx transformation products derived from so4 or co3 oxidation such as 4 no2 smx were more toxic than those products derived from ho oxidation yang et al 2017 in the case of 4 no smx it was reported to be more cytotoxic than smx bonvin et al 2013 therefore selective oxidation of aniline functional group by pms alone without activation would produce more recalcitrant and toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts which are of great environmental concerns this scenario is particularly daunting considering that pms was typically applied in excess in water and wastewater treatment and there may be a large amount of pms residues after remediation because nitroso and nitro chemicals are potentially carcinogenic mutagenic and genotoxic the potential of applying pms to remediate environmental compartments such as wastewater and groundwater should be carefully assessed our results may also have implications for the degradation of sas by activated pms processes e g co2 pms uv pms etc in which so4 was generally regarded as dominant oxidizing species mahdi ahmed et al 2012 cui et al 2016 however the importance and consequence of direct pms oxidation of sas was not well discerned in activated pms processes and to some extent overlooked although the direct pms oxidation may be less important than radical based oxidation the formation of more recalcitrant and toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized 4 conclusions previous studies have demonstrated that activated pms oxidation processes e g uv pms co2 pms etc are highly capable of degrading a broad range of organic contaminants such as endocrine disruptors edcs and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps due to the generation of reactive so4 this research reported that certain contaminants such as sulfonamides are also amendable to direct pms oxidation via a non radical pathway key findings of this study include kinetics and products analyses revealed that the aniline moiety of smx was the reactive site with respect to pms oxidation dft calculation showed that the transformation of smx was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such process was assisted by two water molecules which significantly reduced energy barrier pms preferentially oxidized the aniline moiety of smx to produce n 4 hydroxyl sulfamethoxazole n 4 oh smx 4 nitroso sulfamethoxazole 4 no smx and 4 nitro sulfamethoxazole 4 no2 smx sequentially the transformation kinetics of smx was first order with respect to both pms and smx concentration an increase in pms concentration from 0 2 to 3 0 mm linearly enhanced the pseudo first order rate constant of smx transformation increasing solution ph favored the transformation of smx by pms which can be well described by a species dependent kinetic model higher inhibitory effect on smx transformation was observed in groundwater matrix possibly due to the presence of reducing substances that might consume a fraction of pms sas are amendable to direct pms oxidation however the formation of potential toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized acknowledgements the authors gratefully

direct pms oxidation high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc analyses using authentic standards were adopted to qualifying and quantifying smx transformation products our results reveal that nonradical oxidation of smx by pms was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such reaction was assisted by two water molecules which significantly reduced energy barrier direct pms oxidation of smx led to the formation of n 4 hydroxyl sulfamethoxazole n 4 oh smx 4 nitroso sulfamethoxazole 4 no smx and 4 nitro sulfamethoxazole 4 no2 smx sequentially implications of pms oxidation with sas to water treatment were further evaluated by investigating the effects of pms

the formation of potential hazardous nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized before this technology can be safely used for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords 4 nitro sulfamethoxazole peroxymonosulfate sulfamethoxazole sulfonamide antibiotics transformation 1 introduction peroxymonosulfate pms is a commercially available peroxide with the trade name oxone which is comprised of triple salt with the composition of 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 pms bears a peroxide bond in its molecule except that a hydrogen atom is substituted by a sulfonate group the redox potential of pms is 1 82 v which is comparative with other oxidants commonly used in water and wastewater treatment such as ozone o3 2 07 v permanganate kmno4 1 68 v and hypochlorous acid hocl 1 48 v von gunten 2003 deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2009 pms can be activated by various approaches including uv light transition metals hydroxylions minerals metal and carbon based catalysts to generate sulfate radical so4 a highly reactive oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 guan et al 2011 qi et al 2016 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 2017 yao et al 2017 application of activated pms processes for water and wastewater treatment has received increasing interest recently because so4 is more oxidizing than pms alone and it reacts with a broad rang of contaminants at second order rate constants ranging from 106 to 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 tistonaki et al 2010 while direct oxidation of contaminants by pms alone is relatively slow it can oxidize a variety of inorganic chemicals in waters such as halides firouzabadi et al 2009 li et al 2017 arsenite as iii wang et al 2014 and odor causing compounds betterton and hoffmann 1990 yang et al 2016 for example pms oxidizes bromide br at a second order rate constant of 1 04 m 1s 1 much higher than that of h2o2 reaction with br 2 3 10 5 m 1s 1 fortnum et al 1960 in addition pms has also been utilized either as a substituent oxidant of h2o2 to control the odorous reductive sulfur species or as a bleaching agent in the paper and pulp industry to replace chlorine anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 more recently pms was also used as a broad spectrum disinfectant to inactivate disease associated pathogens chesney et al 2016 although pms oxidation has been utilized for removal of inorganic chemicals as well as inactivation of pathogens studies reporting pms reactions with organic contaminants such as endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals are limited the comparatively high redox potential of pms enables its direct oxidation with many organics thermodynamically feasible several studies have reported the direct pms oxidation of organics such as β lactam antibiotics through a nonradical mechanism chen et al 2018 reaction pathways and product distributions of direct pms oxidation of organic contaminants may differ from those of activated pms processes in which so4 often dominates reactions nevertheless up to now only few studies have investigated the reaction kinetics and underlying mechanisms of direct pms oxidation with organic contaminants chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 indeed during activated pms oxidation of organic contaminants the direct oxidation of pms could not be well differentiated and in some cases overlooked mahdi ahmed et al 2012 therefore it is essential to investigate non activated pms oxidation of organic contaminants in particular those frequently detected in environmental waters cui et al 2016 previous studies using other oxidant such as ferrate and permanganate have indicated that oxidation was initiated by forming a precursor complex which undergoes sequential reactions to generate products sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2009 electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines and olefins are reactive sites typically susceptible to electrophilic attack of oxidants huber et al 2003 dodd et al 2006 in addition reaction kinetics is usually found to be first order with respect to both oxidant and substrate hu et al 2009 2010 these findings are conducive to better understand the kinetics and mechanisms of direct oxidation of organic contaminants by pms in this contribution we attempted to evaluate the kinetics mechanisms and products of non activiated pms oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and other sulfonamides of concern the motivation of this study is to evaluate the potential of employing direct pms oxidation to remediate water and wastewater contaminated by micropollutants e g antibiotics and to assess potential risks associated with utilization of this oxidants sulfonamide antibiotics sas are frequently detected in environmental compartments such as surface water groundwater soils and sediments due to their extensive use as both human and veterinary drugs boxall et al 2003 michael et al 2013 sas are persistent in the environment due to their high solubility chemical stability and resistance to natural attenuation processes such as hydrolysis biotransformation and photolysis kümmerer 2009 sas have the potential for disseminating antibacterial resistance thus may cause subtle chromic and unpredicted effects on both human health and ecosystem baran et al 2011 rizzo et al 2013 by using sulfamethoxazole smx as a representative the present work aims to i identify and quantify smx transformation products by direct pms oxidation ii elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathways of smx transformation and iii evaluate the effects of pms dosage solution ph and natural water matrices on smx transformation our results suggested that while pms has a potential to transform a suite of sas with similar molecular structures the formation of potential hazardous nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized before this technology can be safely used for water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chemicals

μm sulfonamide e g smx or substructural analogs initial solution ph was adjusted by 10 mm phosphate buffer to desired values it should be noted that phosphate ions at 10 mm had no effect on direct pms oxidation of antibiotics chen et al 2018 the vials were immersed in a thermo regulated water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 c over the reaction reactions were initiated by spiking appropriate amount of pms stock solution to the vials aliquots 0 5 ml were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and spiked in hplc vials which contained 20 μl 1m na2s2o3 initially to quench the residual pms anipsitakis et al 2006 samples were refrigerated at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h all degradation experiments were conducted with two duplicate samples and average data were reported solution ph was

quantification of the target compounds was based on multipoint standard calibration curves 2 4 qualification and quantification of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms analyses were performed to identify the primary oxidation products of smx a waters q tof mass spectrometer in negative ionization modes esi was used which was coupled to an hplc waters alliance system consisting of a 2695 module for compounds separation and a 2998 photodiode array detector formation of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx was quantified by the same hitachi hplc as described above analytical separation was performed by an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 5 0 μm particle size 250 mm 4 6 mm i d elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 with h2o containing 0 1 v v formic

in 34 45 min under these conditions the retention times of smx 4 no2 smx and 4 no smx were 17 9 26 4 and 27 5 min respectively 2 5 computational method all the density functional theory dft calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package of program using the m06 2x hybrid meta exchange correlation functional in conjunction with the 6 31 g d basis set zhao and truhlar 2008 the solvent effect of water was considered with the smd model based on the self consistent reaction field scrf method marenich et al 2009 frequency calculations were performed with the same method to determine the character of stationary points transition states ts were characterized with one imaginary vibrational frequency intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculations were also performed to verify that transition states are connected to reactants and intermediates on the potential energy surfaces of reactions in this study δh was calculated instead of δg because of the well known erroneous computational description of the variation of entropy watson and eisenstein 2002 the δh values were corrected by zero point energy and thermal energy at 298 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 nonradical oxidation preliminary experiment revealed that pms alone was capable of transforming smx in aqueous solution under a typical reaction condition of 15 μm smx 1 mm pms and ph 7 more than 65 of smx could be transformed within 80 min fig s1 sm which was consistent with previous studies cui et al 2016 prior studies have reported the involvement of several reactive species including so4 hydroxyl radical ho and singlet oxygen 1o2 in pms based oxidation of contaminants anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 zhou et al 2015 as electrophilic oxidants so4 ho and 1o2 tend to react with smx with second order rate constants determined to be 1 61 0 17 1010 5 8 0 2 109 2 1 104 m 1s 1 respectively boreen et al 2004 zhang et al 2015b to discern whether these species were also involved in non activated pms oxidation of smx experiments with scavengers were conducted methanol meoh that reacts with so4 and ho at a second order rate constant of 2 5 107 and 9 7 108 m 1s 1 respectively was used to determine the contribution of free radicals i e so4 and ho neta et al 1977 liang and su 2009 as shown in fig s1 sm no significant reduce in smx concentration was observed upon addition of meoh 10 mm molar ratio of scavenger substrate was 667 1 implying that free radicals i e so4 and ho were not responsible for smx transformation furthermore increasing the concentration of meoh up to 100 mm molar ratio of scavenger substrate was 6667 1 did not influence the transformation of smx fig s2 sm furfuryl alcohol ffa that reacts with 1o2 at a second order rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1s 1 was also employed to probe the contribution of 1o2 haag et al 1984 result of fig s1 suggests that the contribution of 1o2 was negligible therefore the oxidation of smx by pms possibly occurred through a nonradical pathway which was overlooked previously nonradical based pms oxidation of contaminants such as as iii and 2 4 dichlorophenol has been documented previously wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 3 2 transformation products the reaction sample of smx treated by pms oxidation was tentatively analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms exact masses corresponding to 4 no smx m h 266 03434 and 4 no2 smx m h 282 02985 were identified as shown in fig 1 further structural assignments of these products were confirmed by hplc analyses using commercially available reference standards cas 29699 89 6 for 4 no2 smx and cas 131549 85 4 for 4 no smx fig s3 sm oxidation of smx to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx should process through the intermediate n 4 oh smx after a two electron oxidation of the aniline group as observed in other oxidation processes such as ferrate and chlorine dioxide sharma et al 2006 ben et al 2017 formation of n 4 oh smx was indeed confirmed by hplc analysis using a reference standard cas 114438 33 4 data not shown therefore non activated pms oxidation of smx occurred through a pathway described as follows smx n 4 oh smx 4 no smx 4 no2 smx however the difficulty to separate n 4 oh smx and smx in chromatograph spectrum even a gradient eluent was applied hampered its quantification cribb and spielberg 1992 previous studies have indicated that n 4 oh smx was extremely unstable especially in neutral and basic oxygen containing solutions and transformed to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx rapidly bonvin et al 2013 the instability of n 4 oh smx was also justified by our hplc measurement because 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx were observed during the analysis of a n 4 oh smx standard data not shown the identified transformation products suggested that the aniline moiety of smx was selectively oxidized by pms leading to the formation of n 4 oh smx 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx sequentially fig 2 shows the time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx generated during non activated pms oxidation of smx the concentration of 4 no smx exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing pattern with maximum 0 51 μm occurring at 20 min however the concentration of 4 no2 smx increased steadily as the reaction progressed due to electron withdrawing effect the nitro group of 4 no2 smx is expected to deactivate the aromatic ring making it less susceptible toward further oxidation as a result 4 no2 smx appeared to be resistant to direct pms oxidation and thus accumulated in the reaction solution considering that n 4 oh smx was unstable and quickly transformed to 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx the reaction pathway can be simplified as follows r1 s m x k 1 4 n o s m x k 2 4 n o 2 s m x where k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and degradation rate constants of 4 no smx respectively according to r1 time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx can be described by sequential kinetic equations jiang et al 2018 1 4 n o s m x k 1 s m x 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 2 4 n o 2 s m x s m x 0 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t fig 2 also illustrates that time dependent evolution of 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx can be well described by fitting the experimental data to these equations with least squares nonlinear regression green and red lines in fig 2 this result corroborates the fact that 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx were generated sequentially during smx transformation by pms 3 3 reactive site and reaction mechanism to further support that the aniline moiety of smx was the reactive site with respect to pms oxidation the transformation of smx by pms was compared with those of its substructural analogs including aniline an sulfanilamide sam and 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole 3a5mi fig 3 experimental result shows that pms oxidized an quickly consistent with its electron rich property cui et al 2016 the slower oxidation of sam as compared to an can be attributable to the electron withdrawing effect of sulfonamide moiety attached at the para position sulfonamide moiety within sam molecule is capable of reducing the electron density of aromatic ring via inductive effect ji et al 2015 interestingly 3a5mi was almost inert toward pms oxidation suggesting that the heterocyclic ring of smx was not the reactive site susceptible to pms oxidation overall our result provides strong evidence that pms selectively oxidized the aniline moiety of smx resulting in 4 no smx and 4 no2 smx as major products such oxidation differed appreciably with radical based oxidation of smx in which aniline moiety hydroxylation oxidation sulfonamide bond so2 nh cleavage as well as isoxazole ring oxidation and cleavage were commonly observed hu et al 2007 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 ji et al 2014 yang et al 2017 based on the experimental results obtained from hplc and hr ms analyses it can be concluded that the amino group nh2 of smx can initially be oxidized to a hydroxylamine nhoh via direct pms oxidation a recent study investigating direct pms oxidation of β lactam antibiotics proposed that such reaction proceed through two electron transfer which involved the heterolytic breakage of pms peroxide bond and an oxygen atom transfer from pms to nucleophiles chen et al 2018 to better understand such process dft calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which smx was transformed via direct pms oxidation fig s4 s12 initially we calculated the interaction process of only pms with smx in which pms acted as an o atom donor for the oxidation process as it can be seen in fig 4 red line the initial step was hydroxyl transfer from pms to n atom of the aniline moiety through a transition state ts1 leading to the formation of a new n o bond im in fig 4 however the calculation results indicated that such an oxidation process needed to overcome an energy barrier of 24 5 kcal mol 1 which was too high for a fast reaction to occur it has been reported that water molecules may reduce the energy barrier cordes and bull 1974 zhang et al 2015a wang et al 2015 therefore we further considered the water molecule assisted transformation of smx by pms black line in fig 4 the calculation results suggested that in the presence of two water molecules the δh value for the hydroxyl transfer process generation of im water via ts1 water dropped to 15 3 kcal mol 1 far less than that without water such energy barrier was more easily to overcome at ambient temperature 25 c afterwards im water underwent h atom abstraction from water and electron transfer process simultaneously through the transition state ts2 water yielding pc water with a corresponding barrier of only 1 5 kcal mol 1 pc water could release two molecules of water and finally generated the oxidation intermediate n 4 oh smx such an oxidation process was exergonic by 23 5 kcal mol 1 providing a thermodynamic driving force for this reaction overall our dft calculation shows that the transformation of smx was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such process was assisted by two water molecules which significantly reduced energy barrier sequential heterolytic breakage of the peroxide bond of pms and electron transfer led to the formation of the intermediate n 4 oh smx 3 4 reaction kinetics preliminary experiments indicated that the oxidation of smx by pms followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics eq 3 3 l n s m x t s m x 0 k o b s t where k obs is the pseudo first order rate constant smx 0 and smx t are the concentrations of smx at time zero and t respectively 3 4 1 effects of pms dosage the effects of pms dosage on smx transformation was evaluated by varying the concentration of pms from 0 2 to 3 0 mm fig 5 across the initial pms concentration examined the reaction of pms with smx was first order with respect to smx concentration in addition the value of k obs was positively proportional to pms concentration fig s13 sm suggesting that the reaction was also first order with respect to pms concentration therefore the overall reaction followed a second order kinetic model eq 4 4 l n s m x t s m x 0 k p m s s m x p m s 0 t 5 k p m s s m x k o b s p m s 0 these findings are consistent with the oxidation of antibiotics by other oxidants commonly applied in water and wastewater treatment such as ferrate and permanganate sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2010 the second order rate constant for reaction of pms with smx was determined to be 0 23 m 1s 1 by linear regression of plot of k obs vs pms concentration eq 5 fig s13 sm this value was lower than that of the β lactam antibiotics cefalexin 71 7 3 76 m 1 s 1 as reported by chen et al 2018 it should be noted that such value was also lower than smx reaction with ferrate 1 70 0 2 102 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 2006 and ozone 2 5 106 m 1s 1 or 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 dodd et al 2006 suggesting that pms has a weaker potential for oxidizing sulfonamide antibiotics as compared to other oxidants despite that pms is a weaker oxidant it is more selective toward certain organic contaminant and is less susceptible to scavenging by natural water matrices chen et al 2018 3 4 2 effects of solution ph solution ph affects the oxidation of target compound by altering the speciation of both substrate and oxidant sharma et al 2006 hu et al 2010 fig 6 shows that the transformation of smx was accelerated with increasing ph values when ph was increased from 4 5 0 0042 min 1 to 8 0 0 0146 0 0003 min 1 the k obs value was enhanced by up to approximately 3 5 fold the increase in transformation rate of smx can be attributable to the deprotonation of sulfonamide nh that can activate the aniline moiety which was favorable toward electrophilic attack of oxidants such as o3 dodd et al 2006 sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole possess two pk a values corresponding to the protonation of aniline nh2 pk a1 1 85 and deprotonation of sulfonamide nh pk a2 5 60 respectively boreen et al 2004 qiang and adams 2004 the species distribution of smx in water can be expressed as follows r2 r2 s m x h p k a 1 s m x p k a 2 s m x h where smx h smx and smx h represent the cationic neutral and anionic species of smx respectively the fraction of each species concentration is dependent on the ph which can be described by following equations 6 α h 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 7 α 0 k a 1 h h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 8 α k a 1 k a 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 where α α 0 and α are the molar fractions of the cationic smx h neutral smx and anionic smx h species respectively therefore the total concentration of smx i e smx tot can be calculated by following equation 9 s m x t o t α s m x 0 α 0 s m x 0 α s m x 0 pms has two pk as with pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 guan et al 2011 therefore across the ph range examined 4 5 8 0 pms was present dominantly as hso5 the rate of smx transformation can be illustrated by following equation 10 d s m x d t k p m s s m x p m s 0 s m x t o t k α α k α 0 α 0 k α α p m s 0 s m x 0 therefore second order rate constant of pms reaction with smx k pms smx can be described as follows 11 k p m s s m x k α α k α 0 α 0 k α α where k α k α0 and k α represent species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of pms with smx h smx and smx h respectively because smx h species is negligible under the ph range explored k pms smx can be simplified as follows 12 k p m s s m x k α 0 α 0 k α α values of k α0 and k α were calculated by the least squares nonlinear regression of kinetic data with eq 12 kinetic modelling dash line in fig 6 shows that the contribution of k α0 0 0279 m 1s 1 to the overall k pms smx was less important relative to that of k α 0 2300 m 1s 1 this result suggests that the anionic form of smx smx h was much more reactive toward pms oxidation therefore an enhancement in ph resulted in greater fraction of smx h thus favoring the transformation of smx by pms 3 4 3 effects of natural water matrices two natural waters one lake water and one low aquifer groundwater were utilized to investigate the effects of water matrices on the transformation of smx by pms the lake water derived from a eutrophication lake is rich of natural organic matter nom our previous research showed that the lake water significantly inhibited the degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics by so4 based oxidation presumably due to radical scavenging and reductive conversion of intermediates jiang et al 2016 in the present study however a slight inhibitory effect was observed when smx was oxidized by pms in the lake water as compared to the milli q water fig 7 suggesting that pms suffered less interference from natural surface water constituents such as nom chen et al 2018 in contrast the transformation rate of smx in the groundwater was appreciably lower than that in the milli q water although the exact reason accounting for this phenomenon was unclear previous studies reported that reducing substances such as mn2 and h2s could markedly inhibit permanganate oxidation of organic contaminants including certain antibiotics and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine hu et al 2009 2010 therefore we assumed that the reducing substances present in groundwater might consume a fraction of pms which inhibited the transformation of smx however further research is required to identify the chemicals that caused a decrease in pms oxidation efficiency 3 5 comparison with other sulfonamides the transformation of smx by pms was compared with those of other sas typically detected in natural waters see table 1 except for sulfisoxazole six the rate of loss of sas including smx sulfamethizole smt sulfapyridine spd sulfadiazine sdz and sulfachloropyridazine scp all fall into a range with variation less than 10 therefore the reactivity of sas containing different heterocyclic rings was indeed similar because sas possess an aniline structure in common their similar reactivity implies that pms reacts preferentially with this moiety rather than with heterocyclic rings results from recent studies also demonstrated that pms reaction with a series of sas generated both their corresponding nitroso and nitro products jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 the fast rate of six transformation by pms was interesting this phenomenon also observed previously in so4 based oxidation systems can be attributable to the presence of two methyl substituents in the isoxazole ring ji et al 2014 2015 previous studies provided evidence that methylation of the oxazole or isoxazole ring appreciably increased the ring electron density thus favoring the electrophilic attack of reactive radicals or oxidants dogan et al 1990 therefore in the case of six both aniline and dimethylisoxazole ring were expected to be reactive sites with respect to pms attack this hypothesis was confirmed by additional experiment with 5 amino 3 4 dimethylisoxazole 5a34dmi serving as a substructural analog of six experimental result shows that the transformation rate of 5a34dmi was high with pseudo first order rate constant determined to be 0 0912 min 1 3 6 implications for water treatment it is well known that bacteriostatic effect of sulfonamides originates from antagonistic competition with p aminobenzoic acid for dihydropteroate synthase enzyme which is essential for bacterial folic synthesis modification of aniline moiety to produce nitroso and nitro derivatives by pms oxidation is expected to diminish the antimicrobial activity of smx and other sas of concern dodd and huang 2004 however a recent study by majewsky et al 2014 showed that transformation products with para amino position modified still exhibited clear antibacterial effects for example 4 no2 smx was found to inhibit vibrio fischeri growth to a greater extent than the parent compound majewsky et al 2014 ecological activity relationship ecosar program based on quantitative structure activity relationship analysis also revealed that smx transformation products derived from so4 or co3 oxidation such as 4 no2 smx were more toxic than those products derived from ho oxidation yang et al 2017 in the case of 4 no smx it was reported to be more cytotoxic than smx bonvin et al 2013 therefore selective oxidation of aniline functional group by pms alone without activation would produce more recalcitrant and toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts which are of great environmental concerns this scenario is particularly daunting considering that pms was typically applied in excess in water and wastewater treatment and there may be a large amount of pms residues after remediation because nitroso and nitro chemicals are potentially carcinogenic mutagenic and genotoxic the potential of applying pms to remediate environmental compartments such as wastewater and groundwater should be carefully assessed our results may also have implications for the degradation of sas by activated pms processes e g co2 pms uv pms etc in which so4 was generally regarded as dominant oxidizing species mahdi ahmed et al 2012 cui et al 2016 however the importance and consequence of direct pms oxidation of sas was not well discerned in activated pms processes and to some extent overlooked although the direct pms oxidation may be less important than radical based oxidation the formation of more recalcitrant and toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized 4 conclusions previous studies have demonstrated that activated pms oxidation processes e g uv pms co2 pms etc are highly capable of degrading a broad range of organic contaminants such as endocrine disruptors edcs and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps due to the generation of reactive so4 this research reported that certain contaminants such as sulfonamides are also amendable to direct pms oxidation via a non radical pathway key findings of this study include kinetics and products analyses revealed that the aniline moiety of smx was the reactive site with respect to pms oxidation dft calculation showed that the transformation of smx was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between pms molecule and amino functional group of smx such process was assisted by two water molecules which significantly reduced energy barrier pms preferentially oxidized the aniline moiety of smx to produce n 4 hydroxyl sulfamethoxazole n 4 oh smx 4 nitroso sulfamethoxazole 4 no smx and 4 nitro sulfamethoxazole 4 no2 smx sequentially the transformation kinetics of smx was first order with respect to both pms and smx concentration an increase in pms concentration from 0 2 to 3 0 mm linearly enhanced the pseudo first order rate constant of smx transformation increasing solution ph favored the transformation of smx by pms which can be well described by a species dependent kinetic model higher inhibitory effect on smx transformation was observed in groundwater matrix possibly due to the presence of reducing substances that might consume a fraction of pms sas are amendable to direct pms oxidation however the formation of potential toxic nitroso and nitro byproducts should be scrutinized acknowledgements the authors gratefully

kinetic model which well fitted the removal of sas from aqueous phase at various biochar doses the adsorption of sas on biochar was due to multiple forces in which van der waals forces and hydrophobicity played major roles in distinguishing the sorption behavior of different sas to destruct the sas h2o2 was added with biochar except for n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole all the parent sas can be degraded in urine matrix carbonate radical produced from the activation of peroxymonocarbonate by biochar was proposed to be the major contributing reactive species in biochar h2o2 system in urine

places a major threat on the ecosystem as well as human health wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been regarded as an important source for pharmaceuticals in the natural aquatic environments liu and wong 2013 among all the municipal wastewater streams entering into wwtps human urine accounts for less than 1 by volume but contains pharmaceuticals at 2 3 orders of magnitude higher concentrations eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology 2007 winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b separation of urine from other wastewater streams namely source separated urine has gained increasing attentions because it is expected to be more effective for pharmaceutical removal in source separated urine than other conventional domestic wastewater moreover because urine contributes more than 75 total nitrogen and 50 total phosphorus in wastewater recovering nutrients from urine as a new resource recovery strategy winker et al 2008a also requires elimination of pharmaceuticals from urine multiple processes including nano filtration membranes pronk et al 2006 anion exchange resin landry and boyer 2017 electrodialysis pronk et al 2007 struvite precipitation kemacheevakul et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2015 have been investigated for removing pharmaceuticals from urine however most of the investigated methods require extensive energy material input or upgrading infrastructures and thus hinder their application a more cost effective process will better facilitate the application of removing pharmaceuticals from their source biochar is a carbonaceous material which can be produced from pyrolysis of different sources of biomass including plant materials and wastes sludges manures litters sediment etc cha et al 2016 qambrani et al 2017 rosales et al 2017 considering cost and energy saving carbon sequestration as well as solid waste reuse biochar is regarded as a promising alternative adsorbent for wastewater treatment biochar has been proved to be effective for removing varieties of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics wu et al 2013 yao et al 2012a antiepileptic drugs chen et al 2017 anti inflammatory drugs lin et al 2017 antidepressants anxiolytic and antihistaminic drugs calisto et al 2015 in addition to conventional wastewater treatment system the application of biochar has also been proposed to unconventional systems such as stormwater infiltration system ulrich et al 2015 reclaimed water desalination concentrate lin et al 2017 and other environmental compartment such as soil vithanage et al 2014 although it is expected that human urine is a promising matrix for effective pharmaceutical removal few studies have been carried out applying biochar solanki and boyer have investigated the removal of several pharmaceuticals excluding antibiotics in synthetic human urine using biochar but without including adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies solanki and boyer 2017 the impact of urine components on pharmaceutical removal has not been investigated in addition to adsorption capacity biochar has been reported to activate h2o2 or persulfate to produce highly reactive species which can degrade organic pollutants fang et al 2014 2015 however so far few studies have been conducted for removal of pharmaceuticals by radical nonradical reactive species generated from biochar activation and the technique has not been investigated in source separated urine matrix sulfonamide antibiotics sas are among the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water systems bu et al 2013 li et al 2017 zhang and li 2011 adsorption of sulfamethoxazole smx calisto et al 2015 jung et al 2013 wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 sulfamethazine smt peng et al 2016 vithanage et al 2014 sulfadiazine sdz peng et al 2016 and sulfapyridine inyang et al 2015 xie et al 2014 using biochar or modified activated biochar has been reported however urine matrix is very different from conventional wastewater in terms of ph and major components thus may pose different impact on adsorption process moreover in urine treatment metabolites of the pharmaceuticals should also be considered for example only 9 5 of sulfamethoxazole was excreted in unchanged form while most was excreted as metabolites vree et al 1978 the objective of this study therefore was to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of the removal of antibiotics and human metabolite by biochar catalyzed system in urine matrix specifically the adsorption and degradation of four parent sas and the major human metabolite of smx were investigated considering the relatively long operating period hydrolysis of urea in fresh urine referred to the urine that just left human body will highly likely occur therefore hydrolyzed urine referred to the urine that the original composition has changed due to storage was chosen in this study this work presents sas adsorption isotherm kinetics and mechanisms on biochar in buffer and hydrolyzed urine matrices chemical destruction of sas by biochar activated h2o2 was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smt sulfadimethoxine sdm and n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx were purchased from sigma aldrich inc st louis mo all the five compounds are referred as sas whereas the parent sas represents smx sdz smt and sdm structures and chemical properties of antibiotics are shown in table 1 and table s1 h2o2 30 w w was purchased from aladdine shanghai china hplc grade methanol was purchased from cnw düsseldorf germany all other chemicals and reagents used were in analytical grade or higher reagent grade deionized di water resistivity 18 mω cm was prepared from a nanopure water purification system veolia paris france biochar was produced from pyrolysis of shredded cotton stalks which were air dried under 80 c and milled to pass through a 40 mesh screen the pyrolysis condition was 350 c with the absence of oxygen 2 2 adsorption experiment the batch adsorption experiments were carried out in 10 ml glass vials with screw caps reaction solutions were prepared with 10 μm sa in 10 ml of synthetic urine or phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 9 the synthetic urine composition has been described in previous literature zhang et al 2015 and shown in table 2 due to hydrolysis of urea high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen 0 5 m and bicarbonate 0 25 m were present in hydrolyzed urine which also resulted in elevated ph ph 9 pbs with 5 mm phosphate at ph 9 was employed as a baseline matrix the vials were kept in dark and shaken at 220 rpm 25 c for kinetic study biochar was applied at 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 g l 1 respectively and aliquots were taken at 1 5 10 24 120 h for isotherm study two more biochar doses 0 7 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 were added to provide more accurate results samples were shaken for 120 h to ensure equilibrium before analysis the reaction solutions were filtered with 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filters individual sas were incubated without biochar under each corresponding condition as the control samples nacl was applied to study the impact of ionic strength on adsorption to investigate the impact of major urine components on adsorption bicarbonate and ammonia were added separately with 1 g l 1 biochar and 10 μm sas concentrations of the components were the same as those in synthetic urine solution solution ph was adjusted by concentrated naoh and h3po4 solutions to ph 9 negligible change of ph was observed over the entire contact period for both adsorption and degradation experiments each experiment was conducted by at least duplicates freundlich eq 1 and langmuir eq 2 isotherm model were used to fit the adsorption data 1 q e k f c e 1 n 2 q e q m b s a c e 1 b s a c e where q e is equilibrium adsorbent phase concentration of sa in μmol g 1 k f is freundlich adsorption capacity parameter in μmol g 1 μm 1 1 n 1 n is freundlich adsorption intensity parameter c e is equilibrium aqueous phase concentration of sa in μm q m is langmuir maximum adsorption capacity in μmol g 1 and b sa is the langmuir adsorption constant of sa in μm 1 to better compare the parameters for different sas the amount of sa was quantified using mole based unit μmol instead of mass based unit mg on the basis of langmuir isotherm assumption that the adsorbates and adsorbent surface sites interact as a reversible chemical equilibrium the overall adsorption process of sas onto biochar in pbs and urine matrices was expressed using the following equation 3 s a a q b c v s k s a k s a 1 s a b c where sa aq is the aqueous phase concentration of sas in m bc vs is the vacant sites concentration of biochar in the solution in m sa bc is the concentration of sas adsorbed onto biochar in m k sa in m 1 h 1 and k sa 1 in h 1 are the adsorption and desorption rates respectively therefore at t 0 bc vs biochar dose q m and sa aq 10 μm 2 3 degradation experiment to chemically destruct sas 1 mm h2o2 was added to both pbs and urine solution with 1 g l 1 biochar the samples were shaken for 1 h and then prepared for analysis samples after reactions were treated in two ways extracting agent was added to recover both the residual sas that adsorbed on biochar and remained in aqueous phase solution containing methanol nahco3 9 1 reason for adding nahco3 is elucidated in 3 4 was applied as extracting agent and was added to samples with equal volume after 30 min extraction samples were filtered and analyzed by hplc recovery were 95 80 89 82 and 90 for 10 μm smx sdz sdm smt and nsmx respectively 2 4 quantification of sas a waters e2695 hplc system waters milford ma usa equipped with a uv vis detector and a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm was used to monitor the loss of the sas gradient elution was used with 0 1 phosphoric acid and methanol as mobile phase the portion of methanol stayed at 10 for the first minute then ramped to 50 at 6 min and decreased to 10 from 10 min to 15 min the peak area of sas was quantified at 254 nm 2 5 characterization of biochar information of surface area and pore size of biochar was obtained from a surface area and pore distribution analyzer v sorb 2800tp gold app instruments corporation china fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were performed to qualitatively analyze the functional groups of adsorbent vector 22 tga bruker optics germany with the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the point of zero charge pzc was measured by a ph meter s220 sevencompact mettler toledo shanghai 2 6 estimation of sa properties the pka values of the secondary amine groups on sas were obtained from previous literature babić et al 2007 bonvin et al 2013 solubility of the neutral form of sas was estimated by ecosar v1 11 program the apparent solubility of sas was calculated and detailed in section 3 3 the octanol water distribution coefficient kow was determined experimentally by mixing equal amount of octanol with water solution containing 20 μm individual sas the water phase was buffered with formic acid at ph 3 5 molar refractivity and electronegativity were estimated by chembio3d ultra v12 0 3 result and discussion 3 1 biochar characterization biochar is proposed as a promising low cost adsorbent because of production at relatively low temperature compared with activated carbon in order to demonstrate the performance of low cost biochar on the removal of pharmaceuticals in urine biochar derived from cotton straw produced at 350 c was used in this study it is also worthwhile noting that biochar produced at low temperature retains more nutrient such as total nitrogen than those produced at higher temperatures thus potentially benefits future application as soil amendment shinogi and kanri 2003 yu et al 2013 the properties of the biochar derived from cotton straw are shown in table 3 generally adsorption capacity is considered positively related to the specific surface area and pore volumes therefore comparing with the biochar materials through pyrolysis at comparable temperatures the properties of the biochar derived from cotton straw shown in table 3 was better than peanut shell chen et al 2017 pepper wood sugarcane bagasse and hickory wood yao et al 2012b sediment wu et al 2013 tea waste rajapaksha et al 2014 rice straw wheat straw sun et al 2016 and coconut shell solanki and boyer 2017 but slightly worse than biochar produced from pine wood related materials jung et al 2013 xie et al 2014 the ftir result fig s1 indicated that hydroxyl carbonyl and aromatic moieties dominated on the surface of biochar indicating interactions with pharmaceuticals through h bond and π π interaction may likely occur the point of zero charge was measure to be around 7 4 fig s2 which suggested that the surface of biochar was negatively charged in pbs ph 9 and urine matrix 3 2 adsorption of sas in pbs and urine 3 2 1 kinetics the concentrations of sas in aqueous phase versus time are shown in fig 1 control groups showed that sa concentrations remained unchanged without biochar data not shown confirming that the decreasing concentration of sas in aqueous phase was due to interaction with biochar sas in samples with biochar for 120 h were extracted by methanolic solution and showed that degradation did not occur sa adsorption occurred rapidly within the first 24 h with 0 5 5 g l 1 biochar from 24 h to 120 h the adsorption rates significantly decreased and equilibrium was reached for solutions with 0 1 g l 1 biochar equilibrium was attained within 1 h while the removal was only around 10 with the increase of biochar doses the removal of sas from aqueous phase significantly increased fig 1 indeed the overall removal is higher with higher adsorbent dose due to increasing adsorption sites for the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto biochar time to reach adsorption equilibrium may vary from less than 30 min e g calisto et al 2015 to several days e g wu et al 2013 due to different properties of adsorbent and adsorbate in our study 120 h was deemed sufficient to reach apparent equilibrium therefore 120 h was chosen for following isotherm study independent with biochar doses overall removal of sas in pbs ranked as sdm smt nsmx smx sdz for example the removal ratios at 1 g l 1 biochar were 71 74 68 49 and 39 for sdm smt nsmx smx and sdz respectively in urine similar ranking was observed whereas the removal was inhibited to different extent compared with in pbs fig s3 inhibition was negligible when biochar doses were low because only small amount of sa can be adsorbed even when there was no competitor when biochar doses were relatively high inhibition was also limited because adsorption sites were sufficient for both sas and urine components that will adsorbed onto biochar strongest inhibition urine vs pbs was observed with 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 biochar for each sa 3 2 2 isotherm the adsorption isotherms for five sas in both pbs and urine are shown in fig 2 generally the sorption data were well described by both freundlich and langmuir models shown in fig 2 fig s4 for most conditions langmuir model presented relatively higher regression coefficients r2 table s2 indicating the overall adsorption process followed reversible monolayer sorption mechanism therefore langmuir isotherm model was selected for subsequent analysis and the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 q m values are almost the same for all sas indicating sorption sites for different sas were likely very similar the subtle differences of q m values for pbs and urine matrix indicated urine components did not irreversibly adsorb onto biochar except for sdz the abnormal q m value for sdz in urine may indicate a different mechanism from other sas and further study is needed q m value of this study was comparable with the values reported in previous literature for biochar produced under similar condition from different materials e g 2 79 mg g 1 10 04 μmol g 1 1 39 mg g 1 5 0 μmol g 1 and 5 75 mg g 1 20 68 μmol g 1 for smt with tea waste biochar rajapaksha et al 2014 wheat biochar and maize straw biochar jia et al 2018 4 21 mg g 1 16 64 μmol g 1 and 6 75 mg g 1 26 68 μmol g 1 for smx with rice biochar and wheat biochar sun et al 2016 in pbs b sa values ranked as sdm nsmx smt sdz smx in urine the ranking was sdm smt sdz nsmx smx in addition urine matrix significantly decreased b sa for all the sas from 1 7 times smt to 7 1 times nsmx table 1 the decrease indicates that urine components may compete with sas adsorbing onto biochar same as q m values b sa for sdz in urine was abnormal and even higher than in pbs the difference among sas in adsorption kinetic and equilibrium was likely resulted from different chemical properties of sas which was further discussed in section 3 3 3 2 3 modeling of adsorption process applying matlab simbiology application in matlab program k sa and k sa 1 in eqn 3 were obtained by fitting the data at 1 g l 1 biochar in pbs or in urine all sorption rates are shown in table 1 the adsorption rates k sa of sas in pbs matrix ranks as sdm sdz smt nsmx smx whereas smx has the highest desorption rate k sa 1 followed by sdz smt nsmx and sdm in urine matrix sdm and nsmx adsorbed faster than other sas whereas the desorption rates ranked as smx nsmx sdz smt sdm generally both the adsorption and desorption rates of most sas increased in urine matrix indicating less time was required to reach adsorption equilibrium applying the estimated sorption rates the decrease of aqueous concentrations of sas with the presence of various doses of biochar were then simulated and plotted in fig 1 overall the model has good agreement with the experimental data at various biochar doses to further evaluate this model adsorption experiment in pbs was conducted by mixing five sas at 10 μm with 1 g l 1 biochar the aqueous concentrations of sas were measured after 3 day adsorption as shown in fig s5 the model successfully predicted the removal of all five sas from aqueous phase which also confirmed the hypothesis that all five sas adsorbed on similar sites on biochar thus competing with each other for the same adsorption sites when co existing in solution the adsorption rates of sas represented the energy barrier which was required to overcome for sas to adsorb onto biochar surface higher adsorption rates suggested lower energy barrier and higher attraction force as reported in previous studies the adsorption of sas onto biochar can be resulted from π π interactions coulombic forces hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and hydrophobic effects teixidó et al 2011 in pbs matrix the difference between individual sas may likely resulted from different molecular properties urine components altered the surface properties of biochar leading to the change of sorption rates therefore in order to elucidate the mechanisms of overall sorption process the effects of sa properties and individual urine components were evaluated and discussed in the following sections 3 3 effect of pharmaceutical properties the sas investigated in this work possessed benzene ring and negative charges on the secondary amine nitrogen at ph 9 which are likely important interaction moieties with biochar surface indeed sas may interact with biochar surface through coulombic forces of amine groups and π π interactions of benzene ring teixidó et al 2011 in addition hydrophobicity of sas may also play important role due to favorable partitioning of hydrophobic compounds to the aromatic carbon riched biochar surface from aqueous phase therefore key chemical properties including octanol water partitioning coefficient kow solubility acidity constant pka electronegativity and molar refractivity of all five sas were estimated or recited from previous literature shown in table 1 in order to correlate chemical properties to the different sorption behavior of sas the ranking of pka values of the secondary amine on sas can be roughly considered as the electron donating tendency of the side structures indeed generally sas with lower pka have more negative charge on the secondary amine nitrogen table 1 suggesting lower tendency to interact with the negatively charged biochar surface however neither pka nor electronegativity correlated with any kinetic parameters i e b sa q m k sa k sa 1 therefore interactions due to electron interactions were not major forces distinguishing the sorption behavior of sas the van der waals forces between adsorbate and adsorbent can roughly correlated with molar refractivity ghose and crippen 1987 the molar refractivity of five sas was estimated by the chembio3d ultra v12 0 and shown in table 1 sdm has the highest molar refractivity followed by smt nsmx smx and sdz when plotting molar refractivity with b sa values in pbs fig s6 a good linear correlation was obtained indicating that van der waals forces play an important role in distinguishing the adsorption equilibrium of different sas onto biochar however van der waals forces cannot explain the kinetic differences of sas indeed poor correlations were obtained when plotting molar refractivity with ksa or ksa 1 the adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds onto carboneous materials such as activated carbon has been linked with their partitioning behavior between water and water immiscible organic solvent delgado et al 2012 kow has been widely applied to explain sorption process as for ionizable organic compounds the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient d was applied in order to take account speciation of compounds jung et al 2013 for sas d can be expressed as 4 d s a 0 o c t s a o c t s a 0 w a t e r s a w a t e r where sa0 oct is the concentration of the neutral species present in the octanol phase sa oct is the concentration of the ionized species present in the octanol phase sa0 water is the concentration of the neutral species in the water phase and sa water is the concentration of the ionized species in the water phase the relation between d and kow can be expressed as 5 d k o w 1 1 10 p h p k a k o w 1 1 1 10 p h p k a k o w 1 1 10 p h p k a where kow is the octanol water partitioning coefficient of the neutral species k ow is the octanol water partitioning coefficient of the fully ionized species for hydrophobic species the ionized species is much more soluble in water thus k ow is much lower than kow therefore d is approximately a function of kow and ph applying the kow values measured in this study the d values of sas were calculated and shown in table 1 the same assumptions were also applied to the estimation of solubility therefore the apparent solubility at ph 9 was governed by the solubility limit of neutral species eq 6 6 s a p p s 0 h k a h where sapp is the apparent solubility in m s0 is the solubility limit of neutral form in m attempts were made to correlated hydrophobicity related properties i e kow d s0 sapp with sorption constants i e b sa q m k sa k sa 1 by plotting each property with sorption constants fig s7 s11 we found that 1 d values had linear relation with b sa in pbs with the exception of nsmx 2 the desorption rates of sas in both pbs and urine increased with the increase of apparent solubility with the exception of nsmx therefore hydrophobicity was crucial in distinguishing different sas the distribution coefficient d represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and organic phase higher d values suggests lower energy state in aqueous solution b sa represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and on biochar surface as shown in fig s7 good linear relation was obtained between d and b sa for smx sdz sdm and smt expect for nsmx this results suggested that free energy values of sas on biochar surface likely have the same trend as those in organic phase on the other hand water solubility also represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and solid state however poor correlation was obtained between water solubility and b sa indeed the free energy of solid state represents bond interactions other than solvation effects therefore water solubility was more suitable to describe sorption rates which were governed by bond interactions as shown in fig s8 s11 there is good correlation between water solubility and k sa and k sa 1 for all sas expect nsmx the unusual behavior of nsmx suggested the importance of aniline moiety on the sorption process 3 4 effect of urine components the impact of major individual urine components was tested by spiking corresponding amount of components into pbs with the presence of 1 g l 1 biochar the aqueous concentrations of sas were then measured after 120 h adsorption process inhibition value was calculated using the following equation 7 inhibition s a a q i s a t s a a q p b s s a t 1 s a a q p b s s a t where sa aq i is the aqueous phase concentration of sa with urine component i in μm sa aq pbs is the aqueous phase concentration of sa in pbs in μm sa t is the total concentration of sa spiked in the solution in μm due to the presence of high concentrations of ionic species the ionic strength effect on the adsorption of sas was first evaluated by adding additional amount of nacl into pbs 5 mm to achieve the same ionic strength as urine matrix i e 0 48 m as shown in fig 3 the increase of ionic strength by nacl posed little impact on the sorption equilibrium suggesting the different sorption behavior in pbs and urine was not due to ionic strength difference total ammonia nitrogen tan and carbonate species were dominant species in urine matrix the impact of them was investigated in solutions containing 0 5 m tan and 0 25 m bicarbonate separately the solution ph was adjusted to 9 as shown in fig 3 tan showed minimal impact on the adsorption equilibrium for sas for sdm and nsmx the addition of tan even slightly increased the sorption amount on biochar however bicarbonate greatly inhibited the adsorption of all five sas ionic species such as chloride ammonium and bicarbonate likely affect the sorption of ionizable organic compounds on biochar kah et al 2017 on the basis of pzc value 7 4 of the biochar applied in this study most of the biochar surface possesses negative charges at ph 9 meanwhile all sas were predominantly 98 in their anionic form because the solution ph was much higher than their pka values table 1 a negative charge assisted h bond cahb x h y was likely one of the major interactions between sas and biochar at ph 9 as postulated by teixido et al teixidó et al 2011 indeed the formation of so2n h o likely occurred through the interaction between negatively charged so2nh group on sas and surface carboxyl or hydroxyl group on biochar due to close pka pzc values li et al 2013 it was suggested that carboxylate or phenolate anions tend to form cahbs li et al 2015 analogously bicarbonate likely interacted with biochar surface through cahbs therefore competed with so2nh group for biochar sorption sites due to the incapability to form cahbs chloride and ammonia ammonium ions posed much less impact on the sorption of sas on biochar compared with bicarbonate the sorption of sas was inhibited to different extent by bicarbonate approximately following the order of molar refractivity fig 3 and table 1 which suggested that both van der waals forces and h bonds were major interactions between sas and biochar based on the proposed sorption mechanisms an extraction solution containing methanol and bicarbonate was used to accelerate desorption of sas from biochar and promote extraction recovery 3 5 degradation of sas with biochar h2o2 before biochar can be applied as soil amendment the contaminants adsorbed on it requires chemical destruction to avoid secondary pollution based on previously reported research biochar may activate h2o2 and generate hydroxyl radical fang et al 2014 hydroxyl radical is capable of degrading various pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidizing power and low selectivity buxton et al 1988 in this study h2o2 was added to both pbs and urine matrix to investigate the degradation of sas with the presence of biochar removal was quantified by total extraction by methanolic solution data were shown in fig 4 after 1 h the degradation of sas was not observed in pbs which implied that the biochar applied in this study cannot activate h2o2 to generate reactive species e g hydroxyl radical that can degrade sas at ph 9 or the reactive species were scavenged immediately after generated however in urine matrix smx sdz sdm and smt were degraded by approximately 60 within 1 h whereas the degradation of nsmx was not observed control experiments have shown that sas were stable with the presence of h2o2 in urine matrix without biochar data not shown thus the involvement of biochar was crucial for the degradation of parent sas the degradation of sas in urine by biochar h2o2 can be explained by two possible mechanisms a h2o2 was activated by biochar producing intermediate s which cannot degrade sas but reacted with urine component s yielding secondary reactive species and b the interaction between urine components and h2o2 generated intermediate s which cannot degrade sas but be activated by biochar yielding secondary reactive species to test these two hypotheses the decomposition of h2o2 by biochar was monitored with and without urine components as shown in fig 5 h2o2 was stable with biochar in pbs suggesting the biochar cannot activate h2o2 i e hypothesis a was incorrect among all conditions tested h2o2 was only decomposed by biochar with the presence of bicarbonate the reaction between h2o2 and bicarbonate produces peroxymonocarbonate eq 8 richardson et al 2000 preliminary test using dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method cai et al 2017 showed significant increase of absorbance in h2o2 solution with bicarbonate indicating the formation of peroxymonocarbonate peroxymonocarbonate has been reported to produce carbonate radical by activation by transition metals pi et al 2018 similar activation pathway may likely occur that biochar decomposed peroxymonocarbonate to produce carbonate radical which degraded sas in urine eq 9 8 hco 3 h 2 o 2 hco 4 h 2 o 9 hco 4 e co 3 oh activated by biochar according to our previous studies zhang et al 2015 2016a nsmx has similar reactivity toward hydroxyl radical as smx however smx reacts with carbonate radical at ph 9 with second order rate constant of 2 68 108 m 1 s 1 while nsmx shows much lower reactivity 1 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 amino group substituted benzene derivative was speculated to be the reason because of its high reactivity toward carbonate radical zhang et al 2015 second order rate constants of sdz and smt toward carbonate radical were also previously determined as 2 78 108 m 1 s 1 and 4 37 108 m 1 s 1 comparable to the rate constant of smx zhang et al 2016b although the reactivity of sdm toward carbonate radical has not been measured it is highly likely at the same level as other parent sas due to the structural similarity e g amino group substituted benzene moiety therefore the obvious degradation efficiency difference between nsmx and other sas suggested that carbonate radical may play an important role in degrading the sas because parent sas are probably the major scavengers for carbonate radical parent sas were degraded by similar level about 60 shown in fig 4 regardless of their second order rate constants with carbonate radical the decomposition of h2o2 by biochar was reported in a number of retrospective literature fang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 however some types of biochar have very low capability to activate h2o2 the results in this section demonstrate that a biochar which cannot decompose h2o2 activated h2o2 yielding reactive species with the presence of bicarbonate considering the application of biochar in urine and other high strength wastewater this activation pathway may provide alternative biochar based catalysis system used for pharmaceutical removal 4 conclusion the adsorption of four parent sas and the major human metabolite of smx on biochar derived from cotton straw was investigated in pbs and synthetic urine matrix generally the adsorption reached equilibrium within around 24 h with the presence of biochar from 0 1 g l 1 to 5 g l 1 the sorption isotherm followed langmiur model by fitting experimental data the maximum sorption sites of biochar was estimated around 10 μmol g 1 for all sas in both pbs and urine matrix a kinetic model was developed which successfully described the adsorption behavior of all sas presence individually or co existing in solutions urine matrix increased both the adsorption and desorption rates resulting shorter time to reach sorption equilibrium the adsorption of sas on biochar was due to multiple forces in which van der waals forces and hydrophobicity played major roles in distinguishing the sorption behavior of different sas expect for nsmx in urine matrix bicarbonate was the major competitor for sas on the sorption in order to destruct sas h2o2 was added to create biochar h2o2 catalytic system the degradation of sas expect for nsmx were only observed in urine matrix which was likely attributed to the reactions involving bicarbonate overall biocarbonate in urine played a critical role in both adsorption process and biochar h2o2 system the major human metabolite of smx nsmx behaved differently from the parent sas highlighting the importance of investigating both parent antibiotics and their metabolites in future studies

19236,source separated urine has been increasingly regarded as a promising alternative waste stream for effectively removing pharmaceuticals and human metabolites this study investigated the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics one category among the most frequently detected antibiotics in the environment by biochar and biochar h2o2 in synthetic urine matrix the adsorption and degradation of four parent sulfonamide antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine sulfamethazine sulfadimethoxine and one human metabolite n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole together referred as sas were investigated biochar derived from cotton straw was applied as adsorbent for sas and catalyst for h2o2 results showed that the adsorption of sas was inhibited in urine compared with that in phosphate buffer solution bicarbonate in urine placed major influence langmuir isotherm model well described the adsorption process in both buffer and urine matrices adsorption and desorption rates were estimated by a kinetic model which well fitted the removal of sas from aqueous phase at various biochar doses the adsorption of sas on biochar was due to multiple forces in which van der waals forces and hydrophobicity played major roles in distinguishing the sorption behavior of different sas to destruct the sas h2o2 was added with biochar except for n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole all the parent sas can be degraded in urine matrix carbonate radical produced from the activation of peroxymonocarbonate by biochar was proposed to be the major contributing reactive species in biochar h2o2 system in urine

places a major threat on the ecosystem as well as human health wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been regarded as an important source for pharmaceuticals in the natural aquatic environments liu and wong 2013 among all the municipal wastewater streams entering into wwtps human urine accounts for less than 1 by volume but contains pharmaceuticals at 2 3 orders of magnitude higher concentrations eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology 2007 winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b separation of urine from other wastewater streams namely source separated urine has gained increasing attentions because it is expected to be more effective for pharmaceutical removal in source separated urine than other conventional domestic wastewater moreover because urine contributes more than 75 total nitrogen and 50 total phosphorus in wastewater recovering nutrients from urine as a new resource recovery strategy winker et al 2008a also requires elimination of pharmaceuticals from urine multiple processes including nano filtration membranes pronk et al 2006 anion exchange resin landry and boyer 2017 electrodialysis pronk et al 2007 struvite precipitation kemacheevakul et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2015 have been investigated for removing pharmaceuticals from urine however most of the investigated methods require extensive energy material input or upgrading infrastructures and thus hinder their application a more cost effective process will better facilitate the application of removing pharmaceuticals from their source biochar is a carbonaceous material which can be produced from pyrolysis of different sources of biomass including plant materials and wastes sludges manures litters sediment etc cha et al 2016 qambrani et al 2017 rosales et al 2017 considering cost and energy saving carbon sequestration as well as solid waste reuse biochar is regarded as a promising alternative adsorbent for wastewater treatment biochar has been proved to be effective for removing varieties of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics wu et al 2013 yao et al 2012a antiepileptic drugs chen et al 2017 anti inflammatory drugs lin et al 2017 antidepressants anxiolytic and antihistaminic drugs calisto et al 2015 in addition to conventional wastewater treatment system the application of biochar has also been proposed to unconventional systems such as stormwater infiltration system ulrich et al 2015 reclaimed water desalination concentrate lin et al 2017 and other environmental compartment such as soil vithanage et al 2014 although it is expected that human urine is a promising matrix for effective pharmaceutical removal few studies have been carried out applying biochar solanki and boyer have investigated the removal of several pharmaceuticals excluding antibiotics in synthetic human urine using biochar but without including adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies solanki and boyer 2017 the impact of urine components on pharmaceutical removal has not been investigated in addition to adsorption capacity biochar has been reported to activate h2o2 or persulfate to produce highly reactive species which can degrade organic pollutants fang et al 2014 2015 however so far few studies have been conducted for removal of pharmaceuticals by radical nonradical reactive species generated from biochar activation and the technique has not been investigated in source separated urine matrix sulfonamide antibiotics sas are among the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water systems bu et al 2013 li et al 2017 zhang and li 2011 adsorption of sulfamethoxazole smx calisto et al 2015 jung et al 2013 wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 sulfamethazine smt peng et al 2016 vithanage et al 2014 sulfadiazine sdz peng et al 2016 and sulfapyridine inyang et al 2015 xie et al 2014 using biochar or modified activated biochar has been reported however urine matrix is very different from conventional wastewater in terms of ph and major components thus may pose different impact on adsorption process moreover in urine treatment metabolites of the pharmaceuticals should also be considered for example only 9 5 of sulfamethoxazole was excreted in unchanged form while most was excreted as metabolites vree et al 1978 the objective of this study therefore was to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of the removal of antibiotics and human metabolite by biochar catalyzed system in urine matrix specifically the adsorption and degradation of four parent sas and the major human metabolite of smx were investigated considering the relatively long operating period hydrolysis of urea in fresh urine referred to the urine that just left human body will highly likely occur therefore hydrolyzed urine referred to the urine that the original composition has changed due to storage was chosen in this study this work presents sas adsorption isotherm kinetics and mechanisms on biochar in buffer and hydrolyzed urine matrices chemical destruction of sas by biochar activated h2o2 was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smt sulfadimethoxine sdm and n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx were purchased from sigma aldrich inc st louis mo all the five compounds are referred as sas whereas the parent sas represents smx sdz smt and sdm structures and chemical properties of antibiotics are shown in table 1 and table s1 h2o2 30 w w was purchased from aladdine shanghai china hplc grade methanol was purchased from cnw düsseldorf germany all other chemicals and reagents used were in analytical grade or higher reagent grade deionized di water resistivity 18 mω cm was prepared from a nanopure water purification system veolia paris france biochar was produced from pyrolysis of shredded cotton stalks which were air dried under 80 c and milled to pass through a 40 mesh screen the pyrolysis condition was 350 c with the absence of oxygen 2 2 adsorption experiment the batch adsorption experiments were carried out in 10 ml glass vials with screw caps reaction solutions were prepared with 10 μm sa in 10 ml of synthetic urine or phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 9 the synthetic urine composition has been described in previous literature zhang et al 2015 and shown in table 2 due to hydrolysis of urea high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen 0 5 m and bicarbonate 0 25 m were present in hydrolyzed urine which also resulted in elevated ph ph 9 pbs with 5 mm phosphate at ph 9 was employed as a baseline matrix the vials were kept in dark and shaken at 220 rpm 25 c for kinetic study biochar was applied at 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 g l 1 respectively and aliquots were taken at 1 5 10 24 120 h for isotherm study two more biochar doses 0 7 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 were added to provide more accurate results samples were shaken for 120 h to ensure equilibrium before analysis the reaction solutions were filtered with 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filters individual sas were incubated without biochar under each corresponding condition as the control samples nacl was applied to study the impact of ionic strength on adsorption to investigate the impact of major urine components on adsorption bicarbonate and ammonia were added separately with 1 g l 1 biochar and 10 μm sas concentrations of the components were the same as those in synthetic urine solution solution ph was adjusted by concentrated naoh and h3po4 solutions to ph 9 negligible change of ph was observed over the entire contact period for both adsorption and degradation experiments each experiment was conducted by at least duplicates freundlich eq 1 and langmuir eq 2 isotherm model were used to fit the adsorption data 1 q e k f c e 1 n 2 q e q m b s a c e 1 b s a c e where q e is equilibrium adsorbent phase concentration of sa in μmol g 1 k f is freundlich adsorption capacity parameter in μmol g 1 μm 1 1 n 1 n is freundlich adsorption intensity parameter c e is equilibrium aqueous phase concentration of sa in μm q m is langmuir maximum adsorption capacity in μmol g 1 and b sa is the langmuir adsorption constant of sa in μm 1 to better compare the parameters for different sas the amount of sa was quantified using mole based unit μmol instead of mass based unit mg on the basis of langmuir isotherm assumption that the adsorbates and adsorbent surface sites interact as a reversible chemical equilibrium the overall adsorption process of sas onto biochar in pbs and urine matrices was expressed using the following equation 3 s a a q b c v s k s a k s a 1 s a b c where sa aq is the aqueous phase concentration of sas in m bc vs is the vacant sites concentration of biochar in the solution in m sa bc is the concentration of sas adsorbed onto biochar in m k sa in m 1 h 1 and k sa 1 in h 1 are the adsorption and desorption rates respectively therefore at t 0 bc vs biochar dose q m and sa aq 10 μm 2 3 degradation experiment to chemically destruct sas 1 mm h2o2 was added to both pbs and urine solution with 1 g l 1 biochar the samples were shaken for 1 h and then prepared for analysis samples after reactions were treated in two ways extracting agent was added to recover both the residual sas that adsorbed on biochar and remained in aqueous phase solution containing methanol nahco3 9 1 reason for adding nahco3 is elucidated in 3 4 was applied as extracting agent and was added to samples with equal volume after 30 min extraction samples were filtered and analyzed by hplc recovery were 95 80 89 82 and 90 for 10 μm smx sdz sdm smt and nsmx respectively 2 4 quantification of sas a waters e2695 hplc system waters milford ma usa equipped with a uv vis detector and a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm was used to monitor the loss of the sas gradient elution was used with 0 1 phosphoric acid and methanol as mobile phase the portion of methanol stayed at 10 for the first minute then ramped to 50 at 6 min and decreased to 10 from 10 min to 15 min the peak area of sas was quantified at 254 nm 2 5 characterization of biochar information of surface area and pore size of biochar was obtained from a surface area and pore distribution analyzer v sorb 2800tp gold app instruments corporation china fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were performed to qualitatively analyze the functional groups of adsorbent vector 22 tga bruker optics germany with the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the point of zero charge pzc was measured by a ph meter s220 sevencompact mettler toledo shanghai 2 6 estimation of sa properties the pka values of the secondary amine groups on sas were obtained from previous literature babić et al 2007 bonvin et al 2013 solubility of the neutral form of sas was estimated by ecosar v1 11 program the apparent solubility of sas was calculated and detailed in section 3 3 the octanol water distribution coefficient kow was determined experimentally by mixing equal amount of octanol with water solution containing 20 μm individual sas the water phase was buffered with formic acid at ph 3 5 molar refractivity and electronegativity were estimated by chembio3d ultra v12 0 3 result and discussion 3 1 biochar characterization biochar is proposed as a promising low cost adsorbent because of production at relatively low temperature compared with activated carbon in order to demonstrate the performance of low cost biochar on the removal of pharmaceuticals in urine biochar derived from cotton straw produced at 350 c was used in this study it is also worthwhile noting that biochar produced at low temperature retains more nutrient such as total nitrogen than those produced at higher temperatures thus potentially benefits future application as soil amendment shinogi and kanri 2003 yu et al 2013 the properties of the biochar derived from cotton straw are shown in table 3 generally adsorption capacity is considered positively related to the specific surface area and pore volumes therefore comparing with the biochar materials through pyrolysis at comparable temperatures the properties of the biochar derived from cotton straw shown in table 3 was better than peanut shell chen et al 2017 pepper wood sugarcane bagasse and hickory wood yao et al 2012b sediment wu et al 2013 tea waste rajapaksha et al 2014 rice straw wheat straw sun et al 2016 and coconut shell solanki and boyer 2017 but slightly worse than biochar produced from pine wood related materials jung et al 2013 xie et al 2014 the ftir result fig s1 indicated that hydroxyl carbonyl and aromatic moieties dominated on the surface of biochar indicating interactions with pharmaceuticals through h bond and π π interaction may likely occur the point of zero charge was measure to be around 7 4 fig s2 which suggested that the surface of biochar was negatively charged in pbs ph 9 and urine matrix 3 2 adsorption of sas in pbs and urine 3 2 1 kinetics the concentrations of sas in aqueous phase versus time are shown in fig 1 control groups showed that sa concentrations remained unchanged without biochar data not shown confirming that the decreasing concentration of sas in aqueous phase was due to interaction with biochar sas in samples with biochar for 120 h were extracted by methanolic solution and showed that degradation did not occur sa adsorption occurred rapidly within the first 24 h with 0 5 5 g l 1 biochar from 24 h to 120 h the adsorption rates significantly decreased and equilibrium was reached for solutions with 0 1 g l 1 biochar equilibrium was attained within 1 h while the removal was only around 10 with the increase of biochar doses the removal of sas from aqueous phase significantly increased fig 1 indeed the overall removal is higher with higher adsorbent dose due to increasing adsorption sites for the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto biochar time to reach adsorption equilibrium may vary from less than 30 min e g calisto et al 2015 to several days e g wu et al 2013 due to different properties of adsorbent and adsorbate in our study 120 h was deemed sufficient to reach apparent equilibrium therefore 120 h was chosen for following isotherm study independent with biochar doses overall removal of sas in pbs ranked as sdm smt nsmx smx sdz for example the removal ratios at 1 g l 1 biochar were 71 74 68 49 and 39 for sdm smt nsmx smx and sdz respectively in urine similar ranking was observed whereas the removal was inhibited to different extent compared with in pbs fig s3 inhibition was negligible when biochar doses were low because only small amount of sa can be adsorbed even when there was no competitor when biochar doses were relatively high inhibition was also limited because adsorption sites were sufficient for both sas and urine components that will adsorbed onto biochar strongest inhibition urine vs pbs was observed with 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 biochar for each sa 3 2 2 isotherm the adsorption isotherms for five sas in both pbs and urine are shown in fig 2 generally the sorption data were well described by both freundlich and langmuir models shown in fig 2 fig s4 for most conditions langmuir model presented relatively higher regression coefficients r2 table s2 indicating the overall adsorption process followed reversible monolayer sorption mechanism therefore langmuir isotherm model was selected for subsequent analysis and the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 q m values are almost the same for all sas indicating sorption sites for different sas were likely very similar the subtle differences of q m values for pbs and urine matrix indicated urine components did not irreversibly adsorb onto biochar except for sdz the abnormal q m value for sdz in urine may indicate a different mechanism from other sas and further study is needed q m value of this study was comparable with the values reported in previous literature for biochar produced under similar condition from different materials e g 2 79 mg g 1 10 04 μmol g 1 1 39 mg g 1 5 0 μmol g 1 and 5 75 mg g 1 20 68 μmol g 1 for smt with tea waste biochar rajapaksha et al 2014 wheat biochar and maize straw biochar jia et al 2018 4 21 mg g 1 16 64 μmol g 1 and 6 75 mg g 1 26 68 μmol g 1 for smx with rice biochar and wheat biochar sun et al 2016 in pbs b sa values ranked as sdm nsmx smt sdz smx in urine the ranking was sdm smt sdz nsmx smx in addition urine matrix significantly decreased b sa for all the sas from 1 7 times smt to 7 1 times nsmx table 1 the decrease indicates that urine components may compete with sas adsorbing onto biochar same as q m values b sa for sdz in urine was abnormal and even higher than in pbs the difference among sas in adsorption kinetic and equilibrium was likely resulted from different chemical properties of sas which was further discussed in section 3 3 3 2 3 modeling of adsorption process applying matlab simbiology application in matlab program k sa and k sa 1 in eqn 3 were obtained by fitting the data at 1 g l 1 biochar in pbs or in urine all sorption rates are shown in table 1 the adsorption rates k sa of sas in pbs matrix ranks as sdm sdz smt nsmx smx whereas smx has the highest desorption rate k sa 1 followed by sdz smt nsmx and sdm in urine matrix sdm and nsmx adsorbed faster than other sas whereas the desorption rates ranked as smx nsmx sdz smt sdm generally both the adsorption and desorption rates of most sas increased in urine matrix indicating less time was required to reach adsorption equilibrium applying the estimated sorption rates the decrease of aqueous concentrations of sas with the presence of various doses of biochar were then simulated and plotted in fig 1 overall the model has good agreement with the experimental data at various biochar doses to further evaluate this model adsorption experiment in pbs was conducted by mixing five sas at 10 μm with 1 g l 1 biochar the aqueous concentrations of sas were measured after 3 day adsorption as shown in fig s5 the model successfully predicted the removal of all five sas from aqueous phase which also confirmed the hypothesis that all five sas adsorbed on similar sites on biochar thus competing with each other for the same adsorption sites when co existing in solution the adsorption rates of sas represented the energy barrier which was required to overcome for sas to adsorb onto biochar surface higher adsorption rates suggested lower energy barrier and higher attraction force as reported in previous studies the adsorption of sas onto biochar can be resulted from π π interactions coulombic forces hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and hydrophobic effects teixidó et al 2011 in pbs matrix the difference between individual sas may likely resulted from different molecular properties urine components altered the surface properties of biochar leading to the change of sorption rates therefore in order to elucidate the mechanisms of overall sorption process the effects of sa properties and individual urine components were evaluated and discussed in the following sections 3 3 effect of pharmaceutical properties the sas investigated in this work possessed benzene ring and negative charges on the secondary amine nitrogen at ph 9 which are likely important interaction moieties with biochar surface indeed sas may interact with biochar surface through coulombic forces of amine groups and π π interactions of benzene ring teixidó et al 2011 in addition hydrophobicity of sas may also play important role due to favorable partitioning of hydrophobic compounds to the aromatic carbon riched biochar surface from aqueous phase therefore key chemical properties including octanol water partitioning coefficient kow solubility acidity constant pka electronegativity and molar refractivity of all five sas were estimated or recited from previous literature shown in table 1 in order to correlate chemical properties to the different sorption behavior of sas the ranking of pka values of the secondary amine on sas can be roughly considered as the electron donating tendency of the side structures indeed generally sas with lower pka have more negative charge on the secondary amine nitrogen table 1 suggesting lower tendency to interact with the negatively charged biochar surface however neither pka nor electronegativity correlated with any kinetic parameters i e b sa q m k sa k sa 1 therefore interactions due to electron interactions were not major forces distinguishing the sorption behavior of sas the van der waals forces between adsorbate and adsorbent can roughly correlated with molar refractivity ghose and crippen 1987 the molar refractivity of five sas was estimated by the chembio3d ultra v12 0 and shown in table 1 sdm has the highest molar refractivity followed by smt nsmx smx and sdz when plotting molar refractivity with b sa values in pbs fig s6 a good linear correlation was obtained indicating that van der waals forces play an important role in distinguishing the adsorption equilibrium of different sas onto biochar however van der waals forces cannot explain the kinetic differences of sas indeed poor correlations were obtained when plotting molar refractivity with ksa or ksa 1 the adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds onto carboneous materials such as activated carbon has been linked with their partitioning behavior between water and water immiscible organic solvent delgado et al 2012 kow has been widely applied to explain sorption process as for ionizable organic compounds the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient d was applied in order to take account speciation of compounds jung et al 2013 for sas d can be expressed as 4 d s a 0 o c t s a o c t s a 0 w a t e r s a w a t e r where sa0 oct is the concentration of the neutral species present in the octanol phase sa oct is the concentration of the ionized species present in the octanol phase sa0 water is the concentration of the neutral species in the water phase and sa water is the concentration of the ionized species in the water phase the relation between d and kow can be expressed as 5 d k o w 1 1 10 p h p k a k o w 1 1 1 10 p h p k a k o w 1 1 10 p h p k a where kow is the octanol water partitioning coefficient of the neutral species k ow is the octanol water partitioning coefficient of the fully ionized species for hydrophobic species the ionized species is much more soluble in water thus k ow is much lower than kow therefore d is approximately a function of kow and ph applying the kow values measured in this study the d values of sas were calculated and shown in table 1 the same assumptions were also applied to the estimation of solubility therefore the apparent solubility at ph 9 was governed by the solubility limit of neutral species eq 6 6 s a p p s 0 h k a h where sapp is the apparent solubility in m s0 is the solubility limit of neutral form in m attempts were made to correlated hydrophobicity related properties i e kow d s0 sapp with sorption constants i e b sa q m k sa k sa 1 by plotting each property with sorption constants fig s7 s11 we found that 1 d values had linear relation with b sa in pbs with the exception of nsmx 2 the desorption rates of sas in both pbs and urine increased with the increase of apparent solubility with the exception of nsmx therefore hydrophobicity was crucial in distinguishing different sas the distribution coefficient d represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and organic phase higher d values suggests lower energy state in aqueous solution b sa represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and on biochar surface as shown in fig s7 good linear relation was obtained between d and b sa for smx sdz sdm and smt expect for nsmx this results suggested that free energy values of sas on biochar surface likely have the same trend as those in organic phase on the other hand water solubility also represents the difference between free energy in aqueous phase and solid state however poor correlation was obtained between water solubility and b sa indeed the free energy of solid state represents bond interactions other than solvation effects therefore water solubility was more suitable to describe sorption rates which were governed by bond interactions as shown in fig s8 s11 there is good correlation between water solubility and k sa and k sa 1 for all sas expect nsmx the unusual behavior of nsmx suggested the importance of aniline moiety on the sorption process 3 4 effect of urine components the impact of major individual urine components was tested by spiking corresponding amount of components into pbs with the presence of 1 g l 1 biochar the aqueous concentrations of sas were then measured after 120 h adsorption process inhibition value was calculated using the following equation 7 inhibition s a a q i s a t s a a q p b s s a t 1 s a a q p b s s a t where sa aq i is the aqueous phase concentration of sa with urine component i in μm sa aq pbs is the aqueous phase concentration of sa in pbs in μm sa t is the total concentration of sa spiked in the solution in μm due to the presence of high concentrations of ionic species the ionic strength effect on the adsorption of sas was first evaluated by adding additional amount of nacl into pbs 5 mm to achieve the same ionic strength as urine matrix i e 0 48 m as shown in fig 3 the increase of ionic strength by nacl posed little impact on the sorption equilibrium suggesting the different sorption behavior in pbs and urine was not due to ionic strength difference total ammonia nitrogen tan and carbonate species were dominant species in urine matrix the impact of them was investigated in solutions containing 0 5 m tan and 0 25 m bicarbonate separately the solution ph was adjusted to 9 as shown in fig 3 tan showed minimal impact on the adsorption equilibrium for sas for sdm and nsmx the addition of tan even slightly increased the sorption amount on biochar however bicarbonate greatly inhibited the adsorption of all five sas ionic species such as chloride ammonium and bicarbonate likely affect the sorption of ionizable organic compounds on biochar kah et al 2017 on the basis of pzc value 7 4 of the biochar applied in this study most of the biochar surface possesses negative charges at ph 9 meanwhile all sas were predominantly 98 in their anionic form because the solution ph was much higher than their pka values table 1 a negative charge assisted h bond cahb x h y was likely one of the major interactions between sas and biochar at ph 9 as postulated by teixido et al teixidó et al 2011 indeed the formation of so2n h o likely occurred through the interaction between negatively charged so2nh group on sas and surface carboxyl or hydroxyl group on biochar due to close pka pzc values li et al 2013 it was suggested that carboxylate or phenolate anions tend to form cahbs li et al 2015 analogously bicarbonate likely interacted with biochar surface through cahbs therefore competed with so2nh group for biochar sorption sites due to the incapability to form cahbs chloride and ammonia ammonium ions posed much less impact on the sorption of sas on biochar compared with bicarbonate the sorption of sas was inhibited to different extent by bicarbonate approximately following the order of molar refractivity fig 3 and table 1 which suggested that both van der waals forces and h bonds were major interactions between sas and biochar based on the proposed sorption mechanisms an extraction solution containing methanol and bicarbonate was used to accelerate desorption of sas from biochar and promote extraction recovery 3 5 degradation of sas with biochar h2o2 before biochar can be applied as soil amendment the contaminants adsorbed on it requires chemical destruction to avoid secondary pollution based on previously reported research biochar may activate h2o2 and generate hydroxyl radical fang et al 2014 hydroxyl radical is capable of degrading various pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidizing power and low selectivity buxton et al 1988 in this study h2o2 was added to both pbs and urine matrix to investigate the degradation of sas with the presence of biochar removal was quantified by total extraction by methanolic solution data were shown in fig 4 after 1 h the degradation of sas was not observed in pbs which implied that the biochar applied in this study cannot activate h2o2 to generate reactive species e g hydroxyl radical that can degrade sas at ph 9 or the reactive species were scavenged immediately after generated however in urine matrix smx sdz sdm and smt were degraded by approximately 60 within 1 h whereas the degradation of nsmx was not observed control experiments have shown that sas were stable with the presence of h2o2 in urine matrix without biochar data not shown thus the involvement of biochar was crucial for the degradation of parent sas the degradation of sas in urine by biochar h2o2 can be explained by two possible mechanisms a h2o2 was activated by biochar producing intermediate s which cannot degrade sas but reacted with urine component s yielding secondary reactive species and b the interaction between urine components and h2o2 generated intermediate s which cannot degrade sas but be activated by biochar yielding secondary reactive species to test these two hypotheses the decomposition of h2o2 by biochar was monitored with and without urine components as shown in fig 5 h2o2 was stable with biochar in pbs suggesting the biochar cannot activate h2o2 i e hypothesis a was incorrect among all conditions tested h2o2 was only decomposed by biochar with the presence of bicarbonate the reaction between h2o2 and bicarbonate produces peroxymonocarbonate eq 8 richardson et al 2000 preliminary test using dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method cai et al 2017 showed significant increase of absorbance in h2o2 solution with bicarbonate indicating the formation of peroxymonocarbonate peroxymonocarbonate has been reported to produce carbonate radical by activation by transition metals pi et al 2018 similar activation pathway may likely occur that biochar decomposed peroxymonocarbonate to produce carbonate radical which degraded sas in urine eq 9 8 hco 3 h 2 o 2 hco 4 h 2 o 9 hco 4 e co 3 oh activated by biochar according to our previous studies zhang et al 2015 2016a nsmx has similar reactivity toward hydroxyl radical as smx however smx reacts with carbonate radical at ph 9 with second order rate constant of 2 68 108 m 1 s 1 while nsmx shows much lower reactivity 1 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 amino group substituted benzene derivative was speculated to be the reason because of its high reactivity toward carbonate radical zhang et al 2015 second order rate constants of sdz and smt toward carbonate radical were also previously determined as 2 78 108 m 1 s 1 and 4 37 108 m 1 s 1 comparable to the rate constant of smx zhang et al 2016b although the reactivity of sdm toward carbonate radical has not been measured it is highly likely at the same level as other parent sas due to the structural similarity e g amino group substituted benzene moiety therefore the obvious degradation efficiency difference between nsmx and other sas suggested that carbonate radical may play an important role in degrading the sas because parent sas are probably the major scavengers for carbonate radical parent sas were degraded by similar level about 60 shown in fig 4 regardless of their second order rate constants with carbonate radical the decomposition of h2o2 by biochar was reported in a number of retrospective literature fang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 however some types of biochar have very low capability to activate h2o2 the results in this section demonstrate that a biochar which cannot decompose h2o2 activated h2o2 yielding reactive species with the presence of bicarbonate considering the application of biochar in urine and other high strength wastewater this activation pathway may provide alternative biochar based catalysis system used for pharmaceutical removal 4 conclusion the adsorption of four parent sas and the major human metabolite of smx on biochar derived from cotton straw was investigated in pbs and synthetic urine matrix generally the adsorption reached equilibrium within around 24 h with the presence of biochar from 0 1 g l 1 to 5 g l 1 the sorption isotherm followed langmiur model by fitting experimental data the maximum sorption sites of biochar was estimated around 10 μmol g 1 for all sas in both pbs and urine matrix a kinetic model was developed which successfully described the adsorption behavior of all sas presence individually or co existing in solutions urine matrix increased both the adsorption and desorption rates resulting shorter time to reach sorption equilibrium the adsorption of sas on biochar was due to multiple forces in which van der waals forces and hydrophobicity played major roles in distinguishing the sorption behavior of different sas expect for nsmx in urine matrix bicarbonate was the major competitor for sas on the sorption in order to destruct sas h2o2 was added to create biochar h2o2 catalytic system the degradation of sas expect for nsmx were only observed in urine matrix which was likely attributed to the reactions involving bicarbonate overall biocarbonate in urine played a critical role in both adsorption process and biochar h2o2 system the major human metabolite of smx nsmx behaved differently from the parent sas highlighting the importance of investigating both parent antibiotics and their metabolites in future studies

19237,ultraviolet uv irradiation has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes but its influence on the formation of disinfection by products dbps especially the emerging iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during post chloramination remains unclear this study evaluated the impact of low pressure lp uv treatment on the formation of i thms during post chloramination through two pathways the first pathway is through the transition of dom structure and composition during uv chloramination resulting significant increase of i thm formation with increasing uv dosage in different dissolved organic matter dom containing water 49 7 90 5 at 1160 mj cm2 with the application of excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac we found that i thm formation in uv chloraminated water correlated well with two ratios of three parafac humic like components c3 c2 and c1 c2 r2 0 958 1 000 suggesting that the ratios of fluorescent components can be used as reliable indicators for i thm formation moreover the shift in these fluorescent components is crucial for i thm formation during uv chloramination another pathway for uv irradiation to affect i thm formation during post chloramination is through the transformation of iodine species large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 can be generated directly in the mixed iodine system by uv light leading to the enhancement of iodine utilization factor iuf up to 0 040 after post chloramination these results suggest that uv application to dom containing water may induce changes in organic

disinfectants postigo and richardson 2014 richardson et al 2007 in recent years the formation of emerging toxic iodinated dbps i dbps has raised great concern for water utilities krasner et al 2006 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 because i dbps have been demonstrated to be more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmental toxic in mammalian cell assays than their chlorinated and brominated analogs plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 preliminary studies indicated that iodinated trihalomethanes i thms can also cause bad taste and odor problems due to their low threshold concentrations as low as 0 02 0 5 μg l barceló 2012 hansson et al 1987 therefore further concerns should be paid on i thm formation in drinking water treatment processes naturally occurring i iodate io3 and iodinated organic compounds have been identified as dominant iodine sources in aquatic environment which may undergo transformation to one another and thereby affecting i thm formation gong and zhang 2013 hansen et al 2011 recently low pressure lp ultraviolet uv irradiation is a promising alternative to achieve disinfection in drinking water treatment plants dwtps because of its high efficacy of inactivating waterborne pathogens uv irradiation accompanied with another disinfectant for secondary disinfection such as commonly used chloramine nh2cl for its long term stability is required for maintaining disinfection efficacy in water seidel et al 2005 shah et al 2011 however chloramination of i containing water might result in significant formation of i dbps involving the oxidation of i

compounds and usually act as the principal dbp precursors in the disinfection step with high heterogeneity leenheer and croué 2003 although the heterogeneous dom structures make their transition behavior upon water treatment process very complicated it can be resolved by applying advanced dom characterization methods fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac can successfully separate independent fluorescent components from the bulk dom for quantitative analysis helping to track different behaviors of dom constitutes in various water treatment systems phong and jin 2015 zhang et al 2016b a few studies explored the impact of uv pretreatment with a secondary disinfectant on dbp formation and most of the past work focused on the regulated dbp formation dotson et al 2010 liu et al 2006 reckhow et al 2010 reported an increase in trichloronitromethane formation after medium pressure mp uv irradiation 40 140 mj cm2 followed by chlorination compared with chlorination alone in nitrate containing water the results indicate that uv pretreatment can affect the formation of dbps through reacting with inorganic ions another possibility of uv exposure to alter dbp formation is through the transition of dom structure to cause sequential reactivity towards disinfectants former studies have confirmed that the content and type of dom affect dbp formation greatly during disinfection gallard and von 2002 liu et al 2006 magnuson et al 2002 found that uv irradiation 20 140 mj cm2 changed the mass spectra towards lower masses causing alterations in reactivity of organic matter to chlorination so far there is limited information about the impact of uv irradiation and subsequent chloramination uv chloramination on the formation of emerging i thms which is substantial to realize i thm formation when applying uv disinfection to source water moreover a survey of utilities reported that some dwtps applied higher uv dosages than the original designed values dotson et al 2012 therefore the investigation of high uv dosage is also urgent the primary aim of this research was to clarify the impacts of uv irradiation on the formation of i thms during post chloramination through two pathways including transition of dom structure and transformation of iodine species humic acid ha fulvic acid fa raw water and filtered water were adopted as the different dom matrices the changes of dom characteristics including uv absorbance molecular weight distribution mwd fluorescence and the relationship between

these five water sources were distinctively different and were summarized in table s1 2 3 uv irradiation system the uv irradiation experiments were performed in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china equipped with two parts the quartz reactors and the uv lamps a 36 w lp uv lamp with a quartz sleeve was fixed in the center of the apparatus to generate quasi parallel uv beam at the wavelength 254 nm the setup of this uv system was displayed in fig s1 the uv intensity of lp uv was monitored with an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory beijing normal university at 254 nm the ascertained uv intensity was 0 97 mw cm2 and the uv dosage ranged from 0 to 1160 mj cm2 in this study the irradiation time was defined by dividing the desired uv dosage mj cm2 by the uv intensity tian et al 2014 yuan et al 2009 2 4 uv treatment and subsequent chloramination uv irradiation experiments were conducted using 50 ml dom containing solutions prepared at designed doc concentrations and spiked with a desired concentration of i the ph of solutions was adjusted to 7 0 using small volumes of h2so4 and naoh and buffered with 5 mm phosphate then the solutions were rapidly poured into the sealed quartz reactors equipped with stir bars to ensure homogeneous reaction the quartz reactors were set vertically at a fixed distance from the lamp and maintained at 25 1 c at designed irradiation time each test solution was withdrawn and a small volume of chloramine was added to achieve the desired concentration at ph 7 0 experimental samples in duplicate were immediately incubated under headspace free conditions in 40 ml glass screw cap amber vials with ptfe lined septa and stored at 25 1 c in the dark for 24 h then 10 ml of each solution was quenched using na2s2o3 with 20 excess of the initial nh2cl concentration and extracted using mtbe immediately to avoid any chance of i thm decomposition the fluorescence and gel permeation chromatograph gpc measurements were also performed using the quenched solutions as soon as possible additionally for investigating the conversion of iodine species io3 and i initial concentrations were expanded to 40 and 160 μm respectively to get obvious phenomenon and the signals higher than the detection limits of i hoi and io3 see section 2 6 2 5 eem parafac analysis fluorescence eem data of dom were measured by a fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba jobin yvon edison nj usa excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were set at 240 550 nm with 5 nm intervals and at 280 550

approximately 20 c to minimize temperature influence a 290 nm optical filter was utilized to restrict second order rayleigh scattering phong and jin 2015 the final fluorescence intensities were normalized by using a raman integrated area of the corresponding milli q water more than 80 samples were collected including control samples uv alone and uv chloramine treated samples following stedmon and bro 2008 tutorial the eem signals were decomposed into appropriate components by using parafac modeling with matlabr2014a and the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk 2 6 analytical

with the detection limit of 0 1 mg c l uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and i3 concentration of the samples were determined using a spectrophotometer sq 4802 unico shanghai china at absorbance wavelengths of 254 and 351 nm respectively ye et al 2012 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva is defined as the ratio of uv254 to doc which has been widely used as a parameter of aromatic content within dom weishaar et al 2003 the mwds of dom sources were analyzed using a lc 10ad gpc equipped with a rid 10 a detector shimadzu japan br concentration was detected by an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 usa with a conductivity detector and the detection limit was 20 μg l io3 i hoi and i2 were analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters usa furnished with an xterra ms c18 column and a uv detector according to our previous study zhang et al 2016c because hoi and i2 can both quickly react with the quenching reagent phenol to form 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol the concentrations of hoi and i2 cannot be quantified separately bichsel and von gunten 2000 consequently the concentration of iodophenol is the sum of hoi and i2 the injection volume was 10 μl and the detection limits of io3 i and hoi i2 were 10 5 and 10 μg i l respectively the method for quantifying i thms was modified from the usepa method 551 1 munch and hautman 1995 in our previous research ye et al 2014 samples were extracted using mtbe and the extracts were analyzed by a gas chromatography gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm film thickness j w usa the detection limits of chcl2i chclbri chbr2i chcli2 chbri2 and chi3 were 0 10 0 09 0 10 0 08 0 10 and 0 08 μg

conducted using spss statistics version 22 0 to determine the significance between the data sets p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of uv dosage on i thm formation with different dom species fig 1 displays the variations of i thm formation after uv irradiation with different dosages and sequential chloramination of 5 dom containing water it is obvious that uv irradiation significantly enhanced i thm formation in all cases compared to corresponding cases using only chloramination i thm formation increased with increasing uv dosage and were up to 49 7 90 5 in different dom sources pretreated with 1160 mj cm2 uv compared to the same samples without uv treatment when applying uv dosage of 70 mj cm2 higher percentage increases of i thm formation were obtained in real water rw and fw than those in dom synthetic water fig 1 which is in agreement with the previous reported results liu et al 2012 the reason may be due to less aromatic structures low suva of real water in table s1 that can be induced easily to generate more reactive sites at low uv dosage 70 mj cm2 however at high uv dosage 1160 mj cm2 ha i presented the greatest increase of i thm formation up to 90 5 among the 5 dom containing water this is presumably ascribable to the existence of large amounts of condensed aromatic and unsaturated content in ha i high suva of ha i in table s1 which can provide more activated aromatic structures at high uv dosage lyon et al 2012 moreover only small amounts of chclbri and chbri2 were measured in rw and fw due to the presence of low br concentration below detection limit table s1 it is noteworthy that fa presents the highest i thm formation while fw presents the lowest one regardless of uv dosage this indicates that i thm yields do not correlate well with the suva values of the dom containing water which is inconsistent with the study of jones et al 2012 that i is more easily incorporated into low suva dom to generate i thms it could be explained by the great different characteristics of the 3 synthetic ha i ha ii and fa and 2 real water rw and fw with the wide range of suva values 1 2 7 3 l mg m in our study compared with the study of jones et al 2012 using only real water with the small range of suva values 1 8 4 2 l mg m this suggests that suva value cannot be used as an appropriate indicator for the estimation of i thm formation considering high heterogeneity of source water from fig s2 no changes of i concentration iodine source were observed in both milli q and synthetic water during uv treatment therefore the enhancement of i thm formation could be contributed to the uv induced alteration of organic precursors therefore it is essential to seek other dom properties that is properly related to i thm formation accordingly different characteristics of dom are investigated to clarify the structural transformation during uv irradiation and uv chloramination and the results will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 changes in doc and uv absorbance during uv irradiation doc is a universal indicator for organic matter content in water uv254 is a common parameter of the aromaticity of dom and can be used as a surrogate for doc in aqueous environment phong and jin 2015 weishaar et al 2003 thus the changes of doc and uv254 during uv irradiation of 5 dom containing water are illustrated in fig 2 five dom sources all displayed negligible changes in doc at ph 7 0 in the studied uv dosages which is in agreement with none or slight removal of doc under uva and uvc irradiation reported previously phong and jin 2016 however uv254 displayed an obvious decreasing trend over the irradiation time i e 6 4 29 6 for the experimental conditions in fig 2 b this phenomenon suggests that the uv absorbing substances and or chromophores in dom which are mainly composed of large sized aromatic molecules can be rapidly broken down into smaller sized non aromatic by products sanly et al 2007 also the removal efficiency of uv254 6 4 29 6 was much higher than that of doc 2 2 4 7 which indicates that the aromatic chromophores in dom were preferentially degraded and or some aromatic structures were partially converted to non uv absorbing compounds during uv irradiation jin et al 2011 the photoproducts of dom may contain organic acids alcohols aldehydes and some other non aromatic structures which are associated with dbp formation during post chloramination pullin et al 2004 sanly et al 2007 3 3 variation of dom structure during uv irradiation and uv chloramine processes 3 3 1 fluorescent components identified by using parafac three different fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 were successfully decomposed by parafac modeling on the eem dataset of all samples and the results are presented in fig 3 the number of components was determined based on residual analysis fig s3 a and split half validation fig s3 b component 1 c1 displayed a peak at ex em of 350 nm 476 nm while c2 had a dominant and a secondary peak at wavelengths of 315 nm 520 nm ex em and 375 nm 520 nm ex em respectively c3 exhibited a peak at ex em of 325 nm 418 nm based on the eem peak locations previously reported table s2 and the origin of dom used in this study all of these three identified components may be assigned to humic like components baghoth et al 2011 coble 2007 murphy et al 2011 however as indicated by huang et al 2018 the component exhibiting a wide range of emission and excitation wavelengths has the characteristics of large molecular weight mw complex structure and more aromatic moieties therefore the c2 fluorophores in this study might contain more condensed and polymerized structures with molecular size larger than those of c3 and c1 fluorophores fig 3 lee et al 2015 also demonstrated that the fluorescence feature at a longer emission wavelength e g red shifting is likely to be linked with larger mw dom fractions in this context the three fluorescent components can be distinguished by different mw decreased in the order of c2 c1 c3 3 3 2 behaviors of the parafac components the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component derived from the 3 component parafac model was used to reflect the relative amount of fluorescing component stedmon et al 2003 herein the contributions of c1 c3 components to total fmax c1 c2 and c3 were considered as water quality indexes which exhibited different trends in terms of dom sources as shown in table s3 c2 27 1 34 6 and c3 37 2 42 4 were the dominant components in ha i whereas c3 42 4 50 8 and c1 43 1 48 5 were dominant in fa with limited c2 contribution lower than 10 among the raw and treated samples the relative high abundance of c3 and c1 in fa indicates that c1 and c3 fluorophores could be associated with the existence of fulvic like acids which are known to be smaller in size and lower in mw than humic like acids considering that lee and hur 2016 have successfully applied the ratios of fluorescent components to track the adsorption behavior of extracellular polymeric substances we used the two parafac ratios i e c3 c2 and c1 c2 in fmax values to track the compositional and structural changes in dom during uv irradiation and uv chloramination and the results are illustrated in fig 4 for all the dom species the c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios were much higher than the original values before uv and uv chloramine processes and increased substantially with increasing uv dosage for example the ratios increased from 11 6 to 14 7 and 5 5 to 6 7 for c3 c2 and c1 c2 in fw during uv treatment respectively the higher ratios of the components after uv irradiation indicate the preferential photodecomposition of larger humic like fluorophores c2 over smaller humic like fluorophores c1 and c3 in all the tested dom species the net increases of c1 and or c3 suggest that c1 and or c3 might be photoproducts of c2 by uv light moreover as the changes of ratios of parafac components can reflect the transition of mw among dom fractions according to previous studies aftab and hur 2017 lee et al 2015 such a preferential photolysis behavior also confirmed the distinct shift from higher mw fractions to lower ones with uv pretreatment the above observations may in turn increase i thm formation interestingly samples treated with uv chloramination displayed higher increases in the ratios of c3 c2 and c1 c2 compared to those of only irradiated ones fig 4 in other words post chloramination can amplify this increasing trend evidently suggesting the enhanced degree of decomposition transformation and mw shift this may be attributed to the oxidation of dom by nh2cl such as breakdown of carbon double bonds in aromatic molecules moreover the c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios of the untreated real water were similar and much higher than those in dom synthetic water this deviation is due to the very low proportion of c2 in both real water table s3 which again indicates that the five dom water are source specific notably the changes of the two ratios c3 c2 and c1 c2 during uv irradiation and uv chloramination are correlated with i thm formation which will be elaborated in section 3 4 3 3 3 molecular weight distributions mwds of dom fractions after uv and uv chloramine processes are displayed in fig 5 for comparison each of them exhibited one broad unimodal distribution pattern with uv irradiation alone no significant variations were found compared with those of raw dom solutions which is in accordance with early reports liu et al 2012 magnuson et al 2002 this is probably because the changes in mwds induced by uv irradiation are too small to be detected by a nonselective detector rid 10 a in this study however magnuson et al 2002 have confirmed that uv irradiation changed the mass spectra towards lower masses by employing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and thus altered the reactivity of the extracted organic matter to sequential chlorination from fig 5 both chloramination and uv chloramination caused noticeable decreases in the high mw fractions and increases in the low mw fractions among the tested dom containing solutions compared with the raw or only irradiated ones however when comparing the mwds in chloraminated and uv chloraminated synthetic water further decrease in the high mw fractions and increase in the low mw fractions can be verified suggesting that uv pretreatment magnified the shift of mwd to smaller mw ones during chloramination however as for real water no evident changes of relative high mw fractions were detected after uv chloramination in comparison with only chloraminated ones it is reported that uv photodegradation favored large condensed aromatic structures in dom fragmentation kulovaara et al 1996 however there is only a small amount of condensed aromatic content in real water low suva of real water in table s1 which caused less conversion of dom structures than that in synthetic water at uv dosage of 1160 mj cm2 therefore no evident changes of relative high mw fractions were observed in real water this observation is also in agreement with an early study liu et al 2012 in sum the application of uv pretreatment combined with chloramination shifted mwd of dom containing water and the transition was consistent with our previous results in section 3 3 2 using eem parafac analysis which in turn may increase i thm formation 3 4 correlations between i thm formation and parafac components i thm formation increased with increasing uv dosage followed by chloramination in dom containing water compared to those treated with chloramine alone fig 1 indicating that uv irradiation induced more susceptible precursors toward subsequent chloramination then the linear increases of both c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios for the five dom species during uv and uv chloramine processes fig 4 implies distinct shift in these three fluorescent components among dom which can be responsible for the enhancement of i thm yield with uv pretreatment this is supported by the significant and positive correlations between i thm yields and the changes of c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios among all dom containing solutions treated with uv chloramine r2 0 976 1 000 for c3 c2 ratios and r2 0 958 1 000 for c1 c2 ratios respectively as shown in fig 6 for rw and fw the increase of c3 c2 is much higher than c1 c2 which can be owing to the shift from both c2 and c1 to c3 in the case of very low percentage of c2 in real water table s3 moreover the good linear regressions between components ratios and i thm yields exhibited different slopes for these source specific dom table s4 these findings imply that the transformation of fluorescent components by uv irradiation is crucial for the generation of i thms and the ratios of fluorescent components can be reliable indicators for i thm formation from i containing water 3 5 effect of dom concentration on i thm formation the effect of dom concentration expressed as doc with and without uv pretreatment on i thm formation in ha i synthetic water is displayed in fig 7 obviously statistically significant increases of i thm formation were detected with uv exposure at doc of 0 62 7 2 mg c l the highest increment of i thm yield was 74 with doc at 0 62 mg l and 500 mj cm2 uv compared to samples without uv treatment this is probably because when exposed to the limited uv irradiation the dom structure changes more under lower doc concentration the concentrations of i thms presented an increasing then decreasing trend as doc increased from 0 62 to 7 2 mg c l and reached a maximum of 210 4 and 139 7 μg l at doc of 2 8 mg c l with and without uv pretreatment respectively the increase of doc concentration provided more precursors to form i thms nevertheless exorbitant dom consumes nh2cl excessively causing reduction of available nh2cl for further oxidizing i and precursors and leading to the sharp decrease of i thm yields at relative high doc concentration on the other hand the decline of chi3 concentration at high doc concentration was attributed to the fact that triiodo dbps were less likely to be produced when excess reactive sites of dom were available liu et al 2017 contributing to the reduction of total i thms furthermore the effects of ph and initial i concentration during uv treatment were also examined and the results are shown in figs s4 and s5 solution ph during uv irradiation did not present great influence on i thm formation with post chloramination but i concentration did an increase in i concentration enhanced the generation of reactive iodine species to raise dom approachability for iodination nonetheless the increment was sluggish when i concentration was up to 25 μm which could be attributed to more consumption of nh2cl when oxidizing i and less nh2cl left for the oxidation of organic precursors zhang et al 2016a additionally uv application with different dosages all exhibited the similar increasing trends in i thm yields among various i concentrations 3 6 iodine utilization factor changes in the mixed iodine system it is generally accepted that iodate io3 is one of the predominant iodine sources in aquatic environment and has been detected in tap water at level of several to dozens of μg i l gong and zhang 2013 xia et al 2017 also the concentration of naturally occurring br is usually much higher than that of i in natural water richardson et al 2008 therefore the effect of io3 i molar ratio on i thm formation in the presence of br in ha i synthetic water with and without uv pretreatment was explored after chloramination and the results are shown in fig 8 to investigate i incorporation into i thms iuf for i thm formation was calculated by using eqs 1 and 2 as introduced by former studies hua et al 2006 kristiana et al 2009 according to the iuf obtained from experiments under i or io3 alone systems simulated iuf of mixed iodine systems i io3 can be theoretical calculated by adding the contribution of each iodine species i e just adding i i io3 ratio of the iuf under i alone system and io3 i io3 ratio of the iuf under io3 alone system eq 3 from fig 8 a without uv pretreatment the observed iuf is very close to the simulated one under both mixed iodine systems total iodine concentrations of 5 and 10 μm respectively suggesting that the predicted iuf calculation is reasonable for the mixed system 1 iuf i thms ithm μ m total iodine μ m 2 ithm chcl 2 i chclbri chbr 2 i 2 chcli 2 2 chbri 2 3 chi 3 3 simulated iuf i i i o 3 iuf i alone i o 3 i i o 3 iuf i o 3 alone however after uv chloramination fig 8 b it was surprising to find that the observed iufs were not consistent with the predicted ones the observed iufs enhanced remarkably compared with the corresponding simulated values at all io3 i molar ratios of both mixed iodine systems this may be attributed to the transformation of iodine species in the mixed iodine system induced by uv light in order to further verify this hypothesis the conversion of io3 alone and mixed iodine i io3 species during uv irradiation in milli q water without dom were examined with the results shown in figs s6 and 9 from fig s6 spiked io3 40 μm io3 concentration kept decreasing while i concentration kept increasing as reaction time went by io3 was converted to i gradually and very small amounts of hoi i2 were formed during photo degradation eqs 4 7 saunders et al 2012 zhang et al 2016c comparatively among the mixed iodine system spiked i and io3 160 and 40 μm respectively in fig 9 interestingly the concentrations of both io3 and i decreased simultaneously while the concentrations of hoi i2 and i3 increased rapidly during uv exposure the progressive increase of hoi i2 was ascribable to the presence of massive i which can react with io3 and photons to generate hoi i2 eqs 8 10 meanwhile the increase of i3 was due to quantitative transformation of i and hoi i2 to i3 according to two rapid reactions shown in eqs 8 9 ye et al 2012 under the effect of photons both i and io3 were converted to large amounts of hoi i2 and i3 constantly in the mixed iodine system compared to that only trace amounts of hoi i2 were formed in io3 alone system it is also notable that the rate of io3 degradation was observed to accelerate by 4 fold compared to that in the absence of i with the same uv dosage fig s7 this could be explained by the enhanced consumption of io3 by massive i and photons in the solution to produce i2 and i3 so as to facilitate the degradation of io3 eqs 10 11 bolton and stefan 2011 all these pathways contributed to the significant decrease of i and io3 concentrations and the increase of hoi i2 and i3 concentrations also the diagrammatic sketch of different iodine species transformation by uv light is illustrated in fig s8 for comparison overall the mixed iodine system can generate large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 directly by uv irradiation cause less demand of nh2cl for oxidizing i during subsequent chloramination and lead to the unexpected enhancement of iuf compared to the simulated one from fig 8 b it is also interesting to find that the significant increment of iuf observed iuf simulated iuf p 0 05 in table s5 displayed an increasing then decreasing trend as the io3 i molar ratio decreased from 4 to 0 25 and achieved the maximum at the molar ratio of 1 under 5 μm mixed iodine system when the molar ratio decreased from 4 to 0 25 the increment of iuf increased up from 0 029 to 0 040 and then decreased to 0 036 with uv pretreatment obviously under uv irradiation io3 and i can directly generate high levels of hoi i2 and i3 and then increase iuf eqs 4 11 however when i is excessive massive i3 can be produced during uv irradiation eqs 8 9 because i3 is relatively less reactive than hoi i2 it can explain the slight decrease of the iuf increment lin et al 2008 additionally the presence of br has no effect on the transformation of iodine species during uv irradiation besides changing precursors these results confirmed that the transformation of iodine species is another pathway for uv irradiation to impact i thm formation and the ratio of existing iodine species io3 i in dom solution is critical for iuf during uv chloramination 4 i o 3 h 2 o hv i o 3 h 2 o 5 i o 3 h 2 o hv i o o 2 h 2 o 6 i o hv i 1 2 o 2 7 i o 3 4 e 5 h hoi 2 h 2 o 8 i h hoi i

through two pathways one pathway is through the transition of dom structure and composition we found that uv irradiation increase i thm formation significantly in different five dom water containing i considering that negligible changes in i concentration and mineralization rate were observed during uv irradiation the shift in uv induced dom character is responsible for the increase of i thms the preferential photodecomposition of larger humic like fluorophores c2 over smaller humic like fluorophores c1 and c3 the conversion of c2 to c1 and or c3 as well as the shift from higher mw fractions to lower ones among dom were observed during uv irradiation which led to organic precursors being more susceptible to react with nh2cl strong correlations between two fluorescent ratios c3 c2 and c1 c2 and i thm yields among five dom water suggest that the ratios of fluorescent components can be reliable indicators for i thm formation during uv chloramination another pathway for uv irradiation to alter i thm formation is through the transformation of iodine species in water large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 can be generated directly in the mixed iodine system by uv light resulting in the significant increase of iuf and i thm formation after post chloramination nevertheless the degree of this enhancement depends on the distribution of i and io3 overall this study provides further insights into the effect of uv irradiation on dom characteristics and iodine species transformation causing the profound enhancement of i thm yield during post chloramination careful attention should be paid on uv applications to source water to mitigate uv induced emerging dbp formation especially in high iodine containing water acknowledgments this study was supported in part by

19237,ultraviolet uv irradiation has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes but its influence on the formation of disinfection by products dbps especially the emerging iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during post chloramination remains unclear this study evaluated the impact of low pressure lp uv treatment on the formation of i thms during post chloramination through two pathways the first pathway is through the transition of dom structure and composition during uv chloramination resulting significant increase of i thm formation with increasing uv dosage in different dissolved organic matter dom containing water 49 7 90 5 at 1160 mj cm2 with the application of excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac we found that i thm formation in uv chloraminated water correlated well with two ratios of three parafac humic like components c3 c2 and c1 c2 r2 0 958 1 000 suggesting that the ratios of fluorescent components can be used as reliable indicators for i thm formation moreover the shift in these fluorescent components is crucial for i thm formation during uv chloramination another pathway for uv irradiation to affect i thm formation during post chloramination is through the transformation of iodine species large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 can be generated directly in the mixed iodine system by uv light leading to the enhancement of iodine utilization factor iuf up to 0 040 after post chloramination these results suggest that uv application to dom containing water may induce changes in organic precursors and iodine species so as to enhance i thm formation during post chloramination graphical abstract image 1 keywords iodinated trihalomethanes i thms ultraviolet uv irradiation dissolved organic matter dom chloramination fluorescence spectroscopy iodine utilization factor iuf 1 introduction the formation of disinfection by products dbps during drinking water treatment processes can cause unintended health risks due to their genotoxic and cytotoxic effects dbps are primarily produced when dissolved organic matter dom bromide br iodide i and anthropogenic pollutants react with disinfectants postigo and richardson 2014 richardson et al 2007 in recent years the formation of emerging toxic iodinated dbps i dbps has raised great concern for water utilities krasner et al 2006 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 because i dbps have been demonstrated to be more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmental toxic in mammalian cell assays than their chlorinated and brominated analogs plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 preliminary studies indicated that iodinated trihalomethanes i thms can also cause bad taste and odor problems due to their low threshold concentrations as low as 0 02 0 5 μg l barceló 2012 hansson et al 1987 therefore further concerns should be paid on i thm formation in drinking water treatment processes naturally occurring i iodate io3 and iodinated organic compounds have been identified as dominant iodine sources in aquatic environment which may undergo transformation to one another and thereby affecting i thm formation gong and zhang 2013 hansen et al 2011 recently low pressure lp ultraviolet uv irradiation is a promising alternative to achieve disinfection in drinking water treatment plants dwtps because of its high efficacy of inactivating waterborne pathogens uv irradiation accompanied with another disinfectant for secondary disinfection such as commonly used chloramine nh2cl for its long term stability is required for maintaining disinfection efficacy in water seidel et al 2005 shah et al 2011 however chloramination of i containing water might result in significant formation of i dbps involving the oxidation of i to iodine reactive species by nh2cl that further react with dissolved organic matter dom in water bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 ye et al 2013 dom is a complex mixture comprised of thousands of compounds and usually act as the principal dbp precursors in the disinfection step with high heterogeneity leenheer and croué 2003 although the heterogeneous dom structures make their transition behavior upon water treatment process very complicated it can be resolved by applying advanced dom characterization methods fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac can successfully separate independent fluorescent components from the bulk dom for quantitative analysis helping to track different behaviors of dom constitutes in various water treatment systems phong and jin 2015 zhang et al 2016b a few studies explored the impact of uv pretreatment with a secondary disinfectant on dbp formation and most of the past work focused on the regulated dbp formation dotson et al 2010 liu et al 2006 reckhow et al 2010 reported an increase in trichloronitromethane formation after medium pressure mp uv irradiation 40 140 mj cm2 followed by chlorination compared with chlorination alone in nitrate containing water the results indicate that uv pretreatment can affect the formation of dbps through reacting with inorganic ions another possibility of uv exposure to alter dbp formation is through the transition of dom structure to cause sequential reactivity towards disinfectants former studies have confirmed that the content and type of dom affect dbp formation greatly during disinfection gallard and von 2002 liu et al 2006 magnuson et al 2002 found that uv irradiation 20 140 mj cm2 changed the mass spectra towards lower masses causing alterations in reactivity of organic matter to chlorination so far there is limited information about the impact of uv irradiation and subsequent chloramination uv chloramination on the formation of emerging i thms which is substantial to realize i thm formation when applying uv disinfection to source water moreover a survey of utilities reported that some dwtps applied higher uv dosages than the original designed values dotson et al 2012 therefore the investigation of high uv dosage is also urgent the primary aim of this research was to clarify the impacts of uv irradiation on the formation of i thms during post chloramination through two pathways including transition of dom structure and transformation of iodine species humic acid ha fulvic acid fa raw water and filtered water were adopted as the different dom matrices the changes of dom characteristics including uv absorbance molecular weight distribution mwd fluorescence and the relationship between fluorescence character and i thm formation were evaluated as for different iodine species various io3 i molar ratios and the transformation among iodine species in the mixed iodine system i io3 with uv exposure to affect iodine utilization factor iuf after post chloramination were also investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were of at least

the monochloramine nh2cl solution was freshly prepared with the cl2 n molar ratio of 0 8 at ph 8 5 according to a previous study xu et al 2012 2 2 water samples five dom sources including humic acid i ha i humic aicd ii ha ii fulvic acid fa raw water rw and filtered water fw were used in this study ha i was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ha ii and fa were purchased from the international humic substances society ha i ha ii and fa were prepared by dissolving into milli q water rw and fw after coagulation and filtration but prior to disinfection were collected from a dwtp in shanghai china all the prepared samples were further filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes millipore corp billerica ma and then stored at 4 c in dark until use the characteristics of these five water sources were distinctively different and were summarized in table s1 2 3 uv irradiation system the uv irradiation experiments were performed in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china equipped with two parts the quartz reactors and the uv lamps a 36 w lp uv lamp with a quartz sleeve was fixed in the center of the apparatus to generate quasi parallel uv beam at the wavelength 254 nm the setup of this uv system was displayed in fig s1 the uv intensity of lp uv was monitored with an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory beijing normal university at 254 nm the ascertained uv intensity was 0 97 mw cm2 and the uv dosage ranged from 0 to 1160 mj cm2 in this study the irradiation time was defined by dividing the desired uv dosage mj cm2 by the uv intensity tian et al 2014 yuan et al 2009 2 4 uv treatment and subsequent chloramination uv irradiation experiments were conducted using 50 ml dom containing solutions prepared at designed doc concentrations and spiked with a desired concentration of i the ph of solutions was adjusted to 7 0 using small volumes of h2so4 and naoh and buffered with 5 mm phosphate then the solutions were rapidly poured into the sealed quartz reactors equipped with stir bars to ensure homogeneous reaction the quartz reactors were set vertically at a fixed distance from the lamp and maintained at 25 1 c at designed irradiation time each test solution was withdrawn and a small volume of chloramine was added to achieve the desired concentration at ph 7 0 experimental samples in duplicate were immediately incubated under headspace free conditions in 40 ml glass screw cap amber vials with ptfe lined septa and stored at 25 1 c in the dark for 24 h then 10 ml of each solution was quenched using na2s2o3 with 20 excess of the initial nh2cl concentration and extracted using mtbe immediately to avoid any chance of i thm decomposition the fluorescence and gel permeation chromatograph gpc measurements were also performed using the quenched solutions as soon as possible additionally for investigating the conversion of iodine species io3 and i initial concentrations were expanded to 40 and 160 μm respectively to get obvious phenomenon and the signals higher than the detection limits of i hoi and io3 see section 2 6 2 5 eem parafac analysis fluorescence eem data of dom were measured by a fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba jobin yvon edison nj usa excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were set at 240 550 nm with 5 nm intervals and at 280 550 nm with 2 nm intervals respectively samples for fluorescence measurement were transferred into 25 ml vials and stored at 4 c until analysis before analysis all samples were left to room temperature approximately 20 c to minimize temperature influence a 290 nm optical filter was utilized to restrict second order rayleigh scattering phong and jin 2015 the final fluorescence intensities were normalized by using a raman integrated area of the corresponding milli q water more than 80 samples were collected including control samples uv alone and uv chloramine treated samples following stedmon and bro 2008 tutorial the eem signals were decomposed into appropriate components by using parafac modeling with matlabr2014a and the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk 2 6 analytical methods solution ph was measured with a regularly calibrated ph meter fe20 fiveeasy mettler toledo switzerland using standard buffer solutions doc was detected using a toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan with the detection limit of 0 1 mg c l uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and i3 concentration of the samples were determined using a spectrophotometer sq 4802 unico shanghai china at absorbance wavelengths of 254 and 351 nm respectively ye et al 2012 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva is defined as the ratio of uv254 to doc which has been widely used as a parameter of aromatic content within dom weishaar et al 2003 the mwds of dom sources were analyzed using a lc 10ad gpc equipped with a rid 10 a detector shimadzu japan br concentration was detected by an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 usa with a conductivity detector and the detection limit was 20 μg l io3 i hoi and i2 were analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters usa furnished with an xterra ms c18 column and a uv detector according to our previous study zhang et al 2016c because hoi and i2 can both quickly react with the quenching reagent phenol to form 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol the concentrations of hoi and i2 cannot be quantified separately bichsel and von gunten 2000 consequently the concentration of iodophenol is the sum of hoi and i2 the injection volume was 10 μl and the detection limits of io3 i and hoi i2 were 10 5 and 10 μg i l respectively the method for quantifying i thms was modified from the usepa method 551 1 munch and hautman 1995 in our previous research ye et al 2014 samples were extracted using mtbe and the extracts were analyzed by a gas chromatography gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm film thickness j w usa the detection limits of chcl2i chclbri chbr2i chcli2 chbri2 and chi3 were 0 10 0 09 0 10 0 08 0 10 and 0 08 μg l respectively monochloramine concentration was determined by using the n n diethyl pphenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 additionally a two tailed independent paired t test was conducted using spss statistics version 22 0 to determine the significance between the data sets p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of uv dosage on i thm formation with different dom species fig 1 displays the variations of i thm formation after uv irradiation with different dosages and sequential chloramination of 5 dom containing water it is obvious that uv irradiation significantly enhanced i thm formation in all cases compared to corresponding cases using only chloramination i thm formation increased with increasing uv dosage and were up to 49 7 90 5 in different dom sources pretreated with 1160 mj cm2 uv compared to the same samples without uv treatment when applying uv dosage of 70 mj cm2 higher percentage increases of i thm formation were obtained in real water rw and fw than those in dom synthetic water fig 1 which is in agreement with the previous reported results liu et al 2012 the reason may be due to less aromatic structures low suva of real water in table s1 that can be induced easily to generate more reactive sites at low uv dosage 70 mj cm2 however at high uv dosage 1160 mj cm2 ha i presented the greatest increase of i thm formation up to 90 5 among the 5 dom containing water this is presumably ascribable to the existence of large amounts of condensed aromatic and unsaturated content in ha i high suva of ha i in table s1 which can provide more activated aromatic structures at high uv dosage lyon et al 2012 moreover only small amounts of chclbri and chbri2 were measured in rw and fw due to the presence of low br concentration below detection limit table s1 it is noteworthy that fa presents the highest i thm formation while fw presents the lowest one regardless of uv dosage this indicates that i thm yields do not correlate well with the suva values of the dom containing water which is inconsistent with the study of jones et al 2012 that i is more easily incorporated into low suva dom to generate i thms it could be explained by the great different characteristics of the 3 synthetic ha i ha ii and fa and 2 real water rw and fw with the wide range of suva values 1 2 7 3 l mg m in our study compared with the study of jones et al 2012 using only real water with the small range of suva values 1 8 4 2 l mg m this suggests that suva value cannot be used as an appropriate indicator for the estimation of i thm formation considering high heterogeneity of source water from fig s2 no changes of i concentration iodine source were observed in both milli q and synthetic water during uv treatment therefore the enhancement of i thm formation could be contributed to the uv induced alteration of organic precursors therefore it is essential to seek other dom properties that is properly related to i thm formation accordingly different characteristics of dom are investigated to clarify the structural transformation during uv irradiation and uv chloramination and the results will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 changes in doc and uv absorbance during uv irradiation doc is a universal indicator for organic matter content in water uv254 is a common parameter of the aromaticity of dom and can be used as a surrogate for doc in aqueous environment phong and jin 2015 weishaar et al 2003 thus the changes of doc and uv254 during uv irradiation of 5 dom containing water are illustrated in fig 2 five dom sources all displayed negligible changes in doc at ph 7 0 in the studied uv dosages which is in agreement with none or slight removal of doc under uva and uvc irradiation reported previously phong and jin 2016 however uv254 displayed an obvious decreasing trend over the irradiation time i e 6 4 29 6 for the experimental conditions in fig 2 b this phenomenon suggests that the uv absorbing substances and or chromophores in dom which are mainly composed of large sized aromatic molecules can be rapidly broken down into smaller sized non aromatic by products sanly et al 2007 also the removal efficiency of uv254 6 4 29 6 was much higher than that of doc 2 2 4 7 which indicates that the aromatic chromophores in dom were preferentially degraded and or some aromatic structures were partially converted to non uv absorbing compounds during uv irradiation jin et al 2011 the photoproducts of dom may contain organic acids alcohols aldehydes and some other non aromatic structures which are associated with dbp formation during post chloramination pullin et al 2004 sanly et al 2007 3 3 variation of dom structure during uv irradiation and uv chloramine processes 3 3 1 fluorescent components identified by using parafac three different fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 were successfully decomposed by parafac modeling on the eem dataset of all samples and the results are presented in fig 3 the number of components was determined based on residual analysis fig s3 a and split half validation fig s3 b component 1 c1 displayed a peak at ex em of 350 nm 476 nm while c2 had a dominant and a secondary peak at wavelengths of 315 nm 520 nm ex em and 375 nm 520 nm ex em respectively c3 exhibited a peak at ex em of 325 nm 418 nm based on the eem peak locations previously reported table s2 and the origin of dom used in this study all of these three identified components may be assigned to humic like components baghoth et al 2011 coble 2007 murphy et al 2011 however as indicated by huang et al 2018 the component exhibiting a wide range of emission and excitation wavelengths has the characteristics of large molecular weight mw complex structure and more aromatic moieties therefore the c2 fluorophores in this study might contain more condensed and polymerized structures with molecular size larger than those of c3 and c1 fluorophores fig 3 lee et al 2015 also demonstrated that the fluorescence feature at a longer emission wavelength e g red shifting is likely to be linked with larger mw dom fractions in this context the three fluorescent components can be distinguished by different mw decreased in the order of c2 c1 c3 3 3 2 behaviors of the parafac components the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component derived from the 3 component parafac model was used to reflect the relative amount of fluorescing component stedmon et al 2003 herein the contributions of c1 c3 components to total fmax c1 c2 and c3 were considered as water quality indexes which exhibited different trends in terms of dom sources as shown in table s3 c2 27 1 34 6 and c3 37 2 42 4 were the dominant components in ha i whereas c3 42 4 50 8 and c1 43 1 48 5 were dominant in fa with limited c2 contribution lower than 10 among the raw and treated samples the relative high abundance of c3 and c1 in fa indicates that c1 and c3 fluorophores could be associated with the existence of fulvic like acids which are known to be smaller in size and lower in mw than humic like acids considering that lee and hur 2016 have successfully applied the ratios of fluorescent components to track the adsorption behavior of extracellular polymeric substances we used the two parafac ratios i e c3 c2 and c1 c2 in fmax values to track the compositional and structural changes in dom during uv irradiation and uv chloramination and the results are illustrated in fig 4 for all the dom species the c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios were much higher than the original values before uv and uv chloramine processes and increased substantially with increasing uv dosage for example the ratios increased from 11 6 to 14 7 and 5 5 to 6 7 for c3 c2 and c1 c2 in fw during uv treatment respectively the higher ratios of the components after uv irradiation indicate the preferential photodecomposition of larger humic like fluorophores c2 over smaller humic like fluorophores c1 and c3 in all the tested dom species the net increases of c1 and or c3 suggest that c1 and or c3 might be photoproducts of c2 by uv light moreover as the changes of ratios of parafac components can reflect the transition of mw among dom fractions according to previous studies aftab and hur 2017 lee et al 2015 such a preferential photolysis behavior also confirmed the distinct shift from higher mw fractions to lower ones with uv pretreatment the above observations may in turn increase i thm formation interestingly samples treated with uv chloramination displayed higher increases in the ratios of c3 c2 and c1 c2 compared to those of only irradiated ones fig 4 in other words post chloramination can amplify this increasing trend evidently suggesting the enhanced degree of decomposition transformation and mw shift this may be attributed to the oxidation of dom by nh2cl such as breakdown of carbon double bonds in aromatic molecules moreover the c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios of the untreated real water were similar and much higher than those in dom synthetic water this deviation is due to the very low proportion of c2 in both real water table s3 which again indicates that the five dom water are source specific notably the changes of the two ratios c3 c2 and c1 c2 during uv irradiation and uv chloramination are correlated with i thm formation which will be elaborated in section 3 4 3 3 3 molecular weight distributions mwds of dom fractions after uv and uv chloramine processes are displayed in fig 5 for comparison each of them exhibited one broad unimodal distribution pattern with uv irradiation alone no significant variations were found compared with those of raw dom solutions which is in accordance with early reports liu et al 2012 magnuson et al 2002 this is probably because the changes in mwds induced by uv irradiation are too small to be detected by a nonselective detector rid 10 a in this study however magnuson et al 2002 have confirmed that uv irradiation changed the mass spectra towards lower masses by employing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and thus altered the reactivity of the extracted organic matter to sequential chlorination from fig 5 both chloramination and uv chloramination caused noticeable decreases in the high mw fractions and increases in the low mw fractions among the tested dom containing solutions compared with the raw or only irradiated ones however when comparing the mwds in chloraminated and uv chloraminated synthetic water further decrease in the high mw fractions and increase in the low mw fractions can be verified suggesting that uv pretreatment magnified the shift of mwd to smaller mw ones during chloramination however as for real water no evident changes of relative high mw fractions were detected after uv chloramination in comparison with only chloraminated ones it is reported that uv photodegradation favored large condensed aromatic structures in dom fragmentation kulovaara et al 1996 however there is only a small amount of condensed aromatic content in real water low suva of real water in table s1 which caused less conversion of dom structures than that in synthetic water at uv dosage of 1160 mj cm2 therefore no evident changes of relative high mw fractions were observed in real water this observation is also in agreement with an early study liu et al 2012 in sum the application of uv pretreatment combined with chloramination shifted mwd of dom containing water and the transition was consistent with our previous results in section 3 3 2 using eem parafac analysis which in turn may increase i thm formation 3 4 correlations between i thm formation and parafac components i thm formation increased with increasing uv dosage followed by chloramination in dom containing water compared to those treated with chloramine alone fig 1 indicating that uv irradiation induced more susceptible precursors toward subsequent chloramination then the linear increases of both c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios for the five dom species during uv and uv chloramine processes fig 4 implies distinct shift in these three fluorescent components among dom which can be responsible for the enhancement of i thm yield with uv pretreatment this is supported by the significant and positive correlations between i thm yields and the changes of c3 c2 and c1 c2 ratios among all dom containing solutions treated with uv chloramine r2 0 976 1 000 for c3 c2 ratios and r2 0 958 1 000 for c1 c2 ratios respectively as shown in fig 6 for rw and fw the increase of c3 c2 is much higher than c1 c2 which can be owing to the shift from both c2 and c1 to c3 in the case of very low percentage of c2 in real water table s3 moreover the good linear regressions between components ratios and i thm yields exhibited different slopes for these source specific dom table s4 these findings imply that the transformation of fluorescent components by uv irradiation is crucial for the generation of i thms and the ratios of fluorescent components can be reliable indicators for i thm formation from i containing water 3 5 effect of dom concentration on i thm formation the effect of dom concentration expressed as doc with and without uv pretreatment on i thm formation in ha i synthetic water is displayed in fig 7 obviously statistically significant increases of i thm formation were detected with uv exposure at doc of 0 62 7 2 mg c l the highest increment of i thm yield was 74 with doc at 0 62 mg l and 500 mj cm2 uv compared to samples without uv treatment this is probably because when exposed to the limited uv irradiation the dom structure changes more under lower doc concentration the concentrations of i thms presented an increasing then decreasing trend as doc increased from 0 62 to 7 2 mg c l and reached a maximum of 210 4 and 139 7 μg l at doc of 2 8 mg c l with and without uv pretreatment respectively the increase of doc concentration provided more precursors to form i thms nevertheless exorbitant dom consumes nh2cl excessively causing reduction of available nh2cl for further oxidizing i and precursors and leading to the sharp decrease of i thm yields at relative high doc concentration on the other hand the decline of chi3 concentration at high doc concentration was attributed to the fact that triiodo dbps were less likely to be produced when excess reactive sites of dom were available liu et al 2017 contributing to the reduction of total i thms furthermore the effects of ph and initial i concentration during uv treatment were also examined and the results are shown in figs s4 and s5 solution ph during uv irradiation did not present great influence on i thm formation with post chloramination but i concentration did an increase in i concentration enhanced the generation of reactive iodine species to raise dom approachability for iodination nonetheless the increment was sluggish when i concentration was up to 25 μm which could be attributed to more consumption of nh2cl when oxidizing i and less nh2cl left for the oxidation of organic precursors zhang et al 2016a additionally uv application with different dosages all exhibited the similar increasing trends in i thm yields among various i concentrations 3 6 iodine utilization factor changes in the mixed iodine system it is generally accepted that iodate io3 is one of the predominant iodine sources in aquatic environment and has been detected in tap water at level of several to dozens of μg i l gong and zhang 2013 xia et al 2017 also the concentration of naturally occurring br is usually much higher than that of i in natural water richardson et al 2008 therefore the effect of io3 i molar ratio on i thm formation in the presence of br in ha i synthetic water with and without uv pretreatment was explored after chloramination and the results are shown in fig 8 to investigate i incorporation into i thms iuf for i thm formation was calculated by using eqs 1 and 2 as introduced by former studies hua et al 2006 kristiana et al 2009 according to the iuf obtained from experiments under i or io3 alone systems simulated iuf of mixed iodine systems i io3 can be theoretical calculated by adding the contribution of each iodine species i e just adding i i io3 ratio of the iuf under i alone system and io3 i io3 ratio of the iuf under io3 alone system eq 3 from fig 8 a without uv pretreatment the observed iuf is very close to the simulated one under both mixed iodine systems total iodine concentrations of 5 and 10 μm respectively suggesting that the predicted iuf calculation is reasonable for the mixed system 1 iuf i thms ithm μ m total iodine μ m 2 ithm chcl 2 i chclbri chbr 2 i 2 chcli 2 2 chbri 2 3 chi 3 3 simulated iuf i i i o 3 iuf i alone i o 3 i i o 3 iuf i o 3 alone however after uv chloramination fig 8 b it was surprising to find that the observed iufs were not consistent with the predicted ones the observed iufs enhanced remarkably compared with the corresponding simulated values at all io3 i molar ratios of both mixed iodine systems this may be attributed to the transformation of iodine species in the mixed iodine system induced by uv light in order to further verify this hypothesis the conversion of io3 alone and mixed iodine i io3 species during uv irradiation in milli q water without dom were examined with the results shown in figs s6 and 9 from fig s6 spiked io3 40 μm io3 concentration kept decreasing while i concentration kept increasing as reaction time went by io3 was converted to i gradually and very small amounts of hoi i2 were formed during photo degradation eqs 4 7 saunders et al 2012 zhang et al 2016c comparatively among the mixed iodine system spiked i and io3 160 and 40 μm respectively in fig 9 interestingly the concentrations of both io3 and i decreased simultaneously while the concentrations of hoi i2 and i3 increased rapidly during uv exposure the progressive increase of hoi i2 was ascribable to the presence of massive i which can react with io3 and photons to generate hoi i2 eqs 8 10 meanwhile the increase of i3 was due to quantitative transformation of i and hoi i2 to i3 according to two rapid reactions shown in eqs 8 9 ye et al 2012 under the effect of photons both i and io3 were converted to large amounts of hoi i2 and i3 constantly in the mixed iodine system compared to that only trace amounts of hoi i2 were formed in io3 alone system it is also notable that the rate of io3 degradation was observed to accelerate by 4 fold compared to that in the absence of i with the same uv dosage fig s7 this could be explained by the enhanced consumption of io3 by massive i and photons in the solution to produce i2 and i3 so as to facilitate the degradation of io3 eqs 10 11 bolton and stefan 2011 all these pathways contributed to the significant decrease of i and io3 concentrations and the increase of hoi i2 and i3 concentrations also the diagrammatic sketch of different iodine species transformation by uv light is illustrated in fig s8 for comparison overall the mixed iodine system can generate large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 directly by uv irradiation cause less demand of nh2cl for oxidizing i during subsequent chloramination and lead to the unexpected enhancement of iuf compared to the simulated one from fig 8 b it is also interesting to find that the significant increment of iuf observed iuf simulated iuf p 0 05 in table s5 displayed an increasing then decreasing trend as the io3 i molar ratio decreased from 4 to 0 25 and achieved the maximum at the molar ratio of 1 under 5 μm mixed iodine system when the molar ratio decreased from 4 to 0 25 the increment of iuf increased up from 0 029 to 0 040 and then decreased to 0 036 with uv pretreatment obviously under uv irradiation io3 and i can directly generate high levels of hoi i2 and i3 and then increase iuf eqs 4 11 however when i is excessive massive i3 can be produced during uv irradiation eqs 8 9 because i3 is relatively less reactive than hoi i2 it can explain the slight decrease of the iuf increment lin et al 2008 additionally the presence of br has no effect on the transformation of iodine species during uv irradiation besides changing precursors these results confirmed that the transformation of iodine species is another pathway for uv irradiation to impact i thm formation and the ratio of existing iodine species io3 i in dom solution is critical for iuf during uv chloramination 4 i o 3 h 2 o hv i o 3 h 2 o 5 i o 3 h 2 o hv i o o 2 h 2 o 6 i o hv i 1 2 o 2 7 i o 3 4 e 5 h hoi 2 h 2 o 8 i h hoi i

considering that negligible changes in i concentration and mineralization rate were observed during uv irradiation the shift in uv induced dom character is responsible for the increase of i thms the preferential photodecomposition of larger humic like fluorophores c2 over smaller humic like fluorophores c1 and c3 the conversion of c2 to c1 and or c3 as well as the shift from higher mw fractions to lower ones among dom were observed during uv irradiation which led to organic precursors being more susceptible to react with nh2cl strong correlations between two fluorescent ratios c3 c2 and c1 c2 and i thm yields among five dom water suggest that the ratios of fluorescent components can be reliable indicators for i thm formation during uv chloramination another pathway for uv irradiation to alter i thm formation is through the transformation of iodine species in water large amounts of reactive iodine species hoi i2 and i3 can be generated directly in the mixed iodine system by uv light resulting in the significant increase of iuf and i thm formation after post chloramination nevertheless the degree of this enhancement depends on the distribution of i and io3 overall this study provides further insights into the effect of uv irradiation on dom characteristics and iodine species transformation causing the profound enhancement of i thm yield during post chloramination careful attention should be paid on uv applications to source water to mitigate uv induced emerging dbp formation especially in high iodine containing water acknowledgments this study was supported in part by

19238,a sequential chem bio hybrid process was developed using a novel biochar supported carboxymethyl cellulose stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide cmc fes biochar as a chemical remover and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 as a biological agent for trichloroethylene tce degradation compared with cmc fes fes biochar600 bare fes and biochar600 the cmc fes biochar600 composite displayed better physiochemical properties smaller hydrodynamic diameter and higher stability and demonstrated excellent removal capacity for tce from aqueous phase a facultative bacterial strain corynebacterium variabile hrj4 growing well in the presence of cmc fes biochar added up to 0 25 g l 1 further enhanced tce removal after chemical treatment the dechlorination pathway proposed based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis revealed that tce was dechlorinated to cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and acetylene via hydrogenolysis and β elimination respectively within 12 h by cmc fes biochar addition of hrj4 strain into the reaction system effectively enhanced the degradation of the residual tce cis dce and acetylene to ethylene acetylene was the main product in chemical process whereas ethylene was the main product in biological process as strain hrj4 could reduce acetylene to ethylene effectively the results of this study signify the potential application of cmc fes biochar600 hrj4 chem bio hybrid system for complete degradation of tce in the anaerobic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords fes biochar tce biodegradation adsorption reduction 1 introduction owing to its widespread applications in the dry cleaning and automotive industries as cleaning and degreasing solvent trichloroethylene tce is the most frequently encountered contaminant in various environmental matrices including groundwater wastewater and soils bacik et al 2012 han and yan 2016 agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr reported detection of tce in 852 superfund sites across the united states tce can pose a serious health risk to public and ecosystem due to its toxicity carcinogenicity and resistance to biodegradation lyu et al 2018a zhou et al 2016 considering the common and long term health effects it is warranted to develop a technology to degrade and or remove tce from the contaminated environment various technologies are available for tce removal from water including physical adsorption ahmad et al 2013 and chemical oxidation reduction processes dong et al 2017 however most of these methods resulted in partial degradation of tce and formation of toxic intermediates including cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride vc wang et al 2010 these intermediates are not only carcinogenic but also accumulate in the food chain dong et al 2017 therefore it is very important to develop a high efficiency technology for complete degradation of tce in the environment biological degradation of tce by bacteria has been considered a promising technology for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater and soils guerrero barajas et al 2011 lee and liu 2006 zylstra et al 1989 however tce is highly resistant to biodegradation under aerobic condition little et al 1988 therefore efforts have been made to develop strategy for efficient anaerobic degradation of tce by bacteria such as dehalococcoides desulfuromonas sulfurospirillum dehalobacter and methylobacterium holliger et al 1993 krumholz 1997 little et al 1988 luijten et al 2003 xiu et al 2010 in our previous study corynebacterium variabile hrj4 accession no kp140842 1 isolated from the dagang oil field china showed excellent aerobic degradation ability for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and n alkanes zhang et al 2016 fuller et al 1995 also reported that corynebacterium variabilis syn variabile metabolized tce in the presence of toluene under aerobic conditions fuller et al 1995 the growth experiment suggested that corynebacterium variabile hrj4 was facultative anaerobic bacteria wang et al 2018 however the dechlorination ability of corynebacterium variabile in anaerobic environment has been rarely reported wang et al 2018 we tested reductive dechlorination ability of this strain to broaden its application in cleanup of contaminated sites often biodegradation of tce is limited by some constraints including low dechlorination rates and toxicity of high tce concentrations to dechlorinating bacteria xiu et al 2010 therefore prior dechlorination of tce removal of halogen substituents helps reduce the toxicity of the compound for efficient microbial degradation abiotic dechlorination of tce by nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi and iron sulfide fes has been widely studied jeong and hayes 2007 jeong et al 2007 yan et al 2014 and these materials may serve as excellent precursors for microbial degradation however nanoscale zvi and fes can agglomerate rapidly in actual deployment zhou et al 2016 which may limit their removal ability during environmental applications moreover the inhibitory effect of nanoscale zvi and fes on bacterial activity may affect the biodegradation process in the hybrid treatment li et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc a non toxic anionic polymer can effectively prevent agglomeration of fes particles and thereby facilitate preparation of highly stable fes nanoparticles gong et al 2014 recently biochar and fes has been widely applied in environmental remediation gong et al 2016 lyu et al 2018b tang et al 2015 however the combination of biochar and fes as a composite for tce remediation is barely reported the biochar supported cmc stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide cmc fes biochar is expected to have higher reduction and adsorption ability and affinity towards tce compared to bare fes plain biochar cmc fes and fes biochar due to a synergistic effect induced by interaction between individual components lyu et al 2018c the supporting of biochar and cmc may also reduce the inhibitory effect of fes on the growth of microorganisms therefore a novel strategy combining chemical reducing adsorbent cmc fes biochar and biodegradation agent hrj4 was adopted for the complete degradation of tce that will be of great practical significance for the remediation of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all

si section 1 2 4 removal of tce by cmc fes biochar all batch experiments used sealed 35 ml serum bottles incubated in polyethylene glove bags under anaerobic conditions butler and hayes 1998 all aqueous solutions in the bottles were purged with purified n2 for 1 h and immediately capped with ptfe lined septa a series of experiments was carried out to determine the effects of biochar pyrolysis temperatures 250 700 c cmc fes biochar dosages 0 03 0 42 g l 1 and initial ph 6 0 9 0 on tce adsorption and degradation to investigate the biochar pyrolysis temperature effect cmc fes biochar250 cmc fes biochar300 cmc fes biochar450 cmc fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar700 was added to 34 3 ml of deoxygenated deionized water at 0 12 g l 1 the initial solution ph 7 0 was not modified the bottles were spiked with 0 7 ml tce stock solution 498 mg tce l 1 of 2 methanol to reach an initial tce concentration of 10 mg l 1 in a total mixture volume of 35 ml and incubated for 48 h the volume fraction of methanol in all the microcosms was 0 04 0 1 that can avoid co solvent effect being a better product optimum dosage of cmc fes biochar600 was investigated by adding various amounts 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 18 0 30 or 0 42 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 to 35 ml tce solution 10 mg tce l 1 and incubating for 48 h to test the initial ph effect same experimental approach was used as described above except 0 1 m tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris buffer was used to replace deionized water tris organic buffer was chosen because of its negligible interaction with ferrous ions in solution the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired value i e 6 0 7 0 8 0 or 9 0 with hcl 0 1 1 m or naoh 0 1 1 m in all experiments the bottles were purged with n2 gas sealed with ptfe lined rubber septa and agitated at 180 rpm on a reciprocating shaker hny 2102c honour instrument co ltd tianjin china for 48 h in the dark at 30 c after the incubations the bottles were settled by gravity for 30 min to separate the aqueous phase from the solids an aliquot of the solution phase was withdrawn using a gastight syringe and analyzed for aqueous tce concentration control tests were conducted in the absence of the composites under otherwise identical conditions all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 before we used the hybrid hrj4 and cmc fes biochar600 system for tce removal the system compatibility was evaluated by assessing the effect of chemical adsorbents on the growth of hrj4 the bacterial strain corynebacterium variabile hrj4 maintained in our laboratory cgmcc no 10134 zhang et al 2016 was cultivated to the logarithmic phase in lb medium 30 c 180 rpm and used in the subsequent experiments unless indicated otherwise the batch experiments were carried out in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks under anaerobic conditions as described in section 2 4 the flasks containing 100 ml of lb medium and 1 ml hrj4 logarithmic phase were amended with biochar600 fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 at 0 25 g l 1 the erlenmeyer flasks were then incubated at 30 c and 180 rpm on a reciprocating incubator shaker for 36 h hny 2102c honour instrument co ltd tianjin china control tests were conducted in the absence of adsorbents chemical reductants under identical conditions periodically the erlenmeyer flasks were settled by gravity for 15 min to separate the aqueous phase from the solid and 1 ml culture was sampled with a n2 filled syringe for optical density measurement at 600 nm using an uv vis spectrophotometer 754 chuangyuanbo technology development tianjin china the interference of adsorbents chemical reductants with absorbance was corrected with the samples that contained only adsorbents chemical reductants the experiments were conducted in triplicate under sterile environment and the coefficient of variation cv of replications within each batch experiment was 6 effect of different application rates 0 05 0 10 or 0 25 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 on the growth of hrj4 was also determined using the same conditions and procedures as described above 2 6 degradation of tce by hybrid cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 system hrj4 in lb medium was harvested during logarithmic phase by centrifuging the bacterium suspension at 5000 rpm and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and cells were washed with sterilized normal saline water for three times the final hrj4 cell suspension in 5 ml sterilized normal saline water was kept in an anaerobic chamber and stored for 30 min before its subsequent use in the tce degradation experiments two sets of experiments were conducted to examine how order of addition of cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 would affect tce degradation no additional electron donors were added with the cmc fes biochar600 and or hrj4 in the first set of experiment cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 were added simultaneously 0 06 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 and 0 25 ml of hrj4 cell suspension were mixed with 34 3 ml deoxygenated water resulting in a cell density of 0 5 od at 600 nm the mixture was adjusted to ph 7 0 as our preliminary results showed that hrj4 could effectively grow at the ph range from 6 0 to 9 0 with an optimum ph of 7 0 zhang et al 2016 the initial tce concentration in the solution was 10 mg l 1 established using method described in section 2 4 in the second set of experiment cmc fes biochar600 at 0 06 g l 1 was added to the tce solution 10 mg l 1 first and incubated for 24 h for the reaction dechlorination of tce composite was separated by filtering the suspensions using a 0 22 μm hydrophilic ptfe syringe filter dikma technologies inc lake forest ca usa the supernatant containing tce products was injected into sealed 35 ml anaerobic ptfe capped serum bottle that subsequently received 0 25 ml of hrj4 cell suspension yielding an od600 of 0 5 the culture was incubated for 24 h to compare the hybrid system with the performance of individual components 0 12 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 or 0 5 ml of hrj4 cell suspension od600 1 0 was added to 35 ml tce solution 10 mg l 1 and incubated for 48 h control tests were also conducted in the absence of the cmc fes biochar600 as well as hrj4 under otherwise identical conditions following these experiments degradation kinetics of tce was studied under the determined optimal order of addition of cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 an aliquot of the solution phase was withdrawn using a gastight syringe at predetermined times 0 48 h and analyzed for aqueous tce and its degradation products the chloride concentration was also determined to calculate the degradation mass balance 2 7 analytical methods tce concentration was determined by hplc waters 1525 waters milford massachusetts usa equipped with a 2487 uv detector and a thermal scientific c18 column 250 4 6 mm the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 deionized water with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 determination of tce was performed at a wavelength of 214 nm with a detection limit of 0 2 mg l 1 using a sample volume of 80 μl the tce was quantified using linear calibration curve r 2 0 9995 developed using external standards any potential loss of tce was determined by calculating the difference between the added spiked and the measured aqueous tce concentrations in the control experiment without any material only 3 of tce was diminished over the reaction period indicating that the loss of tce from solutions was negligible cis dce trans dce 1 1 dce vc acetylene and ethylene concentrations were determined by 6850 agilent hp gas chromatograph gc agilent ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd procedures for gc analyses are described in si section 2 concentrations of chloride ions were determined using a dionex dx 120 ion chromatograph separation was achieved with an ionpac as14 column dionex using 3 5 mm sodium carbonate and 1 0 mm sodium bicarbonate eluent and the analyte was detected using chemical suppressor conductivity detector the concentration of total fe was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo elemental waltham ma usa the method achieved the detection limit of 2 0 μg l 1 for fe 3 results and discussion in this study we investigated the effectiveness of a novel hybrid system comprising composite cmc fes biochar and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 for the complete degradation of tce the system was developed by evaluating cmc fes biochar prepared at various biochar pyrolysis temperatures characterizing the properties of cmc fes biochars assessing biochar pyrolysis temperature cmc fes biochar dosage and solution ph determining the effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 and comparing the effect of order of addition of cmc fes biochar and hrj4 on the tce removal and degradation rate finally we explore the possible degradation pathway mechanism the hybrid system used to remove tce from water 3 1 characterization of cmc fes biochar sem image of the bare fes showed the aggregation of fes as flocs fig 1 a after biochar supporting cmc fes biochar clearly defined and discrete fes was observed on the surface of biochar fig 1b f indicating that fes was successfully attached onto the surface of biochar the elemental analyses further proved the existence of fes in cmc fes biochar composite si section 3 and table s1 the morphological observations reveal that biochar was more porous and rough and particles were smaller as pyrolysis temperature increased from 250 to 700 c that resulted in more uniform attachment of fes fig 1b f and creation of larger specific surface area and pore volume yielding more sorption sites the cmc fes biochar600 had the greatest specific surface area and pore volume table s2 the hydrodynamic diameter of cmc fes fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 determined were 222 1045 and 254 nm respectively fig s1 measurements of the hydrodynamic diameters showed that the fes particles were stabilized by the cmc fig s2 no hydrodynamic diameter was determined for the bare fes and tce laden cmc fes biochar due to the rapid agglomeration of fes and the oxidation of cmc fes biochar by tce respectively because of the submicron sizes the cmc fes and cmc fes biochar were better dispersed in di water than the bare fes and fes biochar fig s2 upon tce addition the tce laden cmc fes biochar settled or floated within 30 min suggesting that the redox reaction between cmc fes biochar and tce reduced the stability of cmc fes biochar evidently the combination of biochar cmc and fes resulted in larger specific surface area smaller hydrodynamic diameter and greater stability than respective fes biochar cmc fes and fes biochar compared to the theoretical biochar to fes mass ratio of 1 1 the calculated biochar to fes mass ratios were 0 46 1 0 69 1 0 79 1 0 91 1 and 0 93 1 for biochars pyrolyzed at 250 c 300 c 450 c 600 c and 700 c respectively the results revealed that the fes to biochar ratio did not decrease below 1 which further proved that biochar was favorable for fes attachment table s3 it should be noted that the ratios of biochar to fes were smaller than the theoretical ratios 1 1 for low temperature biochars e g 250 c 300 c and 450 c probably due to the settling of heavy biochar cmc fes biochar250 cmc fes biochar300 and cmc fes biochar450 at the bottom during the coating process xrd patterns of biochar600 fes and cmc fes biochar600 are shown in fig s3 biochar600 displayed a diffraction peak at 22 0 corresponding to a layer to layer distance d spacing of 0 41 nm which was attributed to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups i e oh o c o and c o groups table s4 lyu et al 2017 the characteristic peaks of fes 27 0 31 9 34 3 38 0 46 4 52 8 59 2 and 64 1 assigned to the indices 101 004 200 110 204 205 303 and 222 with planes jcpds no 23 1120 were observed on the surface of cmc fes biochar600 which proved the presence of fes within the cmc fes biochar600 composite bacik et al 2012 the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 18 7 22 8 23 6 and 25 8 suggested partial oxidation of fes vijayakumar et al 2000 the point of zero charge for biochar600 fes and fes biochar600 occurred at ph 5 7 5 0 and 5 4 respectively fig 2 d the zeta potential of cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 decreased from 20 0 to 47 0 mv and from 11 9 to 51 7 mv respectively as equilibrium ph increased from 2 3 to 9 0 cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 have a negative surface charge over the ph range of 2 3 9 0 the low isoelectric point of cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 implied the attachment of cmc pka 4 3 lyu et al 2017 3 2 effects of biochar pyrolysis temperature sorbent dosage and solution ph on tce removal the effect of different pyrolysis temperatures on tce removal efficiency of biochar was assessed fig 2a the percentage of tce removal increased from 48 0 to 58 8 with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 250 to 700 c which is attributed to the greater surface area pore volume lower polarity and thus more sorption sites of biochar produced at higher temperature tables s1 and s2 these results can be proven by the fact that the increase of tce removal was linearly correlated to the surface area pore volume and o c ratio of biochars produced at different temperature si fig s4 a c compared to plain biochars cmc fes biochar offered 1 3 1 7 fold greater tce removal at all pyrolysis temperature fig 2a which could be attributed to the incorporation of fes into biochar that enhanced adsorption degradation capacity of the cmc fes biochar si section 3 as we discussed in supporting information section 3 in this study increased o c ratio resulted in lower hydrophobicity of cmc fes biochar table s1 which diminished the tce sorption however fes coated on the surface of biochar provided additional degradation sites resulting in enhanced tce uptake the correlations between surface area and pore volume of cmc fes biochar and tce removal were more significant as compared to biochar alone si fig s4 d e which further proved the important role of fes in tce removal our sem and biochar to fes mass ratio results showed that pyrolysis temperature increased from 250 to 700 c resulting in more uniform attachment of fes tce removal efficiency of cmc fes biochars was observed in the order cmc fes biochar600 cmc fes biochar700 cmc fes biochar450 cmc fes biochar300 cmc fes biochar250 therefore cmc fes biochar600 was selected and used for the subsequent experiments effect of different concentrations of cmc fes biochar600 on tce removal is shown in fig 2b the percentage of tce removal increased from 16 5 to 80 as cmc fes biochar600 dosage increased from 0 03 to 0 18 g l 1 further increase in cmc fes biochar600 concentration completely removed tce from water the initial solution ph 7 0 was not modified and the final solution ph was 9 0 9 2 9 2 9 4 9 5 and 9 7 for dosage of 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 18 0 30 and 0 42 g l 1 respectively the increasing final ph suggested the dechlorination of tce by cmc fes biochar600 the final solution ph increased slightly with increasing cmc fes biochar600 dosage which might facilitate tce dechlorination additionally increasing dosage provided more materials for adsorption and reduction similarly when tce uptake was calculated increasing the cmc fes biochar600 application rate from 0 03 to 0 12 g l 1 increased the tce uptake from 52 9 to 55 3 mg g 1 further increasing the dosage to 0 18 0 30 and 0 42 g l 1 resulted in a rapid decrease of tce uptake 49 4 30 2 and 22 9 mg g 1 respectively as the greatest efficiency 55 3 mg g 1 of cmc fes biochar600 was achieved at 0 12 g l 1 this optimum application rate was used in the subsequent experiments tce removal by biochar600 fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 was also studied at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 fig 2c the tce removal by biochar600 remained constant at 40 41 over ph range of 6 0 9 0 indicating that the biochar surfaces were not ph responsive however fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 displayed greater affinity for tce at increasing solution ph which is consistent with previous observations in iron sulfide systems butler and hayes 2001 dong et al 2017 higher tce removal by fes containing system at increasing ph is ascribed to deprotonation of surface functional groups that can produce higher electron density for reductive dechlorination of tce butler and hayes 1999 2001 kim et al 2013 also confirmed the important role of negatively charged surface species deprotonated surfaces in the tce reduction by fes coated iron nanoparticles at higher ph levels kim et al 2013 alternatively the ph effect on tce degradation could be related to the surface charge of the adsorbents chemical reductants fig 2d all materials had a negative surface charge over the experimental ph range of 6 0 9 0 cmc fes biochar600 had the strongest negative surface charge the zeta potential decreased from 32 5 to 51 7 mv as equilibrium ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 and could result in increased rates of tce degradation within the experimental ph range ph 6 0 9 0 tested the cmc fes biochar600 exhibited higher reactivity towards tce compared with the plain biochar600 bare fes cmc fes and fes biochar600 which is attributed to the highly reactive and negative surface charges on cmc fes biochar600 lyu et al 2017 3 3 effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 the growth of hrj4 on lb medium was assessed in the presence of biochar bare fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 applied at 0 25 g l 1 fig 3 a compared to the control without adsorbents chemical reductants biochar600 increased the growth of hrj4 from od 1 74 to 2 02 in the late logarithmic phase 25 h bare fes showed significant inhibitory effect on hrj4 the lag phase increased from 4 to 12 h and the maximum cell density decreased from od 1 74 to 1 39 the result is consistent with the work of lee et al 2008 who reported inhibited bacterial growth by iron nanoparticles through physical coating oxidative stress and membrane disruption lee et al 2008 the stabilization of cmc cmc fes or supporting of biochar fes biochar600 reduced the toxicity of fes as evidenced by increasing the growth of hrj4 from od 1 39 for fes to 1 72 for cmc fes and to 1 74 for fes biochar600 in the late log phase respectively hence upon cmc stabilization and biochar600 supporting the inhibitory effect of cmc fes biochar600 on hrj4 decreased though the lag phase remained 12 h the bacterial growth increased from od 1 74 to 1 98 fig 3a these results indicated that the combination of biochar cmc and fes had prevented the adhesion of fes particle onto cell membrane that reduced the toxicity of fes and promoted the growth of hrj4 as well li et al 2010 once cmc fes biochar600 was determined as a suitable material for strain hrj4 growth the effect of different application rates 0 05 0 25 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 on the growth of hrj4 was determined fig 3b the lag phase of control treatment was 4 h increasing the cmc fes biochar600 dosage from 0 05 to 0 25 g l 1 prolonged the lag phase from 6 to 12 h indicating that the hrj4 need more time for acclimation to the incremental addition of cmc fes biochar600 as time passed the higher application rates 0 10 and 0 25 g l 1 eventually increased the growth of hrj4 in the late logarithmic phase 18 h these results might indicate the synergistic effect of cmc protection and higher carbon nutrients source provided by biochar zhou et al 2014 found that cmc stabilized nzvi were less toxic than the uncoated counterpart the stabilization might alter surface reactivity and change iron cell interaction protecting bacteria cells in stabilized nanoparticles zhou et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 found that the addition of biochar stimulated the growth of bacteria which could be associated with the nutrients provided by the biochar jiang et al 2017 3 4 degradation of tce by hybrid hrj4 and cmc fes biochar600 system tce can be degraded by hrj4 and directly by adsorbents chemical reductants as well fig 4 a this chemical activity can be ascribed to 1 adsorption of tce onto biochar600 fes and cmc fes biochar600 surfaces through surface pores and 2 reduction of tce by fes and reductive functional groups e g phenolic hydroxyl table s4 on the surfaces of biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 yang et al 2014 compared with bacteria strain hrj4 alone bacterial application whether mixed with the adsorbent chemical reductant or added after the adsorbent chemical reductant yielded 1 7 3 3 folds higher removal of tce this trend in tce removal has been observed previously using nzvi ronavari et al 2016 which suggested that chemical dechlorination and or adsorption by adsorbents and microbial dechlorination degradation by hrj4 had synergistic effect when applied in combination tce removal rate followed the order the addition of hrj4 after adsorbents chemical reductants adsorbents chemical reductant and hrj4 added at the same time adsorbents chemical reductants or hrj4 alone bare fes biochar600 cmc fes biochar600 or hrj4 we have demonstrated that hrj4 grew well in the presence of biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 however the toxicity of tce on hrj4 could decrease the microbial dechlorination ability when adsorbents and hrj4 were added into the solution at the same time hence the addition of hrj4 after adsorbents chemical reductants and tce reaction had the highest tce removal the cmc fes biochar600 could abiotically degrade and adsorb a large fraction of tce reduce the hyper toxicity of tce on hrj4 and thus yield highly efficient biodegradation of tce the concentrations of final reaction products at the end of the reaction 48 h in the presence of hrj4 fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 were determined fig 4b d cmc fes biochar600 with bacterial partner displayed the highest tce degradation among all the treatments and combinations all other treatments and combinations showed the dominant presence of tce as a parent compound whereas complete transformation of tce was observed with ethylene as the major product accounting for 48 8 of the total products in the solution amended with cmc fes biochar600 followed by hrj4 the presence of chloride ion fig 4b d suggests the process of dechlorination of tce that was highest in cmc fes biochar600 hrj4 hybrid system fig 4d the result indicated that cmc fes biochar600 effectively decreased tce concentration reducing the toxicity of tce and its products for onward bacterial process it should be noted that the product yields were determined at 97 1 98 3 59 9 80 8 and 97 1 101 tce conversion for fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 respectively table s5 the absence of degradation products in the biochar600 treated solution might be attributed to adsorption of tce and or its products onto biochar600 surface as the sorption batch experiments results demonstrated that within 48 h 0 12 g l 1 biochar600 was able to adsorb 40 7 tce at ph 7 0 the dissolved iron concentration in the tce solution after chemical reduction was also measured because it is an essential trace element for microbial growth and function hantke et al 2001 reported that iron ions from nzvi oxidation was essential nutrients for growth of some microbes in a microcosm hantke 2001 in our study no detectable soluble iron 0 002 mg l 1 was found in the hrj4 treatment in fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 amended solutions the dissolved iron concentrations were 0 96 0 002 and 0 89 mg l 1 respectively the results are consistent with the finding of ronavari et al 2016 who reported a slow dissolution of iron from nzvi oxidation they did not observe any change in bacterial composition although dissolved iron reduction might provide energy to bacteria and promote their growth 3 5 tce dechlorination kinetics and removal mechanisms by cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 hybrid system tce removal mechanism was inferred by investigating kinetics of tce dechlorination and its degradation product in a time course study using the hybrid cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 system fig 5 time course tce dechlorination with the addition of cmc fes biochar600 showed that tce concentration reduced from 10 to 2 82 mg l 1 and cis dce acetylene and chloride ions concentrations increased significantly from 0 to 2 31 0 71 and 3 73 mg l 1 respectively fig 5a the results indicated that cis dce and acetylene were the major product in the reductive transformation of tce by cmc fes biochar600 the reaction achieved equilibrium at 12 h similar results suggested acetylene as the main products for chemical dechlorination arnold and roberts 2000 su and puls 1999 wang et al 2010 after the treatment with cmc fes biochar600 addition of hrj4 further decreased tce concentration to 0 2 mg l 1 after 10 h cis dce concentration also decreased from 2 31 to 0 72 mg l 1 acetylene produced in the chemical dechlorination step was reduced slightly from 0 71 to 0 58 mg l 1 fig 5b the amount of ethylene produced was about 1 2 mg l 1 much higher than the reduced value of acetylene this suggested that ethylene a main product in biological dechlorination process was from the dechlorination of tce and cis dce aulenta et al 2007 liu et al 2007 wen et al 2017 during this process dissolved organic carbon from biochar 9 01 mg l 1 other abundant redox active groups e g quinone groups table s4 and the aromatic carbon structures in biochar can serve as electron donors for microorganisms kunhikrishnan et al 2017 saquing et al 2016 tce was degraded preferentially during biological process than cis dce which was in accordance with the fact that cis dce was the predominant product during biological decholorination dan et al 2010 these results confirmed the important role of bacteria hrj4 in biological dechlorination of tce without the addition of any electron donor based on the time course of tce dechlorination the following pathway of tce removal by cmc fes biochar followed by hrj4 is proposed fig 6 1 degradation of tce by cmc fes biochar via hydrogenolysis replacement of a halogen substituent by hydrogen jeong et al 2007 fig 6 intermediate i chemical 2 degradation of tce by cmc fes biochar via β elimination

further degradation of cis dce to ethylene by hrj4 with dissolved organic carbon other abundant redox active groups and the aromatic carbon structures in biochar as electron donor fig 6 product iii 4 conclusion a novel chem bio hybrid treatment for tce removal using a biochar based composite cmc fes biochar and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 was developed the cmc fes biochar could abiotically degrade and adsorb a large fraction of tce and thus reduced the hyper toxicity of tce for further biotransformation by hrj4 time course of tce declorination indicated that tce was reductively dechlorinated via both hydrogenolysis and β elimination the cmc fes biochar increased the growth of hrj4 at late logarithmic phase though it decelerated the growth of hrj4 at lag phase compared to the addition of cmc fes biochar and hrj4 at the same time a tce removal rate of 79 the addition of cmc fes biochar followed by hrj4 has the highest tce removal efficiency a tce removal rate of 99 the chem bio hybrid process for tce dechlorination offered several advantages over other traditional technologies 1 the complete degradation of tce was reached by cmc fes biochar and hrj4 in a short period of time and 2 the environmentally friendly cmc fes biochar and hrj4 can be added directly into the natural underground anaerobic environment for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater however environmental effects on hrj4 growth and stimulation will need to be further studied as cmc fes biochar and hrj4 would be a promising in situ approach notes the authors declare no competing financial

19238,a sequential chem bio hybrid process was developed using a novel biochar supported carboxymethyl cellulose stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide cmc fes biochar as a chemical remover and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 as a biological agent for trichloroethylene tce degradation compared with cmc fes fes biochar600 bare fes and biochar600 the cmc fes biochar600 composite displayed better physiochemical properties smaller hydrodynamic diameter and higher stability and demonstrated excellent removal capacity for tce from aqueous phase a facultative bacterial strain corynebacterium variabile hrj4 growing well in the presence of cmc fes biochar added up to 0 25 g l 1 further enhanced tce removal after chemical treatment the dechlorination pathway proposed based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis revealed that tce was dechlorinated to cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and acetylene via hydrogenolysis and β elimination respectively within 12 h by cmc fes biochar addition of hrj4 strain into the reaction system effectively enhanced the degradation of the residual tce cis dce and acetylene to ethylene acetylene was the main product in chemical process whereas ethylene was the main product in biological process as strain hrj4 could reduce acetylene to ethylene effectively the results of this study signify the potential application of cmc fes biochar600 hrj4 chem bio hybrid system for complete degradation of tce in the anaerobic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords fes biochar tce biodegradation adsorption reduction 1 introduction owing to its widespread applications in the dry cleaning and automotive industries as cleaning and degreasing solvent trichloroethylene tce is the most frequently encountered contaminant in various environmental matrices including groundwater wastewater and soils bacik et al 2012 han and yan 2016 agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr reported detection of tce in 852 superfund sites across the united states tce can pose a serious health risk to public and ecosystem due to its toxicity carcinogenicity and resistance to biodegradation lyu et al 2018a zhou et al 2016 considering the common and long term health effects it is warranted to develop a technology to degrade and or remove tce from the contaminated environment various technologies are available for tce removal from water including physical adsorption ahmad et al 2013 and chemical oxidation reduction processes dong et al 2017 however most of these methods resulted in partial degradation of tce and formation of toxic intermediates including cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride vc wang et al 2010 these intermediates are not only carcinogenic but also accumulate in the food chain dong et al 2017 therefore it is very important to develop a high efficiency technology for complete degradation of tce in the environment biological degradation of tce by bacteria has been considered a promising technology for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater and soils guerrero barajas et al 2011 lee and liu 2006 zylstra et al 1989 however tce is highly resistant to biodegradation under aerobic condition little et al 1988 therefore efforts have been made to develop strategy for efficient anaerobic degradation of tce by bacteria such as dehalococcoides desulfuromonas sulfurospirillum dehalobacter and methylobacterium holliger et al 1993 krumholz 1997 little et al 1988 luijten et al 2003 xiu et al 2010 in our previous study corynebacterium variabile hrj4 accession no kp140842 1 isolated from the dagang oil field china showed excellent aerobic degradation ability for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and n alkanes zhang et al 2016 fuller et al 1995 also reported that corynebacterium variabilis syn variabile metabolized tce in the presence of toluene under aerobic conditions fuller et al 1995 the growth experiment suggested that corynebacterium variabile hrj4 was facultative anaerobic bacteria wang et al 2018 however the dechlorination ability of corynebacterium variabile in anaerobic environment has been rarely reported wang et al 2018 we tested reductive dechlorination ability of this strain to broaden its application in cleanup of contaminated sites often biodegradation of tce is limited by some constraints including low dechlorination rates and toxicity of high tce concentrations to dechlorinating bacteria xiu et al 2010 therefore prior dechlorination of tce removal of halogen substituents helps reduce the toxicity of the compound for efficient microbial degradation abiotic dechlorination of tce by nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi and iron sulfide fes has been widely studied jeong and hayes 2007 jeong et al 2007 yan et al 2014 and these materials may serve as excellent precursors for microbial degradation however nanoscale zvi and fes can agglomerate rapidly in actual deployment zhou et al 2016 which may limit their removal ability during environmental applications moreover the inhibitory effect of nanoscale zvi and fes on bacterial activity may affect the biodegradation process in the hybrid treatment li et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc a non toxic anionic polymer can effectively prevent agglomeration of fes particles and thereby facilitate preparation of highly stable fes nanoparticles gong et al 2014 recently biochar and fes has been widely applied in environmental remediation gong et al 2016 lyu et al 2018b tang et al 2015 however the combination of biochar and fes as a composite for tce remediation is barely reported the biochar supported cmc stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide cmc fes biochar is expected to have higher reduction and adsorption ability and affinity towards tce compared to bare fes plain biochar cmc fes and fes biochar due to a synergistic effect induced by interaction between individual components lyu et al 2018c the supporting of biochar and cmc may also reduce the inhibitory effect of fes on the growth of microorganisms therefore a novel strategy combining chemical reducing adsorbent cmc fes biochar and biodegradation agent hrj4 was adopted for the complete degradation of tce that will be of great practical significance for the remediation of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all

si section 1 2 4 removal of tce by cmc fes biochar all batch experiments used sealed 35 ml serum bottles incubated in polyethylene glove bags under anaerobic conditions butler and hayes 1998 all aqueous solutions in the bottles were purged with purified n2 for 1 h and immediately capped with ptfe lined septa a series of experiments was carried out to determine the effects of biochar pyrolysis

fes biochar300 cmc fes biochar450 cmc fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar700 was added to 34 3 ml of deoxygenated deionized water at 0 12 g l 1 the initial solution ph 7 0 was not modified the bottles were spiked with 0 7 ml tce stock solution 498 mg tce l 1 of 2 methanol to reach an initial tce concentration of 10 mg l 1 in a total mixture volume of 35 ml and incubated for 48 h the volume fraction of methanol in all the microcosms was 0 04 0 1 that can avoid co solvent effect being a better product optimum dosage of cmc fes biochar600 was investigated by adding various amounts 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 18 0 30 or 0 42 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 to 35 ml tce solution 10 mg tce l 1 and incubating for 48 h to test the initial ph effect same experimental approach was used as described above except 0 1 m tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris buffer was used to replace deionized water tris organic buffer was chosen because of its negligible interaction with ferrous ions in solution the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired value i e 6 0 7 0 8 0 or 9 0 with hcl 0 1 1 m or naoh 0 1 1 m in all experiments the bottles were purged with n2 gas sealed with ptfe lined rubber septa and agitated at 180 rpm on a reciprocating shaker hny 2102c honour instrument co ltd tianjin china for 48 h in the dark at 30 c after the incubations the bottles were settled by gravity for 30 min to separate the aqueous phase from the solids an aliquot of the solution phase was withdrawn using a gastight syringe and analyzed for aqueous tce concentration control tests were conducted in the absence of the composites under otherwise identical conditions all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 before we used the hybrid hrj4 and cmc fes biochar600 system for tce removal the system compatibility was evaluated by assessing the effect of chemical adsorbents on the growth of hrj4 the bacterial strain corynebacterium variabile hrj4 maintained in our laboratory cgmcc no 10134 zhang et al 2016 was cultivated to the logarithmic phase in lb medium 30 c 180 rpm and used in the subsequent experiments unless indicated otherwise the batch experiments were carried out in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks under anaerobic conditions as described in section 2 4 the flasks containing 100 ml of lb medium and 1 ml hrj4 logarithmic phase were amended with biochar600 fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 at 0 25 g l 1 the erlenmeyer flasks were then incubated at 30 c and 180 rpm on a reciprocating incubator shaker for 36 h hny 2102c honour instrument co ltd tianjin china control tests were conducted in the absence of adsorbents chemical reductants under identical conditions periodically the erlenmeyer flasks were settled by gravity for 15 min to separate the aqueous phase from the solid and 1 ml culture was sampled with a n2 filled syringe for optical density measurement at 600 nm using an uv vis spectrophotometer 754 chuangyuanbo technology development tianjin china the interference of adsorbents chemical reductants with absorbance was corrected with the samples that contained only adsorbents chemical reductants the experiments were conducted in triplicate under sterile environment and the coefficient of variation cv of replications within each batch experiment was 6 effect of different application rates 0 05 0 10 or 0 25 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 on the growth of hrj4 was also determined using the same conditions and procedures as described above 2 6 degradation of tce by hybrid cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 system hrj4 in lb medium was harvested during logarithmic phase by centrifuging the bacterium suspension at 5000 rpm and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and cells were washed with sterilized normal saline water for three times the final hrj4 cell suspension in 5 ml sterilized normal saline water was kept in an anaerobic chamber and stored for 30 min before its subsequent use in the tce degradation experiments two sets of experiments were conducted to examine how order of addition of cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 would affect tce degradation no additional electron donors were added with the cmc fes biochar600 and or hrj4 in the first set of experiment cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 were added simultaneously 0 06 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 and 0 25 ml of hrj4 cell suspension were mixed with 34 3 ml deoxygenated water resulting in a cell density of 0 5 od at 600 nm the mixture was adjusted to ph 7 0 as our preliminary results showed that hrj4 could effectively grow at the ph range from 6 0 to 9 0 with an optimum ph of 7 0 zhang et al 2016 the initial tce concentration in the solution was 10 mg l 1 established using method described in section 2 4 in the second set of experiment cmc fes biochar600 at 0 06 g l 1 was added to the tce solution 10 mg l 1 first and incubated for 24 h for the reaction dechlorination of tce composite was separated by filtering the suspensions using a 0 22 μm hydrophilic ptfe syringe filter dikma technologies inc lake forest ca usa the supernatant containing tce products was injected into sealed 35 ml anaerobic ptfe capped serum bottle that subsequently received 0 25 ml of hrj4 cell suspension yielding an od600 of 0 5 the culture was incubated for 24 h to compare the hybrid system with the performance of individual components 0 12 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 or 0 5 ml of hrj4 cell suspension od600 1 0 was added to 35 ml tce solution 10 mg l 1 and incubated for 48 h control tests were also conducted in the absence of the cmc fes biochar600 as well as hrj4 under otherwise identical conditions following these experiments degradation kinetics of tce was studied under the determined optimal order of addition of cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 an aliquot of the solution phase was withdrawn using a gastight syringe at predetermined times 0 48 h and analyzed for aqueous tce and its degradation products the chloride concentration was also determined to calculate the degradation mass balance 2 7 analytical methods tce concentration was determined by hplc waters 1525 waters milford massachusetts usa equipped with a 2487 uv detector and a thermal scientific c18 column 250 4 6 mm the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 deionized water with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 determination of tce was performed at a wavelength of 214 nm with a detection limit of 0 2 mg l 1 using a sample volume of 80 μl the tce was quantified using linear calibration curve r 2 0 9995 developed using external standards any potential loss of tce was determined by calculating the difference between the added spiked and the measured aqueous tce concentrations in the control experiment without any material only 3 of tce was diminished over the reaction period indicating that the loss of tce from solutions was negligible cis dce trans dce 1 1 dce vc acetylene and ethylene concentrations were determined by 6850 agilent hp gas chromatograph gc agilent ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd procedures for gc analyses are described in si section 2 concentrations of chloride ions were determined using a dionex dx 120 ion chromatograph separation was achieved with an ionpac as14 column dionex using 3 5 mm sodium carbonate and 1 0 mm sodium bicarbonate eluent and the analyte was detected using chemical suppressor conductivity detector the concentration of total fe was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo elemental waltham ma usa the method achieved the detection limit of 2 0 μg l 1 for fe 3 results and discussion in this study we investigated the effectiveness of a novel hybrid system comprising composite cmc fes biochar and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 for the complete degradation of tce the system was developed by evaluating cmc fes biochar prepared at various biochar pyrolysis temperatures characterizing the properties of cmc fes biochars assessing biochar pyrolysis temperature cmc fes biochar dosage and solution ph determining the effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 and comparing the effect of order of addition of cmc fes biochar and hrj4 on the tce removal and degradation rate finally we explore the possible degradation pathway mechanism the hybrid system used to remove tce from water 3 1 characterization of cmc fes biochar sem image of the bare fes showed the aggregation of fes as flocs fig 1 a after biochar supporting cmc fes biochar clearly defined and discrete fes was observed on the surface of biochar fig 1b f indicating that fes was successfully attached onto the surface of biochar the elemental analyses further proved the existence of fes in cmc fes biochar composite si section 3 and table s1 the morphological observations reveal that biochar was more porous and rough and particles were smaller as pyrolysis temperature increased from 250 to 700 c that resulted in more uniform attachment of fes fig 1b f and creation of larger specific surface area and pore volume yielding more sorption sites the cmc fes biochar600 had the greatest specific surface area and pore volume table s2 the hydrodynamic diameter of cmc fes fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 determined were 222 1045 and 254 nm respectively fig s1 measurements of the hydrodynamic diameters showed that the fes particles were stabilized by the cmc fig s2 no hydrodynamic diameter was determined for the bare fes and tce laden cmc fes biochar due to the rapid agglomeration of fes and the oxidation of cmc fes biochar by tce respectively because of the submicron sizes the cmc fes and cmc fes biochar were better dispersed in di water than the bare fes and fes biochar fig s2 upon tce addition the tce laden cmc fes biochar settled or floated within 30 min suggesting that the redox reaction between cmc fes biochar and tce reduced the stability of cmc fes biochar evidently the combination of biochar cmc and fes resulted in larger specific surface area smaller hydrodynamic diameter and greater stability than respective fes biochar cmc fes and fes biochar compared to the theoretical biochar to fes mass ratio of 1 1 the calculated biochar to fes mass ratios were 0 46 1 0 69 1 0 79 1 0 91 1 and 0 93 1 for biochars pyrolyzed at 250 c 300 c 450 c 600 c and 700 c respectively the results revealed that the fes to biochar ratio did not decrease below 1 which further proved that biochar was favorable for fes attachment table s3 it should be noted that the ratios of biochar to fes were smaller than the theoretical ratios 1 1 for low temperature biochars e g 250 c 300 c and 450 c probably due to the settling of heavy biochar cmc fes biochar250 cmc fes biochar300 and cmc fes biochar450 at the bottom during the coating process xrd patterns of biochar600 fes and cmc fes biochar600 are shown in fig s3 biochar600 displayed a diffraction peak at 22 0 corresponding to a layer to layer distance d spacing of 0 41 nm which was attributed to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups i e oh o c o and c o groups table s4 lyu et al 2017 the characteristic peaks of fes 27 0 31 9 34 3 38 0 46 4 52 8 59 2 and 64 1 assigned to the indices 101 004 200 110 204 205 303 and 222 with planes jcpds no 23 1120 were observed on the surface of cmc fes biochar600 which proved the presence of fes within the cmc fes biochar600 composite bacik et al 2012 the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 18 7 22 8 23 6 and 25 8 suggested partial oxidation of fes vijayakumar et al 2000 the point of zero charge for biochar600 fes and fes biochar600 occurred at ph 5 7 5 0 and 5 4 respectively fig 2 d the zeta potential of cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 decreased from 20 0 to 47 0 mv and from 11 9 to 51 7 mv respectively as equilibrium ph increased from 2 3 to 9 0 cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 have a negative surface charge over the ph range of 2 3 9 0 the low isoelectric point of cmc fes and cmc fes biochar600 implied the attachment of cmc pka 4 3 lyu et al 2017 3 2 effects of biochar pyrolysis temperature sorbent dosage and solution ph on tce removal the effect of different pyrolysis temperatures on tce removal efficiency of biochar was assessed fig 2a the percentage of tce removal increased from 48 0 to 58 8 with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 250 to 700 c which is attributed to the greater surface area pore volume lower polarity and thus more sorption sites of biochar produced at higher temperature tables s1 and s2 these results can be proven by the fact that the increase of tce removal was linearly correlated to the surface area pore volume and o c ratio of biochars produced at different temperature si fig s4 a c compared to plain biochars cmc fes biochar offered 1 3 1 7 fold greater tce removal at all pyrolysis temperature fig 2a which could be attributed to the incorporation of fes into biochar that enhanced adsorption degradation capacity of the cmc fes biochar si section 3 as we discussed in supporting information section 3 in this study increased o c ratio resulted in lower hydrophobicity of cmc fes biochar table s1 which diminished the tce sorption however fes coated on the surface of biochar provided additional degradation sites resulting in enhanced tce uptake the correlations between surface area and pore volume of cmc fes biochar and tce removal were more significant as compared to biochar alone si fig s4 d e which further proved the important role of fes in tce removal our sem and biochar to fes mass ratio results showed that pyrolysis temperature increased from 250 to 700 c resulting in more uniform attachment of fes tce removal efficiency of cmc fes biochars was observed in the order cmc fes biochar600 cmc fes biochar700 cmc fes biochar450 cmc fes biochar300 cmc fes biochar250 therefore cmc fes biochar600 was selected and used for the subsequent experiments effect of different concentrations of cmc fes biochar600 on tce removal is shown in fig 2b the percentage of tce removal increased from 16 5 to 80 as cmc fes biochar600 dosage increased from 0 03 to 0 18 g l 1 further increase in cmc fes biochar600 concentration completely removed tce from water the initial solution ph 7 0 was not modified and the final solution ph was 9 0 9 2 9 2 9 4 9 5 and 9 7 for dosage of 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 18 0 30 and 0 42 g l 1 respectively the increasing final ph suggested the dechlorination of tce by cmc fes biochar600 the final solution ph increased slightly with increasing cmc fes biochar600 dosage which might facilitate tce dechlorination additionally increasing dosage provided more materials for adsorption and reduction similarly when tce uptake was calculated increasing the cmc fes biochar600 application rate from 0 03 to 0 12 g l 1 increased the tce uptake from 52 9 to 55 3 mg g 1 further increasing the dosage to 0 18 0 30 and 0 42 g l 1 resulted in a rapid decrease of tce uptake 49 4 30 2 and 22 9 mg g 1 respectively as the greatest efficiency 55 3 mg g 1 of cmc fes biochar600 was achieved at 0 12 g l 1 this optimum application rate was used in the subsequent experiments tce removal by biochar600 fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 was also studied at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 fig 2c the tce removal by biochar600 remained constant at 40 41 over ph range of 6 0 9 0 indicating that the biochar surfaces were not ph responsive however fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 displayed greater affinity for tce at increasing solution ph which is consistent with previous observations in iron sulfide systems butler and hayes 2001 dong et al 2017 higher tce removal by fes containing system at increasing ph is ascribed to deprotonation of surface functional groups that can produce higher electron density for reductive dechlorination of tce butler and hayes 1999 2001 kim et al 2013 also confirmed the important role of negatively charged surface species deprotonated surfaces in the tce reduction by fes coated iron nanoparticles at higher ph levels kim et al 2013 alternatively the ph effect on tce degradation could be related to the surface charge of the adsorbents chemical reductants fig 2d all materials had a negative surface charge over the experimental ph range of 6 0 9 0 cmc fes biochar600 had the strongest negative surface charge the zeta potential decreased from 32 5 to 51 7 mv as equilibrium ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 and could result in increased rates of tce degradation within the experimental ph range ph 6 0 9 0 tested the cmc fes biochar600 exhibited higher reactivity towards tce compared with the plain biochar600 bare fes cmc fes and fes biochar600 which is attributed to the highly reactive and negative surface charges on cmc fes biochar600 lyu et al 2017 3 3 effect of cmc fes biochar on the growth of hrj4 the growth of hrj4 on lb medium was assessed in the presence of biochar bare fes cmc fes fes biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 applied at 0 25 g l 1 fig 3 a compared to the control without adsorbents chemical reductants biochar600 increased the growth of hrj4 from od 1 74 to 2 02 in the late logarithmic phase 25 h bare fes showed significant inhibitory effect on hrj4 the lag phase increased from 4 to 12 h and the maximum cell density decreased from od 1 74 to 1 39 the result is consistent with the work of lee et al 2008 who reported inhibited bacterial growth by iron nanoparticles through physical coating oxidative stress and membrane disruption lee et al 2008 the stabilization of cmc cmc fes or supporting of biochar fes biochar600 reduced the toxicity of fes as evidenced by increasing the growth of hrj4 from od 1 39 for fes to 1 72 for cmc fes and to 1 74 for fes biochar600 in the late log phase respectively hence upon cmc stabilization and biochar600 supporting the inhibitory effect of cmc fes biochar600 on hrj4 decreased though the lag phase remained 12 h the bacterial growth increased from od 1 74 to 1 98 fig 3a these results indicated that the combination of biochar cmc and fes had prevented the adhesion of fes particle onto cell membrane that reduced the toxicity of fes and promoted the growth of hrj4 as well li et al 2010 once cmc fes biochar600 was determined as a suitable material for strain hrj4 growth the effect of different application rates 0 05 0 25 g l 1 of cmc fes biochar600 on the growth of hrj4 was determined fig 3b the lag phase of control treatment was 4 h increasing the cmc fes biochar600 dosage from 0 05 to 0 25 g l 1 prolonged the lag phase from 6 to 12 h indicating that the hrj4 need more time for acclimation to the incremental addition of cmc fes biochar600 as time passed the higher application rates 0 10 and 0 25 g l 1 eventually increased the growth of hrj4 in the late logarithmic phase 18 h these results might indicate the synergistic effect of cmc protection and higher carbon nutrients source provided by biochar zhou et al 2014 found that cmc stabilized nzvi were less toxic than the uncoated counterpart the stabilization might alter surface reactivity and change iron cell interaction protecting bacteria cells in stabilized nanoparticles zhou et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 found that the addition of biochar stimulated the growth of bacteria which could be associated with the nutrients provided by the biochar jiang et al 2017 3 4 degradation of tce by hybrid hrj4 and cmc fes biochar600 system tce can be degraded by hrj4 and directly by adsorbents chemical reductants as well fig 4 a this chemical activity can be ascribed to 1 adsorption of tce onto biochar600 fes and cmc fes biochar600 surfaces through surface pores and 2 reduction of tce by fes and reductive functional groups e g phenolic hydroxyl table s4 on the surfaces of biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 yang et al 2014 compared with bacteria strain hrj4 alone bacterial application whether mixed with the adsorbent chemical reductant or added after the adsorbent chemical reductant yielded 1 7 3 3 folds higher removal of tce this trend in tce removal has been observed previously using nzvi ronavari et al 2016 which suggested that chemical dechlorination and or adsorption by adsorbents and microbial dechlorination degradation by hrj4 had synergistic effect when applied in combination tce removal rate followed the order the addition of hrj4 after adsorbents chemical reductants adsorbents chemical reductant and hrj4 added at the same time adsorbents chemical reductants or hrj4 alone bare fes biochar600 cmc fes biochar600 or hrj4 we have demonstrated that hrj4 grew well in the presence of biochar600 or cmc fes biochar600 however the toxicity of tce on hrj4 could decrease the microbial dechlorination ability when adsorbents and hrj4 were added into the solution at the same time hence the addition of hrj4 after adsorbents chemical reductants and tce reaction had the highest tce removal the cmc fes biochar600 could abiotically degrade and adsorb a large fraction of tce reduce the hyper toxicity of tce on hrj4 and thus yield highly efficient biodegradation of tce the concentrations of final reaction products at the end of the reaction 48 h in the presence of hrj4 fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 were determined fig 4b d cmc fes biochar600 with bacterial partner displayed the highest tce degradation among all the treatments and combinations all other treatments and combinations showed the dominant presence of tce as a parent compound whereas complete transformation of tce was observed with ethylene as the major product accounting for 48 8 of the total products in the solution amended with cmc fes biochar600 followed by hrj4 the presence of chloride ion fig 4b d suggests the process of dechlorination of tce that was highest in cmc fes biochar600 hrj4 hybrid system fig 4d the result indicated that cmc fes biochar600 effectively decreased tce concentration reducing the toxicity of tce and its products for onward bacterial process it should be noted that the product yields were determined at 97 1 98 3 59 9 80 8 and 97 1 101 tce conversion for fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 respectively table s5 the absence of degradation products in the biochar600 treated solution might be attributed to adsorption of tce and or its products onto biochar600 surface as the sorption batch experiments results demonstrated that within 48 h 0 12 g l 1 biochar600 was able to adsorb 40 7 tce at ph 7 0 the dissolved iron concentration in the tce solution after chemical reduction was also measured because it is an essential trace element for microbial growth and function hantke et al 2001 reported that iron ions from nzvi oxidation was essential nutrients for growth of some microbes in a microcosm hantke 2001 in our study no detectable soluble iron 0 002 mg l 1 was found in the hrj4 treatment in fes biochar600 and cmc fes biochar600 amended solutions the dissolved iron concentrations were 0 96 0 002 and 0 89 mg l 1 respectively the results are consistent with the finding of ronavari et al 2016 who reported a slow dissolution of iron from nzvi oxidation they did not observe any change in bacterial composition although dissolved iron reduction might provide energy to bacteria and promote their growth 3 5 tce dechlorination kinetics and removal mechanisms by cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 hybrid system tce removal mechanism was inferred by investigating kinetics of tce dechlorination and its degradation product in a time course study using the hybrid cmc fes biochar600 and hrj4 system fig 5 time course tce dechlorination with the addition of cmc fes biochar600 showed that tce concentration reduced from 10 to 2 82 mg l 1 and cis dce acetylene and chloride ions concentrations increased significantly from 0 to 2 31 0 71 and 3 73 mg l 1 respectively fig 5a the results indicated that cis dce and acetylene were the major product in the reductive transformation of tce by cmc fes biochar600 the reaction achieved equilibrium at 12 h similar results suggested acetylene as the main products for chemical dechlorination arnold and roberts 2000 su and puls 1999 wang et al 2010 after the treatment with cmc fes biochar600 addition of hrj4 further decreased tce concentration to 0 2 mg l 1 after 10 h cis dce concentration also decreased from 2 31 to 0 72 mg l 1 acetylene produced in the chemical dechlorination step was reduced slightly from 0 71 to 0 58 mg l 1 fig 5b the amount of ethylene produced was about 1 2 mg l 1 much higher than the reduced value of acetylene this suggested that ethylene a main product in biological dechlorination process was from the dechlorination of tce and cis dce aulenta et al 2007 liu et al 2007 wen et al 2017 during this process dissolved organic carbon from biochar 9 01 mg l 1 other abundant redox active groups e g quinone groups table s4 and the aromatic carbon structures in biochar can serve as electron donors for microorganisms kunhikrishnan et al 2017 saquing et al 2016 tce was degraded preferentially during biological process than cis dce which was in accordance with the fact that cis dce was the predominant product during biological decholorination dan et al 2010 these results confirmed the important role of bacteria hrj4 in biological dechlorination of tce without the addition of any electron donor based on the time course of tce dechlorination the following pathway of tce removal by cmc fes biochar followed by hrj4 is proposed fig 6 1 degradation of tce by cmc fes biochar via hydrogenolysis replacement of a halogen substituent by hydrogen jeong et al 2007 fig 6 intermediate i chemical 2 degradation of tce by cmc fes biochar via β elimination formation of an additional c c bond with loss of two vicinal halogens jeong and hayes 2007 fig 6 intermediate ii and 3 degradation of tce to cis dce by hrj4 fig 6 intermediate i biological and 4 further degradation of cis dce to ethylene by hrj4 with dissolved organic carbon other abundant redox active groups and the aromatic carbon structures in biochar as electron donor fig 6 product iii 4 conclusion a novel chem bio hybrid treatment for tce removal using a biochar based composite cmc fes biochar and corynebacterium variabile hrj4 was developed the cmc fes biochar could abiotically degrade and adsorb a large fraction of tce and thus reduced the hyper toxicity of tce for further biotransformation by hrj4 time course of tce declorination indicated that tce was reductively dechlorinated via both hydrogenolysis and β elimination the cmc fes biochar increased the growth of hrj4 at late logarithmic phase though it decelerated the growth of hrj4 at lag phase compared to the addition of cmc fes biochar and hrj4 at the same time a tce removal rate of 79 the addition of cmc fes biochar followed by hrj4 has the highest tce removal efficiency a tce removal rate of 99 the chem bio hybrid process for tce dechlorination offered several advantages over other traditional technologies 1 the complete degradation of tce was reached by cmc fes biochar and hrj4 in a short period of time and 2 the environmentally friendly cmc fes biochar and hrj4 can be added directly into the natural underground anaerobic environment for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater however environmental effects on hrj4 growth and stimulation will need to be further studied as cmc fes biochar and hrj4 would be a promising in situ approach notes the authors declare no competing financial

19239,increasing amounts of saline waste water with high concentrations of organic pollutants are generated globally in the anaerobic waste water treatment domain high salt concentrations are repeatedly reported to inhibit methanogenic activity and strategies to overcome this toxicity are needed current research focuses on the use of potential osmolyte precursor compounds for osmotic stress alleviation in granular anaerobic sludges upon exposure to hypersalinity shocks glutamic acid aspartic acid lysine potassium gelatine and tryptone were tested for their potential to alleviate osmotic stress in laboratory grown and full scale granular sludge the laboratory grown granular sludge was adapted to 5 r5 and 20 r20 g na l full scale granular sludge was obtained from internal circulation reactors treating tannery waste water with influent conductivity of 29 2 do and 14 1 li ms cm in batch experiments which focused on specific methanogenic activity sma r5 granular sludge was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 20 g na l the granular sludge of do and li was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 10 g na l with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source the effects on r20 granular sludge were studied at the salinity level to which the sludge was already adapted namely 20 g na l dosing of glutamic acid aspartic acid gelatine and tryptone resulted in increased sma compared to only acetate fed batches in batches with added glutamic acid the sma increased by 115 li 35 do and 9 r20 with added aspartic acid sma increased by 72 li 26 do 12 r5 and 7 r20 the addition of tryptone resulted in sma increases of 36 r5 17 r20 179 li and 48 do whereas added gelatine increased the sma by 30 r5 14 r20 23 li and 13 do the addition of lysine meanwhile gave negative effects on sma of all tested granular sludges potassium at sea water na k ratio 27 8 w w had a slight positive effect on sma of do 7 3 and li 10 1 whereas at double the sea water ratio 13 9 w w had no pronounced positive effect r20 granular sludge was also exposed to hyposalinity shock from 20 down to 5 g na l glutamate and n acetyl β lysine were excreted by microbial consortium in anaerobic granular sludge adapted to 20 g na l upon this exposure to hyposalinity a potential consequence when applying these results is that saline streams containing specific and hydrolysable proteins can be anaerobically treated without additional dosing of osmolytes graphical abstract image 1 keywords osmolytes anaerobic granular sludge methanogenic activity saline wastewater 1 introduction economic sectors such as leather tanning chemical and agro food industries generate large amounts of saline waste water that is both rich in salt nacl and organic matter lefebvre and moletta 2006 le borgne et al 2008 reported that around 5 of the globally produced industrial waste water is either saline or hypersaline this amount of saline industrial waste water is increasing due to growing industrial activities and recycling of waste water rozzi et al 1999 giustinianovich et al 2018 a viable option for removing bulk organic pollutants from this water is anaerobic biological treatment this approach also generates energy and reduces the amount of waste sludge if sludge aggregation into microbial granules can be achieved high rate anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb should be considered the excellent settling properties of granular sludge allows for a reduction in the bioreactor footprint vieira et al 2005 xiao and roberts 2010 and the high rate anaerobic reactors are already widely applied for industrial waste water treatment van lier et al 2015 there are two factors of particular importance when treating waste water with high concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod with high rate anaerobic treatment i microbial activity and ii microbial sludge granulation and stability o flaherty et al 1997 mchugh et al 2003 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2013 however high concentrations of monovalent salts have been repeatedly reported to inhibit the methanogenic activity rinzema et al 1988 liu and boone 1991 de vrieze et al 2016b and cause granular sludge disintegration with subsequent biomass washout from the bioreactors rinzema et al 1988 ismail et al 2008 jeison et al 2008 de vrieze et al 2016a microbial cells have two different strategies for adapting to high osmotic pressure the first is by increasing their intracellular ion concentration mainly k and cl the second is by up taking and or synthesizing small organic molecules called compatible solutes sowers et al 1990 oren 1999 roberts 2005 the first strategy is used by halobacteria archaea and haloanaerobiales bacteria and requires energy for adaptation of the cells enzyme machinery oren 1999 roeβler and müller 2001 müller et al 2005 the second strategy which is used by the majority of the living cells pflüger et al 2005 does not require such adaptation additionally microorganisms applying this mechanism can survive in a broader range of salinity levels roeβler and müller 2001 müller et al 2005 pflüger et al 2005 in compatible solute accumulating bacteria the response to an osmotic shock can be divided into two phases during the first phase a rapid influx of potassium ion into the microbial cell is triggered during the second phase cellular levels of potassium are decreased and compatible solutes are accumulated instead pflüger et al 2005 similar responses to osmotic stress have been demonstrated in pure cultures of the methanogenic archaea methanococcus thermolitotrophicus martin et al 2000 since salinity of waste water often fluctuates in time vyrides 2015 this mechanism is likely to be utilized by the microbial consortium of bioreactors treating several types of saline waste water several types of molecules can act as compatible solutes sugars trehalose betaine amino acids glutamic acid proline derivatives of amino acids n ε acetyl β lysine ectoine roberts 2005 and polyols roeβler and müller 2001 uptake from the bulk liquid of such molecules is bio energetically more favourable than synthesis de novo oren 1999 this explains why several studies focused on the potential of dosing osmolytes in anaerobic waste water treatment systems molecules like glycine betaine α glutamate β glutamate trehalose and n acetyl β lysine yerkes et al 1997 vyrides and stuckey 2009 vyrides et al 2010 he et al 2012 have all been demonstrated to have the potential of increasing methanogenic activity when flocculent biomass was exposed to osmotic stress in a recent review vyrides and stuckey 2016 reported that glycine betaine is by far the most studied osmolyte to date the effects of osmolytes on methanogenic activity of granular sludge are not researched so far moreover the bottle neck for application of osmolytes in practice is the relatively high cost of such molecules vyrides and stuckey 2016 recently robust anaerobic sludge granulation at high salinity levels up to 20 g na l was reported the microbial activity was sufficient to achieve a high soluble cod removal efficiency 94 at a loading rate of 16 g cod l d the source of carbon in the synthetic waste water was a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone sudmalis et al 2018 proteins contain a broad range of amino acids as their natural building blocks smith and friedman 1984 di gioia and guilbert 1999 these amino acids are known to act as osmo protectant precursors in anaerobic microorganisms roberts 2005 zaprasis et al 2014 it was hypothesised that after hydrolysis tryptone a mixture of peptides formed by digesting casein with trypsin supplied the microorganisms with the building blocks for the osmo protectants uptake synthesis thus hydrolysable proteins are potentially a cheaper alternative to osmolytes if indeed they can alleviate osmotic stress in this work the osmolytes present in granular sludge adapted to 20 g na l were first identified next it was investigated if these osmolytes their precursors and proteins were able to alleviate osmotic shock stress in four types of granular sludge furthermore the potential of potassium to alleviate osmotic shock stress was studied since its rapid uptake is reported as the first response to increase in salinity the granular sludge was obtained from two full scale anaerobic reactors treating saline tannery waste water and two from laboratory scale reactors treating synthetic waste water at salinity levels of 5 and 20 g na l the results show that not only osmolytes but also their precursors and proteins can alleviate osmotic stress in all four types of the anaerobic granular sludges 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum full scale granular sludge was obtained from two internal circulation ic anaerobic reactors waterstromen the netherlands treating tannery waste water in dongen do and lichtenvoorde li the netherlands the average influent waste water conductivity was 14 1 and 29 2 ms cm for the ic reactors in lichtenvoorde and dongen respectively the average influent total cod concentration was 6 8 g l and 5 g l in lichtenvoorde and dongen respectively the average influent chloride concentration was 4 g l in lichtenvoorde and 6 7 g l in dongen the granular sludges from the full scale reactors were pre washed with 5 g na l nutrient medium composition as described in table 1 and were stored in the same medium at 4 c before use in batch experiments this was done in order to have a defined liquid phase ionic composition during the batch experiments the laboratory scale granular sludge adapted to 5 and 20 g na l was formed from dispersed biomass as described in detail in sudmalis et al 2018 and was kept at 4 c before use in batch experiments from this point forward the granular sludge formed at 5 and 20 g na l is referred to as r5 and r20 respectively 2 2 batch experiments three types of batch experiments were performed in this study the first involved use of tryptone at high cod proportion to study its potential for alleviating salt stress in r5 granular sludge the second involved an abrupt decrease in salinity and identification of osmolytes in r20 granular sludge the third type of experiments was performed to study the potential of potassium and potential precursors of osmolytes to alleviate osmotic stress in r5 r20 do and li granular sludge a detailed description of each type of experiment is given in sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 the batch experiments with laboratory grown granules r5 and r20 were performed in 118 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 50 ml the experiments were performed in an incubator at 35 c and with a 120 rpm mixing speed the vss concentration was set to 1 g l and the cod vss ratio was 4 1 w w the experiments with full scale granules do and li were performed in automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden at a stirring speed of 30 rpm 30 s on and off and at 35 c due to the overall lower activity of the full scale as compared to the laboratory grown biomass the working volume of batch experiments was set to 200 ml additionally the biomass concentration for batch experiments was chosen accordingly and was set to 2 5 and 5 g vss l for do and li respectively the cod concentration during experiments was the same as for r5 and r20 namely 4 g l the level of sodium in each experiment was adjusted by varying the nacl concentration vwr minimum purity 98 of nutrient medium as presented in table 1 sodium originating from sodium acetate was taken into account for the final concentration calculations parallel to all batch experiments blank experiments were performed at corresponding salinity without the addition of cod to correct for biogas production originating from the inoculum the headspace before each batch experiment was flushed with nitrogen gas an overview containing all of the batch experiments in this study and the main parameters is presented in table 2 previously it was demonstrated that the dominant active methanogen was the acetoclastic methanosaeta in both r5 and r20 granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 sudmalis et al 2018 therefore acetate was chosen as the main electron donor furthermore data from one of the full scale ic reactors operator revealed that the reactor was operated at 7 6 3 8 meq l of effluent volatile fatty acids vfas potentially requiring additional acetoclastic activity for conversion into methane 2 2 1 tryptone for alleviation of hypersalinity shock at high cod proportion a preliminary experiment was performed to study if peptides can alleviate an osmotic shock in acetoclastic methanogens this was done by exposing r5 granular sludge to an abrupt increase in salinity from 5 g na l to 20 g na l with and without a dosing of tryptone in the batches with added tryptone the cod consisted of 75 sodium acetate and 25 tryptone in the batches without added tryptone the cod consisted solely of sodium acetate similar experiments with r5 granular sludge were performed at a constant salinity level of 5 g na l these experiments were performed to investigate if specific methanogenic activity sma of r5 granular sludge would increase at a stable 5 g na l salinity with added tryptone compared to only sodium acetate fed batches 2 2 2 identification of osmolytes present in 20 g na l adapted biomass r20 to identify osmolytes present in 20 g na l r20 adapted granular biomass this sludge was exposed to a sudden decrease of salinity down to 5 g na l with sodium acetate as the only carbon source after exposure to the lower salinity liquid aliquots were sampled with an interval of 2 h this experiment was designed to study if amino acids or their derivatives would be released to the bulk liquid this would indicate their use as osmo protectants in the biomass pflüger et al 2005 as a control for osmolyte excretion batch experiments at a stable salinity of 20 g na l with sodium acetate as the carbon source were performed to study the specific methanogenic activity sma upon a sudden exposure to hyposalinity as well as at stable salinity of 20 g na l batch experiments for biogas production were run in parallel to those for osmolyte analysis 2 2 3 potential osmolytes and their ability to alleviate hypersalinity shocks the third set of experiments was used to study the sma of granular sludge fed with acetate along with addition of a potential osmo protectant precursor upon exposure to hypersalinity of 10 or 20 g na l the selection of osmo protectant precursors is detailed in the following steps firstly osmo protectants were detected in laboratory scale granules adapted to 20 g na l and their biosynthesis precursors were chosen to study as the model compounds secondly the addition of tryptone and gelatine was chosen to assess if peptides and proteins can also alleviate hypersalinity shock in granular sludge finally potassium was chosen as a known transition element upon exposure of anaerobic microorganisms to hypersalinity shocks martin et al 2000 the selected compounds were tryptone sigma aldrich new zealand gelatine type b from bovine bone merck united kingdom glutamic acid merck germany aspartic acid tci chemicals japan lysine merck france and potassium merck germany to shorten the lag phase of these experiments all batches were preconditioned for 1 3 days at an acetate cod level of 0 4 g l in 75 of the final working volume the salinity level during preconditioning was set to 5 g na l for r5 do and li granular sludge and to 20 g na l for r20 granular sludge after the preconditioning period additional nutrient medium sodium acetate and potential osmo protectants were spiked resulting in a final cod concentration of 4 g l and salinity levels of 10 g na l do li and 20 g na l r5 r20 a lower salinity for full scale granules do and li was chosen after preliminary experiments had shown almost no activity when these were exposed to 20 g na l the nitrogen concentration originating from addition of tryptone gelatine glutamic acid aspartic acid or lysine was compensated in batches fed with only acetate this was done through the dosing of nh4 2co3 in the nutrient medium shown in table 1 2 3 estimation of applicable osmo protectant concentration for hypersalinity shock experiments since na and cl ions were by far the predominant ions in the experiments the amount of osmo protectant to dose in the third set of batch tests was estimated based on the concentration of these two ions for example the concentration of na and cl at 20 g na l equals 0 87 mol l and 0 86 mol l respectively it was assumed that the density of the biomass is close to 1 g cm3 and the fraction of bacteria accounts for about 40 of vss in the granular sludge m m chung and neethling 1990 the amount of osmo protectant required to balance the pressure of na and cl would be 0 69 mmol per gram vss if it is assumed that the efficiency of uptake for these molecules is 100 this calculation was not corrected for the fact that osmo protectants can carry more than one charge at physiological ph mcneil et al 1999 in the case of tryptone it was assumed that after hydrolysis into amino acids mostly glutamic acid acts as the osmo protectant precursor roberts 2005 in fact tryptone is a pancreatic digest of casein where glutamic acid accounts for around 20 2 of amino residues smith and friedman 1984 this was assumed to be similar in tryptone in the case of gelatine the amount to dose was estimated based on the nitrogen content of gelatine assuming that 1 mol of nitrogen corresponds to 1 mol of osmo protectant potassium was dosed both at seawater na k ratio w w of 27 8 zhu et al 2004 and double this ratio

biogas composition measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 tryptone at high cod proportion as an effective compound to alleviate osmotic stress tryptone in a cod ratio tryptone acetate of 1 4 was added to the batches upon exposure to an abrupt increase in salinity from 5 to 20 g na l this resulted in a clear alleviation of osmotic stress for laboratory scale r5 granular sludge fig 1 a methane production curves of only acetate fed batches compared with acetate and tryptone fed batches clearly show a strong reduction of lag phase from approximately 350 h to approximately 150 h before a significant amount of methane was produced fig 1 a the maximum slope of the methane production curve increased by 86 from 0 051 nml ch4 h in the acetate fed batch to 0 095 nml ch4 h in the batch with added tryptone fig 1 a these results demonstrate a positive effect of tryptone addition to alleviate salt stress in anaerobic granules it is assumed that the increase of methanogenic activity is mostly related to the conversion of acetate rather than the conversion of the hydrogen produced from tryptone fermentation indeed based on stoichiometry the theoretical amount of methane produced from hydrogen during casein fermentation only accounts for approximately 10 of the total produced methane ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 the results of the experiment with stable salinity i e granular sludge adapted to 5 g na l r5 and exposed to 5 g na l are shown in fig 1 b the slope of the methane production curve increased by 37 from 0 16 to 0 22 nml ch4 h due to the addition of tryptone the improvement of methanogenic activity is much smaller compared to exposing the same granular sludge to 20 g na l 86 however this still shows that tryptone can improve the methanogenic activity of granular sludge that is already adapted to a certain salinity level 3 2 amino acids and their derivatives as osmo protectants in 20 g na l adapted granular sludge when exposed to a sudden decrease in osmotic pressure bacteria activate the so called mechanosensitive channels located in cytoplasmic membranes these channels allow to rapidly restore cell turgor by either selectively releasing small osmolytes or if membrane tension increases by non selectively releasing osmolytes together with small proteins berrier et al 1992 pflüger et al 2005 archaea have also shown to possess such mechanosensitive channels kloda and martinac 2002 since the granular sludge used in these experiments with decreasing salinity was previously adapted to 20 g na l a rapid release of accumulated osmolytes upon exposure to a hyposalinity shock was expected hplc chromatogram of amino acids in figs s1 a shows that during an abrupt decrease in salinity from 20 g na l to 5 g na l glutamic acid and another compound containing amine bonds were excreted by the granular biomass these compounds were not detected at the stable 20 g na l salinity as shown in figs s1 b the unknown compound was further analysed with hilic coupled to esi q tof ms and tentatively identified as n acetyl β lysine both molecules have been previously reported as compatible solutes in anaerobic microorganisms this is true for moderate salinity environments particularly in methanogenic archaea which accumulate α glutamate β glutamate β glutamine and nε acetyl β lysine müller et al 2005 schlegel and müller 2011 uptake of osmolytes is more bio energetically favourable than synthesis de novo oren 1999 therefore glutamic acid an abundant amino residue in tryptone can potentially be taken up by microbial cells after hydrolysis of tryptone where under physiological ph it would take its anionic form of glutamate sowers and gunsalus 1995 glutamic acid in its anionic form glutamate can counter balance the charge of accumulated potassium in microorganisms as well as balance the osmotic pressure roberts 2005 one must keep in mind that glutamate can be also synthesized de novo without exogenous addition of casamino acids csonka 1989 sowers and gunsalus 1995 however given the positive effect of tryptone on methanogenic activity fig 1 a it is likely that in r20 granular sludge glutamate is taken up after hydrolysis of tryptone nε acetyl β lysine is a compatible solute unique to methanogenic archaea pflüger et al 2003 and some halophilic bacteria joghee and jayaraman 2014 this osmolyte has shown to accumulate in many methanogenic archaea such as different methanosarcina subspecies methanogenium cariaci and methanohalophilus strain fdf1 sowers et al 1990 roberts et al 1992 sowers and gunsalus 1995 in pure cultures of methanogenic archaea methanosarcina mazei gӧ1 and methanococcus maripaludis it was demonstrated that the synthesis of nε acetyl β lysine starts with α lysine production from pyruvate and aspartic acid semi aldehyde pflüger et al 2003 schlegel and müller 2011 tryptone contains both lysine 6 96 mol and aspartic acid 6 87 mol smith and friedman 1984 it is expected that both molecules may have acted as potential substrate for nε acetyl β lysine synthesis in fact it appears that most of the nitrogen containing osmolytes are synthesized either via aspartic acid pathway or via the glutamic acid pathway galinski and trüper 1994 this suggests that proteins or peptides containing these amino acids have the potential to provide microorganisms with the building blocks of osmolytes in our recent work gagliano et al 2018 we showed that the dominant microorganism in granules sampled from the r20 laboratory scale reactor was the acetoclastic methanosaeta harundinacea parallel with our findings the in silico analysis of the complete genome of m harundinacea strain 6ac showed that this microorganism possesses a series of genes which products are most likely involved in the pathway for the synthesis of nε acetyl β lysine both from aspartate or lysine fig s2 gagliano et al 2018 in particular two locus encode for the l lysine 2 3 aminomutase enzyme fig s2 which activity is essential for the biosynthesis of this osmolyte saum et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates that the sudden decrease in salinity down to 5 g na l gave a steeper slope of the methane production curve as compared to r20 granular sludge exposed to the adapted salinity of 20 g na l fig 2 this result is logical because response to hyposalinity shock both in bacteria and archaea has been shown to be a mechanistic reaction berrier et al 1992 kloda and martinac 2002 and does not interfere with energy metabolism the increase in activity can be explained with lower energy requirements to maintain cell turgor at decreased salinity for practical applications this means that problems with granular sludge activity are expected with a rapid increase not decrease in salinity 3 3 effect of amino acids on sma of laboratory scale and full scale derived biomass three amino acids were tested for their potential to alleviate osmotic stress of full scale and laboratory scale granular sludge the first two are potential precursors for production of nε acetyl β lysine namely aspartic acid and lysine pflüger et al 2003 the third was glutamic acid a precursor for glutamate found in r20 biomass n acetyl β lysine was not considered in this study due to its high price compared to the other tested molecules fig 3 shows that glutamic acid and aspartic acid were both efficient in alleviating osmotic stress with all tested granular sludges this is an important observation because it shows that both osmo protectants themselves and also their precursors can indirectly alleviate osmotic stress similarly evidence of a positive effect of osmolyte precursors was recently shown in bacillus subtilis which imports proteogenic amino acids and converts them into proline to enhance its growth under otherwise osmotically unfavourable conditions zaprasis et al 2014 the improvement of sma by dosing glutamic acid and aspartic acid fig 3 a b also demonstrates the efficiency of osmolytes other than commonly used glycine betaine vyrides and stuckey 2016 the addition of glutamic acid was more efficient in alleviating salt stress than aspartic acid fig 3 a b this is in line with pflüger et al 2003 who found that in methanococcus maripaludis jj glutamate is the main osmo protectant up to 376 mm nacl approx 10 g na l and within microbial cells its concentration is unaffected up to salinity levels of 800 mm nacl approx 20 g na l the dominant osmolyte at 800 mm was nε acetyl β lysine pflüger et al 2003 upon increasing salinity a similar pattern of osmolytes was found in eight strains representing five species of methanosarcina spp sowers and gunsalus 1995 aspartate is known as a precursor for biosynthesis of nε acetyl β lysine however glutamate can act as an osmolyte directly within the entire range of investigated salinities in this study and therefore the higher observed effect of dosing of glutamic acid moreover full scale granular sludge was exposed to 10 g na l which is a salinity level at which glutamate has been shown as predominant osmolyte pflüger et al 2003 addition of glutamic acid and aspartic acid had a more pronounced effect on li and do granules from full scale ics than on laboratory scale r5 and r20 granular sludge compared to acetate fed granular sludge glutamic acid increased the sma by 115 35 and 9 in li do and r20 respectively fig 3 a similarly aspartic acid increased the sma by 72 26 12 and 7 in li do r5 and r20 respectively fig 3 b because the amount of added amino acids was calculated based on the vss amount used in the experiment more glutamic and aspartic acid was added to full scale granular sludge do and li compared to r5 and r20 table 2 this difference may partially explain the general trend of a stronger positive effect of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on do and li sludge as compared to r5 and r20 the larger difference of osmo protectant concentration between granules and bulk liquid can favour faster transport in the granules by diffusion thereby also allowing for a faster and more pronounced positive effect additionally r5 granular sludge was exposed to a salinity increase from 5 g na l to 20 g na l compared to the case of do and li where the increase was from 5 to 10 g na l the combination of r5 granules exposure to higher salinity as compared to do and li with potentially slower diffusion of amino acids due to the concentration gradient may have contributed to the less pronounced effect of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on the sma the lowest effect on r20 granular sludge can be explained by the fact that this sludge had already been adapted to 20 g na l for almost two years fig 3 c shows that the addition of lysine gave a negative effect on the sma of all tested granules as already observed in anaerobic batch experiments by wagner et al 2012 the decrease in sma was 6 24 and 14 6 for r20 li and do respectively no explanation for this result could be found 3 4 effect of tryptone and gelatine on sma of laboratory scale and full scale biomass tryptone and gelatine both had a positive effect on the sma for all granular sludges tested with tryptone giving a higher improvement of sma compared to gelatine fig 4 the average increase of sma by addition of tryptone was 36 17 179 and 48 for r5 r20 li and do respectively the addition of gelatine resulted in an sma increase of 30 14 23 and 13 for r5 r20 li and do respectively the more pronounced improvement of sma with tryptone compared to gelatine fig 4 can be explained in several ways firstly gelatine needs to undergo more hydrolysis steps compared to tryptone before its amino residues can be taken up by microbial cells this may be a rate limiting step this also implies gelatine would be less efficient than tryptone to alleviate osmotic stress upon abrupt increase in osmotic pressure secondly tryptone was added in a higher concentration compared to gelatine see table 2 this was done because the dose of tryptone was based only on its glutamic acid content whereas the dose of gelatine was based on its nitrogen content as a result potentially more osmolyte precursors in a form of other amino acids were supplied by tryptone thirdly tryptone also differs from gelatine in its amino acid residue composition the most abundant amino acid sequences in gelatine are triplets of glycine proline and hydroxyproline karim and bhat 2009 whereas the most abundant amino residue in tryptone is glutamic acid 18 5 smith and friedman 1984 tryptone also contains more 6 9 aspartic acid compared to gelatine 5 smith and friedman 1984 karim and bhat 2009 as showed previously fig 3 a b both glutamic acid as well as aspartic acid are efficient in alleviating osmotic stress therefore tryptone can potentially provide more of these amino acids as osmo protectants or as osmo protectant precursors compared to gelatine the positive effect of a peptide such as tryptone and a protein such as gelatine on the activity of anaerobic biomass when exposed to high salinity is a very important outcome in this study it is important because addition of a cheap waste protein can be economically more viable than addition of osmolytes additionally a number of saline waste waters e g cheese olive oil milling and fish industry contain proteins paredes et al 1999 ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 in fact these saline waste water streams have been shown to be anaerobically treatable without dosing of osmolytes gutiérrez et al 1991 khoufi et al 2006 chowdhury et al 2010 in literature no adequate explanations were yet reported for sufficient microbial activity to achieve high efficiencies of organics conversion when treating these saline streams our results show that the presence of certain proteins which after hydrolyses can be taken up as osmo active organic chemicals in the granules probably play an important role in salt stress alleviation when treating these types of waste waters 3 5 effect of potassium on sma of laboratory scale and full scale biomass fig 5 indicates that the addition of potassium at sea water na k ratio 27 8 w w resulted in a slight positive effect on sma in do and li granules with the laboratory scale granules no clear positive effect of potassium was detected potassium at double the sea water na k ratio 13 9 w w gave no positive effect on any of the sludges at the salinity levels investigated in our study 10 20 g na l organic osmolytes are predominant within non halophilic methanogenic archaea since potassium only alleviates a part of the osmotic pressure sowers and gunsalus 1995 the low effect of potassium can be explained gagliano et al 2017 reported that potassium can alleviate the osmotic stress in a continuously operated anaerobic system at 20 g na l at a seawater na k ratio in batch experiments with a na k ratio higher than sea water 359 w w a positive effect was only observed after approximately 3 weeks of incubation at 14 g na l vyrides et al 2010 in the current study the maximum applied incubation time was 10 days potassium had no positive effect during the first 10 days of batch incubation 3 6 the potential of precursor compounds as osmo protectants for anaerobic treatment in practice vyrides and stuckey 2016 recently reported the bottleneck for application of osmolytes for waste water treatment is the costs of these molecules in this contribution we demonstrated the potential of precursor compounds such as proteins and amino acids to alleviate osmotic stress in methanogenic archaea however dosing of proteins or amino acids for anaerobic treatment of saline waste waters still may not be an economically viable option however the existing saline waste waters containing proteins for example can be identified and potentially treated anaerobically moreover when possible mixing waste water streams can be considered to avoid external dosing of osmolytes vlyssides et al 2004 suggested recovery of all marketable compounds from olive oil milling waste water to make the olive oil production more economically viable our findings suggest that not all proteins from existing waste water streams should be recovered if anaerobic treatment is to be applied there is a large potential for anaerobic biological treatment application in the saline waste water domain in the eu the annual fish catch in 2015 was reported to be 5 14 million tonnes eurostat 2018c the annual production of olive oil in 2017 for the eu was 10 2 million tonnes 91 of this was produced in greece spain and italy eurostat 2018b similarly within the eu approximately 56 million tonnes of milk were used to produce cheese in 2016 eurostat 2018a the large amounts of goods produced by these industries are expected to generate even larger quantities of saline waste water as an example production of 1 kg of olive oil generates around 7 5 kg of saline waste water vlyssides et al 2004 this means that during harvest time around 70 million tonnes of heavily polluted saline waste water needs to be treated in greece spain and italy anaerobic treatment technology could become an attractive alternative for treatment of these waste waters fish processing and olive oil industry wastewaters are known to contain high amounts of suspended solids paredes et al 1999 palenzuela rollon et al 2002 such waste waters are not suitable for direct treatment with granular sludge reactors however flocculent uasb reactors can be applied instead if granular sludge uasb is the desired treatment technology suspended solids such as lipids need to be removed prior the anaerobic treatment palenzuela rollon et al 2002 most of the suspended solids in fishery wastewater are proteins and lipids palenzuela rollon et al 2002 this means that only dissolved proteins would remain in the waste water after removing these solids further anaerobic treatment with granular sludge reactors would then only be possible if a sufficient amount of dissolved proteins remain in the waste water similar considerations as for fish processing waste water should also be made for other waste waters with high suspended solids content within the microbial consortia of anaerobic reactors acetoclastic methanogens are often mentioned as the most sensitive microorganisms to high salinity feijoo et al 1995 chen et al 2008 gagliano et al 2017 as such this study focuses only on methanogenic activity however effective anaerobic treatment of complex wastewater is achieved by a diverse microbial community o flaherty et al 2006 and all microorganisms involved in the biodegradation process should be able to cope with the osmotic stress for successful treatment this means that both archaea and bacteria need to synthesize accumulate osmo protectants a potential advantage of precursor compounds like tryptone and gelatine for osmo protection lies in their chemical composition after hydrolysis potentially diverse groups of microorganisms can be supplied with substrates for osmolyte synthesis in our recent work successful sludge granulation in uasb reactors treating wastewater with a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone at salinity levels as high as 20 g na l was shown sudmalis et al 2018 the high bacterial and methanogenic activity within these uasb reactors is explained by the presence of tryptone in the influent which may have indirectly supplied the microbial community with precursors of osmolytes further research should be targeted to study the effects of compounds like gelatine and tryptone on specific microbial groups driving granules formation upon exposure to osmotic stress furthermore it is important to understand shifts in microbial communities when different osmoprotectant precursors substrates are used during long term continuous flow studies because microbial communities can explain effectiveness of different precursor compounds of osmolytes as well as potentially reveal the key microorganism driving the granulation process 4 conclusions the results obtained in these batch experiments allow us to conclude the following glutamic acid and n acetyl β lysine are the sole osmo protectants in anaerobic granular biomass grown in a uasb on a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone 3 2 1 on cod basis and adapted to 20 g na l glutamic acid and aspartic acid as well as the non hydrolysed tryptone and gelatine can alleviate salt toxicity of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge lysine cannot alleviate salt toxicity of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge potassium added at sea water ratio can slightly alleviate osmotic stress of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge during incubation period of 10 days potassium added at double the sea water ratio cannot alleviate salt stress of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge during incubation period of 10 days when adequate amounts and types of proteins are present in the waste water streams with high salt content could be anaerobically treated without external dosing of osmolytes hyposalinity shock from 20 g na l down to 5 g na l does not negatively affect methanogenic activity in 20 g na l adapted granular sludge acknowledgements this research is financed

19239,increasing amounts of saline waste water with high concentrations of organic pollutants are generated globally in the anaerobic waste water treatment domain high salt concentrations are repeatedly reported to inhibit methanogenic activity and strategies to overcome this toxicity are needed current research focuses on the use of potential osmolyte precursor compounds for osmotic stress alleviation in granular anaerobic sludges upon exposure to hypersalinity shocks glutamic acid aspartic acid lysine potassium gelatine and tryptone were tested for their potential to alleviate osmotic stress in laboratory grown and full scale granular sludge the laboratory grown granular sludge was adapted to 5 r5 and 20 r20 g na l full scale granular sludge was obtained from internal circulation reactors treating tannery waste water with influent conductivity of 29 2 do and 14 1 li ms cm in batch experiments which focused on specific methanogenic activity sma r5 granular sludge was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 20 g na l the granular sludge of do and li was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 10 g na l with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source the effects on r20 granular sludge were studied at the salinity level to which the sludge was already adapted namely 20 g na l dosing of glutamic acid aspartic acid gelatine and tryptone resulted in increased sma compared to only acetate fed batches in batches with added glutamic acid the sma increased by 115 li 35 do and 9 r20 with added aspartic acid sma increased by 72 li 26 do 12 r5 and 7 r20 the addition of tryptone resulted in sma increases of 36 r5 17 r20 179 li and 48 do whereas added gelatine increased the sma by 30 r5 14 r20 23 li and 13 do the addition of lysine meanwhile gave negative effects on sma of all tested granular sludges potassium at sea water na k ratio 27 8 w w had a slight positive effect on sma of do 7 3 and li 10 1 whereas at double the sea water ratio 13 9 w w had no pronounced positive effect r20 granular sludge was also exposed to hyposalinity shock from 20 down to 5 g na l glutamate and n acetyl β lysine were excreted by microbial consortium in anaerobic granular sludge adapted to 20 g na l upon this exposure to hyposalinity a potential consequence when applying these results is that saline streams containing specific and hydrolysable proteins can be anaerobically treated without additional dosing of osmolytes graphical abstract image 1 keywords osmolytes anaerobic granular sludge methanogenic activity saline wastewater 1 introduction economic sectors such as leather tanning chemical and agro food industries generate large amounts of saline waste water that is both rich in salt nacl and organic matter lefebvre and moletta 2006 le borgne et al 2008 reported that around 5 of the globally produced industrial waste water is either saline or hypersaline this amount of saline industrial waste water is increasing due to growing industrial activities and recycling of waste water rozzi et al 1999 giustinianovich et al 2018 a viable option for removing bulk organic pollutants from this water is anaerobic biological treatment this approach also generates energy and reduces the amount of waste sludge if sludge aggregation into microbial granules can be achieved high rate anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb should be considered the excellent settling properties of granular sludge allows for a reduction in the bioreactor footprint vieira et al 2005 xiao and roberts 2010 and the high rate anaerobic reactors are already widely applied for industrial waste water treatment van lier et al 2015 there are two factors of particular importance when treating waste water with high concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod with high rate anaerobic treatment i microbial activity and ii microbial sludge granulation and stability o flaherty et al 1997 mchugh et al 2003 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2013 however high concentrations of monovalent salts have been repeatedly reported to inhibit the methanogenic activity rinzema et al 1988 liu and boone 1991 de vrieze et al 2016b and cause granular sludge disintegration with subsequent biomass washout from the bioreactors rinzema et al 1988 ismail et al 2008 jeison et al 2008 de vrieze et al 2016a microbial cells have two different strategies for adapting to high osmotic pressure the first is by increasing their intracellular ion concentration mainly k and cl the second is by up taking and or synthesizing small organic molecules called compatible solutes sowers et al 1990 oren 1999 roberts 2005 the first strategy is used by halobacteria archaea and haloanaerobiales bacteria and requires energy for adaptation of the cells enzyme machinery oren 1999 roeβler and müller 2001 müller et al 2005 the second strategy which is used by the majority of the living cells pflüger et al 2005 does not require such adaptation additionally microorganisms applying this mechanism can survive in a broader range of salinity levels roeβler and müller 2001 müller et al 2005 pflüger et al 2005 in compatible solute accumulating bacteria the response to an osmotic shock can be divided into two phases during the first phase a rapid influx of potassium ion into the microbial cell is triggered during the second phase cellular levels of potassium are decreased and compatible solutes are accumulated instead pflüger et al 2005 similar responses to osmotic stress have been demonstrated in pure cultures of the methanogenic archaea methanococcus thermolitotrophicus martin et al 2000 since salinity of waste water often fluctuates in time vyrides 2015 this mechanism is likely to be utilized by the microbial consortium of bioreactors treating several types of saline waste water several types of molecules can act as compatible solutes sugars trehalose betaine amino acids glutamic acid proline derivatives of amino acids n ε acetyl β lysine ectoine roberts 2005 and polyols roeβler and müller 2001 uptake from the bulk liquid of such molecules is bio energetically more favourable than synthesis de novo oren 1999 this explains why several studies focused on the potential of dosing osmolytes in anaerobic waste water treatment systems molecules like glycine betaine α glutamate β glutamate trehalose and n acetyl β lysine yerkes et al 1997 vyrides and stuckey 2009 vyrides et al 2010 he et al 2012 have all been demonstrated to have the potential of increasing methanogenic activity when flocculent biomass was exposed to osmotic stress in a recent review vyrides and stuckey 2016 reported that glycine betaine is by far the most studied osmolyte to date the effects of osmolytes on methanogenic activity of granular sludge are not researched so far moreover the bottle neck for application of osmolytes in practice is the relatively high cost of such molecules vyrides and stuckey 2016 recently robust anaerobic sludge granulation at high salinity levels up to 20 g na l was reported the microbial activity was sufficient to achieve a high soluble cod removal efficiency 94 at a loading rate of 16 g cod l d the source of carbon in the synthetic waste water was a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone sudmalis et al 2018 proteins contain a broad range of amino acids as their natural building blocks smith and friedman 1984 di gioia and guilbert 1999 these amino acids are known to act as osmo protectant precursors in anaerobic microorganisms roberts 2005 zaprasis et al 2014 it was hypothesised that after hydrolysis tryptone a mixture of peptides formed by digesting casein with trypsin supplied the microorganisms with the building blocks for the osmo protectants uptake synthesis thus hydrolysable proteins are potentially a cheaper alternative to osmolytes if indeed they can alleviate osmotic stress in this work the osmolytes present in granular sludge adapted to 20 g na l were first identified next it was investigated if these osmolytes their precursors and proteins were able to alleviate osmotic shock stress in four types of granular sludge furthermore the potential of potassium to alleviate osmotic shock stress was studied since its rapid uptake is reported as the first response to increase in salinity the granular sludge was obtained from two full scale anaerobic reactors treating saline tannery waste water and two from laboratory scale reactors treating synthetic waste water at salinity levels of 5 and 20 g na l the results show that not only osmolytes but also their precursors and proteins can alleviate osmotic stress in all four types of the anaerobic granular sludges 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum full scale granular sludge was obtained from two internal circulation ic anaerobic reactors waterstromen the netherlands treating tannery waste water in dongen do and lichtenvoorde li the netherlands the average influent waste water conductivity was 14 1 and 29 2 ms cm for the ic reactors in lichtenvoorde and dongen respectively the average influent total cod concentration was 6 8 g l and 5 g l in lichtenvoorde and dongen respectively the average influent chloride concentration was 4 g l in lichtenvoorde and 6 7 g l in dongen the granular sludges from the full scale reactors were pre washed with 5 g na l nutrient medium composition as described in table 1 and were stored in the same medium at 4 c before use in batch experiments this was done in order to have a defined liquid phase ionic composition during the batch experiments the laboratory scale granular sludge adapted to 5 and 20 g na l was formed from dispersed biomass as described in detail in sudmalis et al 2018 and was kept at 4 c before use in batch experiments from this point forward the granular sludge formed at 5 and 20 g na l is referred to as r5 and r20 respectively 2 2 batch experiments three types of batch experiments were performed in this study the first involved use of tryptone at high cod proportion to study its potential for alleviating salt stress in r5 granular sludge the second involved an abrupt decrease in salinity and identification of osmolytes in r20 granular sludge the third type of experiments was performed to study the potential of potassium and potential precursors of osmolytes to alleviate osmotic stress in r5 r20 do and li granular sludge a detailed description of each type of experiment is given in sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 the batch experiments with laboratory grown granules r5 and r20 were performed in 118 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 50 ml the experiments were performed in an incubator at 35 c and with a 120 rpm mixing speed the vss concentration was set to 1 g l and the cod vss ratio was 4 1 w w the experiments with full scale granules do and li were performed in automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden at a stirring speed of 30 rpm 30 s on and off and at 35 c due to the overall lower activity of the full scale as compared to the laboratory grown biomass the working volume of batch experiments was set to 200 ml additionally the biomass concentration for batch experiments was chosen accordingly and was set to 2 5 and 5 g vss l for do and li respectively the cod concentration during experiments was the same as for r5 and r20 namely 4 g l the level of sodium in each experiment was adjusted by varying the nacl concentration vwr minimum purity 98 of nutrient medium as presented in table 1 sodium originating from sodium acetate was taken into account for the final concentration calculations parallel to all batch experiments blank experiments were performed at corresponding salinity without the addition of cod to correct for biogas production originating from the inoculum the headspace before each batch experiment was flushed with nitrogen gas an overview containing all of the batch experiments in this study and the main parameters is presented in table 2 previously it was demonstrated that the dominant active methanogen was the acetoclastic methanosaeta in both r5 and r20 granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 sudmalis et al 2018 therefore acetate was chosen as the main electron donor furthermore data from one of the full scale ic reactors operator revealed that the reactor was operated at 7 6 3 8 meq l of effluent volatile fatty acids vfas potentially requiring additional acetoclastic activity for conversion into methane 2 2 1 tryptone for alleviation of hypersalinity shock at high cod proportion a preliminary experiment was performed to study if peptides can alleviate an osmotic shock in acetoclastic methanogens this was done by exposing r5 granular sludge to an abrupt increase in salinity from 5 g na l to 20 g na l with and without a dosing of tryptone in the batches with added tryptone the cod consisted of 75 sodium acetate and 25 tryptone in the batches without added tryptone the cod consisted solely of sodium acetate similar experiments with r5 granular sludge were performed at a constant salinity level of 5 g na l these experiments were performed to investigate if specific methanogenic activity sma of r5 granular sludge would increase at a stable 5 g na l salinity with added tryptone compared to only sodium acetate fed batches 2 2 2 identification of osmolytes present in 20 g na l adapted biomass r20 to identify osmolytes present in 20 g na l r20 adapted granular biomass this sludge was exposed to a sudden decrease of salinity down to 5 g na l with sodium acetate as the only carbon source after exposure to the lower salinity liquid aliquots were sampled with an interval of 2 h this experiment was designed to study if amino acids or their derivatives would be released to the bulk liquid this would indicate their use as osmo protectants in the biomass pflüger et al 2005 as a control for osmolyte excretion batch experiments at a stable salinity of 20 g na l with sodium acetate as the carbon source were performed to study the specific methanogenic activity sma upon a sudden exposure to hyposalinity as well as at stable salinity of 20 g na l batch experiments for biogas production were run in parallel to those for osmolyte analysis 2 2 3 potential osmolytes and their ability to alleviate hypersalinity shocks the third set of experiments was used to study the sma of granular sludge fed with acetate along with addition of a potential osmo protectant precursor upon exposure to hypersalinity of 10 or 20 g na l the selection of osmo protectant precursors is detailed in the following steps firstly osmo protectants were detected in laboratory scale granules adapted to 20 g na l and their biosynthesis precursors were chosen to study as the model compounds secondly the addition of tryptone and gelatine was chosen to assess if peptides and proteins can also alleviate hypersalinity shock in granular sludge finally potassium was chosen as a known transition element upon exposure of anaerobic microorganisms to hypersalinity shocks martin et al 2000 the selected compounds were tryptone sigma aldrich new zealand gelatine type b from bovine bone merck united kingdom glutamic acid merck germany aspartic acid tci chemicals japan lysine merck france and potassium merck germany to shorten the lag phase of these experiments all batches were preconditioned for 1 3 days at an acetate cod level of 0 4 g l in 75 of the final working volume the salinity level during preconditioning was set to 5 g na l for r5 do and li granular sludge and to 20 g na l for r20 granular sludge after the preconditioning period additional nutrient medium sodium acetate and potential osmo protectants were spiked resulting in a final cod concentration of 4 g l and salinity levels of 10 g na l do li and 20 g na l r5 r20 a lower salinity for full scale granules do and li was chosen after preliminary experiments had shown almost no activity when these were exposed to 20 g na l the nitrogen concentration originating from addition of tryptone gelatine glutamic acid aspartic acid or lysine was compensated in batches fed with only acetate this was done through the dosing of nh4 2co3 in the nutrient medium shown in table 1 2 3 estimation of applicable osmo protectant concentration for hypersalinity shock experiments since na and cl ions were by far the predominant ions in the experiments the amount of osmo protectant to dose in the third set of batch tests was estimated based on the concentration of these two ions for example the concentration of na and cl at 20 g na l equals 0 87 mol l and 0 86 mol l respectively it was assumed that the density of the biomass is close to 1 g cm3 and the fraction of bacteria accounts for about 40 of vss in the granular sludge m m chung and neethling 1990 the amount of osmo protectant required to balance the pressure of na and cl would be 0 69 mmol per gram vss if it is assumed that the efficiency of uptake for these molecules is 100 this calculation was not corrected for the fact that osmo protectants can carry more than one charge at physiological ph mcneil et al 1999 in the case of tryptone it was assumed that after hydrolysis into amino acids mostly glutamic acid acts as the osmo protectant precursor roberts 2005 in fact tryptone is a pancreatic digest of casein where glutamic acid accounts for around 20 2 of amino residues smith and friedman 1984 this was assumed to be similar in tryptone in the case of gelatine the amount to dose was estimated based on the nitrogen content of gelatine assuming that 1 mol of nitrogen corresponds to 1 mol of osmo protectant potassium was dosed both at seawater na k ratio w w of 27 8 zhu et al 2004 and double this ratio resulting in a na k of 13 9 w w 2 4 identification of osmolytes as amino acids the liquid samples were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane filters vwr syringe filters 0 5 ml of the

biogas composition and amount of methane biogas composition at the end of the batch experiments was measured as described in steinbusch et al 2008 to quantify the amount of methane produced in the serum bottles a pressure meter with an absolute pressure probe gmh3151 greisinger electronic germany was used to follow pressure build up in time the amount of methane produced was calculated using the ideal gas law the amount of methane produced in ampts ii system was automatically recorded through the ampts web based software application bioprocess control sweden and corrected for the actual biogas composition measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 tryptone at high cod proportion as an effective compound to alleviate osmotic stress tryptone in a cod ratio tryptone acetate of 1 4 was added to the batches upon exposure to an abrupt increase in salinity from 5 to 20 g na l this resulted in a clear alleviation of osmotic stress for laboratory scale r5 granular sludge fig 1 a methane production curves of only acetate fed batches compared with acetate and tryptone fed batches clearly show a strong reduction of lag phase from approximately 350 h to approximately 150 h before a significant amount of methane was produced fig 1 a the maximum slope of the methane production curve increased by 86 from 0 051 nml ch4 h in the acetate fed batch to 0 095 nml ch4 h in the batch with added tryptone fig 1 a these results demonstrate a positive effect of tryptone addition to alleviate salt stress in anaerobic granules it is assumed that the increase of methanogenic activity is mostly related to the conversion of acetate rather than the conversion of the hydrogen produced from tryptone fermentation indeed based on stoichiometry the theoretical amount of methane produced from hydrogen during casein fermentation only accounts for approximately 10 of the total produced methane ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 the results of the experiment with stable salinity i e granular sludge adapted to 5 g na l r5 and exposed to 5 g na l are shown in fig 1 b the slope of the methane production curve increased by 37 from 0 16 to 0 22 nml ch4 h due to the addition of tryptone the improvement of methanogenic activity is much smaller compared to exposing the same granular sludge to 20 g na l 86 however this still shows that tryptone can improve the methanogenic activity of granular sludge that is already adapted to a certain salinity level 3 2 amino acids and their derivatives as osmo protectants in 20 g na l adapted granular sludge when exposed to a sudden decrease in osmotic pressure bacteria activate the so called mechanosensitive channels located in cytoplasmic membranes these channels allow to rapidly restore cell turgor by either selectively releasing small osmolytes or if membrane tension increases by non selectively releasing osmolytes together with small proteins berrier et al 1992 pflüger et al 2005 archaea have also shown to possess such mechanosensitive channels kloda and martinac 2002 since the granular sludge used in these experiments with decreasing salinity was previously adapted to 20 g na l a rapid release of accumulated osmolytes upon exposure to a hyposalinity shock was expected hplc chromatogram of amino acids in figs s1 a shows that during an abrupt decrease in salinity from 20 g na l to 5 g na l glutamic acid and another compound containing amine bonds were excreted by the granular biomass these compounds were not detected at the stable 20 g na l salinity as shown in figs s1 b the unknown compound was further analysed with hilic coupled to esi q tof ms and tentatively identified as n acetyl β lysine both molecules have been previously reported as compatible solutes in anaerobic microorganisms this is true for moderate salinity environments particularly in methanogenic archaea which accumulate α glutamate β glutamate β glutamine and nε acetyl β lysine müller et al 2005 schlegel and müller 2011 uptake of osmolytes is more bio energetically favourable than synthesis de novo oren 1999 therefore glutamic acid an abundant amino residue in tryptone can potentially be taken up by microbial cells after hydrolysis of tryptone where under physiological ph it would take its anionic form of glutamate sowers and gunsalus 1995 glutamic acid in its anionic form glutamate can counter balance the charge of accumulated potassium in microorganisms as well as balance the osmotic pressure roberts 2005 one must keep in mind that glutamate can be also synthesized de novo without exogenous addition of casamino acids csonka 1989 sowers and gunsalus 1995 however given the positive effect of tryptone on methanogenic activity fig 1 a it is likely that in r20 granular sludge glutamate is taken up after hydrolysis of tryptone nε acetyl β lysine is a compatible solute unique to methanogenic archaea pflüger et al 2003 and some halophilic bacteria joghee and jayaraman 2014 this osmolyte has shown to accumulate in many methanogenic archaea such as different methanosarcina subspecies methanogenium cariaci and methanohalophilus strain fdf1 sowers et al 1990 roberts et al 1992 sowers and gunsalus 1995 in pure cultures of methanogenic archaea methanosarcina mazei gӧ1 and methanococcus maripaludis it was demonstrated that the synthesis of nε acetyl β lysine starts with α lysine production from pyruvate and aspartic acid semi aldehyde pflüger et al 2003 schlegel and müller 2011 tryptone contains both lysine 6 96 mol and aspartic acid 6 87 mol smith and friedman 1984 it is expected that both molecules may have acted as potential substrate for nε acetyl β lysine synthesis in fact it appears that most of the nitrogen containing osmolytes are synthesized either via aspartic acid pathway or via the glutamic acid pathway galinski and trüper 1994 this suggests that proteins or peptides containing these amino acids have the potential to provide microorganisms with the building blocks of osmolytes in our recent work gagliano et al 2018 we showed that the dominant microorganism in granules sampled from the r20 laboratory scale reactor was the acetoclastic methanosaeta harundinacea parallel with our findings the in silico analysis of the complete genome of m harundinacea strain 6ac showed that this microorganism possesses a series of genes which products are most likely involved in the pathway for the synthesis of nε acetyl β lysine both from aspartate or lysine fig s2 gagliano et al 2018 in particular two locus encode for the l lysine 2 3 aminomutase enzyme fig s2 which activity is essential for the biosynthesis of this osmolyte saum et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates that the sudden decrease in salinity down to 5 g na l gave a steeper slope of the methane production curve as compared to r20 granular sludge exposed to the adapted salinity of 20 g na l fig 2 this result is logical because response to hyposalinity shock both in bacteria and archaea has been shown to be a mechanistic reaction berrier et al 1992 kloda and martinac 2002 and does not interfere with energy metabolism the increase in activity can be explained with lower energy requirements to maintain cell turgor at decreased salinity for practical applications this means that problems with granular sludge activity are expected with a rapid increase not decrease in salinity 3 3 effect of amino acids on sma of laboratory scale and full scale derived biomass three amino acids were tested for their potential to alleviate osmotic stress of full scale and laboratory scale granular sludge the first two are potential precursors for production of nε acetyl β lysine namely aspartic acid and lysine pflüger et al 2003 the third was glutamic acid a precursor for glutamate found in r20 biomass n acetyl β lysine was not considered in this study due to its high price compared to the other tested molecules fig 3 shows that glutamic acid and aspartic acid were both efficient in alleviating osmotic stress with all tested granular sludges this is an important observation because it shows that both osmo protectants themselves and also their precursors can indirectly alleviate osmotic stress similarly evidence of a positive effect of osmolyte precursors was recently shown in bacillus subtilis which imports proteogenic amino acids and converts them into proline to enhance its growth under otherwise osmotically unfavourable conditions zaprasis et al 2014 the improvement of sma by dosing glutamic acid and aspartic acid fig 3 a b also demonstrates the efficiency of osmolytes other than commonly used glycine betaine vyrides and stuckey 2016 the addition of glutamic acid was more efficient in alleviating salt stress than aspartic acid fig 3 a b this is in line with pflüger et al 2003 who found that in methanococcus maripaludis jj glutamate is the main osmo protectant up to 376 mm nacl approx 10 g na l and within microbial cells its concentration is unaffected up to salinity levels of 800 mm nacl approx 20 g na l the dominant osmolyte at 800 mm was nε acetyl β lysine pflüger et al 2003 upon increasing salinity a similar pattern of osmolytes was found in eight strains representing five species of methanosarcina spp sowers and gunsalus 1995 aspartate is known as a precursor for biosynthesis of nε acetyl β lysine however glutamate can act as an osmolyte directly within the entire range of investigated salinities in this study and therefore the higher observed effect of dosing of glutamic acid moreover full scale granular sludge was exposed to 10 g na l which is a salinity level at which glutamate has been shown as predominant osmolyte pflüger et al 2003 addition of glutamic acid and aspartic acid had a more pronounced effect on li and do granules from full scale ics than on laboratory scale r5 and r20 granular sludge compared to acetate fed granular sludge glutamic acid increased the sma by 115 35 and 9 in li do and r20 respectively fig 3 a similarly aspartic acid increased the sma by 72 26 12 and 7 in li do r5 and r20 respectively fig 3 b because the amount of added amino acids was calculated based on the vss amount used in the experiment more glutamic and aspartic acid was added to full scale granular sludge do and li compared to r5 and r20 table 2 this difference may partially explain the general trend of a stronger positive effect of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on do and li sludge as compared to r5 and r20 the larger difference of osmo protectant concentration between granules and bulk liquid can favour faster transport in the granules by diffusion thereby also allowing for a faster and more pronounced positive effect additionally r5 granular sludge was exposed to a salinity increase from 5 g na l to 20 g na l compared to the case of do and li where the increase was from 5 to 10 g na l the combination of r5 granules exposure to higher salinity as compared to do and li with potentially slower diffusion of amino acids due to the concentration gradient may have contributed to the less pronounced effect of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on the sma the lowest effect on r20 granular sludge can be explained by the fact that this sludge had already been adapted to 20 g na l for almost two years fig 3 c shows that the addition of lysine gave a negative effect on the sma of all tested granules as already observed in anaerobic batch experiments by wagner et al 2012 the decrease in sma was 6 24 and 14 6 for r20 li and do respectively no explanation for this result could be found 3 4 effect of tryptone and gelatine on sma of laboratory scale and full scale biomass tryptone and gelatine both had a positive effect on the sma for all granular sludges tested with tryptone giving a higher improvement of sma compared to gelatine fig 4 the average increase of sma by addition of tryptone was 36 17 179 and 48 for r5 r20 li and do respectively the addition of gelatine resulted in an sma increase of 30 14 23 and 13 for r5 r20 li and do respectively the more pronounced improvement of sma with tryptone compared to gelatine fig 4 can be explained in several ways firstly gelatine needs to undergo more hydrolysis steps compared to tryptone before its amino residues can be taken up by microbial cells this may be a rate limiting step this also implies gelatine would be less efficient than tryptone to alleviate osmotic stress upon abrupt increase in osmotic pressure secondly tryptone was added in a higher concentration compared to gelatine see table 2 this was done because the dose of tryptone was based only on its glutamic acid content whereas the dose of gelatine was based on its nitrogen content as a result potentially more osmolyte precursors in a form of other amino acids were supplied by tryptone thirdly tryptone also differs from gelatine in its amino acid residue composition the most abundant amino acid sequences in gelatine are triplets of glycine proline and hydroxyproline karim and bhat 2009 whereas the most abundant amino residue in tryptone is glutamic acid 18 5 smith and friedman 1984 tryptone also contains more 6 9 aspartic acid compared to gelatine 5 smith and friedman 1984 karim and bhat 2009 as showed previously fig 3 a b both glutamic acid as well as aspartic acid are efficient in alleviating osmotic stress therefore tryptone can potentially provide more of these amino acids as osmo protectants or as osmo protectant precursors compared to gelatine the positive effect of a peptide such as tryptone and a protein such as gelatine on the activity of anaerobic biomass when exposed to high salinity is a very important outcome in this study it is important because addition of a cheap waste protein can be economically more viable than addition of osmolytes additionally a number of saline waste waters e g cheese olive oil milling and fish industry contain proteins paredes et al 1999 ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 in fact these saline waste water streams have been shown to be anaerobically treatable without dosing of osmolytes gutiérrez et al 1991 khoufi et al 2006 chowdhury et al 2010 in literature no adequate explanations were yet reported for sufficient microbial activity to achieve high efficiencies of organics conversion when treating these saline streams our results show that the presence of certain proteins which after hydrolyses can be taken up as osmo active organic chemicals in the granules probably play an important role in salt stress alleviation when treating these types of waste waters 3 5 effect of potassium on sma of laboratory scale and full scale biomass fig 5 indicates that the addition of potassium at sea water na k ratio 27 8 w w resulted in a slight positive effect on sma in do and li granules with the laboratory scale granules no clear positive effect of potassium was detected potassium at double the sea water na k ratio 13 9 w w gave no positive effect on any of the sludges at the salinity levels investigated in our study 10 20 g na l organic osmolytes are predominant within non halophilic methanogenic archaea since potassium only alleviates a part of the osmotic pressure sowers and gunsalus 1995 the low effect of potassium can be explained gagliano et al 2017 reported that potassium can alleviate the osmotic stress in a continuously operated anaerobic system at 20 g na l at a seawater na k ratio in batch experiments with a na k ratio higher than sea water 359 w w a positive effect was only observed after approximately 3 weeks of incubation at 14 g na l vyrides et al 2010 in the current study the maximum applied incubation time was 10 days potassium had no positive effect during the first 10 days of batch incubation 3 6 the potential of precursor compounds as osmo protectants for anaerobic treatment in practice vyrides and stuckey 2016 recently reported the bottleneck for application of osmolytes for waste water treatment is the costs of these molecules in this contribution we demonstrated the potential of precursor compounds such as proteins and amino acids to alleviate osmotic stress in methanogenic archaea however dosing of proteins or amino acids for anaerobic treatment of saline waste waters still may not be an economically viable option however the existing saline waste waters containing proteins for example can be identified and potentially treated anaerobically moreover when possible mixing waste water streams can be considered to avoid external dosing of osmolytes vlyssides et al 2004 suggested recovery of all marketable compounds from olive oil milling waste water to make the olive oil production more economically viable our findings suggest that not all proteins from existing waste water streams should be recovered if anaerobic treatment is to be applied there is a large potential for anaerobic biological treatment application in the saline waste water domain in the eu the annual fish catch in 2015 was reported to be 5 14 million tonnes eurostat 2018c the annual production of olive oil in 2017 for the eu was 10 2 million tonnes 91 of this was produced in greece spain and italy eurostat 2018b similarly within the eu approximately 56 million tonnes of milk were used to produce cheese in 2016 eurostat 2018a the large amounts of goods produced by these industries are expected to generate even larger quantities of saline waste water as an example production of 1 kg of olive oil generates around 7 5 kg of saline waste water vlyssides et al 2004 this means that during harvest time around 70 million tonnes of heavily polluted saline waste water needs to be treated in greece spain and italy anaerobic treatment technology could become an attractive alternative for treatment of these waste waters fish processing and olive oil industry wastewaters are known to contain high amounts of suspended solids paredes et al 1999 palenzuela rollon et al 2002 such waste waters are not suitable for direct treatment with granular sludge reactors however flocculent uasb reactors can be applied instead if granular sludge uasb is the desired treatment technology suspended solids such as lipids need to be removed prior the anaerobic treatment palenzuela rollon et al 2002 most of the suspended solids in fishery wastewater are proteins and lipids palenzuela rollon et al 2002 this means that only dissolved proteins would remain in the waste water after removing these solids further anaerobic treatment with granular sludge reactors would then only be possible if a sufficient amount of dissolved proteins remain in the waste water similar considerations as for fish processing waste water should also be made for other waste waters with high suspended solids content within the microbial consortia of anaerobic reactors acetoclastic methanogens are often mentioned as the most sensitive microorganisms to high salinity feijoo et al 1995 chen et al 2008 gagliano et al 2017 as such this study focuses only on methanogenic activity however effective anaerobic treatment of complex wastewater is achieved by a diverse microbial community o flaherty et al 2006 and all microorganisms involved in the biodegradation process should be able to cope with the osmotic stress for successful treatment this means that both archaea and bacteria need to synthesize accumulate osmo protectants a potential advantage of precursor compounds like tryptone and gelatine for osmo protection lies in their chemical composition after hydrolysis potentially diverse groups of microorganisms can be supplied with substrates for osmolyte synthesis in our recent work successful sludge granulation in uasb reactors treating wastewater with a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone at salinity levels as high as 20 g na l was shown sudmalis et al 2018 the high bacterial and methanogenic activity within these uasb reactors is explained by the presence of tryptone in the influent which may have indirectly supplied the microbial community with precursors of osmolytes further research should be targeted to study the effects of compounds like gelatine and tryptone on specific microbial groups driving granules formation upon exposure to osmotic stress furthermore it is important to understand shifts in microbial communities when different osmoprotectant precursors substrates are used during long term continuous flow studies because microbial communities can explain effectiveness of different precursor compounds of osmolytes as well as potentially reveal the key microorganism driving the granulation process 4 conclusions the results obtained in these batch experiments allow us to conclude the following glutamic acid and n acetyl β lysine are the sole osmo protectants in anaerobic granular biomass grown in a uasb on a mixture of glucose acetate and tryptone 3 2 1 on cod basis and adapted to 20 g na l glutamic acid and aspartic acid as well as the non hydrolysed tryptone and gelatine can alleviate salt toxicity of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge lysine cannot alleviate salt toxicity of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge potassium added at sea water ratio can slightly alleviate osmotic stress of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge during incubation period of 10 days potassium added at double the sea water ratio cannot alleviate salt stress of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge during incubation period of 10 days when adequate amounts and types of proteins are present in the waste water streams with high salt content could be anaerobically treated without external dosing of osmolytes hyposalinity shock from 20 g na l down to 5 g na l does not negatively affect methanogenic activity in 20 g na l adapted granular sludge acknowledgements this research is financed
