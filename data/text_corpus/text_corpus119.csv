595,this paper presents the results of a detailed experimental study performed to examine fluid flow in a water wet fractured sandstone rock using high resolution x ray micro computed tomography technique we systematically investigate the pore scale displacement mechanisms and governing interactions between the matrix and fracture during gas injection we perform two sets of flow experiments using brine soltrol 170 spreading oil nitrogen and brine decalin nonspreading oil nitrogen fluid systems to probe the possible beneficial role of spreading phenomena in transferring oil from the matrix to the fracture during gas injection gas injection after primary oil drainage was used to generate a wide range of oil saturations and pore fluid arrangements with both fluid systems direct visualization of the pore fluid occupancies at different oil saturations in the medium reveals the significant role that the spreading oil layers play in maintaining the hydraulic conductivity of the oil phase between the matrix and the fracture this mainly takes place at low remaining oil saturations under the spreading condition where layer drainage in the presence of stable and connected spreading oil layers is the dominant displacement mechanism in the case of high remaining oil saturations it is observed that the oil movement is primarily governed by piston like displacements as well as the ability of the gas phase to access the pore elements adjacent to the fracture under the nonspreading condition oil cannot maintain its connectivity due to the absence of the spreading layers leading to higher residual oil saturations in the matrix and lower ultimate oil recovery keywords pore scale displacement multi phase flow fractured porous media x ray microtomography spreading

leave behind significant quantities of oil in the surrounding matrix firoozabadi 2000 fernø 2012 hence any improvements in extraction of the hydrocarbons stored in the matrix requires enhancements in matrix fracture mass transfer this in turn depends on development of a significantly improved understanding of the mechanisms that control such interactions exchange of fluids between the two domains is impacted by multiple factors including fluid properties fluid fluid interfacial tension porosity and permeability of the matrix and fracture fracture aperture and wettability state of the medium despite reports in the literature regarding improvements in oil recovery from fractured systems the physics of displacement mechanisms responsible for matrix fracture interactions at the pore scale is still poorly understood this is primarily owing to the limitations of experimental technologies that can be used to probe flow behavior at the micro scale in fractured rock samples here we summarize some of the investigations in this domain micromodels have been used for decades to explore different mechanisms of flow through fractured porous media however they do not capture the complexity of the fracture morphology and their connectivity with the neighboring matrix for example researchers have used two dimensional micromodels to investigate gas injection and waterflooding flow processes through fractures shariatpanahi et al 2005 the authors mimicked a similar morphology of a fractured porous medium by inserting a single fracture in the 2d glass etched water wet micromodel in their study two sets of experiments were performed after primary oil drainage where the oil phase was connected it was reported that the average oil recovery was 75 by waterflooding compared to 60 by immiscible gas injection in their model investigation of flow through fractures using x ray macro ct scanners is disadvantaged by its inadequate resolution to map pore fluid occupancies in the fracture and matrix the fracture aperture and matrix pores are often too small to be visualized instead they usually generate average in situ saturation information for instance alajmi and grader 2000 carried out two sets of two phase flow experiments on a fractured berea sandstone sample to study matrix fracture interactions using a medical x ray ct scanner their results showed that the presence of the fracture in the rock slowed down the oil recovery from the regions around the fracture they concluded that the fracture formed a bypassing channel for both the injected and the displaced fluids other researchers used nuclear tracer imaging nti and magnetic resonance imaging mri techniques to study the effect of wettability on ultimate oil recovery haugen et al 2010 in contrast to the above mentioned technologies x ray micro computed tomography technique has proven to be effective in directly mapping the arrangement of fluids and their movements at the pore scale golparvar et al 2018 karpyn et al 2007 studied the effect of fracture morphology on the distribution of oil and water within a single fracture using x ray micro computed tomography by visualizing the fluid occupancy the authors concluded that the distribution of the fluid phases in the fracture depended on its geometry fluids saturations and wetting characteristics of the fractured rock the authors kept matrix fully saturated with the wetting fluid brine during the experiments and hence contribution of matrix to the entire flow behavior was not investigated arshadi et al 2018 performed a series of flow experiments on a water wet fractured sandstone rock using a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner to investigate the matrix fracture interactions at the pore scale under two phase flow conditions the researchers mapped fluid occupancies in both matrix and fracture to probe the impact of fluid exchange between two domains on the flow behavior of the entire medium they examined the effects of flow rate fracture aperture geometry and interfacial tension on fluid displacements in the fracture and the neighboring matrix with the advent of micro tomography imaging technique and digital rock technology the ability to directly visualize pore fluid occupancy allows us to better understand the behavior of multiphase flow in fractured porous systems this can be particularly effective in elucidating some of the critical subtleties of displacement physics encountered during three phase flow through fractured porous media for example one of the fundamental complexities seen in these systems is the ability of one of the fluids to spread in the presence of the other two as we explain later in this section the impact of this phenomenon on oil recovery is critically relevant but its impact in fractured systems is not well understood and hence a careful investigation of the problem using advanced experimental technologies is warranted in a water wet porous medium holding three phases i e water oil and gas water wets the rock surfaces and fills the crevices while gas resides in the middle of pore elements the oil phase i e the intermediate wetting fluid can form spreading layers sandwiched between the water and gas phases blunt et al 1995 piri and blunt 2004 the hydraulic conductivity of these layers could sustain a continuous oil phase in the pore space flow of oil through these layers known as layer drainage is a slow process blunt 2017 but could eventually lead to very low remaining oil saturations the affinity of oil to spread on water in the existence of gas is evaluated by calculating the equilibrium spreading coefficient adamson and gast 1967 hirasaki 1993 rowlinson and widom 2013 as 1 c s σ g w e q σ g o e q σ o w e q where σ g w e q σ g o e q and σ o w e q are the interfacial tensions ifts of gas water gas oil and oil water pairs of fluids respectively when water oil and gas coexist at equilibrium the spreading coefficient is either zero or negative depending on the interfacial tension between each pair of fluids a zero or slightly negative value means that oil will spontaneously spread as a thin layer between water and gas in contrast a negative value means that oil will form small lenses on the surface of water in the presence of gas and hence will not maintain its phase connectivity across the medium since the work of dumore and schols 1974 it has been acknowledged that the residual oil saturation can be as low as few percentage due to the flow of oil through spreading oil layers in the presence of gas and water blunt et al 1995 zhou and blunt 1997 obtained a remaining oil saturation as low as 0 1 in their gravity drainage experiments on sand packs due to the presence of the aforementioned layers vizika and lombard 1996 concluded that the oil relative permeabilities were different at low oil saturations under spreading and nonspreading conditions whereas they were similar at high oil saturations since the layer drainage mechanism played an insignificant role other researchers have focused on the impact of the thickness and stability of these layers on the continuity of oil kantzas et al 1988 blunt et al 1995 observations from micromodels studies øren and pinczewski 1995 were consistent with the above results as they showed three phase fluids distributions where the oil formed thin layers between the water and the gas phases under positive spreading coefficient however to the best of our knowledge the role of these layers on recovery from fractured porous media has not been systematically investigated in this work we examine the impact of the matrix fracture interactions on oil recovery during gas injection when spreadability plays a pivotal role to this end a high resolution micro ct scanner coupled with a three phase core flooding apparatus was used to perform two and three phase flow experiments on a miniature water wet fractured core sample the comparison of two and three dimensional pore fluid occupancy maps obtained with two different fluid systems with varying equilibrium spreading coefficients i e spreading and nonspreading systems enabled us to develop a significantly improved understanding of the governing displacement mechanisms during gas injection in fractured porous media under two very different spreading behavior this document is structured as follows we first list the details of the rock and fluids as well as the experimental apparatus and procedure used in this study this is then followed by a summary of the steps employed in our image analysis technique subsequently we present the results and include a careful discussion of the trends observed the paper is concluded with a set of key remarks and recommendations 2 experimental methodology in this section we discuss the details pertaining to the core sample preparation methodology oil brine gas fluid systems experimental setup and procedure used in this study 2 1 rock and fluid properties we used a miniature fractured berea sandstone core sample to conduct the flow experiments in this study the sample was 40 mm long and 10 mm in diameter to prepare the specimen we first drilled a cylindrical core plug 38 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length from a block of water wet berea sandstone subsequently half of the core plug s length was subjected to nonuniform stress to induce an artificial fracture using the modified brazilian test guo et al 1993 the radial stress on the plug was applied such that the induced fracture was extended only to the middle of the core a 10 mm diameter sample was then drilled from the core plug in a manner that the fracture extended only over half of its length see fig 1 the loose sand grains were gently removed by blowing nitrogen through the sample fig 2 a presents a micro ct image of the fracture area at a resolution of 2 5 µm fig 2 b shows an scanning electron microscope sem image of a site within the fracture located approximately 10 mm from the inlet of the core the image was obtained after the sample had been cleaned and dried it shows the tortuosity and roughness of the induced fracture the physical properties of the samples used are listed in table 1 to probe the effect of the spreading phenomena it was necessary to identify two oil phases that would establish significantly different spreading coefficients in the presence of nitrogen and brine such that they would develop spreading and nonspreading behaviors we selected soltrol 170 and decalin as spreading and nonspreading oil phases respectively both fluids were purified prior to use by passing them through a gravity column that contained aluminum oxide powder and silica gel this allowed us to obtain stable interfacial tensions by eliminating surface active impurities goebel and lunkenheimer 1997 the oil phases were mixed with 5 vol 1 iodooctane ch3 ch2 6ch2i each a solution of 13 wt sodium iodide nai acs reagent 99 5 sigma aldrich usa 2 wt calcium chloride hexahydrate cacl2 6h2o bioxtra 99 5 sigma aldrich usa 99 5 and 0 01 wt sodium azide nan3 99 5 sigma aldrich usa was used as the aqueous phase sodium azide was added to the solution to avoid bacterial growth during the experiments jadhunandan and morrow 1995 the gas phase was nitrogen with 99 purity the physical properties and the interfacial tension values for the fluids used in this study are listed in tables 2 and 3 the x ray dopants sodium iodide and 1 iodooctane that were added to aqueous and oil phases respectively allowed us to establish sufficient contrasts among all phases i e brine oil gas and solid in the x ray images this plays an important role in significantly reducing the uncertainty of image processing steps listed later in this paper 2 2 experimental apparatus a closed loop multi phase core flooding setup coupled with a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner was utilized to perform the flow experiments at the micro scale the imaging system was an xradia 510 versa micro ct scanner manufactured by zeisstm the core flooding setup was composed of a miniature carbon fiber core holder a series of differential pressure transducers rosemountâ usa with various ranges an 800 ml three phase separator two 300 ml accumulators and six dual cylinder 5000 series quizixâ pumps as shown in fig 3 three of the six pumps were utilized to retract the fluid phases brine oil and gas from the separator and inject them into the core at constant flow rates an overburden pressure pump was used to exert confining pressure around the core sample this pump was linked to each of the injection pumps in order to maintain a fixed net confining stress i e the difference between the injection pore pressure and the confining pressure another pump was used to regulate the core sample s back pressure by receiving the effluent at constant pressure and discharging it into the separator the remaining pump was used to compensate for fluctuations in separator pressure caused by fluid injection and withdrawal the core flooding setup allowed us to dynamically scan the core sample while the fluids were being injected this feature enabled acquisition of fluid occupancy maps while the pore fluid configurations were kept stable at different stages of the flow experiments inside the micro ct enclosure the core holder was connected to high pressure peek polyetheretherketone tubing 1 16 in in outside diameter this tubing was light weight and flexible and hence it minimized the amount of torque exerted on the core holder during the rotation this considerably reduced the amount of image artifacts a detailed description of the core flooding setup can be found elsewhere alizadeh and piri 2014 2 3 experimental procedure the core sample was first inserted into a viton sleeve to provide no flow boundary condition on its surface the sleeve and core sample assembly was then placed in a carbon fiber core holder while carefully connecting all the remaining components of the holder subsequently the core holder was vertically mounted inside the micro ct scanner the core sample was initially flushed with gaseous co2 to remove air and then vacuumed for 24 h at this stage the entire sample was imaged while the core sample was under vacuum this was performed to select the regions of interest to acquire additional images during the flow tests map the fracture topology measure the fracture aperture and obtain the porosity distribution across the core sample thereafter the core sample was vacuum saturated with high salinity brine hereafter referred to as doped brine to establish 100 water saturation numerous pore volumes of the brine was injected into the pore space in order to displace dissolve any remaining co2 micro ct images obtained at this stage of the experiment confirmed that the sample was fully saturated with brine we used high salinity brine at this stage because its x ray attenuation is significantly different than that of gas air and co2 it is worth mentioning that before starting the experiments all the three phases were sufficiently pre equilibrated for 48 h through the core flooding setup bypassing the core sample at the experimental conditions in order to establish equilibrium and minimize mass transfer amongst the fluids in the core sample during the experiments since the intensity of the doped brine in the images was similar to that of the grains the doped brine was replaced by a low salinity brine to generate an accurate and clear map of the pore space once the doped brine was completely replaced by the low salinity brine a wet reference scan was obtained at a resolution of 2 5 µm afterward the low salinity brine was again replaced by the doped brine one should note that the reference scan was not acquired when the sample was dry because introduction of brine could have slightly relocated the grains within the fracture it is to be noted that the core was periodically scanned during the flow tests and the pore configurations were always compared with the reference scan to ensure the core sample did not rotate move we always used the registration method by superimposing the wet reference image on the wet flooded image and then performed segmentation after acquiring the wet reference scan the core sample was subjected to an oilflood with an incremental increase of oil flow rate from 0 01 to 0 45 ml min this resulted in an average initial water saturation of 31 throughout the different zones in the medium during drainage we acquired quick scans at a lower resolution of 5 µm to monitor the oil saturation and recorded the pressure drop across the core sample after establishing the desired two phase initial condition gas was injected into the core sample at increasing flow rates during gas injection the fluid saturations were measured in both the fracture and the matrix after completing these steps the core sample was cleaned in order to start a new set of flow tests using a fluid system with a different spreading coefficient it is to be noted that keeping a constant fracture aperture in all stages of the experiments was one of the most important attributes of the experimental procedure used in this study any undesired variations in the aperture could adversely impact the interactions between the fracture and the matrix which in turn would make it difficult for us to accurately compare the results at each step to this end the confining pressure pump was linked to each injection pump to maintain a fixed net confining pressure during all steps of the flow experiments the flow tests using unsteady state method in which only one phase is injected at a time were carried out at pore pressure of 500 psig and ambient temperature approximately 20 c fig 4 demonstrates a schematic diagram summarizing the steps followed in this work as mentioned earlier we used only one miniature core sample for both sets of the experiments this was an attempt to enable direct comparison of the results of the spreading and nonspreading fluid systems at identical zones within the medium therefore it was critically important that we cleaned the samples thoroughly between these two groups of tests to do so the following procedure was followed at the end of the experiments with the spreading fluid system 1 gaseous co2 was injected into the core for 30 min at a pressure of 100 psig and ambient temperature to displace n2 from the pore space 2 a low salinity brine nondoped was introduced into the core to increase the pore pressure to 500 psi in order to reach the desired experimental condition 3 20 pore volumes pv of nondoped brine was injected into the core to displace and dissolve the co2 as well as the doped brine already present in the core 4 20 pv of 2 propanol acs reagent 99 5 sigma aldrich usa was used to miscibly displace the brine and oil phases from the core sample the fluid was injected at relatively low flow rate to avoid any changes in the fracture aperture 5 20 pv of the nondoped brine was injected into the core to displace the solvent 6 the core was fully brine saturated by injecting 40 pv of the doped brine into the core 7 the entire core sample was scanned to ensure it was 100 saturated with brine 3 image analysis prior to starting the experiments a scan from the entire core see fig 5 was acquired to determine a porosity based representative elementary volume rev pore size distribution and the properties of the fracture aperture this was needed to prepare the scan recipes and determine the regions of interest for imaging during the flow experiments table 4 lists the parameters of different types of scans performed in this study after evaluating the images of the entire core sample three zones i e a b and c were selected to be scanned during the experiment zones a b and c were respectively situated closed to the inlet middle of the core where fracture tip merged with the matrix and at the end of the core sample where no fracture existed we selected these sites to explore pore fluid occupancies at different topological areas of the sample while using different fluid systems fig 6 shows pore size distributions and variations in total porosity for the entire core sample the average diameter of the most frequent pores in the rock matrix was around 75 microns compared to the fracture that had an average aperture of 180 microns as indicated in fig 6 b the average porosity of the medium was reduced from 0 26 to 0 2 as we move from the inlet of the core where the fracture was located toward the outlet of the core table 5 lists physical dimensions and additional imaging attributes pertinent to these zones next we prepared three imaging recipes for the three zones each recipe included imaging parameters such as the positions of the source detector and sample source voltage camera binning pixel size exposure time types of filter and objective and the number of projections these parameters could be retrieved at any time during the experiments by recalling the saved recipes after scanning each region the entire tomogram sets i e images from the ct scanner were converted into raw 3d images ready for visualization the reconstruction process was carried out by using xm reconstructor software and adjusting different parameters such as the center shift to eliminate image artifacts pergeos 1 1 and avizo 9 0 1 by thermo fisher scientific were utilized to process the reconstructed 3d images obtained from the ct scanner the image processing steps included 1 filtering 2 arithmetic operations 3 thresholding and segmentation and 4 quantification more details about these steps can be found elsewhere wildenschild and sheppard 2014 alizadeh et al 2013 the above mentioned data processing procedure produced sharp demarcation of the pore space and saturating fluid interfaces during various stages of the flow experiments as illustrated in fig 7 as seen in this figure we started the image analysis process by using a reference image subfigure a that was used to create a pore fracture map as shown in subfigure b because the solid phase had an x ray attenuation similar to that of the doped brine we multiplied the wet images see subfigure c that had brine oil and gas by the created pore fracture map in order to eliminate the rock grains from the images this would provide a clear image including only the pore space with a three phase occupancy ready to be studied after this step we used the interactive thresholding method to segment brine oil and gas phases based on different threshold values as listed in table 6 4 results and discussion in this section we first present the pore scale displacement events that take place during primary oil drainage and secondary gas injection next we discuss the observations emerged from the micro ct images regarding the impact of the spreading phenomena on fluid exchange between the matrix and the fracture at different oil saturations and then explain these observations using the relevant displacement mechanisms oil was initially introduced into the fully brine saturated core sample to establish a desired initial brine saturation prior to gas injection the initial flow rate of oil was incrementally increased from 0 01 to 0 45 ml min resulting in an average initial brine saturation sw i of 31 for zones a b and c oil as the nonwetting phase relative to water initially invaded the fracture opening through a pore scale piston like displacement because the fracture had a lower threshold capillary pressure compared to those of the matrix pores the average fracture aperture was approximately 180 µm which was more than twice the average diameter of the matrix pores a three dimensional image showing the variations of the aperture map thickness for the whole fracture is presented in fig 8 once the capillary pressure was increased to the threshold value required to invade the matrix pores oil displaced water from large water filled pore elements in the surrounding matrix subsequently and with further increase in the flow rate oil invaded the medium sized pores and at the same time displaced water from the pores of the intact matrix zone i e zone c the absence of a fracture conduit in zone c led to increases in the capillary pressure of the entire medium which resulted in a deeper invasion of oil into the matrix pores surrounding the fracture as the flow rate of oil was gradually increased to the maximum value of 0 45 ml min still a capillary dominated displacement regime n ca 1 6 10 6 oil occupied most of the large and medium sized pore elements displacing 69 of water water as the wetting phase however maintained its connectivity by forming wetting layers on the roughness of the fracture walls and the crevices of interconnected pore elements of the matrix a cartoon of the possible and favorable pore fluid occupancy in an angular water wet pore element during primary oil drainage is illustrated in fig 9 a where water resides in the corner and oil occupies the center of the pore element fig 10 a shows a similar fluid occupancy observed in the pore space of the medium at the end of primary oil drainage experiment during the secondary gas injection sgi the flow rate of gas was incrementally increased from 0 01 to 7 ml min in 10 steps in each step the core sample was imaged and the water oil and gas saturations were measured in zones a b and c at low flow rates of gas as seen in fig 11 gas as the most nonwetting phase preferentially filled the fracture conduit because of its low gas oil threshold capillary pressure compared to those of the matrix pores the figure also indicates that in early stages the oil was recovered from the large pores surrounding the fracture than those that were radially far away from the fracture this is due to the fact that the gas phase had access to the pores that were directly connected to the fracture as well as the lower threshold pressure required to invade such elements the sequence of fluid displacements at different gas flow rates at an arbitrary selected cross section of the core sample is presented in fig 12 the observed behavior was reconfirmed by plotting the radial distribution of the average oil and water saturations in zones a and b as depicted in fig 13 as it is shown the average saturations of oil and water reduced significantly as we moved towards the fracture opening in zone c intact matrix however due to the absence of a fracture the gas oil capillary pressure increased to create a pathway to the outlet of the medium by preferentially invading the large and medium sized pores as the gas flow rate and hence the capillary pressure were increased gas started to extract oil from more pores of the neighboring matrix with higher threshold capillary pressures at this stage the radial saturation distributions of the oil as the intermediate wetting phase and water as the wetting phase became relatively uniform for the matrix pores in all zones as seen in fig 14 furthermore this figure shows that saturation of water at high flow rates did not significantly change even though it was hydraulically well connected this is because brine required a significant gas brine capillary pressure to be displaced as it resided in small pores throats and crevices of the oil filled pores the three phase pore fluid occupancies generated under gas injection could vary significantly with changes in fluid fluid and rock fluid properties for instance depending on the values of interfacial tension between the pairs of fluids oil may either form a spreading layer sandwiched between the brine and gas see fig 15 a or disconnected blobs throughout the pore space see fig 15 b from the oil recovery standpoint it is worth mentioning that the existence of oil layers are less important at high oil saturations as piston like displacements have the highest contribution in oil recovery compared to the low oil saturation condition where oil drainage through these layers plays a vital role in recovery it is to be noted that low oil saturations usually refers to values less than 30 40 the stability of the oil layers mainly depends on the pore geometry spreading coefficient saturation history and flow regime zolfaghari and piri 2017 in the present work the stability of the oil layers was examined by measuring their thickness at different gas flow rates this allowed us to confirm that the layers stay stable over a wide range of flow rates in the spreading system furthermore we determined the flow rates at which they started to collapse in the nonspreading system as demonstrated in fig 16 the thickness of the oil layers ranged from approximately 5 to 85 microns at low gas flow rates under the spreading condition i e 0 015 0 04 ml min the majority of oil layers had a thickness between 65 to 70 microns while by increasing the gas flow rate to 0 08 ml min it reduced to 40 microns the thickness of these layers remained nearly constant as the gas flow rate was increased further in the nonspreading system however the majority of oil layers that had a thickness of 40 microns were observed to form at low gas flow rates as the gas flow rate increased these layers expectedly became thinner to around 20 microns and then could collapse at higher gas flow rates which directly translates to lower relative permeability for oil it is worth noting that in order to reduce the impact of segmentation uncertainties on the analysis presented here we only selected the oil layers that were thicker than 6 pixels as shown in the ternary diagrams in fig 17 the oil saturations under both spreading and nonspreading conditions were relatively similar at low gas flow rates whereas they were distinctly different as the oil saturation reduced at higher gas flow rates at the end of gas injection the average remaining oil saturation under the spreading and nonspreading systems reached as low as 17 and 26 respectively this reflects the significance of layer drainage in the displacements in particular the spreading oil layers maintained oil connectivity throughout the pore space during the gas injection process that is the oil phase continued although very slowly to drain into the fracture and pass through the intact matrix area towards the outlet until very late stages of gas injection in the case of the nonspreading oil due to the absence of the spreading layers at low oil saturations the production of oil entirely depended on the connectivity of oil phase through oil filled pore throat elements within the matrix often this connectivity could not be maintained through the fracture conduit as illustrated in fig 18 although we observed thin oil layers at high oil saturations but they collapsed as the gas flow rate and hence gas oil capillary pressure was increased zolfaghari and piri 2017 a layer that collapses at higher flow rates in the nonspreading system is presented in fig 19 this implies that the hydraulic conductivity of oil was not well maintained which in turn hindered the oil movement from the neighboring matrix to the fracture leading to lower oil recovery compared to its counterpart with the spreading oil this was consistent with the observations reported by vizika and lombard 1996 and alizadeh and piri 2014 in a water wet rock fig 9 c d demonstrates a schematic of an angular pore element that has very thin layer of oil that collapses at higher capillary pressures however by comparing the oil saturation profiles of the spreading and the nonspreading systems at different flow rates as shown in fig 20 it became evident that the thinner layers in the nonspreading system had little or no effects on oil recovery the difference between oil saturation profile in the spreading and the nonspreading systems increased at lower oil saturation where the oil layers controlled oil transport and recovery under the spreading condition it was observed that the spreading oil layers were present not only in the pores of the matrix but also in the fracture between the wetting layers of brine on the fracture walls and gas in the center these layers have non negligible hydraulic conductivity throughout the pore space this means that the oil phase in the matrix was hydraulically connected to the oil in the fracture fig 21 presents a three dimensional view of a pore element squared area that is adjacent to the fracture the oil in this pore was drained to the fracture through the connected oil layers in addition to the direct visualization of these layers in the pore space we used the euler number to further characterize the connectivity of the oil phase in the spreading and nonspreading systems euler number is a measure of an object s topology that can be used to characterize effective porosity distribution of fluids and the connectivity of a certain phase i e wetting or nonwetting in a porous medium vogel 2002 arns et al 2001 feali et al 2012 rücker et al 2015 schlüter et al 2016 in general euler number can be described as e c h where e is the euler number c is the number of connected objects and h is the number of holes the euler number is respectively positive and negative for disconnected and connected phases feali et al 2012 to explain this in more details consider two cases presented in a sketch in fig 22 where the red spots represent oil globules and the white spots represent all phases in the pore space except the oil phase the euler number for fig 22 a is negative which means the oil is a connected phase whereas it is positive for disconnected objects in fig 22 b in other words having less connected objects and more holes indicates better phase connectivity to asses the connectivity of oil in our porous medium the euler number was computed by applying euler number module of avizo software on the binary segmented three dimensional image i e oil phase as illustrated in fig 23 the computed euler number confirmed that the oil phase based on the above mentioned concept applied to the oil clusters was connected in the spreading system while this was not the case in the nonspreading system as seen in this figure in both cases the connectivity of oil phase reduces as the oil saturation decreases due to the increase in gas flow rates 5 concluding remarks the comparison of the experimentally generated pore fluid occupancy maps obtained under the spreading and nonspreading conditions allowed us to develop a significantly improved insight into pore scale physics governing the matrix fracture interactions in water wet fractured rocks the spreading characteristics and fluid fluid and rock fluid interfacial energies determined the favorable fluid configurations in the pore space during the gas injection under the spreading condition the oil spread and formed thick layers sandwiched between the brine and gas these spreading layers were present not only in the pore elements of the matrix but also in the fracture the oil phase in the matrix established a hydraulic connectivity through the connected spreading layers with the oil in the fracture thereby allowing the oil in the matrix to drain into the fracture this resulted in a higher oil recovery from the entire medium negative euler number computed for the oil phase confirmed its connectivity throughout the medium due to the ability of the fluid to spread however infrequent oil layers observed under nonspreading condition were not stable and collapsed easily as capillary pressure was increased during gas injection this meant that oil had poor connectivity that hindered oil movement from the matrix to the fracture leading to lower oil recovery compared to that of the spreading system similar recovery trends were observed in both spreading and nonspreading systems at high oil saturations low gas flow rates which is due to much greater contribution of the piston like displacements in the recovery of oil however there was a distinct difference in the oil recovery trends between the above mentioned systems at low oil saturations high gas flow rates this was due to increased contribution of the spreading oil layers to the overall mechanisms responsible for oil production acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of

still poorly understood this is primarily owing to the limitations of experimental technologies that can be used to probe flow behavior at the micro scale in fractured rock samples here we summarize some of the investigations in this domain micromodels have been used for decades to explore different mechanisms of flow through fractured porous media however they do not capture the complexity of the fracture morphology and their connectivity with the neighboring matrix for example researchers have used two dimensional micromodels to investigate gas injection and waterflooding flow processes through fractures shariatpanahi et al 2005 the authors mimicked a similar morphology of a fractured porous medium by inserting a single fracture in the 2d glass etched water wet micromodel in their study two sets of experiments were performed after primary oil drainage where the oil phase was connected it was reported that the average oil recovery was 75 by waterflooding compared to 60 by immiscible gas injection in their model investigation of flow through fractures using x ray macro ct scanners is disadvantaged by its inadequate resolution to map pore fluid occupancies in the fracture and matrix the fracture aperture and matrix pores are often too small to be visualized instead they usually generate average in situ saturation information for instance alajmi and grader 2000 carried out two sets of two phase flow experiments on a fractured berea sandstone sample to study matrix fracture interactions using a medical x ray ct scanner their results showed that the presence of the fracture in the rock slowed down the oil recovery from the regions around the fracture they concluded that the fracture formed a bypassing channel for both the injected and the displaced fluids other researchers used nuclear tracer imaging nti and magnetic resonance imaging mri techniques to study the effect of wettability on ultimate oil recovery haugen et al 2010 in contrast to the above mentioned technologies x ray micro computed tomography technique has proven to be effective in directly mapping the arrangement of fluids and their movements at the pore scale golparvar et al 2018 karpyn et al 2007 studied the effect of fracture morphology on the distribution of oil and water within a single fracture using x ray micro computed tomography by visualizing the fluid occupancy the authors concluded that the distribution of the fluid phases in the fracture depended on its geometry fluids saturations and wetting characteristics of the fractured rock the authors kept matrix fully saturated with the wetting fluid brine during the experiments and hence contribution of matrix to the entire flow behavior was not investigated arshadi et al 2018 performed a series of flow experiments on a water wet fractured sandstone rock using a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner to investigate the matrix fracture interactions at the pore scale under two phase flow conditions the researchers mapped fluid occupancies in both matrix and fracture to probe the impact of fluid exchange between two domains on the flow behavior of the entire medium they examined the effects of flow rate fracture aperture geometry and interfacial tension on fluid displacements in the fracture and the neighboring matrix with the advent of micro tomography imaging technique and digital rock technology the ability to directly visualize pore fluid occupancy allows us to better understand the behavior of multiphase flow in fractured porous systems this can be particularly effective in elucidating some of the critical subtleties of displacement physics encountered during three phase flow through fractured porous media for example one of the fundamental complexities seen in these systems is the ability of one of the fluids to spread in the presence of the other two as we explain later in this section the impact of this phenomenon on oil recovery is critically relevant but its impact in fractured systems is not well understood and hence a careful investigation of the problem using advanced experimental technologies is warranted in a water wet porous medium holding three phases i e water oil and gas water wets the rock surfaces and fills the crevices while gas resides in the middle of pore elements the oil phase i e the intermediate wetting fluid can form spreading layers sandwiched between the water and gas phases blunt et al 1995 piri and blunt 2004 the hydraulic conductivity of these layers could sustain a continuous oil phase in the pore space flow of oil through these layers known as layer drainage is a slow process blunt 2017 but could eventually lead to very low remaining oil saturations the affinity of oil to spread on water in the existence of gas is evaluated by calculating the equilibrium spreading coefficient adamson and gast 1967 hirasaki 1993 rowlinson and widom 2013 as 1 c s σ g w e q σ g o e q σ o w e q where σ g w e q σ g o e q and σ o w e q are the interfacial tensions ifts of gas water gas oil and oil water pairs of fluids respectively when water oil and gas coexist at equilibrium the spreading coefficient is either zero or negative depending on the interfacial tension between each pair of fluids a zero or slightly negative value means that oil will spontaneously spread as a thin layer between water and gas in contrast a negative value means that oil will form small lenses on the surface of water in the presence of gas and hence will not maintain its phase connectivity across the medium since the work of dumore and schols 1974 it has been acknowledged that the residual oil saturation can be as low as few percentage due to the flow of oil through spreading oil layers in the presence of gas and water blunt et al 1995 zhou and blunt 1997 obtained a remaining oil saturation as low as 0 1 in their gravity drainage experiments on sand packs due to the presence of the aforementioned layers vizika and lombard 1996 concluded that the oil relative permeabilities were different at low oil saturations under spreading and nonspreading conditions whereas they were similar at high oil saturations since the layer drainage mechanism played an insignificant role other researchers have focused on the impact of the thickness and stability of these layers on the continuity of oil kantzas et al 1988 blunt et al 1995 observations from micromodels studies øren and pinczewski 1995 were consistent with the above results as they showed three phase fluids distributions where the oil formed thin layers between the water and the gas phases under positive spreading coefficient however to the best of our knowledge the role of these layers on recovery from fractured porous media has not been systematically investigated in this work we examine the impact of the matrix fracture interactions on oil recovery during gas injection when spreadability plays a pivotal role to this end a high resolution micro ct scanner coupled with a three phase core flooding apparatus was used to perform two and three phase flow experiments on a miniature water wet fractured core sample the comparison of two and three dimensional pore fluid occupancy maps obtained with two different fluid systems with varying equilibrium spreading coefficients i e spreading and nonspreading systems enabled us to develop a significantly improved understanding of the governing displacement mechanisms during gas injection in fractured porous media under two very different spreading behavior this document is structured as follows we first list the details of the rock and fluids as well as the experimental apparatus and procedure used in this study this is then followed by a summary of the steps employed in our image analysis technique subsequently we present the results and include a careful discussion of the trends observed the paper is concluded with a set of key remarks and recommendations 2 experimental methodology in this section we discuss the details pertaining to the core sample preparation methodology oil brine gas fluid systems experimental setup and procedure used in this study 2 1 rock and fluid properties we used a miniature fractured berea sandstone core sample to conduct the flow experiments in this study the sample was 40 mm long and 10 mm in diameter to prepare the specimen we first drilled a cylindrical core plug 38 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length from a block of water wet berea sandstone subsequently half of the core plug s length was subjected to nonuniform stress to induce an artificial fracture using the modified brazilian test guo et al 1993 the radial stress on the plug was applied such that the induced fracture was extended only to the middle of the core a 10 mm diameter sample was then drilled from the core plug in a manner that the fracture extended only over half of its length see fig 1 the loose sand grains were gently removed by blowing nitrogen through the sample fig 2 a presents a micro ct image of the fracture area at a resolution of 2 5 µm fig 2 b shows an scanning electron microscope sem image of a site within the fracture located approximately 10 mm from the inlet of the core the image was obtained after the sample had been cleaned and dried it shows the tortuosity and roughness of the induced fracture the physical properties of the samples used are listed in table 1 to probe the effect of the spreading phenomena it was necessary to identify two oil phases that would establish significantly different spreading coefficients in the presence of nitrogen and brine such that they would develop spreading and nonspreading behaviors we selected soltrol 170 and decalin as spreading and nonspreading oil phases respectively both fluids were purified prior to use by passing them through a gravity column that contained aluminum oxide powder and silica gel this allowed us to obtain stable interfacial tensions by eliminating surface active impurities goebel and lunkenheimer 1997 the oil phases were mixed with 5 vol 1 iodooctane ch3 ch2 6ch2i each a solution of 13 wt sodium iodide nai acs reagent 99 5 sigma aldrich usa 2 wt calcium chloride hexahydrate cacl2 6h2o bioxtra 99 5 sigma aldrich usa 99 5 and 0 01 wt sodium azide nan3 99 5 sigma aldrich usa was used as the aqueous phase sodium azide was added to the solution to avoid bacterial growth during the experiments jadhunandan and morrow 1995 the gas phase was nitrogen with 99 purity the physical properties and the interfacial tension values for the fluids used in this study are listed in tables 2 and 3 the x ray dopants sodium iodide and 1 iodooctane that were added to aqueous and oil phases respectively allowed us to establish sufficient contrasts among all phases i e brine oil gas and solid in the x ray images this plays an important role in significantly reducing the uncertainty of image processing steps listed later in this paper 2 2 experimental apparatus a closed loop multi phase core flooding setup coupled with a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner was utilized to perform the flow experiments at the micro scale the imaging system was an xradia 510 versa micro ct scanner manufactured by zeisstm the core flooding setup was composed of a miniature carbon fiber core holder a series of differential pressure transducers rosemountâ usa with various ranges an 800 ml three phase separator two 300 ml accumulators and six dual cylinder 5000 series quizixâ pumps as shown in fig 3 three of the six pumps were utilized to retract the fluid phases brine oil and gas from the separator and inject them into the core at constant flow rates an overburden pressure pump was used to exert confining pressure around the core sample this pump was linked to each of the injection pumps in order to maintain a fixed net confining stress i e the difference between the injection pore pressure and the confining pressure another pump was used to regulate the core sample s back pressure by receiving the effluent at constant pressure and discharging it into the separator the remaining pump was used to compensate for fluctuations in separator pressure caused by fluid injection and withdrawal the core flooding setup allowed us to dynamically scan the core sample while the fluids were being injected this feature enabled acquisition of fluid occupancy maps while the pore fluid configurations were kept stable at different stages of the flow experiments inside the micro ct enclosure the core holder was connected to high pressure peek polyetheretherketone tubing 1 16 in in outside diameter this tubing was light weight and flexible and hence it minimized the amount of torque exerted on the core holder during the rotation this considerably reduced the amount of image artifacts a detailed description of the core flooding setup can be found elsewhere alizadeh and piri 2014 2 3 experimental procedure the core sample was first inserted into a viton sleeve to provide no flow boundary condition on its surface the sleeve and core sample assembly was then placed in a carbon fiber core holder while carefully connecting all the remaining components of the holder subsequently the core holder was vertically mounted inside the micro ct scanner the core sample was initially flushed with gaseous co2 to remove air and then vacuumed for 24 h at this stage the entire sample was imaged while the core sample was under vacuum this was performed to select the regions of interest to acquire additional images during the flow tests map the fracture topology measure the fracture aperture and obtain the porosity distribution across the core sample thereafter the core sample was vacuum saturated with high salinity brine hereafter referred to as doped brine to establish 100 water saturation numerous pore volumes of the brine was injected into the pore space in order to displace dissolve any remaining co2 micro ct images obtained at this stage of the experiment confirmed that the sample was fully saturated with brine we used high salinity brine at this stage because its x ray attenuation is significantly different than that of gas air and co2 it is worth mentioning that before starting the experiments all the three phases were sufficiently pre equilibrated for 48 h through the core flooding setup bypassing the core sample at the experimental conditions in order to establish equilibrium and minimize mass transfer amongst the fluids in the core sample during the experiments since the intensity of the doped brine in the images was similar to that of the grains the doped brine was replaced by a low salinity brine to generate an accurate and clear map of the pore space once the doped brine was completely replaced by the low salinity brine a wet reference scan was obtained at a resolution of 2 5 µm afterward the low salinity brine was again replaced by the doped brine one should note that the reference scan was not acquired when the sample was dry because introduction of brine could have slightly relocated the grains within the fracture it is to be noted that the core was periodically scanned during the flow tests and the pore configurations were always compared with the reference scan to ensure the core sample did not rotate move we always used the registration method by superimposing the wet reference image on the wet flooded image and then performed segmentation after acquiring the wet reference scan the core sample was subjected to an oilflood with an incremental increase of oil flow rate from 0 01 to 0 45 ml min this resulted in an average initial water saturation of 31 throughout the different zones in the medium during drainage we acquired quick scans at a lower resolution of 5 µm to monitor the oil saturation and recorded the pressure drop across the core sample after establishing the desired two phase initial condition gas was injected into the core sample at increasing flow rates during gas injection the fluid saturations were measured in both the fracture and the matrix after completing these steps the core sample was cleaned in order to start a new set of flow tests using a fluid system with a different spreading coefficient it is to be noted that keeping a constant fracture aperture in all stages of the experiments was one of the most important attributes of the experimental procedure used in this study any undesired variations in the aperture could adversely impact the interactions between the fracture and the matrix which in turn would make it difficult for us to accurately compare the results at each step to this end the confining pressure pump was linked to each injection pump to maintain a fixed net confining pressure during all steps of the flow experiments the flow tests using unsteady state method in which only one phase is injected at a time were carried out at pore pressure of 500 psig and ambient temperature approximately 20 c fig 4 demonstrates a schematic diagram summarizing the steps followed in this work as mentioned earlier we used only one miniature core sample for both sets of the experiments this was an attempt to enable direct comparison of the results of the spreading and nonspreading fluid systems at identical zones within the medium therefore it was critically important that we cleaned the samples thoroughly between these two groups of tests to do so the following procedure was followed at the end of the experiments with the spreading fluid system 1 gaseous co2 was injected into the core for 30 min at a pressure of 100 psig and ambient temperature to displace n2 from the pore space 2 a low salinity brine nondoped was introduced into the core to increase the pore pressure to 500 psi in order to reach the desired experimental condition 3 20 pore volumes pv of nondoped brine was injected into the core to displace and dissolve the co2 as well as the doped brine already present in the core 4 20 pv of 2 propanol acs reagent 99 5 sigma aldrich usa was used to miscibly displace the brine and oil phases from the core sample the fluid was injected at relatively low flow rate to avoid any changes in the fracture aperture 5 20 pv of the nondoped brine was injected into the core to displace the solvent 6 the core was fully brine saturated by injecting 40 pv of the doped brine into the core 7 the entire core sample was scanned to ensure it was 100 saturated with brine 3 image analysis prior to starting the experiments a scan from the entire core see fig 5 was acquired to determine a porosity based representative elementary volume rev pore size distribution and the properties of the fracture aperture this was needed to prepare the scan recipes and determine the regions of interest for imaging during the flow experiments table 4 lists the parameters of different types of scans performed in this study after evaluating the images of the entire core sample three zones i e a b and c were selected to be scanned during the experiment zones a b and c were respectively situated closed to the inlet middle of the core where fracture tip merged with the matrix and at the end of the core sample where no fracture existed we selected these sites to explore pore fluid occupancies at different topological areas of the sample while using different fluid systems fig 6 shows pore size distributions and variations in total porosity for the entire core sample the average diameter of the most frequent pores in the rock matrix was around 75 microns compared to the fracture that had an average aperture of 180 microns as indicated in fig 6 b the average porosity of the medium was reduced from 0 26 to 0 2 as we move from the inlet of the core where the fracture was located toward the outlet of the core table 5 lists physical dimensions and additional imaging attributes pertinent to these zones next we prepared three imaging recipes for the three zones each recipe included imaging parameters such as the positions of the source detector and sample source voltage camera binning pixel size exposure time types of filter and objective and the number of projections these parameters could be retrieved at any time during the experiments by recalling the saved recipes after scanning each region the entire tomogram sets i e images from the ct scanner were converted into raw 3d images ready for visualization the reconstruction process was carried out by using xm reconstructor software and adjusting different parameters such as the center shift to eliminate image artifacts pergeos 1 1 and avizo 9 0 1 by thermo fisher scientific were utilized to process the reconstructed 3d images obtained from the ct scanner the image processing steps included 1 filtering 2 arithmetic operations 3 thresholding and segmentation and 4 quantification more details about these steps can be found elsewhere wildenschild and sheppard 2014 alizadeh et al 2013 the above mentioned data processing procedure produced sharp demarcation of the pore space and saturating fluid interfaces during various stages of the flow experiments as illustrated in fig 7 as seen in this figure we started the image analysis process by using a reference image subfigure a that was used to create a pore fracture map as shown in subfigure b because the solid phase had an x ray attenuation similar to that of the doped brine we multiplied the wet images see subfigure c that had brine oil and gas by the created pore fracture map in order to eliminate the rock grains from the images this would provide a clear image including only the pore space with a three phase occupancy ready to be studied after this step we used the interactive thresholding method to segment brine oil and gas phases based on different threshold values as listed in table 6 4 results and discussion in this section we first present the pore scale displacement events that take place during primary oil drainage and secondary gas injection next we discuss the observations emerged from the micro ct images regarding the impact of the spreading phenomena on fluid exchange between the matrix and the fracture at different oil saturations and then explain these observations using the relevant displacement mechanisms oil was initially introduced into the fully brine saturated core sample to establish a desired initial brine saturation prior to gas injection the initial flow rate of oil was incrementally increased from 0 01 to 0 45 ml min resulting in an average initial brine saturation sw i of 31 for zones a b and c oil as the nonwetting phase relative to water initially invaded the fracture opening through a pore scale piston like displacement because the fracture had a lower threshold capillary pressure compared to those of the matrix pores the average fracture aperture was approximately 180 µm which was more than twice the average diameter of the matrix pores a three dimensional image showing the variations of the aperture map thickness for the whole fracture is presented in fig 8 once the capillary pressure was increased to the threshold value required to invade the matrix pores oil displaced water from large water filled pore elements in the surrounding matrix subsequently and with further increase in the flow rate oil invaded the medium sized pores and at the same time displaced water from the pores of the intact matrix zone i e zone c the absence of a fracture conduit in zone c led to increases in the capillary pressure of the entire medium which resulted in a deeper invasion of oil into the matrix pores surrounding the fracture as the flow rate of oil was gradually increased to the maximum value of 0 45 ml min still a capillary dominated displacement regime n ca 1 6 10 6 oil occupied most of the large and medium sized pore elements displacing 69 of water water as the wetting phase however maintained its connectivity by forming wetting layers on the roughness of the fracture walls and the crevices of interconnected pore elements of the matrix a cartoon of the possible and favorable pore fluid occupancy in an angular water wet pore element during primary oil drainage is illustrated in fig 9 a where water resides in the corner and oil occupies the center of the pore element fig 10 a shows a similar fluid occupancy observed in the pore space of the medium at the end of primary oil drainage experiment during the secondary gas injection sgi the flow rate of gas was incrementally increased from 0 01 to 7 ml min in 10 steps in each step the core sample was imaged and the water oil and gas saturations were measured in zones a b and c at low flow rates of gas as seen in fig 11 gas as the most nonwetting phase preferentially filled the fracture conduit because of its low gas oil threshold capillary pressure compared to those of the matrix pores the figure also indicates that in early stages the oil was recovered from the large pores surrounding the fracture than those that were radially far away from the fracture this is due to the fact that the gas phase had access to the pores that were directly connected to the fracture as well as the lower threshold pressure required to invade such elements the sequence of fluid displacements at different gas flow rates at an arbitrary selected cross section of the core sample is presented in fig 12 the observed behavior was reconfirmed by plotting the radial distribution of the average oil and water saturations in zones a and b as depicted in fig 13 as it is shown the average saturations of oil and water reduced significantly as we moved towards the fracture opening in zone c intact matrix however due to the absence of a fracture the gas oil capillary pressure increased to create a pathway to the outlet of the medium by preferentially invading the large and medium sized pores as the gas flow rate and hence the capillary pressure were increased gas started to extract oil from more pores of the neighboring matrix with higher threshold capillary pressures at this stage the radial saturation distributions of the oil as the intermediate wetting phase and water as the wetting phase became relatively uniform for the matrix pores in all zones as seen in fig 14 furthermore this figure shows that saturation of water at high flow rates did not significantly change even though it was hydraulically well connected this is because brine required a significant gas brine capillary pressure to be displaced as it resided in small pores throats and crevices of the oil filled pores the three phase pore fluid occupancies generated under gas injection could vary significantly with changes in fluid fluid and rock fluid properties for instance depending on the values of interfacial tension between the pairs of fluids oil may either form a spreading layer sandwiched between the brine and gas see fig 15 a or disconnected blobs throughout the pore space see fig 15 b from the oil recovery standpoint it is worth mentioning that the existence of oil layers are less important at high oil saturations as piston like displacements have the highest contribution in oil recovery compared to the low oil saturation condition where oil drainage through these layers plays a vital role in recovery it is to be noted that low oil saturations usually refers to values less than 30 40 the stability of the oil layers mainly depends on the pore geometry spreading coefficient saturation history and flow regime zolfaghari and piri 2017 in the present work the stability of the oil layers was examined by measuring their thickness at different gas flow rates this allowed us to confirm that the layers stay stable over a wide range of flow rates in the spreading system furthermore we determined the flow rates at which they started to collapse in the nonspreading system as demonstrated in fig 16 the thickness of the oil layers ranged from approximately 5 to 85 microns at low gas flow rates under the spreading condition i e 0 015 0 04 ml min the majority of oil layers had a thickness between 65 to 70 microns while by increasing the gas flow rate to 0 08 ml min it reduced to 40 microns the thickness of these layers remained nearly constant as the gas flow rate was increased further in the nonspreading system however the majority of oil layers that had a thickness of 40 microns were observed to form at low gas flow rates as the gas flow rate increased these layers expectedly became thinner to around 20 microns and then could collapse at higher gas flow rates which directly translates to lower relative permeability for oil it is worth noting that in order to reduce the impact of segmentation uncertainties on the analysis presented here we only selected the oil layers that were thicker than 6 pixels as shown in the ternary diagrams in fig 17 the oil saturations under both spreading and nonspreading conditions were relatively similar at low gas flow rates whereas they were distinctly different as the oil saturation reduced at higher gas flow rates at the end of gas injection the average remaining oil saturation under the spreading and nonspreading systems reached as low as 17 and 26 respectively this reflects the significance of layer drainage in the displacements in particular the spreading oil layers maintained oil connectivity throughout the pore space during the gas injection process that is the oil phase continued although very slowly to drain into the fracture and pass through the intact matrix area towards the outlet until very late stages of gas injection in the case of the nonspreading oil due to the absence of the spreading layers at low oil saturations the production of oil entirely depended on the connectivity of oil phase through oil filled pore throat elements within the matrix often this connectivity could not be maintained through the fracture conduit as illustrated in fig 18 although we observed thin oil layers at high oil saturations but they collapsed as the gas flow rate and hence gas oil capillary pressure was increased zolfaghari and piri 2017 a layer that collapses at higher flow rates in the nonspreading system is presented in fig 19 this implies that the hydraulic conductivity of oil was not well maintained which in turn hindered the oil movement from the neighboring matrix to the fracture leading to lower oil recovery compared to its counterpart with the spreading oil this was consistent with the observations reported by vizika and lombard 1996 and alizadeh and piri 2014 in a water wet rock fig 9 c d demonstrates a schematic of an angular pore element that has very thin layer of oil that collapses at higher capillary pressures however by comparing the oil saturation profiles of the spreading and the nonspreading systems at different flow rates as shown in fig 20 it became evident that the thinner layers in the nonspreading system had little or no effects on oil recovery the difference between oil saturation profile in the spreading and the nonspreading systems increased at lower oil saturation where the oil layers controlled oil transport and recovery under the spreading condition it was observed that the spreading oil layers were present not only in the pores of the matrix but also in the fracture between the wetting layers of brine on the fracture walls and gas in the center these layers have non negligible hydraulic conductivity throughout the pore space this means that the oil phase in the matrix was hydraulically connected to the oil in the fracture fig 21 presents a three dimensional view of a pore element squared area that is adjacent to the fracture the oil in this pore was drained to the fracture through the connected oil layers in addition to the direct visualization of these layers in the pore space we used the euler number to further characterize the connectivity of the oil phase in the spreading and nonspreading systems euler number is a measure of an object s topology that can be used to characterize effective porosity distribution of fluids and the connectivity of a certain phase i e wetting or nonwetting in a porous medium vogel 2002 arns et al 2001 feali et al 2012 rücker et al 2015 schlüter et al 2016 in general euler number can be described as e c h where e is the euler number c is the number of connected objects and h is the number of holes the euler number is respectively positive and negative for disconnected and connected phases feali et al 2012 to explain this in more details consider two cases presented in a sketch in fig 22 where the red spots represent oil globules and the white spots represent all phases in the pore space except the oil phase the euler number for fig 22 a is negative which means the oil is a connected phase whereas it is positive for disconnected objects in fig 22 b in other words having less connected objects and more holes indicates better phase connectivity to asses the connectivity of oil in our porous medium the euler number was computed by applying euler number module of avizo software on the binary segmented three dimensional image i e oil phase as illustrated in fig 23 the computed euler number confirmed that the oil phase based on the above mentioned concept applied to the oil clusters was connected in the spreading system while this was not the case in the nonspreading system as seen in this figure in both cases the connectivity of oil phase reduces as the oil saturation decreases due to the increase in gas flow rates 5 concluding remarks the comparison of the experimentally generated pore fluid occupancy maps obtained under the spreading and nonspreading conditions allowed us to develop a significantly improved insight into pore scale physics governing the matrix fracture interactions in water wet fractured rocks the spreading characteristics and fluid fluid and rock fluid interfacial energies determined the favorable fluid configurations in the pore space during the gas injection under the spreading condition the oil spread and formed thick layers sandwiched between the brine and gas these spreading layers were present not only in the pore elements of the matrix but also in the fracture the oil phase in the matrix established a hydraulic connectivity through the connected spreading layers with the oil in the fracture thereby allowing the oil in the matrix to drain into the fracture this resulted in a higher oil recovery from the entire medium negative euler number computed for the oil phase confirmed its connectivity throughout the medium due to the ability of the fluid to spread however infrequent oil layers observed under nonspreading condition were not stable and collapsed easily as capillary pressure was increased during gas injection this meant that oil had poor connectivity that hindered oil movement from the matrix to the fracture leading to lower oil recovery compared to that of the spreading system similar recovery trends were observed in both spreading and nonspreading systems at high oil saturations low gas flow rates which is due to much greater contribution of the piston like displacements in the recovery of oil however there was a distinct difference in the oil recovery trends between the above mentioned systems at low oil saturations high gas flow rates this was due to increased contribution of the spreading oil layers to the overall mechanisms responsible for oil production acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of

596,sedimentary density flows are major agents of sediment transport on oceans occurring after submarine landslides the sedimentary density flows experience a series of dilution processes such flows then transform from the hyperconcentrated flows into the concentrated ones and finally turn into the turbidity currents this study applies a sophisticated multi phase flow model to simulate sedimentary density flows caused by submarine granular landslides over a simplified topography with an emphasis on their dilution mechanisms this model takes account of the particle particle interactions the particle fluid interactions and the turbulent motions of fluid and particles in the momentum transports the two effects on turbulence modulation are considered one is due to the stratification and the other is caused by the correlation between the fluid and sediment turbulent motions the numerical results suggest that the dilution mechanisms are highly related to kelvin helmholtz vortices in addition to erosion of the hyperconcentrated region by vortices this study finds that strong stir in the concentrated region by the vortices is another important dilution mechanism compared with the outer regions of the vortices with zero vorticity the vortex cores with non zero vorticity have less efficient dilution processes due to rigid body rotations there the vortex cores can trap the small particles for a while the involved flow regimes are also presented the numerical results reveal that the turbidity currents can be either turbulent or laminar when the bagnold limit of concentration is adopted to define the boundary of turbidity currents keywords multiphase flow simulations submarine landslides sedimentary density flows turbidity currents 1 introduction sedimentary density flows mulder and alexander 2001 the most important sediment transporting mechanism can transport over 100 km3 of sediment for a single event meiburg and kneller 2010 the flows can considerably change seafloor morphology through erosion and deposition talling et al 2015 besides they can also break cables hsu et al 2008 as well as pipelines bruschi et al 2006 during flow processes causing industrial and environmental disasters non cohesive sedimentary density flows can be classified into turbidity currents concentrated density flows and hyperconcentrated density flows in order from low to high concentrations mulder and alexander 2001 the turbidity currents are expected to be newtonian and turbulent due to their dilute nature mulder and alexander 2001 many experimental studies have been contributed to investigate heads of the turbidity currents in terms of shapes middleton 1966 travel speeds middleton 1966 and instabilities occurring there simpson 1972 1982 previous experimental results reveal that the turbidity currents share similar velocity structures with plane turbulent wall jets parker et al 1987 sequeiros et al 2010 stagnaro and bolla pittaluga 2014 the suspended sediment concentration has its maximum value immediately above the bed and its gradient does either meiburg and kneller 2010 to simulate the turbidity currents direct numerical simulations large eddy simulations and reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations have been used with the boussinesq approximation the transportation of sediment concentration is determined by solving an advection diffusion equation meiburg et al 2015 in these numerical approaches particle particle interactions are ignored owing to the dilute nature the hyperconcentrated flow behaves as a non newtonian fluid and grain to grain collisions predominate throughout the flow turbulent motions would be suppressed as a result of the dense nature the concentrated flow is a transitional flow between the hyperconcentrated flow and the turbidity current so far a fewer studies have been devoted to investigate these two flow types cassar et al 2005 performed experiments of hyperconcentrated flows down an inclined plane to explore rheological characteristics another experiments studied collapse of submerged granular columns to examine flow behaviors meruane et al 2010 rondon et al 2011 bougouin and lacaze 2018 lee et al 2018 compared with the turbidity currents it is more difficult to simulate the hyperconcentrated flows and the concentrated flows because of particle particle interactions becoming important with reduction in distances between particles recently several multi phase flow models considering particle particle interactions were successfully applied to simulate the collapse of submerged granular columns in the laboratory scale lee et al 2018 lee and huang 2018 yu et al 2018 si et al 2018 an event of sedimentary density flow e g submarine landslides may involve more than one flow type after failure of a submarine slope the released hyperconcentrated mass flows and dilutes gradually the hyperconcentrated flow may evolve into the concentrated flow and then the turbidity current at present the evolution or dilution process is not well understood due to the limitation of the experimental measurement techniques according to measured concentration and

fields near bed as a result of the distortion numerical cells this issue is addressed by adopting the hydrodynamic pressure instead of static pressure including the hydrostatic pressure and the

where the main dissipative mechanics are related to friction and collision to examine the capability of the present model to simulate dilute flows with the main dissipative mechanism of viscous stresses the lock exchange experiment of gladstone et al 1998 is reproduced numerically the silicon carbide particles with ρs 3217 kg m3 and the diameter d 0 025 mm were used in their experiments together with tap water the particles were placed in the lock volume with c 3 49 10 3 the flow started after lifting a lock gate in front of the lock volume the location of the flow front xf was measured gladstone et al 1998 the two dimensional numerical simulation is performed in the 5 5 m 0 5 m computational domain the uniform grid with the cell size of 5 mm 5 mm is used it can be seen in fig 1 that a good agreement between the simulated propagation of the flow front and the measured one the present model is also applicable to dilute flows 4 simulations of submarine landslides to study basic physics of sedimentary density flows the simplified topography used by heinrich et al 2001 is considered the bathymetry b is given by 7 b x 1 10 490 exp 6 1429 1 10 4 x 1 if 0 m x 1 10 4 m 2500 2000 exp 1 5050 10 4 x 1 1 if 10 4 m x 1 1 2 10 5 m the bathymetry comprises two exponential curves and the slope angle varies from 0 to 17 the landslide is defined as a part of an ellipsoid 8 b l max 500 x 1 10 4 2 1 8 10 4 b the maximum thickness of the initial landslide mass is 300 m the numerical domain of 1200 km 27 km is used including 261 699 numerical cells the typical cell is of 25 m in height the initial concentration of 0 55 corresponding to the concentration of random loose packing is taken for the landslide mass except for the numerical cells connected to the bottom of which the initial concentration is set to be 0 5 to reflect the failure line between the landslide mass and the bed three types of particles are used in the simulations they have the same density ρs 2500 kg m3 but different diameters 0 5 mm 1 mm and 5 mm each simulation took about 10 days by using 30 cores in the workstation equipped with 2 central processing units intel xeon gold 6130 it is remarked that the slope used in the present simulation is steeper than slopes in reality the former has the maximum angle of 17 but the latter usually has the angle less than 10 hampton et al 1996 real submarine slopes are stable normally so that other forces are required to cause submarine landslides such forces are not given in the present simulation so that a submarine landslide can not occur unless a steep slope is adopted to justify the use of eq 7 the decimetric froude number f r u g h 0 5 with g g ρ s ρ f ρ s u being the flow front speed and h being the thickness of the sedimentary density flow is computed in the case of d 0 5 mm the maximum u is about 52 m s occurring at t 100 s the corresponding fr is about 0 78 which is similar to the values reported in previous studies mulder 2011 therefore using eq 7 to study sedimentary density flows is reasonable 4 1 flow evolution fig 2 shows the evolution of the sedimentary density flow c 10 4 with d 0 5 mm it is remarked that the contour lines of c 10 3 are very close to those of c 10 4 in the following discussion the flow region with 10 4 c 0 09 is considered to be the turbidity current region due to the bagnold limit for turbulent suspension as suggested by mulder and alexander 2001 the boundary between the concentrated flow region and the hyperconcentrated flow region is close to the transition between newtonian and non newtonian conditions mulder and alexander 2001 c 0 4 is adopted as that boundary in this study it can be seen in fig 2 that the flow transforms from the hyperconcentrated flow t 50 s to the concentrated flow t 200 s and finally evolves into the turbidity current t 450 s the first stage of transformation is the result of erosion by the kelvin helmholtz kh vortices the second stage of transformation is caused by the vigorous stir in the sedimentary density flow by the kh vortices at t 50 s the granular mass slides down along the slope and a vortex layer lies on it due to strong shear the flow is mainly classed as the hyperconcentrated flow at t 100 s the vortex layer rolls up forming several elliptical kh vortices these vortices penetrate the concentrated region and erode the hyperconcentrated region the flow evolves into a surge like current equipped with the significant head followed by the body and the tail at t 200 s the vortices continuously growth up and erode the hyperconcentrated layer a new vortex labelled v2 in the fig 2c is formed in front of the largest vortex v1 in this instant the sedimentary density flow comprises mainly the concentrated flow at t 400 s the vortex v1 rotates and is surrounded with complicated filament debris the vortex v2 rises due to its interaction with the vortex v1 and their interaction significantly distorts the outline of the sedimentary density flow the vortex v1 strongly stretches and folds the concentrated region causing strong mixing at t 450 s the vortex v2 merges with the vortex v1 the flow evolves mainly into the turbidity current the three main dilution mechanisms conjectured by felix and peakall 2006 include erosion off the dense mass breaking apart of the dense underflow and breaking of internal waves these phenomena are also observed in fig 2 and they are the results of the erosion by the kh vortices at t 100 s the hyperconcentrated region is eroded and the internal waves between the hyperconcentrated and the concentration regions breaks at t 200 s the hyperconcentrated region is broken this study finds another dilution mechanism the stir by the vortices which occurs inside the flow 4 2 effects of vortex on sediment motion as discussed in section 4 1 the kh vortices have significant effects on dilution to further investigate these effects figs 3 a d present the buoyancy and the drag force the first and the second terms in eq 6 respectively the turbulent dispersion the third term in eq 6 is ignored here since its magnitude is less than 0 1 of the other two forces the sediment velocity and the fluid pressure are also superposed in figs 3 a d it is remarked that the fluid velocity is quite similar to the sediment velocity their difference can be inferred from the drag force fig 3 e schematically illustrates the typical patterns of the forces exerted on particles due to the fluid vortex it is observed in fig 3 b that the drag force in the hyperconcentrated region is so small suggesting that the vortices cannot stir the hyperconcentrated region the erosion is the main mechanism to transform the hyperconcentrated flow into the concentrated flow in this instant high pore pressure exists in the hyperconcentrated region generating the upward buoyancy see fig 3 a the upward buoyancy decreases the inter particle friction increasing the erosion efficiency the centripetal pattern of buoyancy and the upward convergent pattern of drag force inside the kh vortices can be observed in fig 3 a d e g the region within 29 km x 1 29 5 km for t 400 s the kh vortices in fig 2 are similar to the rankine vortex comprising a forced vortex in the core region and a free vortex in the outer region wu et al 2015 see fig 3 e the rankine vortex has a low pressure zone inside providing outward pressure gradient as a centripetal force the pressure gradient provides the buoyancy applied on sediment particles as a centripetal force too however the particles have larger inertia than fluid so the centripetal force is not strong enough to prevent these particles from leaving the vortex called the ejection here both gravity and drag force have effects on the ejection gravity provides the centrifugal centripetal force to the particles in the lower upper part of the vortex additionally the particles in the lower part of the vortex could have larger speed than in the upper part due to gravity these two effects of gravity together enhance the ejection in the lower part and reduce it in the upper part occasionally particles in the right upper part even move inwardly the drag force resulted from the velocity difference between the particles and their surrounding fluid mitigates the ejection process therefore it points toward the upper part of the vortex resulting in the upward convergent pattern it is noted that the influence area of the buoyancy is limited to the vicinity of the vortex core smaller than that of the drag force since the buoyancy rapidly declines in the outer region see fig 3 e distribution of particles around inside a vortex can affect the transformation when particles accumulate in the vortex core the buoyancy and the drag force slow the particles ejection furthermore the fluid rotates in the vortex core like a rigid body so the mixing does not occur there as a result the dilution process inside the vortex core is inefficient which explain why the vortex cores overlay the concentrated region from t 100 s to 450 s see fig 2 when the particles distribute nonuniformly in the outer region not rigid rotate the vortex stir particles causing filament like distribution of concentration surrounding the vortex core see the vortex v1 in fig 2 d and mixing 4 3 particle size effects fig 4 presents the flow fields of the sedimentary density flows with d 1 mm and 5 mm at t 400 s the sedimentary density flows with d 1 mm and 5 mm can also evolve into turbidity currents as d 0 5 mm differently the hyperconcentrated region still exists for d 5 mm but that region disappears for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm the concentrated region mainly lies on the bed for d 5 mm whereas the vortex cores trap some of the concentrated regions for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm consequently the particle size has effects on the dilution process and the concentration distribution due to the centripetal pattern of the buoyancy in the vortex the distribution of the concentrated region related to the vortices can be inferred from the net buoyancy to expand the concentrated region which is determined by 9 b a c 0 09 c p f d a where a is the area according to the divergence theorem eq 9 can be also explained as the total buoyancy pushing the sediments across the contour line of c 0 09 fig 5 depicts the total area a with c 10 4 0 09 and 0 4 for d 0 5 mm 1 mm and 5 mm to study the particle size effects on dilution process fig 5 also presents b for the three particle sizes to study how the particle size affects the concentration distribution related to the vortex it can be seen from fig 5 a that the smaller particles have better dilution efficacy the possible reason is that the smaller particles have slower settling velocity and are easier to be suspended the particle size of d 5 mm keeps the hyperconcentrated region but the other two particle sizes do not for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm the hyperconcentrated regions c 0 4 entirely transform into the diluter ones c 0 4 additionally the smaller particles have the larger areas with c 10 4 in general notably from fig 5 b that b for the three particle sizes turn from positives to negatives at t 150 s for d 5 mm b goes back to a positive soon however for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm b remain negative the positive b for d 5 mm suggests the concentrated region is mainly in the outer regions of the vortices which is usually below the vortices due to gravity and lies on the bed see fig 4 b the negative b for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm imply that some of the concentrated regions are trapped by the vortex cores see fig 4 a the difference in the locations of the concentration regions is caused by different settling velocities the particles of d 5 mm have faster settling velocities and can fall from the vortex cores quickly 4 4 flow regimes the flow regime of the sedimentary density flow is examined here concerning the mixture of sediment and water the total stress applied on a small element of the mixture t c t s 1 c t f has the three components the viscoplastic component c t sv the viscous component c t fv and the turbulence component c t s t 1 c t f t in order to evaluate how important are these three components fig 6 presents the ratio of the viscoplastic component to the total stress and the ratio of the turbulence component to the total stress in some place these two ratios are quite low meaning that the viscous component is important for the hyperconcentrated region the viscoplastic component dominates suggesting that the flow regime is non newtonian for the turbidity region the viscoplastic component vanishes the turbulence component and or the viscous component prevail in other words the flow regime is newtonian for the turbidity current and it can be either turbulent or laminar the turbidity current is expected to be turbulent in the past this study follows mulder and alexander 2001 to define the turbidity current without considering the strain rate therefore the flow regime can be laminar in some place where the flow almost ceases but some particles are still suspended for the concentrated flow the flow regime is the transition between the laminar newtonian flow regime and the non newtonian flow regime conclusively the computed flow regimes for the three flow types are identical to the previous conjecture mulder and alexander 2001 except that the laminar flow regime could occurs in the turbidity current 5 conclusions this study applied the sophisticated multi phase model lee et al 2019 lee and huang 2018 to examine the submarine landslide over the simplified topography in the field scale the experiment of gladstone et al 1998 was reproduced numerically to validate this model the following conclusions are drawn based on the numerical results 1 the submarine landslide evolves into the hyperconcentrated flow the concentrated flow and the turbidity current successively the kelvin helmholtz vortices caused by shear instability have considerably effects on the transformations of flows through eroding the hyperconcentrated flow and stirring the concentrated flow 2 the buoyancy has centripetal patterns inside the vortex cores and the drag force has upward convergent patterns the dilution process is less efficient in the vortex cores than in the outer regions of the vortices for small particles e g d 0 5 mm and 1 mm in this study the vortex cores can trap these particles for a while forming the high concentration regions in the vortex cores for the larger particles e g d 5 mm in this study the faster settling velocity prevents particles from trap in the vortex cores 3 the numerical results confirm the previous expectations about the flow regimes the hyperconcentrated flow has the non newtonian flow regime and the concentrated flow has the transitional flow regime from the non newtonian flow regime to the newtonian one however the flow regime for the turbidity current can be either laminar or turbulent differing from the previous conjecture of turbulent turbidity current the numerical results show that the flow in some place almost ceases but the particle is still suspended there

appendix a model formulas and boundary conditions the model of lee et al 2019 is developed to deal with sediment transport problems with air water interface this model regards air and water as a single fluid with variable density and viscosity used to track air water interface the water saturation s is defined as the volumetric ratio of water to the void pore space in a computational cell due to the no slip condition at the air water interface only one velocity vector u f is required to specify both the air and the water velocities the density ρf and the viscosity νf of the air water

596,sedimentary density flows are major agents of sediment transport on oceans occurring after submarine landslides the sedimentary density flows experience a series of dilution processes such flows then transform from the hyperconcentrated flows into the concentrated ones and finally turn into the turbidity currents this study applies a sophisticated multi phase flow model to simulate sedimentary density flows caused by submarine granular landslides over a simplified topography with an emphasis on their dilution mechanisms this model takes account of the particle particle interactions the particle fluid interactions and the turbulent motions of fluid and particles in the momentum transports the two effects on turbulence modulation are considered one is due to the stratification and the other is caused by the correlation between the fluid and sediment turbulent motions the numerical results suggest that the dilution mechanisms are highly related to kelvin helmholtz vortices in addition to erosion of the hyperconcentrated region by vortices this study finds that strong stir in the concentrated region by the vortices is another important dilution mechanism compared with the outer regions of the vortices with zero vorticity the vortex cores with non zero vorticity have less efficient dilution processes due to rigid body rotations there the vortex cores can trap the small particles for a while the involved flow regimes are also presented the numerical results reveal that the turbidity currents can be either turbulent or laminar when the bagnold limit of concentration is adopted to define the boundary of turbidity currents keywords multiphase flow simulations submarine landslides sedimentary density flows turbidity currents 1 introduction sedimentary density flows mulder and alexander 2001 the most important sediment transporting mechanism can transport over 100 km3 of sediment for a single event meiburg and kneller 2010 the flows can considerably change seafloor morphology through erosion and deposition talling et al 2015 besides they can also break cables hsu et al 2008 as well as pipelines bruschi et al 2006 during flow processes causing industrial and environmental disasters non cohesive sedimentary density flows can be classified into turbidity currents concentrated density flows and hyperconcentrated density

numerical simulations large eddy simulations and reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations have been used with the boussinesq approximation the transportation of sediment concentration is determined by solving an advection diffusion equation meiburg et al 2015 in these numerical approaches particle particle interactions are ignored owing to the dilute nature the hyperconcentrated flow behaves as a non newtonian fluid and grain to grain collisions predominate throughout the flow turbulent motions would be suppressed as a result of the dense nature the concentrated flow is a transitional flow between the hyperconcentrated flow and the turbidity current so far a fewer studies have been devoted to investigate these two flow types cassar et al 2005 performed experiments of hyperconcentrated

bougouin and lacaze 2018 lee et al 2018 compared with the turbidity currents it is more difficult to simulate the hyperconcentrated flows and the concentrated flows because of particle particle

involve more than one flow type after failure of a submarine slope the released hyperconcentrated mass flows and dilutes gradually the hyperconcentrated flow may evolve into the concentrated flow and

the slope used in the present simulation is steeper than slopes in reality the former has the maximum angle of 17 but the latter usually has the angle less than 10 hampton et al 1996 real submarine slopes are stable normally so that other forces are required to cause submarine landslides such forces are not given in the present simulation so that a submarine landslide can not occur unless a steep slope is adopted to justify the use of eq 7 the decimetric froude number f r u g h 0 5 with g g ρ s ρ f ρ s u being the flow front speed and h being the thickness of the sedimentary density flow is computed in the case of d 0 5 mm the maximum u is about 52 m s occurring at t 100 s the corresponding fr is about 0 78 which is similar to the values reported in previous studies mulder 2011 therefore using eq 7 to study sedimentary density flows is reasonable 4 1 flow evolution fig 2 shows the evolution of the sedimentary density flow c 10 4 with d 0 5 mm it is remarked that the contour lines of c 10 3 are very close to those of c 10 4 in the following discussion the flow region with 10 4 c 0 09 is considered to be the turbidity current region due to the bagnold limit for turbulent suspension as suggested by mulder and alexander 2001 the boundary between the concentrated flow region and the hyperconcentrated flow region is close to the transition between newtonian and non newtonian conditions mulder and alexander 2001 c 0 4 is adopted as that boundary in this study it can be seen in fig 2 that the flow transforms from the hyperconcentrated flow t 50 s to the concentrated flow t 200 s and finally evolves into the turbidity current t 450 s the first stage of transformation is the result of erosion by the kelvin helmholtz kh vortices the second stage of transformation is caused by the vigorous stir in the sedimentary density flow by the kh vortices at t 50 s the granular mass slides down along the slope and a vortex layer lies on it due to strong shear the flow is mainly classed as the hyperconcentrated flow at t 100 s the vortex layer rolls up forming several elliptical kh vortices these vortices penetrate the concentrated region and erode the hyperconcentrated region the flow evolves into a surge like current equipped with the significant head followed by the body and the tail at t 200 s the vortices continuously growth up and erode the hyperconcentrated layer a new vortex labelled v2 in the fig 2c is formed in front of the largest vortex v1 in this instant the sedimentary density flow comprises mainly the concentrated flow at t 400 s the vortex v1 rotates and is surrounded with complicated filament debris the vortex v2 rises due to its interaction with the vortex v1 and their interaction significantly distorts the outline of the sedimentary density flow the vortex v1 strongly stretches and folds the concentrated region causing strong mixing at t 450 s the vortex v2 merges with the vortex v1 the flow evolves mainly into the turbidity current the three main dilution mechanisms conjectured by felix and peakall 2006 include erosion off the dense mass breaking apart of the dense underflow and breaking of internal waves these phenomena are also observed in fig 2 and they are the results of the erosion by the kh vortices at t 100 s the hyperconcentrated region is eroded and the internal waves between the hyperconcentrated and the concentration regions breaks at t 200 s the hyperconcentrated region is broken this study finds another dilution mechanism the stir by the vortices which occurs inside the flow 4 2 effects of vortex on sediment motion as discussed in section 4 1 the kh vortices have significant effects on dilution to further investigate these effects figs 3 a d present the buoyancy and the drag force the first and the second terms in eq 6 respectively the turbulent dispersion the third term in eq 6 is ignored here since its magnitude is less than 0 1 of the other two forces the sediment velocity and the fluid pressure are also superposed in figs 3 a d it is remarked that the fluid velocity is quite similar to the sediment velocity their difference can be inferred from the drag force fig 3 e schematically illustrates the typical patterns of the forces exerted on particles due to the fluid vortex it is observed in fig 3 b that the drag force in the hyperconcentrated region is so small suggesting that the vortices cannot stir the hyperconcentrated region the erosion is the main mechanism to transform the hyperconcentrated flow into the concentrated flow in this instant high pore pressure exists in the hyperconcentrated region generating the upward buoyancy see fig 3 a the upward buoyancy decreases the inter particle friction increasing the erosion efficiency the centripetal pattern of buoyancy and the upward convergent pattern of drag force inside the kh vortices can be observed in fig 3 a d e g the region within 29 km x 1 29 5 km for t 400 s the kh vortices in fig 2 are similar to the rankine vortex comprising a forced vortex in the core region and a free vortex in the outer region wu et al 2015 see fig 3 e the rankine vortex has a low pressure zone inside providing outward pressure gradient as a centripetal force the pressure gradient provides the buoyancy applied on sediment particles as a centripetal force too however the particles have larger inertia than fluid so the centripetal force is not strong enough to prevent these particles from leaving the vortex called the ejection here both gravity and drag force have effects on the ejection gravity provides the centrifugal centripetal force to the particles in the lower upper part of the vortex additionally the particles in the lower part of the vortex could have larger speed than in the upper part due to gravity these two effects of gravity together enhance the ejection in the lower part and reduce it in the upper part occasionally particles in the right upper part even move inwardly the drag force resulted from the velocity difference between the particles and their surrounding fluid mitigates the ejection process therefore it points toward the upper part of the vortex resulting in the upward convergent pattern it is noted that the influence area of the buoyancy is limited to the vicinity of the vortex core smaller than that of the drag force since the buoyancy rapidly declines in the outer region see fig 3 e distribution of particles around inside a vortex can affect the transformation when particles accumulate in the vortex core the buoyancy and the drag force slow the particles ejection furthermore the fluid rotates in the vortex core like a rigid body so the mixing does not occur there as a result the dilution process inside the vortex core is inefficient which explain why the vortex cores overlay the concentrated region from t 100 s to 450 s see fig 2 when the particles distribute nonuniformly in the outer region not rigid rotate the vortex stir particles causing filament like distribution of concentration surrounding the vortex core see the vortex v1 in fig 2 d and mixing 4 3 particle size effects fig 4 presents the flow fields of the sedimentary density flows with d 1 mm and 5 mm at t 400 s the sedimentary density flows with d 1 mm and 5 mm can also evolve into turbidity currents as d 0 5 mm differently the hyperconcentrated region still exists for d 5 mm but that region disappears for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm the concentrated region mainly lies on the bed for d 5 mm whereas the vortex cores trap some of the concentrated regions for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm consequently the particle size has effects on the dilution process and the concentration distribution due to the centripetal pattern of the buoyancy in the vortex the distribution of the concentrated region related to the vortices can be inferred from the net buoyancy to expand the concentrated region which is determined by 9 b a c 0 09 c p f d a where a is the area according to the divergence theorem eq 9 can be also explained as the total buoyancy pushing the sediments across the contour line of c 0 09 fig 5 depicts the total area a with c 10 4 0 09 and 0 4 for d 0 5 mm 1 mm and 5 mm to study the particle size effects on dilution process fig 5 also presents b for the three particle sizes to study how the particle size affects the concentration distribution related to the vortex it can be seen from fig 5 a that the smaller particles have better dilution efficacy the possible reason is that the smaller particles have slower settling velocity and are easier to be suspended the particle size of d 5 mm keeps the hyperconcentrated region but the other two particle sizes do not for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm the hyperconcentrated regions c 0 4 entirely transform into the diluter ones c 0 4 additionally the smaller particles have the larger areas with c 10 4 in general notably from fig 5 b that b for the three particle sizes turn from positives to negatives at t 150 s for d 5 mm b goes back to a positive soon however for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm b remain negative the positive b for d 5 mm suggests the concentrated region is mainly in the outer regions of the vortices which is usually below the vortices due to gravity and lies on the bed see fig 4 b the negative b for d 0 5 mm and 1 mm imply that some of the concentrated regions are trapped by the vortex cores see fig 4 a the difference in the locations of the concentration regions is caused by different settling velocities the particles of d 5 mm have faster settling velocities and can fall from the vortex cores quickly 4 4 flow regimes the flow regime of the sedimentary density flow is examined here concerning the mixture of sediment and water the total stress applied on a small element of the mixture t c t s 1 c t f has the three components the viscoplastic component c t sv the viscous component c t fv and the turbulence component c t s t 1 c t f t in order to evaluate how important are these three components fig 6 presents the ratio of the viscoplastic component to the total stress and the ratio of the turbulence component to the total stress in some place these two ratios are quite low meaning that the viscous component is important for the hyperconcentrated region the viscoplastic component dominates suggesting that the flow regime is non newtonian for the turbidity region the viscoplastic component vanishes the turbulence component and or the viscous component prevail in other words the flow regime is newtonian for the turbidity current and it can be either turbulent or laminar the turbidity current is expected to be turbulent in the past this study follows mulder and alexander 2001 to define the turbidity current without considering the strain rate therefore the flow regime can be laminar in some place where the flow almost ceases but some particles are still suspended for the concentrated flow the flow regime is the transition between the laminar newtonian flow regime and the non newtonian flow regime conclusively the computed flow regimes for the three flow types are identical to the previous conjecture mulder and alexander 2001 except that the laminar flow regime could occurs in the turbidity current 5 conclusions this study applied the sophisticated multi phase model lee et al 2019 lee and huang 2018 to examine the submarine landslide over the simplified topography in the field scale the experiment of gladstone et al 1998 was reproduced numerically to validate this model the following conclusions are drawn based on the numerical results 1 the submarine landslide evolves into the hyperconcentrated flow the concentrated flow and the turbidity current successively the kelvin helmholtz vortices caused by shear instability have considerably effects on the transformations of flows through eroding the hyperconcentrated flow and stirring the concentrated flow 2 the buoyancy has centripetal patterns inside the vortex cores and the drag force has upward convergent patterns the dilution process is less efficient in the vortex cores than in the outer regions of the vortices for small particles e g d 0 5 mm and 1 mm in this study the vortex cores can trap these particles for a while forming the high concentration regions in the vortex cores for the larger particles e g d 5 mm in this study the faster settling velocity prevents particles from trap in the vortex cores 3 the numerical results confirm the previous expectations about the flow regimes the hyperconcentrated flow has the non newtonian flow regime and the concentrated flow has the transitional flow regime from the non newtonian flow regime to the newtonian one however the flow regime for the turbidity current can be either laminar or turbulent differing from the previous conjecture of turbulent turbidity current the numerical results show that the flow in some place almost ceases but the particle is still suspended there

appendix a model formulas and boundary conditions the model of lee et al 2019 is developed to deal with sediment transport problems with air water interface this model regards air and water as a single fluid with variable density and viscosity used to track air water interface the water saturation s is defined as the volumetric ratio of water to the void pore space in a computational cell due to the no slip condition at the air water interface only one velocity vector u f is required to specify both the air and the water velocities the density ρf and the viscosity νf of the air water

597,soil properties are determined by a complex arrangement of pores particles and aggregates which may change in time as a result of both ecohydrological dynamics and land management processes the soil pore size distribution psd which typically is treated as a static component is a key determinant of soil properties and its accurate representation has the potential to improve hydrological and crop models following previous work by or et al 2000 a modeling framework is proposed for the time evolution of the psd which takes into account processes such as tillage consolidation and changes in organic matter a time varying power law psd is obtained as the solution of a special form of transport equation for the psd parameterized using data from the literature to capture in a parsimonious and efficient manner the changes in the psd as a result of the soil processes considered alterations in soil properties brought about by tillage consolidation and organic matter are then discussed the potential benefit of this method for determining soil properties over the more widely used pedotransfer functions ptf is that it allows for the history of the soil rather than only its present state to be taken into account when estimating soil properties and it does so in a physically consistent manner leading to the widely used power law expression for soil properties with few parameters keywords soil hydraulic properties pore size distribution tillage soil biogeochemistry 1 introduction the properties of a soil are determined by a complex arrangement of pores particles and aggregates but the temporal evolution of these properties and their links to biogeochemical cycles are typically not taken into account in current biogeochemical and ecohydrological models an accurate representation of soil properties such as the water retention curve wrc and hydraulic conductivity curve hcc is needed for such models in both natural and agricultural environments as they largely control the soil moisture balance which plays a key role in the hydrologic cycle e g manzoni and porporato 2009 porporato et al 2015 however direct measurement of these properties for a particular soil is often infeasible leading to the need to estimate them based on more easily obtained information such as the silt sand clay fractions bulk density and organic matter pedotransfer functions ptfs which use large soil databases to statistically relate such basic data to the soil properties of interest have been widely used to estimate useful soil properties from more readily available data e g wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 but they are largely empirical and limited in their physical information content among their main limitations is that their ability to predict soil properties outside of the regions or soil types which were used to create the functions is unknown and uncertain also they provide little information about soil structure such as the shape of the pore size distribution psd and although more recently vereecken et al 2010 suggested the development of temporal ptfs to better represent the time evolution of soil properties they still implicitly assume static conditions and do not account for time dependent processes although they are often taken to be constant in modeling applications soil properties do change even over relatively short timescales especially under the influence of human activities vereecken et al 2010 combined with the well recognized importance of the psd in determining soil properties this has led to efforts to model the time evolution of the psd and thereby the dynamics of the wrc and hcc or et al 2000 leij et al 2002a 2002b maggi and porporato 2007 also coupled the psd with biological processes to understand the effect of bioclogging on soil hydraulic properties we follow this work by developing a psd model which evolves in time as a result of time dependent soil processes and biogeochemical cycling our model differs from previous efforts in that we make use of a simple power law description of the psd which has the advantage of a clear connection to the well known power law wrc e g brooks and corey 1964 clapp and hornberger 1978 and has a basis in the fractal fragmentation of soils tyler and wheatcraft 1992 perrier et al 1996 while the power law model is not applicable in all cases and its form imposes certain limitations on the shape of the distribution due to its widespread use physical basis and the ease with which it can be linked to bulk soil properties it constitutes a desirable parsimonious model of the psd we also consider biogeochemical processes by connecting the parameters to the soil organic matter som content we first develop an evolution equation for the dynamics of the pore size distribution and derive the power law distribution as one of its solutions we then derive expressions for key soil properties from the power law psd and with a careful consideration of experimental data from the literature link its parameters to key soil processes and management activities such as tillage soil consolidation and changes in som finally we show how these processes alter the psd and soil properties 2 dynamic pore size distribution 2 1 evolution equation we model the time evolution of the pore size distribution f f r t as a function of the pore radius r and the time t via a generic transport equation of the form 1 f t r v f m f where v v r t is a drift term and m m r t is a source sink term this equation represents the evolution of the ensemble frequency distribution of pore radii the term v represents the shrinking of a pore radii as a function of pore radius and time while m represents the instantaneous rate of gain or loss of pores of radius r this type of equation is typically used in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theories to describe the evolution of statistical distributions of multiparticle systems balescu 1997 a sample application to the psd can be seen in fig 1 in the top panel of fig 1 trajectories of individual pores of radius r gradually decrease according to v r t and are randomly lost according to m r t the bottom left and right panels show the psd f r t at t 0 and t 18 years respectively the expressions for f r t v r t and m r t are discussed in section 2 3 or et al 2000 applied a related evolution equation the fokker planck equation to the time evolution of the psd and obtained a lognormal psd a distribution which was first used for this purpose by brutsaert 1966 and later by kosugi 1994 1996 unlike in that study we do not include a diffusion term i e a term depending on the second derivative of f with respect to r 2 f r 2 the presence of such a term requires careful justification because it is linked to a random walk of the individual pore sizes r t e g a random walk in the top panel of fig 1 in addition to the drift and mortality terms however reasonable forms of the psd may be obtained in this way and might be justified by the consideration of processes such as wet dry and freeze thaw cycles which are not considered here one could also consider additional integral terms describing sudden changes in pore structure such as those brought about by tillage rather than doing this we assume that tillage resets the soil pore system with new initial conditions so that eq 1 describes the continuous evolution of the system between tillage events 2 2 power law pore size distribution we assume that in its evolution the psd retains its power law form with time varying parameters 2 f r t a t r b t 0 r r m t in which a t is a scaling parameter b t is the power law exponent and rm t is the maximum effective pore radius the power law psd can be obtained as a solution to eq 1 which is discussed further in the next section and in the appendix rm is related to the air entry or bubbling pressure which can be defined as the matric pressure at which air enters the soil pores brooks and corey 1964 the integral of the psd over r is equal to the porosity ϕ t which is equivalent to the soil water content at saturation we can therefore solve for ϕ t as 3 ϕ t 0 r m t a t r b t d r a t r m t 1 b t 1 b t from which the scaling parameter a t is 4 a t ϕ t 1 b t r m t 1 b t yielding the full expression for the psd 5 f r t ϕ t 1 b t r m t 1 b t r b t in order for the integral to converge it is necessary that b t 1 which is a requirement for the model to be physically realistic in the next section we develop expressions for v and m which allow us to obtain a power law form of the psd 2 3 terms of the evolution equation we now return to the as yet undefined terms of the evolution equation eq 1 the drift v t and the source sink m t in order to obtain a power law psd which evolves in time these terms must be 6 v r t r a t b t a t b t ln r a t and 7 m r t b t b t 1 ln r a t a t b t where the time derivative of the parameters is indicated with a prime symbol with these terms we obtain a form of eq 1 which can be solved analytically using the method of characteristics logan 2013 leading to a power law solution see the appendix for details the initial condition for this problem is 8 f r 0 f 0 r a 0 r b 0 0 r r m 0 t 0 as previously stated we assume that the system resets with new initial conditions at each tillage event in the following sections we will develop expressions for key soil properties as well as discuss the model parameterization and the dependence of the parameters on both time and soil biogeochemical cycling 3 soil hydraulic properties in order to utilize the results of this study in an ecohydrological model we obtain expressions for the evolution of key soil properties in particular the wrc and the hcc note that the psd is intended as an average over the soil depth as we do not consider different soil horizons or a vertically explicit representation of soil properties and so these expressions should likewise be taken as average values using the methods outlined by mualem and dagan 1978 and brutsaert 2005 we model the flow of water through the soil by assuming that the soil pores act as capillary tubes with a distribution of pore sizes determined by the normalized psd i e the probability density function of r and derive the following expression for the matric potential ψ s 9 ψ s s t c s r m t s 1 1 b t where s is the relative soil moisture and cs is a constant related to the surface tension of water a derivation can be found in the appendix we can invert this expression to solve for the relative soil moisture at a particular matric potential for example we can obtain the soil moisture at the wilting point sw by solving for s with the wilting matric potential ψ s w as 10 s w t ψ s w r m t c s b t 1 the same procedure can be followed to obtain other values of interest for soil moisture such as the hygroscopic point and the point of incipient water stress values for the wilting point vary with the plant type but in this study we use ψ s w 1 5 mpa this is a typical value for a crop such as maize though a value of 3 mpa is often used for stress tolerant plants rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 an expression for the hcc can also be obtained by treating the soil pores as a series of parallel tubes with a distribution of radii determined by the psd mualem and dagan 1978 brutsaert 2005 as this tends to lead to an unrealistically high value for the saturated hydraulic conductivity a so called series parallel model can be used in which the parallel tubes are cut normal to the flow direction and randomly rearranged brutsaert 2005 leading to the following expression for the hydraulic conductivity 11 k s t γ w g e ϕ t 2 r m t 2 1 b t 2 μ 3 b t 2 b t s 4 2 b t 1 b t where γw is the specific weight and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water if the flow in the pores follows the hagen poiseuille equation g e 1 8 brutsaert 2005 another soil property of interest the field capacity may be defined as the value of s at which the hydraulic conductivity becomes negligible compared to the maximum daily evapotranspiration rate rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 3 1 model parameterization as the wrc curve is generally easier to measure than pore size data it is useful to estimate the latter from the former we can relate the soil moisture s to the water content θ t and the porosity ϕ t as 12 s θ t t θ t ϕ t which allows us to rewrite eq 9 as 13 ψ s θ t t c s r m t θ t ϕ t 1 1 b t we estimated the parameter values by using the matlab constrained minimization function fmincon to minimize the root mean square error rmse between eq 13 and the data while developing this model we explored other parameterizations of the wrc for example including a residual porosity or a minimum pore radius but found that these additional parameters had little effect on the model results and so in the interest of parsimony we have neglected them fig 2 shows an example of this fitting to data of teiwes 1988 obtained from leij et al 2002b which compares data from two experimental sites one which had been tilled annually and one which was managed using no till methods 4 connection of parameters to temporal and biogeochemical processes we separate the important factors which affect the psd parameters into those which are explicitly time dependent including external forcing such as soil tillage and internal processes such as consolidation and those which depend on the soil biogeochemistry the effect of soil biogeochemistry on soil structure and properties are complex to account for these effects in our model we adopt the soil organic matter content c t as a means to encapsulate the effect of soil biogeochemical changes on the soil while this is certainly a simplification it is a necessary one to maintain the parsimonious description of the soil psd in order to incorporate the effects of time dependent processes and soil organic matter we posit that these changes are sufficiently independent that they can be accounted for with two multiplicative terms in reality of course they are not likely to be completely independent but this is a useful first step to separate these two important influences in this way it represents an improvement on a typical pedotransfer function for which all else being equal a given value of som will always result in the same soil properties because time dependent information such as the time when the soil was last tilled are not taken into account below we present only the results for the power law exponent b but the same procedure was followed for all parameters we separate the factors which control the value of b into two parts first a function γb t which is used to account for explicitly time dependent changes in the psd and second a component bc c t which relates the value of b to the som content these terms are then multiplied together to obtain an expression for b t c t 14 b t c t γ b t b c c t the next subsections discuss γb t and bc c t respectively 4 1 tillage and consolidation term differences in the soil properties of tilled and untilled soils are evident in many studies teiwes 1988 arshad et al 1999 or et al 2000 leij et al 2002b and can be seen for example in fig 2 while tillage induces an immediate change in the psd there is also a consolidation process which occurs over a larger timescale as larger pores close and the distribution of pore sizes changes hillel 1980 jiang et al 2018 in order to incorporate the effect of tillage and consolidation into our model we utilized data teiwes 1988 which presents contrasting wrc curves from plots which were tilled annually and those which were left untilled for an extended period in this case 18 years fig 3 shows the fitted psd model before and after tillage the samples were taken approximately 6 months 180 d after the soil was tilled for each parameter we obtained the ratio between the no till and the tilled value based on the empirical differences between the psd of tilled and no till soils fig 2 we assume that there is a consistent ratio of the value of each parameter at two given points in time e g the ratio of a parameter immediately after tillage and after maximum consolidation is constant and that this ratio is independent of the current som content given the time scales of interest in this work ranging from days to multiple growing seasons tillage is assumed to occur instantaneously and is followed by consolidation which is modeled by an exponential decline towards the untilled state therefore we write the settling term γb as 15 γ b t r b 1 r b exp k b t 180 where rb is the ratio of the no till parameter value to the base value kb is the time rate of settling and t is the time since the soil was tilled at which point the psd is reset with a new initial condition in this way when t 180 days the soil has been tilled 180 days prior the consolidation term γ b 1 and the modeled psd matches the data as t after a long period without tillage the consolidation term γb rb and the psd approaches the untilled state by assuming a constant value for kb the parameter values at tillage can be obtained by setting t 0 days the effect of the γ term on the parameter values can be seen in the black lines in fig 7 which show the parameter evolution with constant c 4 2 som relationship organic matter is an important indicator of soil structure and function e g dexter 2004 dexter et al 2008 which is demonstrated by the inclusion of som as a predictor variable in many ptfs e g wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 soils which have different levels of organic matter clearly have different properties in reality there is likely some overlap between the effect on the psd of management practices which tend to increase or decrease som content and the physical properties of som itself but in this study we take the amount of som as a proxy for these joint effects the expression for bc is 16 b c c t b 0 σ b c t where b 0 is the parameter value at c 0 and σb is the slope of the b c relationship here we have used a linear fit though other relationships may be supported by additional data fig 4 shows fitted relationships for each of the three model parameters we note that the data to which this relationship was fit extends over a limited range and it therefore may not hold outside of it for example it may not be valid as low as c 0 despite the fact that b 0 appears in the equation the magnitude of parameter changes over time due to changing c can be seen in fig 7 the three lines in each panel correspond to increasing constant and decreasing c all the data used in this study is from silt loam soils and it is possible or even likely that other types of soils would produce substantially different results additionally the tillage method used in teiwes 1988 was moldboard plowing while multiple tillage types were used in naveed et al 2014 including an offset disc plow and rotary harrow here we do not consider different effects for different types of tillage though there are differences heard et al 1988 which could possibly be taken into account by adjusting the ratios between till and no till parameters 5 evolution of soil hydraulic properties and parameters in the preceding sections we have developed a model which accounts for the evolution of the psd as a result of both temporal tillage and consolidation and biogeochemical som content changes in the soil and which connects the resulting dynamic psd to important soil hydraulic properties we will now see the joint effects of these changes on the model the effects of biogeochemical processes are shown by varying the som levels see fig 5 we have imposed three theoretical regimes of som dynamics in which som declines remains constant and increases respectively these temporal variations in som are consistent with a minimal som model with constant inputs and first order decomposition and the three regimes are intended to represent low medium and high input levels of fertilizer manure or other amendments which tend to promote som accumulation the upper and lower limits of som are chosen so that the results are shown over the range of som values contained in the data from naveed et al 2014 which were used to parameterize the model the effects of temporal processes are demonstrated by imposing a till period of several years of annual tillage followed by a longer no till period these periods are separated by the gray lines in figs 6 and 7 additionally we have denoted 3 points on fig 5 as a b and c which we will use to indicate the differences between the soil psd and hydraulic properties across varying times and som levels as previously discussed the wrc and the hcc are two key soil hydraulic properties which are largely controlled by the psd in fig 6 the effects of tillage on these two properties are shown with a timeseries of the soil wilting point sw top left and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat bottom left which were estimated using eqs 9 and 11 additionally the right side of fig 6 shows the wrc and the hcc at points a b and c to demonstrate how these changing soil properties can be integrated into an ecohydrological model in the top panel of fig 6 the wilting point decreases with tillage and for higher levels of som this reflects the general purpose of tillage which is to improve soil structure for crop growth hillel 1980 as lowered wilting points allow crops to continue transpiring at lower soil moisture levels the negative relationship between sw and som is also consistent with other studies which considered the impact of som on soil properties for example dexter 2004 found a positive correlation between som and a measure of soil physical quality in the bottom panel we observe that the hydraulic conductivity ksat is increased with tillage and for higher values of som some studies show an increase of soil hydraulic conductivity with tillage mielke et al 1986 heard et al 1988 pikul jr et al 1990 which may represent an increase in the number of macropores although macropores are more continuous in no till soils heard et al 1988 found them to be more numerous in tilled soils macroporosity is not separated from total porosity in our model but is related to the rm parameter which also increases with tillage see the middle panel of fig 7 however it is also possible that undisturbed soils could have a higher hydraulic conductivity because their macropores formed by earthworms insects or roots are more continuous and are not disrupted during tillage ehlers and van der ploeg 1976 klute 1982 wu et al 1992 the positive relationship between hydraulic conductivity and som can be attributed to an associated increase in macro and mesoporosity mahmood ul hassan et al 2013 the study from which we obtained som data naveed et al 2014 did not present hydraulic conductivity data though it did show a general trend of increasing air permeability with increasing som and it is to be expected that hydraulic conductivity would trend in the same direction as air permeability fig 7 shows timeseries of the model parameters for a tilled followed by a no till period and for contrasting som levels as in fig 6 although the power law psd has certain limitations in the variety of soil types that it can adequately represent a decrease in the power law exponent b generally means that for a particular matric pressure the soil is capable of maintaining a higher water content which is favorable for crops the top left panel of fig 7 shows that b decreases with tillage and with higher levels of som which is consistent with the positive correlation of som with a soil quality index found elsewhere dexter 2004 the positive relationship of rm with both tillage and som top right panel can be connected to the associations of both with increased macroporosity as discussed previously and is shown in the middle of fig 7 the positive relationships between porosity and som and the decrease in ϕ in the absence of tillage bottom left panel can be seen in the bottom panel of fig 7 and have support in the literature teiwes 1988 dexter et al 2008 naveed et al 2014 the bottom right panel shows the combined effects of different parameter combinations on the psd at points a b and c one potential implication of the results shown in figs 6 and 7 is that there may be tradeoffs between management strategies here encapsulated by tillage and changes in som and soil properties for example in the bottom left panel of fig 7 despite 18 years of no till management at the end of the 25 years modeling period the porosity for the high som treatment was over 90 of its initial value this suggests possibilities for optimizing management strategies in order to achieve desired soil property outcomes however we emphasize that the results shown in figs 5 7 do not represent a full coupling of the dynamic psd model to an ecohydrological model this would include feedbacks between for example the soil hydraulic properties and the som dynamics and would also require estimations of other soil properties such as the soil depth from the changes in the psd such a coupling will be explored in a follow up publication 6 conclusion the model described in this study represents realistic trends of key soil properties as they evolve in time and change with soil biogeochemistry in a physically consistent manner changes in the key soil properties indicated here by the wrc and the hcc as well as sw and ksat and the parameters which control them b rm ϕ are shown in figs 6 and 7 each panel shows a timeseries of the parameter or variable with the soil undergoing several years of annual tillage followed by a longer period of consolidation corresponding to a no till period for increasing decreasing and constant som the general trends shown by the soil properties in figs 6 and 7 have support in the literature via their dependence on som these dynamic variables can be readily coupled to an ecohydrological or soil biogeochemical model we note that the model presented here does not account for very short term changes in soil properties such as those due to wetting and drying cycles however the long term effects of such hydrologic forcing on soil properties could be indirectly accounted for via the changes in som which would result from different hydrologic regimes or irrigation strategies to create figs 6 and 7 we imposed three contrasting som regimes which were intended to represent low middle and high inputs of amendments which tend to promote the accumulation of som the power law model may in general perform less well on fine textured soils tyler and wheatcraft 1990 and because this model is vertically averaged over the soil depth it may also be less applicable to soils with strong vertical variation in soil type or properties the results in figs 6 and 7 point toward a means to account for the considerable changes which can be brought about in soil properties as a result of contrasting management strategies specifically those which increase or decrease som and the effect of tillage this can be done by providing a real coupling of this model to ordinary differential equations describing soil biogeochemical processes and plant growth future contributions

water retention curve the relative soil moisture s is defined as a 11 s θ ϕ where θ is the volumetric water content and ϕ is the porosity following brutsaert 2005 we assume that soil moisture will occupy smaller pores first allowing us to set the relative soil moisture s r equal to p r the cumulative distribution function cdf of the pore size distribution where r is the effective radius of the largest pore which is filled at the specified soil moisture level a 12 s r p r we can invert this expression to solve for r p 1 s we then apply the young laplace equation which gives the pressure difference across the interface between two immiscible fluids brutsaert 2005 a 13 δ p σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 in which r 1 and r 2 are the radii of curvature of the interface and σ is the surface tension we define the radii of curvature as r r cos β where β is the contact angle of the air water interface and assume that the radii of curvature are equal so that we can now write the previous expression as a 14 δ p 2 σ cos β r the contact angle for water and typical soil materials is generally small so we let β 0 and define the pressure difference across the interface as the matric pressure δ p ψ s we then obtain the following expression for the matric pressure as a function of r a 15 ψ s r c s r where c s 2 σ by substituting the previous expression for r s we can obtain the matric pressure as a

597,soil properties are determined by a complex arrangement of pores particles and aggregates which may change in time as a result of both ecohydrological dynamics and land management processes the soil pore size distribution psd which typically is treated as a static component is a key determinant of soil properties and its accurate representation has the potential to improve hydrological and crop models following previous work by or et al 2000 a modeling framework is proposed for the time evolution of the psd which takes into account processes such as tillage consolidation and changes in organic matter a time varying power law psd is obtained as the solution of a special form of transport equation for the psd parameterized using data from the literature to capture in a parsimonious and efficient manner the changes in the psd as a result of the soil processes considered alterations in soil properties brought about by tillage consolidation and organic matter are then discussed the potential benefit of this method for determining soil properties over the more widely used pedotransfer functions ptf is that it allows for the history of the soil rather than only its present state to be taken into account when estimating soil properties and it does so in a physically consistent manner leading to the widely used power law expression for soil properties with few parameters keywords soil hydraulic properties pore size distribution tillage soil biogeochemistry 1 introduction the properties of a soil are determined by a complex arrangement of pores particles and aggregates but the temporal evolution of these properties and their links to biogeochemical cycles are typically not taken into account in current biogeochemical and ecohydrological models an accurate representation of soil properties such as the water retention curve wrc and hydraulic conductivity curve hcc is needed for such models in both natural and agricultural environments as they largely control the soil moisture balance which plays a key role in the hydrologic cycle e g manzoni and porporato 2009 porporato et al 2015 however direct measurement of these properties for a particular soil is often infeasible leading to the need to estimate them based on more easily obtained information such as the silt sand clay fractions bulk density and organic matter pedotransfer functions ptfs which use large soil databases to statistically relate such basic data to the soil properties of interest have been widely used to estimate useful soil properties from more readily available data e g wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 but they are largely empirical and limited in their physical information content among their main limitations is that their ability to predict soil properties outside of the regions or soil types which were used to create the functions is unknown and uncertain also they provide little information about soil structure such as the shape of the pore size distribution psd and although more recently vereecken et al 2010 suggested the development of temporal ptfs to better represent the time evolution of soil properties they still implicitly assume static conditions and do not account for time dependent processes although they are often taken to be constant in modeling applications soil properties do change even over relatively short timescales especially under the influence of human activities vereecken et al 2010 combined with the well recognized importance of the psd in determining soil properties this has led to efforts to model the time evolution of the psd and thereby the dynamics of the wrc and hcc or et al 2000 leij et al 2002a 2002b maggi and porporato 2007 also coupled the psd with biological processes to understand the effect of bioclogging on soil hydraulic properties we follow this work by developing a psd model which evolves in time as a result of time dependent soil processes and biogeochemical cycling our model differs from previous efforts in that we make use of a simple power law description of the psd which has the advantage of a clear connection to the well known power law wrc e g brooks and corey 1964 clapp and hornberger 1978 and has a basis in the fractal fragmentation of soils tyler and wheatcraft 1992 perrier et al 1996 while the power law model is not applicable in all cases and its form imposes certain limitations on the shape of the distribution due to its widespread use physical basis and the ease with which it can be linked to bulk soil properties it constitutes a desirable parsimonious model of the psd we also consider biogeochemical processes by connecting the parameters to the soil organic matter som content we first develop an evolution equation for the dynamics of the pore size distribution and derive the power law distribution as one of its solutions we then derive expressions for key soil properties from the power law psd and with a careful consideration of experimental data from the literature link its parameters to key soil processes and management activities such as tillage soil consolidation and changes in som finally we show how these processes alter the psd and soil properties 2 dynamic pore size distribution 2 1 evolution equation we model the time evolution of the pore size distribution f f r t as a function of the pore radius r and the time t via a generic transport equation of the form 1 f t r v f m f where v v r t is a drift term and m m r t is a source sink term this equation represents the evolution of the ensemble frequency distribution of pore radii the term v represents the shrinking of a pore radii as a function of pore radius and time while m represents the instantaneous rate of gain or loss of pores of radius r this type of equation is typically used in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theories to describe the evolution of statistical distributions of multiparticle systems balescu 1997 a sample application to the psd can be seen in fig 1 in the top panel of fig 1 trajectories of individual pores of radius r gradually decrease according to v r t and are randomly lost according to m r t the bottom left and right panels show the psd f r t at t 0 and t 18 years respectively the expressions for f r t v r t and m r t are discussed in section 2 3 or et al 2000 applied a related evolution equation the fokker planck equation to the time evolution of the psd and obtained a lognormal psd a distribution which was first used for this purpose by brutsaert 1966 and later by kosugi 1994 1996 unlike in that study we do not include a diffusion term i e a term depending on the second derivative of f with respect to r 2 f r 2 the presence of such a term requires careful justification because it is linked to a random walk of the individual pore sizes r t e g a random walk in the top panel of fig 1 in addition to the drift and mortality terms however reasonable forms of the psd may be obtained in this way and might be justified by the consideration of processes such as wet dry and freeze thaw cycles which are not considered here one could also consider additional integral terms describing sudden changes in pore structure such as those brought about by tillage rather than doing this we assume that tillage resets the soil pore system with new initial conditions so that eq 1 describes the continuous evolution of the system between tillage events 2 2 power law pore size distribution we assume that in its evolution the psd retains its power law form with time varying parameters 2 f r t a t r b t 0 r r m t in which a t is a scaling parameter b t is the power law exponent and rm t is the maximum effective pore radius the power law psd can be obtained as a solution to eq 1 which is discussed further in the next section and in the appendix rm is related to the air entry or bubbling pressure which can be defined as the matric pressure at which air enters the soil pores brooks and corey 1964 the integral of the psd over r is equal to the porosity ϕ t which is equivalent to the soil water content at saturation we can therefore solve for ϕ t as 3 ϕ t 0 r m t a t r b t d r a t r m t 1 b t 1 b t from which the scaling parameter a t is 4 a t ϕ t 1 b t r m t 1 b t yielding the full expression for the psd 5 f r t ϕ t 1 b t r m t 1 b t r b t in order for the integral to converge it is necessary that b t 1 which is a requirement for the model to be physically realistic in the next section we develop expressions for v and m which allow us to obtain a power law form of the psd 2 3 terms of the evolution equation we now return to the as yet undefined terms of the evolution equation eq 1 the drift v t and the source sink m t in order to obtain a power law psd which evolves in time these terms must be 6 v r t r a t b t a t b t ln r a t and 7 m r t b t b t 1 ln r a t a t b t where the time derivative of the parameters is indicated with a prime symbol with these terms we obtain a form of eq 1 which can be solved analytically using the method of characteristics logan 2013 leading to a power law solution see the appendix for details the initial condition for this problem is 8 f r 0 f 0 r a 0 r b 0 0 r r m 0 t 0 as previously stated we assume that the system resets with new initial conditions at each tillage event in the following sections we will develop expressions for key soil properties as well as discuss the model parameterization and the dependence of the parameters on both time and soil biogeochemical cycling 3 soil hydraulic properties in order to utilize the results of this study in an ecohydrological model we obtain expressions for the evolution of key soil properties in particular the wrc and the hcc note that the psd is intended as an average over the soil depth as we do not consider different soil horizons or a vertically explicit representation of soil properties and so these expressions should likewise be taken as average values using the methods outlined by mualem and dagan 1978 and brutsaert 2005 we model the flow of water through the soil by assuming that the soil pores act as capillary tubes with a distribution of pore sizes determined by the normalized psd i e the probability density function of r and derive the following expression for the matric potential ψ s 9 ψ s s t c s r m t s 1 1 b t where s is the relative soil moisture and cs is a constant related to the surface tension of water a derivation can be found in the appendix we can invert this expression to solve for the relative soil moisture at a particular matric potential for example we can obtain the soil moisture at the wilting point sw by solving for s with the wilting matric potential ψ s w as 10 s w t ψ s w r m t c s b t 1 the same procedure can be followed to obtain other values of interest for soil moisture such as the hygroscopic point and the point of incipient water stress values for the wilting point vary with the plant type but in this study we use ψ s w 1 5 mpa this is a typical value for a crop such as maize though a value of 3 mpa is often used for stress tolerant plants rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 an expression for the hcc can also be obtained by treating the soil pores as a series of parallel tubes with a distribution of radii determined by the psd mualem and dagan 1978 brutsaert 2005 as this tends to lead to an unrealistically high value for the saturated hydraulic conductivity a so called series parallel model can be used in which the parallel tubes are cut normal to the flow direction and randomly rearranged brutsaert 2005 leading to the following expression for the hydraulic conductivity 11 k s t γ w g e ϕ t 2 r m t 2 1 b t 2 μ 3 b t 2 b t s 4 2 b t 1 b t where γw is the specific weight and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water if the flow in the pores follows the hagen poiseuille equation g e 1 8 brutsaert 2005 another soil property of interest the field capacity may be defined as the value of s at which the hydraulic conductivity becomes negligible compared to the maximum daily evapotranspiration rate rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 3 1 model parameterization as the wrc curve is generally easier to measure than pore size data it is useful to estimate the latter from the former we can relate the soil moisture s to the water content θ t and the porosity ϕ t as 12 s θ t t θ t ϕ t which allows us to rewrite eq 9 as 13 ψ s θ t t c s r m t θ t ϕ t 1 1 b t we estimated the parameter values by using the matlab constrained minimization function fmincon to minimize the root mean square error rmse between eq 13 and the data while developing this model we explored other parameterizations of the wrc for example including a residual porosity or a minimum pore radius but found that these additional parameters had little effect on the model results and so in the interest of parsimony we have neglected them fig 2 shows an example of this fitting to data of teiwes 1988 obtained from leij et al 2002b which compares data from two experimental sites one which had been tilled annually and one which was managed using no till methods 4 connection of parameters to temporal and biogeochemical processes we separate the important factors which affect the psd parameters into those which are explicitly time dependent including external forcing such as soil tillage and internal processes such as consolidation and those which depend on the soil biogeochemistry the effect of soil biogeochemistry on soil structure and properties are complex to account for these effects in our model we adopt the soil organic matter content c t as a means to encapsulate the effect of soil biogeochemical changes on the soil while this is certainly a simplification it is a necessary one to maintain the parsimonious description of the soil psd in order to incorporate the effects of time dependent processes and soil organic matter we posit that these changes are sufficiently independent that they can be accounted for with two multiplicative terms in reality of course they are not likely to be completely independent but this is a useful first step to separate these two important influences in this way it represents an improvement on a typical pedotransfer function for which all else being equal a given value of som will always result in the same soil properties because time dependent information such as the time when the soil was last tilled are not taken into account below we present only the results for the power law exponent b but the same procedure was followed for all parameters we separate the factors which control the value of b into two parts first a function γb t which is used to account for explicitly time dependent changes in the psd and second a component bc c t which relates the value of b to the som content these terms are then multiplied together to obtain an expression for b t c t 14 b t c t γ b t b c c t the next subsections discuss γb t and bc c t respectively 4 1 tillage and consolidation term differences in the soil properties of tilled and untilled soils are evident in many studies teiwes 1988 arshad et al 1999 or et al 2000 leij et al 2002b and can be seen for example in fig 2 while tillage induces an immediate change in the psd there is also a consolidation process which occurs over a larger timescale as larger pores close and the distribution of pore sizes changes hillel 1980 jiang et al 2018 in order to incorporate the effect of tillage and consolidation into our model we utilized data teiwes 1988 which presents contrasting wrc curves from plots which were tilled annually and those which were left untilled for an extended period in this case 18 years fig 3 shows the fitted psd model before and after tillage the samples were taken approximately 6 months 180 d after the soil was tilled for each parameter we obtained the ratio between the no till and the tilled value based on the empirical differences between the psd of tilled and no till soils fig 2 we assume that there is a consistent ratio of the value of each parameter at two given points in time e g the ratio of a parameter immediately after tillage and after maximum consolidation is constant and that this ratio is independent of the current som content given the time scales of interest in this work ranging from days to multiple growing seasons tillage is assumed to occur instantaneously and is followed by consolidation which is modeled by an exponential decline towards the untilled state therefore we write the settling term γb as 15 γ b t r b 1 r b exp k b t 180 where rb is the ratio of the no till parameter value to the base value kb is the time rate of settling and t is the time since the soil was tilled at which point the psd is reset with a new initial condition in this way when t 180 days the soil has been tilled 180 days prior the consolidation term γ b 1 and the modeled psd matches the data as t after a long period without tillage the consolidation term γb rb and the psd approaches the untilled state by assuming a constant value for kb the parameter values at tillage can be obtained by setting t 0 days the effect of the γ term on the parameter values can be seen in the black lines in fig 7 which show the parameter evolution with constant c 4 2 som relationship organic matter is an important indicator of soil structure and function e g dexter 2004 dexter et al 2008 which is demonstrated by the inclusion of som as a predictor variable in many ptfs e g wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 soils which have different levels of organic matter clearly have different properties in reality there is likely some overlap between the effect on the psd of management practices which tend to increase or decrease som content and the physical properties of som itself but in this study we take the amount of som as a proxy for these joint effects the expression for bc is 16 b c c t b 0 σ b c t where b 0 is the parameter value at c 0 and σb is the slope of the b c relationship here we have used a linear fit though other relationships may be supported by additional data fig 4 shows fitted relationships for each of the three model parameters we note that the data to which this relationship was fit extends over a limited range and it therefore may not hold outside of it for example it may not be valid as low as c 0 despite the fact that b 0 appears in the equation the magnitude of parameter changes over time due to changing c can be seen in fig 7 the three lines in each panel correspond to increasing constant and decreasing c all the data used in this study is from silt loam soils and it is possible or even likely that other types of soils would produce substantially different results additionally the tillage method used in teiwes 1988 was moldboard plowing while multiple tillage types were used in naveed et al 2014 including an offset disc plow and rotary harrow here we do not consider different effects for different types of tillage though there are differences heard et al 1988 which could possibly be taken into account by adjusting the ratios between till and no till parameters 5 evolution of soil hydraulic properties and parameters in the preceding sections we have developed a model which accounts for the evolution of the psd as a result of both temporal tillage and consolidation and biogeochemical som content changes in the soil and which connects the resulting dynamic psd to important soil hydraulic properties we will now see the joint effects of these changes on the model the effects of biogeochemical processes are shown by varying the som levels see fig 5 we have imposed three theoretical regimes of som dynamics in which som declines remains constant and increases respectively these temporal variations in som are consistent with a minimal som model with constant inputs and first order decomposition and the three regimes are intended to represent low medium and high input levels of fertilizer manure or other amendments which tend to promote som accumulation the upper and lower limits of som are chosen so that the results are shown over the range of som values contained in the data from naveed et al 2014 which were used to parameterize the model the effects of temporal processes are demonstrated by imposing a till period of several years of annual tillage followed by a longer no till period these periods are separated by the gray lines in figs 6 and 7 additionally we have denoted 3 points on fig 5 as a b and c which we will use to indicate the differences between the soil psd and hydraulic properties across varying times and som levels as previously discussed the wrc and the hcc are two key soil hydraulic properties which are largely controlled by the psd in fig 6 the effects of tillage on these two properties are shown with a timeseries of the soil wilting point sw top left and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat bottom left which were estimated using eqs 9 and 11 additionally the right side of fig 6 shows the wrc and the hcc at points a b and c to demonstrate how these changing soil properties can be integrated into an ecohydrological model in the top panel of fig 6 the wilting point decreases with tillage and for higher levels of som this reflects the general purpose of tillage which is to improve soil structure for crop growth hillel 1980 as lowered wilting points allow crops to continue transpiring at lower soil moisture levels the negative relationship between sw and som is also consistent with other studies which considered the impact of som on soil properties for example dexter 2004 found a positive correlation between som and a measure of soil physical quality in the bottom panel we observe that the hydraulic conductivity ksat is increased with tillage and for higher values of som some studies show an increase of soil hydraulic conductivity with tillage mielke et al 1986 heard et al 1988 pikul jr et al 1990 which may represent an increase in the number of macropores although macropores are more continuous in no till soils heard et al 1988 found them to be more numerous in tilled soils macroporosity is not separated from total porosity in our model but is related to the rm parameter which also increases with tillage see the middle panel of fig 7 however it is also possible that undisturbed soils could have a higher hydraulic conductivity because their macropores formed by earthworms insects or roots are more continuous and are not disrupted during tillage ehlers and van der ploeg 1976 klute 1982 wu et al 1992 the positive relationship between hydraulic conductivity and som can be attributed to an associated increase in macro and mesoporosity mahmood ul hassan et al 2013 the study from which we obtained som data naveed et al 2014 did not present hydraulic conductivity data though it did show a general trend of increasing air permeability with increasing som and it is to be expected that hydraulic conductivity would trend in the same direction as air permeability fig 7 shows timeseries of the model parameters for a tilled followed by a no till period and for contrasting som levels as in fig 6 although the power law psd has certain limitations in the variety of soil types that it can adequately represent a decrease in the power law exponent b generally means that for a particular matric pressure the soil is capable of maintaining a higher water content which is favorable for crops the top left panel of fig 7 shows that b decreases with tillage and with higher levels of som which is consistent with the positive correlation of som with a soil quality index found elsewhere dexter 2004 the positive relationship of rm with both tillage and som top right panel can be connected to the associations of both with increased macroporosity as discussed previously and is shown in the middle of fig 7 the positive relationships between porosity and som and the decrease in ϕ in the absence of tillage bottom left panel can be seen in the bottom panel of fig 7 and have support in the literature teiwes 1988 dexter et al 2008 naveed et al 2014 the bottom right panel shows the combined effects of different parameter combinations on the psd at points a b and c one potential implication of the results shown in figs 6 and 7 is that there may be tradeoffs between management strategies here encapsulated by tillage and changes in som and soil properties for example in the bottom left panel of fig 7 despite 18 years of no till management at the end of the 25 years modeling period the porosity for the high som treatment was over 90 of its initial value this suggests possibilities for optimizing management strategies in order to achieve desired soil property outcomes however we emphasize that the results shown in figs 5 7 do not represent a full coupling of the dynamic psd model to an ecohydrological model this would include feedbacks between for example the soil hydraulic properties and the som dynamics and would also require estimations of other soil properties such as the soil depth from the changes in the psd such a coupling will be explored in a follow up publication 6 conclusion the model described in this study represents realistic trends of key soil properties as they evolve in time and change with soil biogeochemistry in a physically consistent manner changes in the key soil properties indicated here by the wrc and the hcc as well as sw and ksat and the parameters which control them b rm ϕ are shown in figs 6 and 7 each panel shows a timeseries of the parameter or variable with the soil undergoing several years of annual tillage followed by a longer period of consolidation corresponding to a no till period for increasing decreasing and constant som the general trends shown by the soil properties in figs 6 and 7 have support

for very short term changes in soil properties such as those due to wetting and drying cycles however the long term effects of such hydrologic forcing on soil properties could be indirectly accounted for via the changes in som which would result from different hydrologic regimes or irrigation strategies to create figs 6 and 7 we imposed three contrasting som regimes which were intended to represent low middle and high inputs of amendments which tend to promote the accumulation of som the power law model may in general perform less well on fine textured soils tyler and wheatcraft 1990 and because this model is vertically averaged over the soil depth it may also be less applicable to soils with strong vertical variation in soil type or properties the results in figs 6 and 7 point

water retention curve the relative soil moisture s is defined as a 11 s θ ϕ where θ is the volumetric water content and ϕ is the porosity following brutsaert 2005 we assume that soil moisture will

598,a worldwide study is presented to understand the role of major global moisture source regions in the occurrence of extreme monthly precipitation over the continents the lagrangian model flexpart v9 0 was used to analyse the moisture transport for precipitation and the extreme precipitation was calculated for each grid point at 0 25 using the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep monthly precipitation dataset although the eventual aim of this work is to show the link between the contributions from the sources to their sinks during months of extreme rainfall we provide for the first time much needed information on these contributions at a monthly scale previously this information was only available at an annual scale we also provide maps showing global monthly moisture sources together with the identification of the peak precipitation month ppm and of the preferred moisture source for precipitation in that month graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords contribution to precipitation lagrangian modelling extreme precipitation sources of moisture 1 introduction a primary concern related to climate change is not just the variation in the mean variables of climate but also in their extremes santos and costa 2014 several authors have pointed to future increases in the frequency and magnitude of extremes smith 2011 singh et al 2013 fischer et al 2013 understanding how climate change affects these extremes is important due to their impact on the environment and on society as a whole e g frank et al 2015 butt et al 2015 nolet and kneeshaw 2018 o lenick et al 2019 such understanding is also crucial monitoring and preparedness of unexpected extreme events toreti and desiato 2008 under a warmer climate precipitation will change substantially trenberth 2011 and the frequency of extreme wet and dry years is expected to increase knapp et al 2015 ramos et al 2016 extreme precipitation events lead to major natural disasters around the world and are the main cause of flood events because of this the comprehensive analysis of global precipitation climatology and the assessment of extreme precipitation events are of particular interest to better understand the likely impacts of global climate change on the water cycle the link between oceanic and terrestrial sources and precipitation is especially relevant e g gimeno et al 2010 van der ent and savenije 2013 the identification of the major sources of precipitation is thus important for areas where there are changes in the hydrological cycle due to climate change gimeno et al 2013 given the importance of this topic previous authors have investigated the major oceanic and terrestrial water sources of precipitation and their corresponding sink regions at a global gimeno et al 2010 van der ent et al 2010 and a regional scale e g drumond et al 2014 sodemann and zubler 2010 gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 analysed the oceanic moisture sources using the maximum values of annual divergence flux of moisture they observed an asymmetrical influence of moisture source regions on precipitation over land in terms of both extent and importance while the moisture contribution from some large oceanic sources for instance the south pacific ocean is localized over large continental areas some smaller sources provide moisture to widespread vast areas in proportion to their sizes for example the black sea provides moisture for precipitation over central europe ciric et al 2016 the arabian peninsula heydarizad et al 2018 and even the arctic region vázquez et al 2016 moreover despite some continental regions receiving moisture from several sources other regions have no moisture contribution for precipitation from any of these major moisture sources as identified by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 where the moisture contribution is more local e g greenland sodemann et al 2008 or inland parts of asia sato et al 2007 further details of the main sources of moisture and their contribution to precipitation over continental areas can be found in gimeno et al 2010 2013 in the present work the analysis of gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 is revisited in order to allow identification of the major oceanic and terrestrial sources of extreme precipitation for the whole of the period 1980 2015 from the detection of these moisture sources a complete collection of maps of precipitation is developed taking into account only monthly extremes of precipitation the aim of this work is twofold i to collate maps of global extremes and ii enhance understanding of the role of the major sources of moisture oceanic and continental during the months with intense precipitation monthly data from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset are used to analyse the precipitation extremes and the outputs from the flexible particle dispersion flexpart model are used to compute the associated moisture transport 2 methodology 2 1 moisture source region definition identification of the major global moisture source regions is based on the methodology established by gimeno et al 2010 the method uses the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf divergence to localize maximum values which are associated with evaporative areas using vimf data obtained from the era interim dataset dee et al 2011 at a 1 1 horizontal resolution the climatological flux divergence was computed for each month individually over a 36 year period 1980 2015 gimeno et al 2010 imposed fixed annual thresholds of 750 and 500 mm year to identify the oceanic and continental moisture sources the fiftieth and fortieth percentiles respectively here the thresholds are imposed monthly and the moisture sources are defined as those areas showing values higher than the threshold for each month 2 2 continental sink regions and flexpart methodology in order to analyse the regions affected by each of the detected sources and to assess how much moisture is provided to these areas the lagrangian particle dispersion model flexpart is applied this model was developed by stohl 1999 and is widely used to analyse moisture transport e g sodemann et al 2008 nieto et al 2010 vázquez et al 2016 sorí et al 2017 the input data for running flexpart is era interim reanalysis at a resolution of 1 x 1 degrees in latitude and longitude and on native ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasting model levels flexpart uses 3d wind to transport and move the particles and among other parametrization turbulent dispersion is handled by a subroutine that calls procedures to interpolate winds a complete model configuration can be found in stohl and james 2005 therefore the final trajectories outputs need not be in the initial grid 1 x 1 and the changes in any variable over a particular area can be calculated for the grid required by the user with a number of air particles that must be higher than the ecmwf model levels flexpart is used for a global experiment in which about 2 million air particles are released every 6 h with intermediate data added every 3 h stohl and james 2004 outputs were used to analyse changes in moisture experienced by the particles along their trajectories in the present work changes in specific humidity are used to analyse the moisture contribution from the major sources over the continents however there are many different parameters that may influence the variability of the precipitation xue et al 2017 tandon et al 2018 for example the influence of temperature on extreme precipitation is well known westra et al 2013 hoerling et al 2016 although the direct effect of temperature is not investigated in the present study a discussion of the influence of this and other parameters on the hydrological cycle was provided by gimeno et al 2012 the approach used here is based on the methodology established by stohl and james 2004 2005 to investigate the sink regions for a particular source the model follows the particles that leave the source forwards in time stohl and james 2004 2005 for a limited transport time of 10 days the average time spent by water vapour in the atmosphere as indicated by numaguti 1999 and corroborated by van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 and nieto and gimeno 2019 the so called forward tracking mode or forward methodology along each trajectory the programme stores the specific humidity together with the position latitude longitude and altitude of each particle at 6 h time step 00 06 12 and 18 utc by calculating the changes in specific humidity q at each time step the variations in moisture given the evaporation e and precipitation p experienced by the particles can be identified by the equation e p m dq dt where m indicates the mass of the particle and dt indicates the 6 h time interval considering all e p values of the particles in an atmospheric column over a target region for an area a it is possible to calculate the total surface freshwater flux as 1 e p k 1 k k e p k a where k is the number of particles considered to identify the sinks of moisture the regions where the total precipitation p exceeds the total evaporation e should be selected so only those regions showing e p 0 values are taken into account at a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 degrees 2 3 precipitation analysis to describe characteristics of global precipitation in terms of annual and monthly precipitation climatology the mswep database beck et al 2017 is used the mswep database covers the period from 1980 2015 and is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 latitude and longitude available since 2017 this dataset combines the advantages of a wide range of data sources eg from reanalyses as the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 and era interim and from estimation on gauges as global historical climatology network daily ghcn d worldclim global precipitation climatology centre gpcc or global summary of the day gsod and from satellites as the gridded satellite gridsat climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap to provide reliable precipitation estimates around the world from this dataset the peak precipitation month ppm is defined as that containing the maximum precipitation for each grid point for the whole period the mean precipitation calculated from mswep in that ppm for each grid point is calculated and herein denoted as pmswep this value allows assessing extreme monthly precipitation for each grid point 2 4 preferred source and moisture source contribution for the ppm the preferred source ps of moisture is defined as the source providing most of the moisture for precipitation to each grid point in the ppm in order to identify the ps the total contribution from each individual moisture source is computed following the particles trajectories simulated by flexpart dispersion model with the forward in time methodology stohl et al 2005 therefore the source that shows the highest values of e p 0 measured in mm day is the ps for the corresponding grid point the values of e p 0 associated only with the ps for the ppm are denoted herein as pflex ps the moisture contribution is also analysed taking into account all the sources not only the ps that show some contribution at each grid point in this case the values of e p 0 from all sources not just the ps are included this field is denoted pflex 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of global monthly moisture sources and sinks to investigate the monthly role of the major moisture sources for the peak precipitation months ppms for each 0 25 grid point it is first necessary to identify moisture sources and the corresponding sinks the first part is achieved following the methodology of gimeno et al 2010 as described in the methodology section the fiftieth p50 and fortieth p40 percentiles are applied to the vimf divergence to define oceanic and continental sources respectively in the present work the threshold values of vimf divergence differ from month to month and between oceanic and continental sources the data contained in table 1 confirm that the threshold values vary between 656 and 850 mm year for oceanic and 440 508 mm year for terrestrial sources which are within the approximate range of values used in gimeno et al 2010 a total of 14 moisture sources were identified eleven are oceanic namely npac north pacific spac south pacific mexcar gulf of mexico and caribbean sea natl north atlantic satl south atlantic zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea agu agulhas current ind indian ocean corals coral sea med mediterranean sea and reds red sea three are continental sam south america sahel sahel region and safr south africa because med and red occupy almost the whole of the area inside their basins these two sources are defined using their physical boundaries the left side panels of fig 1 show oceanic and terrestrial moisture source regions for january and july mid boreal winter and mid boreal summer months figures for all months can be found in the supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 at global scale most of the detected moisture sources are located over tropical and subtropical oceanic areas including the continental areas of south america south africa and the sahel region the areas of contribution of the detected sources to continental precipitation are estimated using the forward tracking mode in the outputs of the lagrangian dispersion model flexpart stohl et al 2005 for the period 1980 2015 this calculation is performed for each month but for simplicity the results and explanation are presented here only for january and july fig 1 right side panels similarly the results for all months can be found in the supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 for each month the continental sink regions for the oceanic sources top right and for the continental sources bottom right are presented separately each colour used in the figures for the sinks is associated with the same colour in the figure for the moisture sources in the left hand panels thus for instance areas in red over south america and the coast of africa in january a top right figure represent sink regions for the satl source red in the top left figure in general the moisture sources identified at a monthly scale are quite similar to those found by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 in terms of their location and extent however it is interesting to note that the moisture sources are not stationary they show differences in intensity between months which is reflected in their spatial extents and thus the associated sinks the selection of thresholds is always a source of uncertainty in this study the limits imposed are large enough to comprise the maximum values of vimf where the major monthly global evaporation occurs the oceanic moisture taken into account using these thresholds include vast areas that extend from one side of the ocean to the other with the coasts acting as geographical barriers in many cases see gimeno et al 2010 or castillo et al 2014 if different thresholds were to be applied the latitude would be the only dimension to show a slight growth in any case if the area of the moisture source was bigger there would be a few more particles to be forward tracked and no perceptible difference would be noted in the final computation of e p 0 over each grid point in terms of annual variability some sources are present throughout the year while others are greatly reduced or completely absent in some months for example in both the northern and southern hemispheres the pac and atl sources are present during both january and july and also during all other months see supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 zanar in the northern hemisphere and ind in the southern hemisphere also provide moisture throughout all the year on the other hand some sources vary throughout the year for example corals while the source practically disappears in january it is strong in july mexcar the mexico caribbean source shows another example of this behaviour from january to april this source shows its maximum extent but it weakens from may until august before disappearing altogether in september from october it appears again as an important moisture source for the complete annual evolution see supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 similar patterns are also observed for the continental sources of sam safr and sahel fig 1 shows that in january the sahel is the only moisture source on land but it disappears during july when safr and sam appear the sahel source exhibits a clear seasonal dichotomy during late spring and summer april september it is absent while during the extended winter october march it is an important source sam is a bigger moisture source between april and october but it is greatly reduced in september and october appearing only over the north eastern part of brazil the sinks of moisture associated with each source in fig 1 right side panels and in the corresponding supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 show that oceanic subtropical areas dominate as moisture providers as in gimeno et al 2010 thus the north atlantic ocean natl is the dominant moisture source during january providing moisture for precipitation in three continents europe eastern north america and south america in july its influence is weakened and it contributes to only small parts of mexico central america and northern south america on the other hand the south atlantic ocean satl contributes to precipitation during january and july mainly providing the moisture for brazil and central africa there is no rule that the major moisture sources necessarily provide precipitation to huge continental areas as demonstrated by the indian and south pacific oceans during both january and july in contrast there are some small moisture source regions that provide large amounts of moisture for precipitation in comparison with their size for example the mediterranean sea is an important water source for europe and north africa throughout the year in particular the mediterranean sea represents the only source from those identified here that contributes to northern africa throughout the year and to some areas of europe especially in summer another example is the red sea which provides great quantities of precipitation for the whole coast of the middle east including parts of syria iraq and iran from january to april this points to the importance of the source in the hydrological cycle for these continental areas during january mexcar is the dominant moisture source for precipitation over europe and eastern north america extending its influence across the northern american continent in july although with reduced intensity on the other hand there are also some areas for example australia and canada which generally receive precipitation from a single source throughout the year the dominant moisture source for australia is corals coral sea during both january and july while for canada it is the north pacific ocean npac continental moisture sources are important providers of precipitation in those months when they appear to be the most significant moisture source regions for instance in january the sahel region provides precipitation for vast continental areas including parts of north and south africa the coast of the middle east and the north eastern part of brazil during july sam and safr are important moisture sources for precipitation for south america and central and southern africa respectively this source sink relationship is in agreement with previous results for example the north atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea have previously been identified as major sources for europe nieto et al 2010 and the south pacific ocean was previously found to provide most of the moisture arriving in central brazil and the la plata basin drumond et al 2008 the monthly variability of the contribution of all detected moisture source regions to precipitation can be found in appendix a supplementary material 3 2 climatological analysis of precipitation in order to describe the global characteristics of precipitation mswep annual fig 2 and monthly fig 3 climatological precipitation means are presented at a global scale as anticipated the annual distribution of precipitation shows highest values in the tropical and subtropical zones located between 0 and 20 north and south located over areas of south america central south africa south asia india thailand cambodia indonesia and papa new guinea areas further north such as the west coast of canada central europe and norway also have among the highest precipitation with 4 mm day or more the lowest values are observed in semi arid and arid regions of africa the coast of the middle east central parts of asia and australia with less than 0 3 mm day moderate precipitation between 1 5 and 2 5 mm day are mostly recorded over europe west russia and the eastern united states and canada the general distribution of precipitation from the mswep database is similar to other climatological precipitation datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 and era interim simmons et al 2007 sun et al 2018 3 3 contribution from the major moisture sources to extreme precipitation in the peak precipitation month ppm 3 3 1 ppm identification the climatological 1980 2015 monthly precipitation data from mswep is used to detect the month that exhibits the maximum precipitation fig 4 a for each grid point namely the peak precipitation month ppm the ppm varies significantly between regions from the results in fig 4a it can be seen that the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz towards the warmer hemisphere xian and miller 2008 causes ppms in december to february austral summer around latitudes from 10 s to 30 s over central parts of south america and south africa and northern australia during july and august boreal summer this occurs over southern asia the sahel and central africa and between the band 5 30 n in america further north and across most of the asian continent northern europe and northern and central north america ppms occur between june and august march predominates as the ppm over the eastern middle east and the band from 1 s 10 s over south america it is interesting to note that for the mediterranean and central north america the pattern is the most diverse the ppms along the european atlantic coast occur during boreal winter months which is the period with the most active precipitation associated with storm tracks this is also the case for the pacific coast of north america fig 4b shows the monthly precipitation during the ppm using mswep data pmswep the areas around the equator which are affected by the itcz show the highest precipitation with more than 8 mm day this is twice the mean annual values 4 5 mm day see fig 2 on the other hand arid or semiarid regions in africa the middle east central asia or australia receive the least precipitation less than 1 mm day during the ppms in summary for most areas worldwide the ppm value of precipitation is double the mean annual value 3 3 2 characterization of preferred moisture source and its contribution to extreme precipitation having defined the ppm for every grid point it is highly relevant to investigate the proportions of the contributions of the main global moisture sources for this extreme precipitation month for this purpose the total moisture contributions from all the sources pflex considered and the source that provides the greatest contribution hereinafter denoted the preferred source ps is considered the ps associated with the ppm at each grid point is shown in fig 5 the map shows that for the european atlantic coast from the iberian to the scandinavian peninsula the preferred moisture source is natl north atlantic ocean for northern europe to eurasia and for north africa the preferred source of moisture is med the mediterranean sea for most of australia the ps is the coral sea for the southern cone of south america and for central america spac contributes the most precipitation during the ppm while natl is the ps over the amazon river basin satl south atlantic ocean prevails over most of eastern south america and central africa on the other hand for south africa the ps is agu agulhas current the npac north pacific dominates in alaska canada and the northern united states which also extends its influence to some parts of russia the mexcar mexico caribbean is the ps for the eastern cone of the united states and some parts of mexico it is interesting to note that in central and east asia including the middle eastern coast the detected preferred source is zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea as expected ind indian ocean dominates in india and extends its influence over eastern africa the moisture contribution from the ps in the ppm ps pflex is shown in fig 6 a and the contributions associated with all the detected moisture sources can be observed in fig a 13a in the supplementary material in order to provide a better understanding of how fig a 13a was created an example is presented below for each grid point the values where e p 0 are added together for all the detected sources for each ppm for instance for north america the ppm is july and the moisture for precipitation is supported only by a single source namely the npac north pacific see fig 1 for july thus the precipitation values calculated from flexpart e p 0 in fig 6a for that region are only those associated with npac moisture source on the other hand there are regions where two or more moisture sources contribute to precipitation during the ppm this is the case over the south arabian peninsula iraq iran and kazakhstan regions where the ppm is march see fig 4a in yellow and the precipitation in march see the figure in the supplementary material is supported by moisture from reds red sea and zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea therefore in these cases and for each grid point the contributions of both sources are added together the general pattern shown in both figures fig 6a and a 13a is similar to that shown in fig 4b however the difference in magnitude reflects the fact that only the major moisture sources represented in figs 1 and a 1 12 in the supplementary material from flexpart outputs are considered only a single source the ps for fig 6a and all the major sources for fig a 13a in the supplementary material fig 4b shows the total precipitation using mswep data the missing moisture is made up from the remaining oceanic and continental evaporative areas that are not included as major sources in order to assess the importance of the primary source in each case fig 6b shows the ratio of the precipitation from the ps fig 6a to the precipitation pmswep fig 4b in the ppm the same for fig a 13b in the supplementary material but rating pflex from all the major moisture sources and pmswep it is important to stress that for the calculation of the ratio pmswep values of less than 0 1 mm day are not considered in general there are no important differences between the ratio associated with all the sources fig a 13b in supplementary materials and that associated only with the ps fig 6b this suggests that the contribution of the ps is generally much greater than the remaining main moisture sources affecting each region the lower ratios of precipitation for the ppm explained by the ps and the main global moisture sources in general occur at higher latitudes over the northern hemisphere however more than 50 of the precipitation is explained by the main moisture sources over most of africa southern asia and eastern brazil or southern argentina fig 6b these results suggest that the main global moisture sources have a higher impact and relevance on precipitation over lower latitudes over higher latitudes however extreme precipitation seems to have a different origin and or that there is a higher number of sources affecting the extreme precipitation patterns summary and conclusions in this work a detailed global analysis of climatological and extreme precipitation in terms of the ppm is performed and the identification variability and relative contribution of the main oceanic and continental sources to these precipitation patterns is also investigated the moisture sources detected in this work are similar to those found by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 most of the detected sources are oceanic and located over tropical and subtropical areas only some regions over africa and south america appear as continental moisture sources in general terms the sources show important variability in their extent and contribution throughout the year for extreme precipitation these results reflect important geographical differences for the ppm summer months show higher precipitation over most of the asian continent northern europe northern and central north america southern africa and most of south america and australia however the ppm along the european atlantic coast occurs during boreal winter which is in agreement with most studies on extreme precipitation catto and pfahl 2013 lavers and villarini 2013 hénin et al 2019 the impact of the ps on the precipitation amount in the ppm varies geographically despite for example npac and med sources are over vast areas in norther hemisphere the percentage of their contribution to extreme precipitation is in general low on the other hand other sources of moisture such as zanar or satl provide over 50 of precipitation occurring during the ppm from our results the moisture contribution associated with the ps does not show important differences compared with the case where all the main moisture sources are taken into consideration the contributions from the major global oceanic sources should provide most of the moisture for precipitation at a global scale nevertheless in regional terms there are some specific areas for which the main moisture sources are not necessary located over the most evaporative areas from results presented in this paper it can be addressed that the moisture contribution from the major sources strongly resembles the precipitation pattern of observed global precipitation in terms of both climatological and extreme precipitation the analysis presented here is also useful for further applications such as the analysis of the influence of moisture transport according to the major modes of variability as enso pna or nao over the preferred sources during the peak precipitation month and the role of particular local synoptic conditions as well the relationship between climate change and the occurrence of extreme events such as floods or droughts is well known since understanding moisture transport from the main global sources towards continental areas provides valuable data for investigating these events the information presented in this study could be very useful for further studies of climate change the study of possible changes over time of both ppm or and ps could be of great interest changes in the behaviour of moisture transport in terms of quantity from the preferred sources could affect the intensity and or frequency of extreme precipitation events moreover focus for further investigation would be possible changes in ppm over the last few decades to verify whether the potential changes are due to modification in the ps moisture contribution to precipitation this signal could be another valuable indicator of regional or global climate change finally it should be noted that since this assessment is performed using monthly data results obtained for specific daily extreme precipitation events may have different contributions in preferred moisture sources and or its percentage this daily analysis will be addressed in future research for individual synoptic

contribution from some large oceanic sources for instance the south pacific ocean is localized over large continental areas some smaller sources provide moisture to widespread vast areas in proportion to their sizes for example the black sea provides moisture for precipitation over central europe ciric et al 2016 the arabian peninsula heydarizad et al 2018 and even the arctic region vázquez et al 2016 moreover despite some continental regions receiving moisture from several sources other regions have no moisture contribution for precipitation from any of these major moisture sources as identified by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 where the moisture contribution is more local e g greenland sodemann et al 2008 or inland parts of asia sato et al 2007 further details of the main sources of moisture and their contribution to precipitation over continental areas can be found in gimeno et al 2010 2013 in the present work the analysis of gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 is revisited in order to allow identification of the major oceanic and terrestrial sources of extreme precipitation for the whole of the period 1980 2015 from the detection of these moisture sources a complete collection of maps of precipitation is developed taking into account only monthly extremes of precipitation the aim of this work is twofold i to collate maps of global extremes and ii enhance understanding of the role of the major sources of moisture oceanic and continental during the months with intense precipitation monthly data from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset are used to analyse the precipitation extremes and the outputs from the flexible particle dispersion flexpart model are used to compute the associated moisture transport 2 methodology 2 1 moisture source region definition identification of the major global moisture source regions is based on the methodology established by gimeno et al 2010 the method uses the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf divergence to localize maximum values which are associated with evaporative areas using vimf data obtained from the era interim dataset dee et al 2011 at a 1 1 horizontal resolution the climatological flux divergence was computed for each month individually over a 36 year period 1980 2015 gimeno et al 2010 imposed fixed annual thresholds of 750 and 500 mm year to identify the oceanic and continental moisture sources the fiftieth and fortieth percentiles respectively here the thresholds are imposed monthly and the moisture sources are defined as those areas showing values higher than the threshold for each month 2 2 continental sink regions and flexpart methodology in order to analyse the regions affected by each of the detected sources and to assess how much moisture is provided to these areas the lagrangian particle dispersion model flexpart is applied this model was developed by stohl 1999 and is widely used to analyse moisture transport e g sodemann et al 2008 nieto et al 2010 vázquez et al 2016 sorí et al 2017 the input data for running flexpart is era interim reanalysis at a resolution of 1 x 1 degrees in latitude and longitude and on native ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasting model levels flexpart uses 3d wind to transport and move the particles and among other parametrization turbulent dispersion is handled by a subroutine that calls procedures to interpolate winds a complete model configuration can be found in stohl and james 2005 therefore the final trajectories outputs need not be in the initial grid 1 x 1 and the changes in any variable over a particular area can be calculated for the grid required by the user with a number of air particles that must be higher than the ecmwf model levels flexpart is used for a global experiment in which about 2 million air particles are released every 6 h with intermediate data added every 3 h stohl and james 2004 outputs were used to analyse changes in moisture experienced by the particles along their trajectories in the present work changes in specific humidity are used to analyse the moisture contribution from the major sources over the continents however there are many different parameters that may influence the variability of the precipitation xue et al 2017 tandon et al 2018 for example the influence of temperature on extreme precipitation is well known westra et al 2013 hoerling et al 2016 although the direct effect of temperature is not investigated in the present study a discussion of the influence of this and other parameters on the hydrological cycle was provided by gimeno et al 2012 the approach used here is based on the methodology established by stohl and james 2004 2005 to investigate the sink regions for a particular source the model follows the particles that leave the source forwards in time stohl and james 2004 2005 for a limited transport time of 10 days the average time spent by water vapour in the atmosphere as indicated by numaguti 1999 and corroborated by van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 and nieto and gimeno 2019 the so called forward tracking mode or forward methodology along each trajectory the programme stores the specific humidity together with the position latitude longitude and altitude of each particle at 6 h time step 00 06 12 and 18 utc by calculating the changes in specific humidity q at each time step the variations in moisture given the evaporation e and precipitation p experienced by the particles can be identified by the equation e p m dq dt where m indicates the mass of the particle and dt indicates the 6 h time interval considering all e p values of the particles in an atmospheric column over a target region for an area a it is possible to calculate the total surface freshwater flux as 1 e p k 1 k k e p k a where k is the number of particles considered to identify the sinks of moisture the regions where the total precipitation p exceeds the total evaporation e should be selected so only those regions showing e p 0 values are taken into account at a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 degrees 2 3 precipitation analysis to describe characteristics of global precipitation in terms of annual and monthly precipitation climatology the mswep database beck et al 2017 is used the mswep database covers the period from 1980 2015 and is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 latitude and longitude available since 2017 this dataset combines the advantages of a wide range of data sources eg from reanalyses as the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 and era interim and from estimation on gauges as global historical climatology network daily ghcn d worldclim global precipitation climatology centre gpcc or global summary of the day gsod and from satellites as the gridded satellite gridsat climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap to provide reliable precipitation estimates around the world from this dataset the peak precipitation month ppm is defined as that containing the maximum precipitation for each grid point for the whole period the mean precipitation calculated from mswep in that ppm for each grid point is calculated and herein denoted as pmswep this value allows assessing extreme monthly precipitation for each grid point 2 4 preferred source and moisture source contribution for the ppm the preferred source ps of moisture is defined as the source providing most of the moisture for precipitation to each grid point in the ppm in order to identify the ps the total contribution from each individual moisture source is computed following the particles trajectories simulated by flexpart dispersion model with the forward in time methodology stohl et al 2005 therefore the source that shows the highest values of e p 0 measured in mm day is the ps for the corresponding grid point the values of e p 0 associated only with the ps for the ppm are denoted herein as pflex ps the moisture contribution is also analysed taking into account all the sources not only the ps that show some contribution at each grid point in this case the values of e p 0 from all sources not just the ps are included this field is denoted pflex 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of global monthly moisture sources and sinks to investigate the monthly role of the major moisture sources for the peak precipitation months ppms for each 0 25 grid point it is first necessary to identify moisture sources and the corresponding sinks the first part is achieved following the methodology of gimeno et al 2010 as described in the methodology section the fiftieth p50 and fortieth p40 percentiles are applied to the vimf divergence to define oceanic and continental sources respectively in the present work the threshold values of vimf divergence differ from month to month and between oceanic and continental sources the data contained in table 1 confirm that the threshold values vary between 656 and 850 mm year for oceanic and 440 508 mm year for terrestrial sources which are within the approximate range of values used in gimeno et al 2010 a total of 14 moisture sources were identified eleven are oceanic namely npac north pacific spac south pacific mexcar gulf of mexico and caribbean sea natl north atlantic satl south atlantic zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea agu agulhas current ind indian ocean corals coral sea med mediterranean sea and reds red sea three are continental sam south america sahel sahel region and safr south africa because med and red occupy almost the whole of the area inside their basins these two sources are defined using their physical boundaries the left side panels of fig 1 show oceanic and terrestrial moisture source regions for january and july mid boreal winter and mid boreal summer months figures for all months can be found in the supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 at global scale most of the detected moisture sources are located over tropical and subtropical oceanic areas including the continental areas of south america south africa and the sahel region the areas of contribution of the detected sources to continental precipitation are estimated using the forward tracking mode in the outputs of the lagrangian dispersion model flexpart stohl et al 2005 for the period 1980 2015 this calculation is performed for each month but for simplicity the results and explanation are presented here only for january and july fig 1 right side panels similarly the results for all months can be found in the supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 for each month the continental sink regions for the oceanic sources top right and for the continental sources bottom right are presented separately each colour used in the figures for the sinks is associated with the same colour in the figure for the moisture sources in the left hand panels thus for instance areas in red over south america and the coast of africa in january a top right figure represent sink regions for the satl source red in the top left figure in general the moisture sources identified at a monthly scale are quite similar to those found by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 in terms of their location and extent however it is interesting to note that the moisture sources are not stationary they show differences in intensity between months which is reflected in their spatial extents and thus the associated sinks the selection of thresholds is always a source of uncertainty in this study the limits imposed are large enough to comprise the maximum values of vimf where the major monthly global evaporation occurs the oceanic moisture taken into account using these thresholds include vast areas that extend from one side of the ocean to the other with the coasts acting as geographical barriers in many cases see gimeno et al 2010 or castillo et al 2014 if different thresholds were to be applied the latitude would be the only dimension to show a slight growth in any case if the area of the moisture source was bigger there would be a few more particles to be forward tracked and no perceptible difference would be noted in the final computation of e p 0 over each grid point in terms of annual variability some sources are present throughout the year while others are greatly reduced or completely absent in some months for example in both the northern and southern hemispheres the pac and atl sources are present during both january and july and also during all other months see supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 zanar in the northern hemisphere and ind in the southern hemisphere also provide moisture throughout all the year on the other hand some sources vary throughout the year for example corals while the source practically disappears in january it is strong in july mexcar the mexico caribbean source shows another example of this behaviour from january to april this source shows its maximum extent but it weakens from may until august before disappearing altogether in september from october it appears again as an important moisture source for the complete annual evolution see supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 similar patterns are also observed for the continental sources of sam safr and sahel fig 1 shows that in january the sahel is the only moisture source on land but it disappears during july when safr and sam appear the sahel source exhibits a clear seasonal dichotomy during late spring and summer april september it is absent while during the extended winter october march it is an important source sam is a bigger moisture source between april and october but it is greatly reduced in september and october appearing only over the north eastern part of brazil the sinks of moisture associated with each source in fig 1 right side panels and in the corresponding supplementary material figs a 1 a 12 show that oceanic subtropical areas dominate as moisture providers as in gimeno et al 2010 thus the north atlantic ocean natl is the dominant moisture source during january providing moisture for precipitation in three continents europe eastern north america and south america in july its influence is weakened and it contributes to only small parts of mexico central america and northern south america on the other hand the south atlantic ocean satl contributes to precipitation during january and july mainly providing the moisture for brazil and central africa there is no rule that the major moisture sources necessarily provide precipitation to huge continental areas as demonstrated by the indian and south pacific oceans during both january and july in contrast there are some small moisture source regions that provide large amounts of moisture for precipitation in comparison with their size for example the mediterranean sea is an important water source for europe and north africa throughout the year in particular the mediterranean sea represents the only source from those identified here that contributes to northern africa throughout the year and to some areas of europe especially in summer another example is the red sea which provides great quantities of precipitation for the whole coast of the middle east including parts of syria iraq and iran from january to april this points to the importance of the source in the hydrological cycle for these continental areas during january mexcar is the dominant moisture source for precipitation over europe and eastern north america extending its influence across the northern american continent in july although with reduced intensity on the other hand there are also some areas for example australia and canada which generally receive precipitation from a single source throughout the year the dominant moisture source for australia is corals coral sea during both january and july while for canada it is the north pacific ocean npac continental moisture sources are important providers of precipitation in those months when they appear to be the most significant moisture source regions for instance in january the sahel region provides precipitation for vast continental areas including parts of north and south africa the coast of the middle east and the north eastern part of brazil during july sam and safr are important moisture sources for precipitation for south america and central and southern africa respectively this source sink relationship is in agreement with previous results for example the north atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea have previously been identified as major sources for europe nieto et al 2010 and the south pacific ocean was previously found to provide most of the moisture arriving in central brazil and the la plata basin drumond et al 2008 the monthly variability of the contribution of all detected moisture source regions to precipitation can be found in appendix a supplementary material 3 2 climatological analysis of precipitation in order to describe the global characteristics of precipitation mswep annual fig 2 and monthly fig 3 climatological precipitation means are presented at a global scale as anticipated the annual distribution of precipitation shows highest values in the tropical and subtropical zones located between 0 and 20 north and south located over areas of south america central south africa south asia india thailand cambodia indonesia and papa new guinea areas further north such as the west coast of canada central europe and norway also have among the highest precipitation with 4 mm day or more the lowest values are observed in semi arid and arid regions of africa the coast of the middle east central parts of asia and australia with less than 0 3 mm day moderate precipitation between 1 5 and 2 5 mm day are mostly recorded over europe west russia and the eastern united states and canada the general distribution of precipitation from the mswep database is similar to other climatological precipitation datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 and era interim simmons et al 2007 sun et al 2018 3 3 contribution from the major moisture sources to extreme precipitation in the peak precipitation month ppm 3 3 1 ppm identification the climatological 1980 2015 monthly precipitation data from mswep is used to detect the month that exhibits the maximum precipitation fig 4 a for each grid point namely the peak precipitation month ppm the ppm varies significantly between regions from the results in fig 4a it can be seen that the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz towards the warmer hemisphere xian and miller 2008 causes ppms in december to february austral summer around latitudes from 10 s to 30 s over central parts of south america and south africa and northern australia during july and august boreal summer this occurs over southern asia the sahel and central africa and between the band 5 30 n in america further north and across most of the asian continent northern europe and northern and central north america ppms occur between june and august march predominates as the ppm over the eastern middle east and the band from 1 s 10 s over south america it is interesting to note that for the mediterranean and central north america the pattern is the most diverse the ppms along the european atlantic coast occur during boreal winter months which is the period with the most active precipitation associated with storm tracks this is also the case for the pacific coast of north america fig 4b shows the monthly precipitation during the ppm using mswep data pmswep the areas around the equator which are affected by the itcz show the highest precipitation with more than 8 mm day this is twice the mean annual values 4 5 mm day see fig 2 on the other hand arid or semiarid regions in africa the middle east central asia or australia receive the least precipitation less than 1 mm day during the ppms in summary for most areas worldwide the ppm value of precipitation is double the mean annual value 3 3 2 characterization of preferred moisture source and its contribution to extreme precipitation having defined the ppm for every grid point it is highly relevant to investigate the proportions of the contributions of the main global moisture sources for this extreme precipitation month for this purpose the total moisture contributions from all the sources pflex considered and the source that provides the greatest contribution hereinafter denoted the preferred source ps is considered the ps associated with the ppm at each grid point is shown in fig 5 the map shows that for the european atlantic coast from the iberian to the scandinavian peninsula the preferred moisture source is natl north atlantic ocean for northern europe to eurasia and for north africa the preferred source of moisture is med the mediterranean sea for most of australia the ps is the coral sea for the southern cone of south america and for central america spac contributes the most precipitation during the ppm while natl is the ps over the amazon river basin satl south atlantic ocean prevails over most of eastern south america and central africa on the other hand for south africa the ps is agu agulhas current the npac north pacific dominates in alaska canada and the northern united states which also extends its influence to some parts of russia the mexcar mexico caribbean is the ps for the eastern cone of the united states and some parts of mexico it is interesting to note that in central and east asia including the middle eastern coast the detected preferred source is zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea as expected ind indian ocean dominates in india and extends its influence over eastern africa the moisture contribution from the ps in the ppm ps pflex is shown in fig 6 a and the contributions associated with all the detected moisture sources can be observed in fig a 13a in the supplementary material in order to provide a better understanding of how fig a 13a was created an example is presented below for each grid point the values where e p 0 are added together for all the detected sources for each ppm for instance for north america the ppm is july and the moisture for precipitation is supported only by a single source namely the npac north pacific see fig 1 for july thus the precipitation values calculated from flexpart e p 0 in fig 6a for that region are only those associated with npac moisture source on the other hand there are regions where two or more moisture sources contribute to precipitation during the ppm this is the case over the south arabian peninsula iraq iran and kazakhstan regions where the ppm is march see fig 4a in yellow and the precipitation in march see the figure in the supplementary material is supported by moisture from reds red sea and zanar zanzibar current and arabian sea therefore in these cases and for each grid point the contributions of both sources are added together the general pattern shown in both figures fig 6a and a 13a is similar to that shown in fig 4b however the difference in magnitude reflects the fact that only the major moisture sources represented in figs 1 and a 1 12 in the supplementary material from flexpart outputs are considered only a single source the ps for fig 6a and all the major sources for fig a 13a in the supplementary material fig 4b shows the total precipitation using mswep data the missing moisture is made up from the remaining oceanic and continental evaporative areas that are not included as major sources in order to assess the importance of the primary source in each case fig 6b shows the ratio of the precipitation from the ps fig 6a to the precipitation pmswep fig 4b in the ppm the same for fig a 13b in the supplementary material but rating pflex from all the major moisture sources and pmswep it is important to stress that for the calculation of the ratio pmswep values of less than 0 1 mm day are not considered in general there are no important differences between the ratio associated with all the sources fig a 13b in supplementary materials and that associated only with the ps fig 6b this suggests that the contribution of the ps is generally much greater than the remaining main moisture sources affecting each region the lower ratios of precipitation for the ppm explained by the ps and the main global moisture sources in general occur at higher latitudes over the northern hemisphere however more than 50 of the precipitation is explained by the main moisture sources over most of africa southern asia and eastern brazil or southern argentina fig 6b these results suggest that the main global moisture sources have a higher impact and relevance on precipitation over lower latitudes over higher latitudes however extreme precipitation seems to have a different origin and or that there is a higher number of sources affecting the extreme precipitation patterns summary and conclusions in this work a detailed global analysis of climatological and extreme precipitation in terms of the ppm is performed and the identification variability and relative contribution of the main oceanic and continental sources to these precipitation patterns is also investigated the moisture sources detected in this work are similar to those found by gimeno et al 2010 and castillo et al 2014 most of the detected sources are oceanic and located over tropical and subtropical areas only some regions over africa and south america appear as continental moisture sources in general terms the sources show important variability in their extent and contribution throughout the year for extreme precipitation these results reflect important geographical differences for the ppm summer months show higher precipitation over most of the asian continent northern europe northern and central north america southern africa and most of south america and australia however the ppm along the european atlantic coast occurs during boreal winter which is in agreement with most studies on extreme precipitation catto and pfahl 2013 lavers and villarini 2013 hénin et al 2019 the impact of the ps on the precipitation amount in the ppm varies geographically despite for example npac and med sources are over vast areas in norther hemisphere the percentage of their contribution to extreme precipitation is in general low on the other hand other sources of moisture such as zanar or satl provide over 50 of precipitation occurring during the ppm from our results the moisture contribution associated with the ps does not show important differences compared with the case where all the main moisture sources are taken into consideration the contributions from the major global oceanic sources should provide most of the moisture for precipitation at a global scale nevertheless in regional terms there are some specific areas for which the main moisture sources are not necessary located over the most evaporative areas from results presented in this paper it can be addressed that the moisture contribution from the major sources strongly resembles the precipitation pattern of observed global precipitation in terms of both climatological and extreme precipitation the analysis presented here is also useful for further applications such as the analysis of the influence of moisture transport according to the major modes of variability as enso pna or nao over the preferred sources during the peak precipitation month and the role of particular local synoptic conditions as well the relationship between climate change and the occurrence of extreme events such as floods or droughts is well known since understanding moisture transport from the main global sources towards continental areas provides valuable data for investigating these events the information presented in this study could be very useful for further studies of climate change the study of possible changes over time of both ppm or and ps could be of great interest changes in the behaviour of moisture transport in terms of quantity from the preferred sources could affect the intensity and or frequency of extreme precipitation events moreover focus for further investigation would be possible changes in ppm over the last few decades to verify whether the potential changes are due to modification in the ps moisture contribution to precipitation this signal could be another valuable indicator of regional or global climate change finally it should be noted that since this assessment is performed using monthly data results obtained for specific daily extreme precipitation events may have different contributions in preferred moisture sources and or its percentage this daily analysis will be addressed in future research for individual synoptic

599,groundwater surface water interactions as result of in and effluent conditions along a stream may have a strong impact on the quantity and quality of the river water these interactions are controlled by river morphology and by transient hydraulic gradients between river and surrounding groundwater here we document the existence of spatiotemporal variations in groundwater surface water interactions in the bed of the lower jordan river through pore water analysis of shallow sediment cores using major ions na mg2 ca2 cl br so4 2 and stable isotopes δ18o δ2h our results demonstrate that temporal variations are neither spatially uniform nor steady upwelling of groundwater is seasonally dependent and forced by a winter pulse of groundwater recharge and by estival low river

pollutants nutrients or dissolved salts has been documented to result in eutrophication and salinization of fresh surface water schlüter et al 2004 santos et al 2008 krause et al 2009 attempts to estimate groundwater inflow into fluvial systems requires differentiation amongst agricultural return flow deep groundwater upwelling scanlon et al 2007 hogan et al 2007 gardner et al 2011 smerdon et

research has been carried out in sandy and relatively coarse grained fluvial environments e g arntzen et al 2006 zimmer and lautz 2014 however water flow through fine grained silty or clayey riverbeds with considerably lower hydraulic conductivities and consequently reduced matrix permeability younger et al 1993 boulton et al 1998 has been less widely examined groundwater upwelling controlled by hydraulic head gradients may be driven by the formation of brines within artesian aquifers ascending along fractures and faults cherubini et al 2014 or through hydrologic windows pepin et al 2014 natural causes for river water salinization such as saline groundwater infiltration hogan et al 2007 and direct evaporation are typical of closed drainage basins in semi arid and arid regions williams 1999 phillips et al 2003 river water salinity may also increase due to dissolution of saline deposits accumulated in dry periods by surface runoff anker et al 2009 anthropogenic induced river

groundwater inflow may be inferred from monitoring piezometric heads adjacent to the river by discharge differences between gauging stations along the stream and by temperature measurements e g

isotopic composition of a water parcel is the integral of its entire pathways influenced by both geogenic and or anthropogenic factors kimball et al 2001 the lower jordan river ljr receives water from the confluence of freshwater from lake kinneret tds 0 6 g l and brackish yarmouk river tds 2 8 g l together with saline springs from the saline diversion channel sdc tds 4 2 g l and treated wastewater tds 1 2 g l while it enters the dead sea with strongly enhanced and variable salinities of 8 10 g l fig 1 neither evaporation nor the known saline inflows may cause this high salinity excess salinity is most likely supplied by inflowing saline groundwater which was estimated to amount to 20 80 and 10 of the total flow in the northern and southern segments of the ljr respectively farber et al 2004 holtzman et al 2005 this wide range of estimated saline groundwater contribution and the strong temporal variations in chemical composition of the ljr hillel et al 2015 indicate chemically distinct temporal contributions of variable solute sources the ljr flows through urbanised and intensely exploited agricultural land possessing sources of anthropogenic pollution sewage fishpond spills additionally saline springs of the kinneret basin are diverted to minimize salinization of the kinneret and enter the ljr via the sdc thereby contributing to the solute content of the river the

interstitial water of the riverbed and in the river water comparing these hydrogeochemical characteristics with those of previously characterized aquifers field measurements to support the present study could be carried out at limited locations since the river forms a highly restricted international border and security considerations make swaths of the river inaccessible nevertheless our goal was to overcome this challenge and to advance our ability to investigate groundwater surface water interactions in comparable hydrological systems characterized by very limited data information and accessibility 2 study area the lower jordan river meanders along 200 km through the jordan valley from lake kinneret sea of galilee 210 m msl fig 1 to the dead sea currently 432 m msl along the aerial

rest of the study area location of sampling stations could not be determined purely on scientific preferences rather they were chosen 1 arbitrarily by officials according to administrative considerations and 2 where the river could be accessed without mortal danger sampling sediment cores were obtained by manually inserting a 2 inch diameter plastic liner into the streambed core lengths vary table 1 and were determined by local sediment depth and limitations of the manual method immediately after recovery of the liner it was cut to core length and sealed with a fitted cap to prevent disturbance and mixing on the same day sediment was removed from the liner by a piston starting at the sediment water interface cores were divided into slices of 2 to 3 cm these subsamples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm the supernatant water was removed with a syringe several slices did not yield enough water for analysis resulting in missing data sdc and abdullah stations were not sampled for technical reasons during the december campaign water analysis both stream water and extracted pore water were filtered 0 45 μm and analysed for major ions and water isotopes δ18o δd stream water samples were analysed at the university of goettingen anions cl br no3 so4 2 were analysed by ic ion chromatography dionex dx 320 and cations na k mg2 ca2 were analysed applying conductometric detection using an ic dionex dx 500 the analytical error was estimated to be 8 major ions in pore water were analysed at the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz applying ic ics 2000 dionex for anions and dionex dx 120 for cations bicarbonate and dic were determined using standard titration technique and a shimadzu total carbon analyser toc5000 5050 respectively water isotope analyses were performed at ufz using a los gatos research triple isotope water analyser 45 ep with a respective analytical precision of 1 5 and 0 4 for 2h and 18o respectively inverse modelling the public domain software phreeqc parkhurst 1995 and the phreeq dat thermodynamic database were applied to calculate inverse models by which the interpretation of chemical and isotopic composition of pore waters may be supported but not explained based on hydrogeological considerations we assume that the porewater at each sampling location is the result of mixed known solutions namely ljr water and local ground or reservoir waters which react with the occurring geological material of the jordan valley in the case of the lake kinneret core lake water replaces the river water component generally at most two waters which are known to be present in the area of the respective coring location are considered and mixed with the covering river lake water during the time and at the location of sampling these solutions table 2 are allowed to be in equilibrium with common and plausible minerals at each location the model input consists of field measured ph temperature and concentration of major ions mineral phases halite dolomite aragonite calcite anhydrite and gypsum represent the solid phases in the shallow sediments of the ljv which either dissolve or precipitate table 3 reactive surfaces mgx2 cax2 nax and kx enable cation exchange and either gain or release mg2 ca2 na and k respectively co2 represents the amount of transferred gaseous co2 sumresiduals represents the sum of the remaining components that could not be attributed by phreeqc to specific reactions phreeqc allows for inaccuracies in the analysis of each solution and for uncertainty of the reaction scheme the former was attributed by setting uncertainty to 5 10 multiple models of different solutions were inversely modelled for each pore water core and the best model determined from its geochemical plausibility and goodness of fit was selected for each core and presented in table 3 to suspend the majority of mathematically correct simulation results and to end up with few models which best fit the measurements the following criteria have been applied i phase transfers are coherent to saturation indices and ii the sum of residuals sumresidual and iii the number of mol transfers are lowest for each sample the one fitting best molar na cl ratio of the sampled pore water has been selected as the most plausible solution although this process of elimination leads to feasible results these inverse modelling results are not a unique solution but a plausible answer with an acceptable uncertainty 4 results 4 1 na cl br and mg2 distribution in pore water profiles fig 3a d two distinct behaviours are observable in the ionic distribution of the pore water profiles that may be mainly attributed to saline sources such as brines and the dissolution of minerals fig 3 first low concentration pore water profiles that do not vary significantly with depth are derived from kinneret sdc beit zera and menahamiya stations figs 3a d all located in the northern segment of the river and are henceforth combined to a northern cluster second profiles with large variations and enhanced concentrations with depth sampled at the southerly tovlan baptism and abdullah sites are henceforth combined to a southern cluster in the northern cluster kinneret differs in april with slightly higher na cl br and mg2 concentrations along the profile while beit zera shows increasing concentrations of these ions during december the southern cluster has distinctly different and site specific ion concentrations with depth both cores in the southernmost abdullah are characterized by increasing ion concentrations with depth in the april core the deepest samples may represent maximum concentration of 180 meq l and 1 5 meq l for cl and br at this location respectively fig 3b c during august enhanced concentrations are reached at shallower depths in april ion concentrations at the baptism site do not vary with depth with the exception of mg2 fig 3d during august and december a substantial almost linear increase of ion concentrations with depth is typical of the baptism site at tovlan concentrations vary only in august when they continuously increase to a depth of 0 3 m and decline thereafter 4 2 distribution of ca2 and so4 2 in pore water profiles fig 3e f except for the abdullah and baptism site stations where concentration profiles of ca2 and so4 2 nearly resemble those of mg2 all other stations show distinctly different behaviours figs 3e f at tovlan ca2 shows a possible concentration maximum at 0 3 m depth during april while so4 2 does not vary with depth from the riverbed to 0 35 m increasing thereafter depth independent concentrations of both these ions are lowest during december at kinneret and menahamiya their concentrations increase with depth and are lowest in december and highest in august contrastingly no distinct trends are observable at the sdc and beit zera locations 4 3 the variation with depth of 1000br cl and na cl ratios salinity in groundwater of the jordan dead sea rift is mostly associated with the ascent of either residual seawater brines e g starinsky 1974 rosenthal et al 1988 or post halite ablation brines flexer et al 2000 which show an enhanced 1000br cl ratio of 5 and a low na cl ratio of 0 86 möller et al 2018 in contrast waters with lower 1000br cl ratios and 0 86 na cl 1 refer to halite dissolution by freshwater na cl 1 indicates basaltic weathering solutions where na is released from plagioclase minerals siebert et al 2014a in december and april pore water profiles along the river show average 1000br cl ratios of 5 which except for kinneret and beit zera slightly increase with depth fig 4 a during august ratios increase to 7 5 at lake kinneret beit zera and the baptism site ratios of 1000br cl in pore water samples of lake kinneret are persistently elevated relative to lake water which varies in the range 3 3 8 siebert 2006 at the baptism and abdullah sites 1000br cl ratios in pore water resemble the characteristic distribution of cl and br in the respective cores fig 3b c the vertical distribution of na cl ratios within the cores is less distinct at the kinneret ratios vary between 0 7 and 1 05 during the year with the december core showing the lowest values in april and august values increase close to and below the water sediment interface to 1 and decrease downwards fig 4b at sdc beit zera and menahamiya na cl values increase with depth to almost unity this stands true for tovlan as well except for august when the concentration maxima for na and cl fig 3b c result in a minimum na cl of 0 5 at a depth of 0 3 m at the baptism site ratios are highest 0 7 0 9 during december and april and lowest 0 6 0 7 in august unlike the br cl ratios na cl ratios at abdullah exhibit no trend but vary with depth 0 56 0 84 4 4 variation of mg ca ratios with depth the northern cluster sdc beit zera and menahamiya are defined by mg ca equivalent ratios 1 while kinneret shows ratios 1 only in august while kinneret shows no continuous trend during december and april in august ratios decrease with depth no significant variations with depth occur at the other northern stations at the southern cluster i e tovlan baptism and abdullah mg ca ratios are 1 throughout the year while tovlan shows lowest values in april baptism and abdulla show highest ratios at that time at the baptism and abdullah sites ratios increase with depth while values in tovlan differ between the seasons but do not vary considerably with depth 4 5 cross plot equivalent ratios in pore and river waters cross plots of pore water na cl vs mg ca form distinct groups either ca dominated in the northern cluster or mg dominated in the southern cluster fig 5 a c this grouping is valid throughout the year for most stations only kinneret pore water vary whereas they belong to both groups in april fig 5a they are ca dominated in august fig 5b and switch to mg dominated in december fig 5a pore waters in the southern cluster have a stronger mg dominance with decreasing na cl in the northern cluster ca mg ratios do not significantly change with changes in na cl cross plots of na cl versus 1000br cl do not show grouping of pore water fig 5 d f pore waters plot mostly right of the mixing line of the dead sea rift brines dsrb klein ben david et al 2004 in december br cl ratios within the pore waters of each station are similar resulting in an almost horizontal deviation of samples from the dsrb mixing line and indicating a freshwater component to which dsrb is variably admixed fig 5d river water samples consistently plot close to the dsrb and differ from pore water composition in april pore water in the southern baptism and even more in abdullah sites move up the dsrb line to higher br cl and lower na cl ratios fig 5e which become even more distinct during august fig 5f in august highest br cl and lowest na cl ratios are observable in the southern stations while the stations in the upper part of the ljr including the kinneret show variable and unsystematic behaviour 4 6 stable isotopes of water δ2h δ18o with depth variations of seasonal isotopic compositions with depth are different along the river fig 6 the only outlier is observable at the kinneret where isotopic signatures in pore water are strongly enriched all year round values are positive for both δ2h and δ18o isotopic values of pore water from the river sediments are relatively similar ca δ18o of 2 5 and δ2h of 10 signatures in sdc beit zera and menahamiya do not vary with depth while in december tovlan pore water has increasing values with depth reaching in the lowest part of the core 1 and 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the baptism site shows stable values with depth during april and decreasing with depth during august while signatures in december are inconsistent up to 0 3 δ18o and 4 2 δ2h at abdullah signatures slightly decline with depth in april and august the distribution of δ18o versus δ2h shows different conditions during the year fig 7 at the end of the rainy season april all pore water samples except beit zera and menahamiya plot to the right of the global meteoric water line gmwl dansgaard 1964 and the levantine mwl gat 1971 furthermore all pore water samples except kinneret plot left of the long term trend of kinneret water siebert 2006 at this time of the year pore waters are isotopically light and follow two distinct trends fig 7a the pore water at beit zera and menahamiya is close to the gmwl and lighter than the contemporaneous river water at the stations as for the southern cluster isotope signatures in pore water plot between gmwl and the kinneret long term average they become isotopically lighter with increasing distance downstream from lake kinneret in april contemporaneous river water is isotopically heavier than the pore waters the heaviest samples are derived from lake kinneret surface water and pore water trend lines of both clusters have the closest inclination to the kinneret water line during april fig 7a compared with april trends in both clusters but particularly in the southern cluster have lower and almost parallel running slopes during august fig 7b and are distinctly separated during august the pore water in the southern cluster plots closely to trend line of lake kinneret water isotopically lightest water is observed in the baptism core while the heaviest is derived from the kinneret pore water at the end of the dry season in december the trend lines of both clusters are even less inclined than in august fig 7c except for beit zera and menahamiya all pore waters plot to the right of the long term trend of kinneret water fig 7c though the latter two stations are located slightly downstream of the outlet of the isotopically enriched lake kinneret both river and pore waters at beit zera and menahamiya are isotopically lighter indicating an origin differing from lake kinneret pore water samples become enriched along the river course reaching δ18o 0 at tovlan and are in all cases isotopically heavier than the co located river water 5 discussion at lake kinneret station cl in pore water increases with depth during april it is an order of magnitude lower during august and december similar behaviours are observable for all other ions and particularly for so4 2 decreasing na cl variable br cl and variable mg ca ratios with depth indicate an upwards seeping admixture of recently infiltrated groundwater that has dissolved halite and contains traces of residual brines indeed inverse modelling refers to fractions of fresh judea group aquifer water that mixes with lake kinneret water and very small portions of tiberias type brines siebert 2006 and dissolves about 4 58 mmol halite per litre table 3 in contrast to august and december in april equivalent ratios of mg ca 1 fig 4c and so4 ca 1 indicate weathering of basalts and associated oxidation of sulphide minerals these results resemble previous general findings of stiller et al 1975 2009 stiller 1994 and dror et al 1999 who described saline groundwater seepage through the lakebed increased chloride concentration during april reflects the seasonal behaviour of groundwater systems in tiberias and fuliya at lake kinneret driven by the hibernal pulse of both lake level rise and groundwater recharge which control the hydraulic gradient between the aquifers and the lake rimmer et al 1999 south of lake kinneret the ljr results from the confluence of isotopically light saline groundwater channelized by the sdc and the isotopically enriched fresh lake water this is observable by the enhanced salinity and decreased isotopic composition in the northern stations compared to the lake except from beit zera in december stations of the northern cluster have consistently similar behaviour they show little to no increase in chloride concentration and a stable mg ca 1 with depth the equivalent increase in ca2 and so4 2 indicating gypsum dissolution and na cl ratios trending with depth towards unity suggest halite dissolution such high na cl have previously been described in pore water at the southern part of lake kinneret stiller et al 2009 and might be related to the zemah halite body which extends northwards into the kinneret basin inbar unpublished data and is dissolved by groundwater möller et al 2012 within the lower jordan valley two general types of groundwater with low na cl are observed ca and mg dominated bentor 1969 they cause a well described mg ca contrast in different locations along the rift plotting na cl versus mg ca and 1000br cl fig 5 reveals that pore water at the kinneret is dominated by mg2 and lower na cl ratios during the early and late rainy season mg ca 1 indicating a brine contribution similar to that known from the ha on region möller et al 2012 while ca rich groundwater mg ca 1 dictates pore water composition during august then when ca2 dominates na cl of about unity indicates increased contribution of halite dissolution water as described for groundwater in the vicinity of the zemah borehole marcus and slager 1985 möller et al 2012 drilled at the southern end of lake kinneret into thick halite bodies following the river further downstream only pore water of beit zera in december shows an influence by ascending rift brines that becomes evident due to distinctly decreasing na cl and increasing ion concentrations except of so4 2 with depth it is further supported by modelling results which indicate a fraction of about 0 12 ca cl rift brines of tiberias type admix to 0 88 ljr water table 3 and cause these pore waters to plot close to the dead sea rift line dsr introduced by klein ben david et al 2004 in contrast to the pore waters at sdc beit zera and menahamiya river water samples at these locations are always close to the dsr fig 5d e f mainly resulting from the saline groundwater carrier sdc which collects diluted rift brines at lake kinneret and releases them to the ljr rather than of rift brines ascending through the streambed a similar picture emerges from the pore water signatures of δ18o and δ2h at these stations they resemble those of the co located river water indicating infiltration of river water into the riverbed sediments the southern part of the ljr displays a different behaviour during april pore water at tovlan is characterised by fresh groundwater observable by a low cl pore water even less then the lowest river water cl concentrations which occur during the hibernal high flow season fig 8 a at the end of the wet season april fresh effluent dominating the pore space in tovlan may be caused by shallow fresh groundwater fluctuating concentrations of mg2 ca2 and so4 2 with higher concentrations at 8 cm and 15 35 cm depth but unchanged low na cl and br along the core are interpreted to indicate layered flow of such shallow groundwater during august this pattern of layered flow intensifies simultaneously a distinct salinity peak in pore water at a depth of 15 35 cm indicates a contribution of saline groundwater into that horizon there and in comparison to april all ions except so4 2 show increased concentrations lower na cl and higher mg ca ratios suggesting a contribution of mg cl brines of type aqraa during december pore water is fresh and shows no variations with depth except for δ18o and δ2h which both increase this unusual behaviour may be explained by leakage from the relatively fresh tirtsa reservoir located a few hundred meters upstream tovlan fig 1 also supporting the existence of a hydraulic connection between the nearby graben flank and the ljr at tovlan inverse models support this concept which denotes a considerable contribution aqraa brine in august and variable contributions of tirtsa reservoir water in august and december table 3 the seasonal sampling scheme revealed varying ascending brines rather than a steady mix with fresh groundwater while freshwater that leaches pleistocene and neogene sediments with high na cl high so4 ca and low mg ca ratios predominantly approaches the riverbed during the wet season december to march farber et al 2007 low groundwater tables allow enhanced admixture of mg rich brines during august during the wet season the river head rises expected to increase infiltration into the riverbed zimmer and lautz 2014 at the baptism site ionic concentrations in april behave similarly to those contemporaneously at tovlan with freshwater dictating the geochemical composition river water is the only component within the riverbed at that time table 3 however even with low groundwater heads and obviously independent from river water discharge fig 8b salinity in pore water increases significantly with depth in august and more so in december here too low na cl and high mg ca refer to infiltrating mg cl brine of aqraa type which is supported by inverse modelling table 3 in august decreasing δ18o and δ2h signatures with depth may relate to a higher contribution of isotopic light saline groundwater möller et al 2007a 2012 however in december when pore water composition indicates a saline component with enhanced δ18o and δ2h signatures this supports the contribution of saline water which has experienced considerable evaporation and approaches the river through the subsurface with the first recharge flush fig 8b such evaporated saline water may originate from the leaking karameh dam located close to the baptism site fig 1 in the karama dam saline tds up to 35 g l 1000br cl 9 03 na cl 0 57 mg ca 1 68 salameh pers comm 2018 and highly evaporated δ18o 5 49 and δ2h 24 54 siebert unpubl data water is characteristic the concept of different sources supplying salinity to the porewater of the baptism site during august and december is supported by inverse modelling which refer to fractions of 0 19 karama dam water during december and 0 16 aqraa type brine in august in the deepest pore waters at the baptism site table 3 at abdullah station fluctuations of the ljr water table are characterised by much smaller amplitudes fig 8c and the chemical composition in the upper 0 15 m of the april core constantly resembles low concentrated river water this feature indicates stream water infiltration into the sediment however below this depth sharply rising concentrations increasing br cl and mg ca ratios 1 and low na cl ratios indicate a strong contribution of mg cl rift brines at the least during april and august when groundwater tables in the surrounding sediments are low compared to april the observed behaviour establishes much earlier during august likely related to slightly lower riverheads during the dry season facilitating the ascent of brines farber et al 2004 assumed a continuous high contribution of saline groundwater in that region this is supported by modelling the deepest pore waters at abdullah station denoting a fraction of about 0 1 of aqraa type brines in august and december table 3 the discussion of our findings is condensed in a conceptual summary fig 9 of the main sources in each station and month plausibility of which is underpinned by inverse modelling 6 conclusions though the hydrogeochemistry and origin of saline waters in the jordan rift valley has already been widely investigated past studies have mainly been restricted to springs wells and boreholes at lake kinneret and the dead sea only few studies focussed on the hydrogeochemical composition and development of the ljr but did not directly interrogate groundwater river water interactions these studies defined the groundwater source as nearly a steady contributor by which a static mix of brine and saline groundwater enters the river our study is the first to investigate variations in spatiotemporal groundwater surface water interactions through direct sampling of riverine pore water hydrogeochemical profiles the data were collected at the beginning and end of the wet season december and april and during midsummer august to observe spatiotemporal trends and the micro scale variability in hydrogeochemical profiles of pore water our results suggest spatially as well as seasonally variable connection between the ljr and groundwater our central finding is based on the interpretation of chemical and isotopic composition of pore waters which are underpinned by inverse models for selected pore water samples applying reasonable criteria for exclusion the non uniqueness of modelling results was eliminated and the remaining most plausible solutions support our interpretation with an acceptable uncertainty where effluent conditions prevail groundwater inflows and their composition vary spatially and seasonally the most distinct difference along the ljr is the strong n s zonation of pore water salinity and composition effluent groundwaters in the north of the ljr are almost fresh and ca dominated indicating moderate contribution of ca cl brines as known from the western shore of lake kinneret contrastingly between menahamiya and tovlan and further southwards the contribution of brines is much higher and its character switches to mg cl generally two groundwater types interact with each other a shallow gravity driven fresh or brackish groundwater and b pressurized groundwater brines ascending along faults and fractures within the lower jordan valley these components variably mix and enter the river in varying proportions along its course causing different pore water compositions this result has strong implications since the contribution of deep saline groundwater varies temporally instead of being constant as commonly assumed our analyses further demonstrate that surface reservoirs on both sides of the ljr interact sporadically with pore water the interplay between the two groundwaters and their final composition are obviously independent from river head but dependent on groundwater tables in the graben sediments temporal changes at single locations e g in baptism site result from seasonal groundwater table fluctuations and their response time to the hibernal recharge as stated above the salinity of the ljr cannot be explained by evaporation or a single groundwater source but rather by a mixture of sources by confirming spatiotemporal variability we demonstrate the transient nature of these sources our results also demonstrate the importance of spatiotemporal pore water sampling schemes to better understand complex hydraulic and hydrochemical environments such as the ljr these results will aid in the global challenge of knowledge based management of river water quality in rivers draining semi arid basins 6 1 future directions despite the novelty of the present work examining groundwater surface water interactions in the ljr through the lens of sub riverine pore water hydrogeochemical profiles deeper cores are needed to better characterise the endmembers and clarify boundary conditions for numerical modelling purposes on this basis modelling advective and diffusive flow could be realized which would facilitate an inverse solution of flow rates acknowledgments this study was funded by

599,groundwater surface water interactions as result of in and effluent conditions along a stream may have a strong impact on the quantity and quality of the river water these interactions are controlled by river morphology and by transient hydraulic gradients between river and surrounding groundwater here we document the existence of spatiotemporal variations in groundwater surface water interactions in the bed of the lower jordan river through pore water analysis of shallow sediment cores using major ions na mg2 ca2 cl br so4 2 and stable isotopes δ18o δ2h our results demonstrate that temporal variations are neither spatially uniform nor steady upwelling of groundwater is seasonally dependent and forced by a winter pulse of groundwater recharge and by estival low river discharge keywords lower jordan river pore water major ions isotopes groundwater surface water interactions 1 introduction groundwater inflow into fluvial limnic or marine systems as a source of pollutants nutrients or dissolved salts has been documented to result in eutrophication and salinization of fresh surface water schlüter et al 2004 santos et al 2008 krause et al 2009 attempts to estimate groundwater inflow into fluvial systems requires differentiation amongst agricultural return flow deep groundwater upwelling scanlon et al 2007 hogan et al 2007 gardner et al 2011 smerdon et

research has been carried out in sandy and relatively coarse grained fluvial environments e g arntzen et al 2006 zimmer and lautz 2014 however water flow through fine grained silty or clayey riverbeds with considerably lower hydraulic conductivities and consequently reduced matrix permeability younger et al 1993 boulton et al 1998 has been less widely examined groundwater upwelling controlled by hydraulic head gradients may be driven by the formation of brines within artesian aquifers ascending along fractures and faults cherubini et al 2014 or through hydrologic windows pepin et al 2014 natural causes for river water salinization such as saline groundwater infiltration hogan et al 2007 and direct evaporation are typical of closed drainage basins in semi arid and arid regions williams 1999 phillips et al 2003 river water salinity may also increase due to dissolution of saline deposits accumulated in dry periods by surface runoff anker et al 2009 anthropogenic induced river salinization due to agricultural return flows sewage land use changes scanlon et al 2007 water diversion and river damming williams 1999 2001 often occur alongside natural causes hogan et al 2007 groundwater inflow may be inferred from monitoring piezometric heads adjacent to the river by discharge differences between gauging stations along the stream and by temperature measurements e g marzadri et al 2013 briggs et al 2016 however these methods pose considerable uncertainties and require adequate monitoring stations alternatively a variety of chemical and isotopic environmental

isotopic composition of a water parcel is the integral of its entire pathways influenced by both geogenic and or anthropogenic factors kimball et al 2001 the lower jordan river ljr receives water from the confluence of freshwater from lake kinneret tds 0 6 g l and brackish yarmouk river tds 2 8 g l together with saline springs from the saline diversion channel sdc tds 4 2 g l and treated wastewater tds 1 2 g l while it enters the dead sea with strongly enhanced and variable salinities of 8 10 g l fig 1 neither evaporation nor the known saline inflows may cause this high salinity excess salinity is most likely supplied by inflowing saline groundwater which was estimated to amount to 20 80 and 10 of the total flow in the northern and southern segments of the ljr respectively farber et al 2004 holtzman et al 2005 this wide range of estimated saline groundwater contribution and the strong temporal variations in chemical composition of the ljr hillel et al 2015 indicate chemically distinct temporal contributions of variable solute sources the ljr flows through urbanised and intensely exploited agricultural land possessing sources of anthropogenic pollution sewage fishpond spills additionally saline springs of the kinneret basin are diverted to minimize salinization of the kinneret and enter the ljr via the sdc thereby contributing to the solute content of the river the

investigated the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater surface water interactions we aim to enhance understanding regarding where and when groundwater from a range of sources having variable

interstitial water of the riverbed and in the river water comparing these hydrogeochemical characteristics with those of previously characterized aquifers field measurements to support the present study could be carried out at limited locations since the river forms a highly restricted international border and security considerations make swaths of the river inaccessible nevertheless our goal was to overcome this challenge and to advance our ability to investigate groundwater surface water interactions in comparable hydrological systems characterized by very limited data information and accessibility 2 study area the lower jordan river meanders along 200 km through the jordan valley from lake kinneret sea of galilee 210 m msl fig 1 to the dead sea currently 432 m msl along the aerial

from i lake kinneret ii yarmouk river iii sdc which diverts springs with varying salinities from the kinneret and iv sewage treated to various degrees fig 1 additionally fishpond spills agricultural return flows and to large degree seasonal floods contribute to the total discharge of the ljr hillel et al 2015 groundwater sources that may enter the ljr are manifold fig 2 i pressurized brines which ascend along faults from deep aquiferous units within the rift fill ii fresh to brackish groundwater hosted in the mesozoic sandstone complex lower cretaceous and older formations of the rift margins

infiltrating into the wadi deposits and groundwater from all these sources migrate through the post miocene fluvial and lacustrine sediments of the lower jordan valley ljv to reach the river the ljv deposits possess variable hydraulic conductivities aquifer sequences such as the waqqas and the dana conglomerates in jordan and the samra formation west of the river efficiently transport water while

the ljr and at the outlet of the lake kinneret river water was sampled monthly between early 2015 and the end of 2016 fig 1 additionally at these locations sediment cores were drilled on three occasions dec 2014 apr 2016 and aug 2016 to study possible seasonal effects since the upper 10 km of the river is not an international border station density is higher in this reach relative to the rest of the study area location of sampling stations could not be determined purely on scientific preferences rather they were chosen 1 arbitrarily by officials according to administrative considerations and 2 where the river could be accessed without mortal danger sampling sediment cores were obtained by manually inserting a 2 inch diameter plastic liner into the streambed core lengths vary table 1 and were determined by local sediment depth and limitations of the manual method immediately after recovery of the liner it was cut to core length and sealed with a fitted cap to prevent disturbance and mixing on the same day sediment was removed from the liner by a piston starting at the sediment water interface cores were divided into slices of 2 to 3 cm these subsamples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm the supernatant water was removed with a syringe several slices did not yield enough water for analysis resulting in missing data sdc and abdullah stations were not sampled for technical reasons during the december campaign water analysis both stream water and extracted pore water were filtered 0 45 μm and analysed for major ions and water isotopes δ18o δd stream water samples were analysed at the university of goettingen anions cl br no3 so4 2 were analysed by ic ion chromatography dionex dx 320 and cations na k mg2 ca2 were analysed applying conductometric detection using an ic dionex dx 500 the analytical error was estimated to be 8 major ions in pore water were analysed at the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz applying ic ics 2000 dionex for anions and dionex dx 120 for cations bicarbonate and dic were determined using standard titration technique and a shimadzu total carbon analyser toc5000 5050 respectively water isotope analyses were performed at ufz using a los gatos research triple isotope water analyser 45 ep with a respective analytical precision of 1 5 and 0 4 for 2h and 18o respectively inverse modelling the public domain software phreeqc parkhurst 1995 and the phreeq dat thermodynamic database were applied to calculate inverse models by which the interpretation of chemical and isotopic composition of pore waters may be supported but not explained based on hydrogeological considerations we assume that the porewater at each sampling location is the result of mixed known solutions namely ljr water and local ground or reservoir waters which react with the occurring geological material of the jordan valley in the case of the lake kinneret core lake water replaces the river water component generally at most two waters which are known to be present in the area of the respective coring location are considered and mixed with the covering river lake water during the time and at the location of sampling these solutions table 2 are allowed to be in equilibrium with common and plausible minerals at each location the model input consists of field measured ph temperature and concentration of major ions mineral phases halite dolomite aragonite calcite anhydrite and gypsum represent the solid phases in the shallow sediments of the ljv which either dissolve or precipitate table 3 reactive surfaces mgx2 cax2 nax and kx enable cation exchange and either gain or release mg2 ca2 na and k respectively co2 represents the amount of transferred gaseous co2 sumresiduals represents the sum of the remaining components that could not be attributed by phreeqc to specific reactions phreeqc allows for inaccuracies in the analysis of each solution and for uncertainty of the reaction scheme the former was attributed by setting uncertainty to 5 10 multiple models of different solutions were inversely modelled for each pore water core and the best model determined from its geochemical plausibility and goodness of fit was selected for each core and presented in table 3 to suspend the majority of mathematically correct simulation results and to end up with few models which best fit the measurements the following criteria have been applied i phase transfers are coherent to saturation indices and ii the sum of residuals sumresidual and iii the number of mol transfers are lowest for each sample the one fitting best molar na cl ratio of the sampled pore water has been selected as the most plausible solution although this process of elimination leads to feasible results these inverse modelling results are not a unique solution but a plausible answer with an acceptable uncertainty 4 results 4 1 na cl br and mg2 distribution in pore water profiles fig 3a d two distinct behaviours are observable in the ionic distribution of the pore water profiles that may be mainly attributed to saline sources such as brines and the dissolution of minerals fig 3 first low concentration pore water profiles that do not vary significantly with depth are derived from kinneret sdc beit zera and menahamiya stations figs 3a d all located in the northern segment of the river and are henceforth combined to a northern cluster second profiles with large variations and enhanced concentrations with depth sampled at the southerly tovlan baptism and abdullah sites are henceforth combined to a southern cluster in the northern cluster kinneret differs in april with slightly higher na cl br and mg2 concentrations along the profile while beit zera shows increasing concentrations of these ions during december the southern cluster has distinctly different and site specific ion concentrations with depth both cores in the southernmost abdullah are characterized by increasing ion concentrations with depth in the april core the deepest samples may represent maximum concentration of 180 meq l and 1 5 meq l for cl and br at this location respectively fig 3b c during august enhanced concentrations are reached at shallower depths in april ion concentrations at the baptism site do not vary with depth with the exception of mg2 fig 3d during august and december a substantial almost linear increase of ion concentrations with depth is typical of the baptism site at tovlan concentrations vary only in august when they continuously increase to a depth of 0 3 m and decline thereafter 4 2 distribution of ca2 and so4 2 in pore water profiles fig 3e f except for the abdullah and baptism site stations where concentration profiles of ca2 and so4 2 nearly resemble those of mg2 all other stations show distinctly different behaviours figs 3e f at tovlan ca2 shows a possible concentration maximum at 0 3 m depth during april while so4 2 does not vary with depth from the riverbed to 0 35 m increasing thereafter depth independent concentrations of both these ions are lowest during december at kinneret and menahamiya their concentrations increase with depth and are lowest in december and highest in august contrastingly no distinct trends are observable at the sdc and beit zera locations 4 3 the variation with depth of 1000br cl and na cl ratios salinity in groundwater of the jordan dead sea rift is mostly associated with the ascent of either residual seawater brines e g starinsky 1974 rosenthal et al 1988 or post halite ablation brines flexer et al 2000 which show an enhanced 1000br cl ratio of 5 and a low na cl ratio of 0 86 möller et al 2018 in contrast waters with lower 1000br cl ratios and 0 86 na cl 1 refer to halite dissolution by freshwater na cl 1 indicates basaltic weathering solutions where na is released from plagioclase minerals siebert et al 2014a in december and april pore water profiles along the river show average 1000br cl ratios of 5 which except for kinneret and beit zera slightly increase with depth fig 4 a during august ratios increase to 7 5 at lake kinneret beit zera and the baptism site ratios of 1000br cl in pore water samples of lake kinneret are persistently elevated relative to lake water which varies in the range 3 3 8 siebert 2006 at the baptism and abdullah sites 1000br cl ratios in pore water resemble the characteristic distribution of cl and br in the respective cores fig 3b c the vertical distribution of na cl ratios within the cores is less distinct at the kinneret ratios vary between 0 7 and 1 05 during the year with the december core showing the lowest values in april and august values increase close to and below the water sediment interface to 1 and decrease downwards fig 4b at sdc beit zera and menahamiya na cl values increase with depth to almost unity this stands true for tovlan as well except for august when the concentration maxima for na and cl fig 3b c result in a minimum na cl of 0 5 at a depth of 0 3 m at the baptism site ratios are highest 0 7 0 9 during december and april and lowest 0 6 0 7 in august unlike the br cl ratios na cl ratios at abdullah exhibit no trend but vary with depth 0 56 0 84 4 4 variation of mg ca ratios with depth the northern cluster sdc beit zera and menahamiya are defined by mg ca equivalent ratios 1 while kinneret shows ratios 1 only in august while kinneret shows no continuous trend during december and april in august ratios decrease with depth no significant variations with depth occur at the other northern stations at the southern cluster i e tovlan baptism and abdullah mg ca ratios are 1 throughout the year while tovlan shows lowest values in april baptism and abdulla show highest ratios at that time at the baptism and abdullah sites ratios increase with depth while values in tovlan differ between the seasons but do not vary considerably with depth 4 5 cross plot equivalent ratios in pore and river waters cross plots of pore water na cl vs mg ca form distinct groups either ca dominated in the northern cluster or mg dominated in the southern cluster fig 5 a c this grouping is valid throughout the year for most stations only kinneret pore water vary whereas they belong to both groups in april fig 5a they are ca dominated in august fig 5b and switch to mg dominated in december fig 5a pore waters in the southern cluster have a stronger mg dominance with decreasing na cl in the northern cluster ca mg ratios do not significantly change with changes in na cl cross plots of na cl versus 1000br cl do not show grouping of pore water fig 5 d f pore waters plot mostly right of the mixing line of the dead sea rift brines dsrb klein ben david et al 2004 in december br cl ratios within the pore waters of each station are similar resulting in an almost horizontal deviation of samples from the dsrb mixing line and indicating a freshwater component to which dsrb is variably admixed fig 5d river water samples consistently plot close to the dsrb and differ from pore water composition in april pore water in the southern baptism and even more in abdullah sites move up the dsrb line to higher br cl and lower na cl ratios fig 5e which become even more distinct during august fig 5f in august highest br cl and lowest na cl ratios are observable in the southern stations while the stations in the upper part of the ljr including the kinneret show variable and unsystematic behaviour 4 6 stable isotopes of water δ2h δ18o with depth variations of seasonal isotopic compositions with depth are different along the river fig 6 the only outlier is observable at the kinneret where isotopic signatures in pore water are strongly enriched all year round values are positive for both δ2h and δ18o isotopic values of pore water from the river sediments are relatively similar ca δ18o of 2 5 and δ2h of 10 signatures in sdc beit zera and menahamiya do not vary with depth while in december tovlan pore water has increasing values with depth reaching in the lowest part of the core 1 and 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the baptism site shows stable values with depth during april and decreasing with depth during august while signatures in december are inconsistent up to 0 3 δ18o and 4 2 δ2h at abdullah signatures slightly decline with depth in april and august the distribution of δ18o versus δ2h shows different conditions during the year fig 7 at the end of the rainy season april all pore water samples except beit zera and menahamiya plot to the right of the global meteoric water line gmwl dansgaard 1964 and the levantine mwl gat 1971 furthermore all pore water samples except kinneret plot left of the long term trend of kinneret water siebert 2006 at this time of the year pore waters are isotopically light and follow two distinct trends fig 7a the pore water at beit zera and menahamiya is close to the gmwl and lighter than the contemporaneous river water at the stations as for the southern cluster isotope signatures in pore water plot between gmwl and the kinneret long term average they become isotopically lighter with increasing distance downstream from lake kinneret in april contemporaneous river water is isotopically heavier than the pore waters the heaviest samples are derived from lake kinneret surface water and pore water trend lines of both clusters have the closest inclination to the kinneret water line during april fig 7a compared with april trends in both clusters but particularly in the southern cluster have lower and almost parallel running slopes during august fig 7b and are distinctly separated during august the pore water in the southern cluster plots closely to trend line of lake kinneret water isotopically lightest water is observed in the baptism core while the heaviest is derived from the kinneret pore water at the end of the dry season in december the trend lines of both clusters are even less inclined than in august fig 7c except for beit zera and menahamiya all pore waters plot to the right of the long term trend of kinneret water fig 7c though the latter two stations are located slightly downstream of the outlet of the isotopically enriched lake kinneret both river and pore waters at beit zera and menahamiya are isotopically lighter indicating an origin differing from lake kinneret pore water samples become enriched along the river course reaching δ18o 0 at tovlan and are in all cases isotopically heavier than the co located river water 5 discussion at lake kinneret station cl in pore water increases with depth during april it is an order of magnitude lower during august and december similar behaviours are observable for all other ions and particularly for so4 2 decreasing na cl variable br cl and variable mg ca ratios with depth indicate an upwards seeping admixture of recently infiltrated groundwater that has dissolved halite and contains traces of residual brines indeed inverse modelling refers to fractions of fresh judea group aquifer water that mixes with lake kinneret water and very small portions of tiberias type brines siebert 2006 and dissolves about 4 58 mmol halite per litre table 3 in contrast to august and december in april equivalent ratios of mg ca 1 fig 4c and so4 ca 1 indicate weathering of basalts and associated oxidation of sulphide minerals these results resemble previous general findings of stiller et al 1975 2009 stiller 1994 and dror et al 1999 who described saline groundwater seepage through the lakebed increased chloride concentration during april reflects the seasonal behaviour of groundwater systems in tiberias and fuliya at lake kinneret driven by the hibernal pulse of both lake level rise and groundwater recharge which control the hydraulic gradient between the aquifers and the lake rimmer et al 1999 south of lake kinneret the ljr results from the confluence of isotopically light saline groundwater channelized by the sdc and the isotopically enriched fresh lake water this is observable by the enhanced salinity and decreased isotopic composition in the northern stations compared to the lake except from beit zera in december stations of the northern cluster have consistently similar behaviour they show little to no increase in chloride concentration and a stable mg ca 1 with depth the equivalent increase in ca2 and so4 2 indicating gypsum dissolution and na cl ratios trending with depth towards unity suggest halite dissolution such high na cl have previously been described in pore water at the southern part of lake kinneret stiller et al 2009 and might be related to the zemah halite body which extends northwards into the kinneret basin inbar unpublished data and is dissolved by groundwater möller et al 2012 within the lower jordan valley two general types of groundwater with low na cl are observed ca and mg dominated bentor 1969 they cause a well described mg ca contrast in different locations along the rift plotting na cl versus mg ca and 1000br cl fig 5 reveals that pore water at the kinneret is dominated by mg2 and lower na cl ratios during the early and late rainy season mg ca 1 indicating a brine contribution similar to that known from the ha on region möller et al 2012 while ca rich groundwater mg ca 1 dictates pore water composition during august then when ca2 dominates na cl of about unity indicates increased contribution of halite dissolution water as described for groundwater in the vicinity of the zemah borehole marcus and slager 1985 möller et al 2012 drilled at the southern end of lake kinneret into thick halite bodies following the river further downstream only pore water of beit zera in december shows an influence by ascending rift brines that becomes evident due to distinctly decreasing na cl and increasing ion concentrations except of so4 2 with depth it is further supported by modelling results which indicate a fraction of about 0 12 ca cl rift brines of tiberias type admix to 0 88 ljr water table 3 and cause these pore waters to plot close to the dead sea rift line dsr introduced by klein ben david et al 2004 in contrast to the pore waters at sdc beit zera and menahamiya river water samples at these locations are always close to the dsr fig 5d e f mainly resulting from the saline groundwater carrier sdc which collects diluted rift brines at lake kinneret and releases them to the ljr rather than of rift brines ascending through the streambed a similar picture emerges from the pore water signatures of δ18o and δ2h at these stations they resemble those of the co located river water indicating infiltration of river water into the riverbed sediments the southern part of the ljr displays a different behaviour during april pore water at tovlan is characterised by fresh groundwater observable by a low cl pore water even less then the lowest river water cl concentrations which occur during the hibernal high flow season fig 8 a at the end of the wet season april fresh effluent dominating the pore space in tovlan may be caused by shallow fresh groundwater fluctuating concentrations of mg2 ca2 and so4 2 with higher concentrations at 8 cm and 15 35 cm depth but unchanged low na cl and br along the core are interpreted to indicate layered flow of such shallow groundwater during august this pattern of layered flow intensifies simultaneously a distinct salinity peak in pore water at a depth of 15 35 cm indicates a contribution of saline groundwater into that horizon there and in comparison to april all ions except so4 2 show increased concentrations lower na cl and higher mg ca ratios suggesting a contribution of mg cl brines of type aqraa during december pore water is fresh and shows no variations with depth except for δ18o and δ2h which both increase this unusual behaviour may be explained by leakage from the relatively fresh tirtsa reservoir located a few hundred meters upstream tovlan fig 1 also supporting the existence of a hydraulic connection between the nearby graben flank and the ljr at tovlan inverse models support this concept which denotes a considerable contribution aqraa brine in august and variable contributions of tirtsa reservoir water in august and december table 3 the seasonal sampling scheme revealed varying ascending brines rather than a steady mix with fresh groundwater while freshwater that leaches pleistocene and neogene sediments with high na cl high so4 ca and low mg ca ratios predominantly approaches the riverbed during the wet season december to march farber et al 2007 low groundwater tables allow enhanced admixture of mg rich brines during august during the wet season the river head rises expected to increase infiltration into the riverbed zimmer and lautz 2014 at the baptism site ionic concentrations in april behave similarly to those contemporaneously at tovlan with freshwater dictating the geochemical composition river water is the only component within the riverbed at that time table 3 however even with low groundwater heads and obviously independent from river water discharge fig 8b salinity in pore water increases significantly with depth in august and more so in december here too low na cl and high mg ca refer to infiltrating mg cl brine of aqraa type which is supported by inverse modelling table 3 in august decreasing δ18o and δ2h signatures with depth may relate to a higher contribution of isotopic light saline groundwater möller et al 2007a 2012 however in december when pore water composition indicates a saline component with enhanced δ18o and δ2h signatures this supports the contribution of saline water which has experienced considerable evaporation and approaches the river through the subsurface with the first recharge flush fig 8b such evaporated saline water may originate from the leaking karameh dam located close to the baptism site fig 1 in the karama dam saline tds up to 35 g l 1000br cl 9 03 na cl 0 57 mg ca 1 68 salameh pers comm 2018 and highly evaporated δ18o 5 49 and δ2h 24 54 siebert unpubl data water is characteristic the concept of different sources supplying salinity to the porewater of the baptism site during august and december is supported by inverse modelling which refer to fractions of 0 19 karama dam water during december and 0 16 aqraa type brine in august in the deepest pore waters at the baptism site table 3 at abdullah station fluctuations of the ljr water table are characterised by much smaller amplitudes fig 8c and the chemical composition in the upper 0 15 m of the april core constantly resembles low concentrated river water this feature indicates stream water infiltration into the sediment however below this depth sharply rising concentrations increasing br cl and mg ca ratios 1 and low na cl ratios indicate a strong contribution of mg cl rift brines at the least during april and august when groundwater tables in the surrounding sediments are low compared to april the observed behaviour establishes much earlier during august likely related to slightly lower riverheads during the dry season facilitating the ascent of brines farber et al 2004 assumed a continuous high contribution of saline groundwater in that region this is supported by modelling the deepest pore waters at abdullah station denoting a fraction of about 0 1 of aqraa type brines in august and december table 3 the discussion of our findings is condensed in a conceptual summary fig 9 of the main sources in each station and month plausibility of which is underpinned by inverse modelling 6 conclusions though the hydrogeochemistry and origin of saline waters in the jordan rift valley has already been widely investigated past studies have mainly been restricted to springs wells and boreholes at lake kinneret and the dead sea only few studies focussed on the hydrogeochemical composition and development of the ljr but did not directly interrogate groundwater river water interactions these studies defined the groundwater source as nearly a steady contributor by which a static mix of brine and saline groundwater enters the river our study is the first to investigate variations in spatiotemporal groundwater surface water interactions through direct sampling of riverine pore water hydrogeochemical profiles the data were collected at the beginning and end of the wet season december and april and during midsummer august to observe spatiotemporal trends and the micro scale variability in hydrogeochemical profiles of pore water our results suggest spatially as well as seasonally variable connection between the ljr and groundwater our central finding is based on the interpretation of chemical and isotopic composition of pore waters which are underpinned by inverse models for selected pore water samples applying reasonable criteria for exclusion the non uniqueness of modelling results was eliminated and the remaining most plausible solutions support our interpretation with an acceptable uncertainty where effluent conditions prevail groundwater inflows and their composition vary spatially and seasonally the most distinct difference along the ljr is the strong n s zonation of pore water salinity and composition effluent groundwaters in the north of the ljr are almost fresh and ca dominated indicating moderate contribution of ca cl brines as known from the western shore of lake kinneret contrastingly between menahamiya and tovlan and further southwards the contribution of brines is much higher and its character switches to mg cl generally two groundwater types interact with each other a shallow gravity driven fresh or brackish groundwater and b pressurized groundwater brines ascending along faults and fractures within the lower jordan valley these components variably mix and enter the river in varying proportions along its course causing different pore water compositions this result has strong implications since the contribution of deep saline groundwater varies temporally instead of being constant as commonly assumed our analyses further demonstrate that surface reservoirs on both sides of the ljr interact sporadically with pore water the interplay between the two groundwaters and their final composition are obviously independent from river head but dependent on groundwater tables in the graben sediments temporal changes at single locations e g in baptism site result from seasonal groundwater table fluctuations and their response time to the hibernal recharge as stated above the salinity of the ljr cannot be explained by evaporation or a single groundwater source but rather by a mixture of sources by confirming spatiotemporal variability we demonstrate the transient nature of these sources our results also demonstrate the importance of spatiotemporal pore water sampling schemes to better understand complex hydraulic and hydrochemical environments such as the ljr these results will aid in the global challenge of knowledge based management of river water quality in rivers draining semi arid basins 6 1 future directions despite the novelty of the present work examining groundwater surface water interactions in the ljr through the lens of sub riverine pore water hydrogeochemical profiles deeper cores are needed to better characterise the endmembers and clarify boundary conditions for numerical modelling purposes on this basis modelling advective and diffusive flow could be realized which would facilitate an inverse solution of flow rates acknowledgments this study was funded by
