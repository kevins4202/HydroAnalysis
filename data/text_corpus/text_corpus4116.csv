both numerical and experimental results of the pss effect on the propeller efficiency have been published however there is still efficient design is demanding as mentioned earlier the pss aims to reduce or recover the rotational energy losses by generating a swirling flow opposite to the sense of the propeller s rotation the wake flow behind the ship is produced due to the boundary layer and possibly separation flow which is very complex unsteady and non uniform flow which strongly depends on the ship type and so each ship may be considered to have a unique wake field therefore the design of the pss depends on the type of the ship and its stern shape for a u shape the propeller thrust loading coefficient c th is typically greater than 1 0 and the ship s speed is usually less than 20 knots like bulk carrier and crude carrier while for a v shape like kcs the design speed is greater than 20 knots for the pss mounted into the kcs efficient numerical schemes are scarce and the hydrodynamic design of the pss has not far been adequately explored for the kcs it is indeed imperative to use an appropriate pss in front of the propeller in order to improve the wake and propulsion

of the whole system at four model speed of 0 8 2 5 m s the remainder of the paper is divided as follows materials and methods are described in section 2 numerical results are presented in section 3 in

analysis system modelling system analysis and conclusions governing equations and geometrical properties of the analysed hull and propeller are presented in detail in the following parts of this section the system analysis is provided in the third section 2 2 governing equations the governing equations for the numerical simulation are the continuity equation and the incompressible ranse reynolds averaged navier stokes equations navier stokes equations and the continuity equation are expressed as follows 8 u i x i 0 9 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j where x i are cartesian coordinates u i are the corresponding velocity components and p ρ and μ are the pressure density and viscosity respectively the steady state solution of governing equations 8

which solves the ranse and continuity equations in an integral form on a polyhedral mesh by means of the finite volume technique both steady state and transient calculations are considered the reynolds stress term of ρ u i u j is solved by means of the k ε turbulence model the rotating propeller is treated in two different ways i e the moving reference frame mrf is applied for the open water calculation while for the propeller behind the ship a rigid body approach is applied the ranse method is based on the fundamental conservation equations however they are solved for the values averaged in a long time direct numerical flow modeling requires excessive computational effort due to the requirement of very dense discretization of the computational domain and use of very short time step it is assumed that turbulence s influence on the flow is derived with sufficient accuracy based on the averaged flow parameters further details of the implementation can be found in the

blade of kp505 are presented in fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 mesh generation analysis in the meshing method huilan et al 2002 compared three types of unstructured mesh for a propeller to calculate propeller characteristics in detail and suggested trimmed mesh is better to be used thus the trimmed mesh method is adopted with 1 3 surface growth rate to mesh continuity a fast volume growth rate is used there was more attention in mesh generation hence the convergence was achieved by such a less mesh number mesh sensitivity is analysed to obtain independent mesh results the calculations are performed in four mesh sizes i e coarse medium fine and finer mesh size due to the acceptable error and consuming time it was achieved that the propeller with 1 2 million meshes and pss with 0 8 million meshes satisfy the mesh independence as fig 6 based on the grid convergence index gci proposed by celik et al 2008 the proper verification is performed on the grid generation analysis in this method apparent order s a is expressed as 15 s a 1 ln r 21 ln ε 32 ε 21 q s a auxiliary parameters are calculated as follows 16 q s a ln r 21 s a s r 32 s a s 17 s 1 sgn ε 32 ε 21

propeller as the unstructured girds is used to apply the propeller rotation influences the unstructured fixed grids are also implemented to the surface of the hub and part of the shaft on the other hand the structured girds are utilized in other domains as the upstream and downstream surface extruder three layers of prismatic cells are placed to resolve the boundary layer accurately and provide desired levels of wall y the thickness of the boundary layer is supposed as 0 8 d d is the propeller diameter the y values were acquired less than 40 with the before mentioned boundary layer settings according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendation ittc procedings 2014 the preferred time step has been calculated in such a way that the propeller revolves within a 0 5 and 2 unit time step here in this paper the time step is 0 0005 which allows the propeller to rotate 1 9 3 2 propeller in open water condition calculations of the propeller in the open water condition are the first step in the propeller design the propeller open water condition states that the propeller is rotating with a revolution n in the uniform flow with advanced velocity v a the model propeller kp505 created by kriso for a container ship has been simulated the experimental data were also reported in ref fujisawa et al 2000 simcenter star ccm was used to simulate models here the propeller is rotated with 10 6 rps and the advance velocity is changed from 0 4 m s to 2 5 m s to get the advance coefficient of 0 15 0 95 by step 0 1 hence the torque thrust and efficiency results are determined at nine advance coefficients a comparison of this model propeller s hydrodynamic coefficients or open water characteristics is shown in fig 8 maximal absolute errors for thrust and torque coefficients are equal to δk tmax 0 29and δ k qmax 0 58 except for the calculation of advance coefficient j 0 95 the maximal absolute error for propeller efficiency is equal to δη max 0 35 although the numerical results are slightly different from the experimental data there is a similar tendency 3 3 propeller in wake flow condition in the case of a propeller working in the wake flow a kcs is modelled the simulations were carried out at four different ship speeds from 0 8 to 2 5 m s after 35 s the result is converged and fig 9 a shows the top view of the free surface waves the cross sectional waves and axial velocity field have also been captured around the ship as presented in fig 9 b the velocity field behind the ship is compared with the experimental results as can be seen in fig 10 axial and cross velocities have a good agreement with the experimental measurements by fujisawa et al 2000 table 4 shows total ship resistance and wake factor at four speeds total resistance and propeller thrust with rotating speed 10 6 rps are illustrated in fig 11 in different ship speed for validating the ship simulation the laboratory and cfd drag coefficients are 0 0053711 and 0 003636 respectively therefore the calculation has a 2 03 error which is practically satisfactory after capturing the wake flow behind the ship it is used as an inlet wake flow to the propeller fig 12 compares the velocity field downstream of the propeller with the measured velocity field in the ship research institute of japan sri towing tank fujisawa et al 2000 from this figure it is concluded that the calculated velocity field had a good agreement with the experimental measurement fig 13 shows relative rotative efficiency ζ r in relation to four values of advanced coefficients the relative rotative efficiency ζ r accounted for the difference in power absorbed by the propeller when working in a uniform flow field at a given speed and absorbed when working in a wake field having the same mean velocity as equation 18 22 ζ r k q o k q b where k q o torque coefficient of the propeller working in open water condition k q b torque coefficient of the propeller working in wake condition 3 4 effect of the pss diminishing the propeller slip loss that occurred in the rotation is the principal pss s task the pss rotates flow in the reverse direction of the propeller rotation and intensifies thrust and torque the design of pss is significant to develop the proper flow direction to the propeller otherwise it causes to enhance resistance in this study pss is designed by eight stators rectangular span chord ratio or aspect ratio equals to 0 25 with naca0006 section and its angle of attack 15 deg the pss distance to the propeller is 0 17 d the final dimensions of the pss are given in table 5 the geometry of the propeller and pss is shown in fig 14 here in the present calculations the thrust identity that means total thrust t t o t a l and advance velocity v a are the same in the case of the propeller with and without pss is used to reach equal thrust one way is to change the propeller rotation speed for example the case 1 with and without pss the velocity and thrust are 0 6625 m s and 173 38165 n respectively while the rotating speeds n are different cause to change in torque efficiency and delivered power in the case of pss it isn t easy to find n to obtain the same thrust the propeller s rotating speed n is calculated by trial and error and it takes consuming time the total propulsion thrust is equal to the sum of the propeller thrust and the pss drag which are given as follows 23 t t o t a l t p r o p t p s s where t p r o p is the propeller thrust and t p s s is the drag of pss it is found that pss causes to increase in both thrust and torque of the propeller and with a proper design the efficiency increases and delivered power diminishes at the same speed the calculation results at the four different speeds are given in table 6 delivered power and efficiency are presented in fig 15 as can be seen in this figure the power diminishes and efficiency increases with pss in low speed according to the numerical results it is indicated that the average efficiency at the model speed between 0 8 2 196 m s is almost increased by 3 35 and the average delivered power is decreased by about 3 82 as shown in fig 15 the delivered power is decreased by 4 82 using the pss at speed 1 5 m s and 2 59 at speed 2 196 m s 3 5 comparison of the results in fig 16 and fig 17 axial isolines and cross velocities vector without pss a and with pss b are presented at two coefficients of v a 0 64 m s and 1 87 m s in front upstream of the propeller at x 0 2d as can be observed pss has changed the flow into the propeller especially the cross velocities the pss leads the current in the opposite direction of the propeller rotation so it reduces the slip loss of the propeller the pressure distribution contours at the propeller s back and face sides with and without pss at v a 1 87 are indicated in fig 18 as shown in this figure high pressure is found at the face or the pressure side and low pressure is shown in the back or suction side the pressure at a given point on the propeller blade is shown in one revolution and four revolutions of the propeller in fig 19 the point is in radius r x 0 7r and distance x 0 4c from the leading edge of the propeller blade where c is the propeller chord length at radius r x 0 7r and r is the propeller radius in this calculation the propeller speed is 10 6 rps during 2 s the propeller is rotated 21 revolutions the pressure is given in the last rotational speed last cycle and four last cycles in the case of using pss there are some small fluctuations for pressure during each cycle also pss decreases the maximum pressure fluctuation by 16 48 in the backside thrust and torque coefficients against one cycle for one blade and whole blades with and without pss are shown in fig 20 as observed on this figure there are some fluctuations for one blade during one cycle with pss while the effect of pss causes increases in the thrust and torque for both one blade and whole blades consequently the pss affects to decrease fluctuations for total thrust and torque coefficient during one cycle 4 conclusion the present paper was presented a new pss arrangement which fitted behind the kcs in front of the kp505 propeller to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the system at four model speed of 0 8 2 5 m s the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller behind the ship with and without pss is investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients in open water are calculated and compared at different advance coefficients a new pss configuration is then mounted in front of the propeller and its effect is presented and discussed the results of the present study lead to the following conclusions the numerical results of the open water characteristics are in good agreement with experimental data the effect of the pss caused to increase in the thrust and torque coefficients the results showed that the pss is prompted to increase the average efficiency at four defined speeds by 3 35 and diminished 3 82 delivered power in the case of using pss the maximum pressure fluctuation decreases by 16 48 in the backside the pss works well at low ship speeds and increases efficiency and decreases delivered power some fluctuations are produced on the one blade thrust and torque by pss during one cycle while for whole blades the total thrust and torque coefficient is smoother by pss the methodology presented in this article may serve as the basis for the development of different pss operated with other types of hulls and propellers and it will be the subject to future research

which solves the ranse and continuity equations in an integral form on a polyhedral mesh by means of the finite volume technique both steady state and transient calculations are considered the reynolds stress term of ρ u i u j is solved by means of the k ε turbulence model the rotating propeller is treated in two different ways i e the moving reference frame mrf is applied for the open water calculation while for the propeller behind the ship a rigid body approach is applied the ranse method is based on the fundamental conservation equations however they are solved for the values averaged in a long time direct numerical flow modeling requires excessive computational effort due to the requirement of very dense discretization of the computational domain and use of very short time step it is assumed that turbulence s influence on the flow is derived with sufficient accuracy based on the averaged flow parameters further details of the implementation can be found in the

calculate propeller characteristics in detail and suggested trimmed mesh is better to be used thus the trimmed mesh method is adopted with 1 3 surface growth rate to mesh continuity a fast volume growth rate is used there was more attention in mesh generation hence the convergence was achieved by such a less mesh number mesh sensitivity is analysed to obtain independent mesh results the calculations are performed in four mesh sizes i e coarse medium fine and finer mesh size due to the acceptable error and consuming time it was achieved that the propeller with 1 2 million meshes and pss with 0 8 million meshes satisfy the mesh independence as fig 6 based on the grid convergence index gci proposed by celik et al 2008 the proper verification is performed on the grid generation

propeller as the unstructured girds is used to apply the propeller rotation influences the unstructured fixed grids are also implemented to the surface of the hub and part of the shaft on the other hand the structured girds are utilized in other domains as the upstream and downstream surface extruder three layers of prismatic cells are placed to resolve the boundary layer accurately and provide desired levels of wall y the thickness of the boundary layer is supposed as 0 8 d d is the propeller diameter the y values were acquired less than 40 with the before mentioned boundary layer settings according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendation ittc procedings 2014 the preferred time step has been calculated in such a way that the propeller revolves within a 0 5 and 2 unit time step here in this paper the time step is 0 0005 which allows the propeller to rotate 1 9 3 2 propeller in open water condition calculations of the propeller in the open water condition are the first step in the propeller design the propeller open water condition states that the propeller is rotating with a revolution n in the uniform flow with advanced velocity v a the model propeller kp505 created by kriso for a container ship has been simulated the experimental data were also reported in ref fujisawa et al 2000 simcenter star ccm was used to simulate models here the propeller is rotated with 10 6 rps and the advance velocity is changed from 0 4 m s to 2 5 m s to get the advance coefficient of 0 15 0 95 by step 0 1 hence the torque thrust and efficiency results are determined at nine advance coefficients a comparison of this model propeller s hydrodynamic coefficients or open water characteristics is shown in fig 8 maximal absolute errors for thrust and torque coefficients are equal to δk tmax 0 29and δ k qmax 0 58 except for the calculation of advance coefficient j 0 95 the maximal absolute error for propeller efficiency is equal to δη max 0 35 although the numerical results are slightly different from the experimental data there is a similar tendency 3 3 propeller in wake flow condition in the case of a propeller working in the wake flow a kcs is modelled the simulations were carried out at four different ship speeds from 0 8 to 2 5 m s after 35 s the result is converged and fig 9 a shows the top view of the free surface waves the cross sectional waves and axial velocity field have also been captured around the ship as presented in fig 9 b the velocity field behind the ship is compared with the experimental results as can be seen in fig 10 axial and cross velocities have a good agreement with the experimental measurements by fujisawa et al 2000 table 4 shows total ship resistance and wake factor at four speeds total resistance and propeller thrust with rotating speed 10 6 rps are illustrated in fig 11 in different ship speed for validating the ship simulation the laboratory and cfd drag coefficients are 0 0053711 and 0 003636 respectively therefore the calculation has a 2 03 error which is practically satisfactory after capturing the wake flow behind the ship it is used as an inlet wake flow to the propeller fig 12 compares the velocity field downstream of the propeller with the measured velocity field in the ship research institute of japan sri towing tank fujisawa et al 2000 from this figure it is concluded that the calculated velocity field had a good agreement with the experimental measurement fig 13 shows relative rotative efficiency ζ r in relation to four values of advanced coefficients the relative rotative efficiency ζ r accounted for the difference in power absorbed by the propeller when working in a uniform flow field at a given speed and absorbed when working in a wake field having the same mean velocity as equation 18 22 ζ r k q o k q b where k q o torque coefficient of the propeller working in open water condition k q b torque coefficient of the propeller working in wake condition 3 4 effect of the pss diminishing the propeller slip loss that occurred in the rotation is the principal pss s task the pss rotates flow in the reverse direction of the propeller rotation and intensifies thrust and torque the design of pss is significant to develop the proper flow direction to the propeller otherwise it causes to enhance resistance in this study pss is designed by eight stators rectangular span chord ratio or aspect ratio equals to 0 25 with naca0006 section and its angle of attack 15 deg the pss distance to the propeller is 0 17 d the final dimensions of the pss are given in table 5 the geometry of the propeller and pss is shown in fig 14 here in the present calculations the thrust identity that means total thrust t t o t a l and advance velocity v a are the same in the case of the propeller with and without pss is used to reach equal thrust one way is to change the propeller rotation speed for example the case 1 with and without pss the velocity and thrust are 0 6625 m s and 173 38165 n respectively while the rotating speeds n are different cause to change in torque efficiency and delivered power in the case of pss it isn t easy to find n to obtain the same thrust the propeller s rotating speed n is calculated by trial and error and it takes consuming time the total propulsion thrust is equal to the sum of the propeller thrust and the pss drag which are given as follows 23 t t o t a l t p r o p t p s s where t p r o p is the propeller thrust and t p s s is the drag of pss it is found that pss causes to increase in both thrust and torque of the propeller and with a proper design the efficiency increases and delivered power diminishes at the same speed the calculation results at the four different speeds are given in table 6 delivered power and efficiency are presented in fig 15 as can be seen in this figure the power diminishes and efficiency increases with pss in low speed according to the numerical results it is indicated that the average efficiency at the model speed between 0 8 2 196 m s is almost increased by 3 35 and the average delivered power is decreased by about 3 82 as shown in fig 15 the delivered power is decreased by 4 82 using the pss at speed 1 5 m s and 2 59 at speed 2 196 m s 3 5 comparison of the results in fig 16 and fig 17 axial isolines and cross velocities vector without pss a and with pss b are presented at two coefficients of v a 0 64 m s and 1 87 m s in front upstream of the propeller at x 0 2d as can be observed pss has changed the flow into the propeller especially the cross velocities the pss leads the current in the opposite direction of the propeller rotation so it reduces the slip loss of the propeller the pressure distribution contours at the propeller s back and face sides with and without pss at v a 1 87 are indicated in fig 18 as shown in this figure high pressure is found at the face or the pressure side and low pressure is shown in the back or suction side the pressure at a given point on the propeller blade is shown in one revolution and four revolutions of the propeller in fig 19 the point is in radius r x 0 7r and distance x 0 4c from the leading edge of the propeller blade where c is the propeller chord length at radius r x 0 7r and r is the propeller radius in this calculation the propeller speed is 10 6 rps during 2 s the propeller is rotated 21 revolutions the pressure is given in the last rotational speed last cycle and four last cycles in the case of using pss there are some small fluctuations for pressure during each cycle also pss decreases the maximum pressure fluctuation by 16 48 in the backside thrust and torque coefficients against one cycle for one blade and whole blades with and without pss are shown in fig 20 as observed on this figure there are some fluctuations for one blade during one cycle with pss while the effect of pss causes increases in the thrust and torque for both one blade and whole blades consequently the pss affects to decrease fluctuations for total thrust and torque coefficient during one cycle 4 conclusion the present paper was presented a new pss arrangement which fitted behind the kcs in front of the kp505 propeller to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the system at four model speed of 0 8 2 5 m s the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller behind the ship with and without pss is investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients in open water are calculated and compared at different advance coefficients a new pss configuration is then mounted in front of the propeller and its effect is presented and discussed the results of the present study lead to the following conclusions the numerical results of the open water characteristics are in good agreement with experimental data the effect of the pss caused to increase in the thrust and torque coefficients the results showed that the pss is prompted to increase the average efficiency at four defined speeds by 3 35 and diminished 3 82 delivered power in the case of using pss the maximum pressure fluctuation decreases by 16 48 in the backside the pss works well at low ship speeds and increases efficiency and decreases delivered power some fluctuations are produced on the one blade thrust and torque by pss during one cycle while for whole blades the total thrust and torque coefficient is smoother by pss

20581,flow noise caused by sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy reduces the signal to noise ratio snr of the recorded signal therefore understanding the physical properties of the flow noise is important for improving the working performance of the sonobuoy the present work is dedicated to investigate the characteristics of the flow noise of sonobuoy generated from vertical motion based on the combination of numerical calculations and experimental results the flow noise of the hydrophone under time varying stream velocity is predicted using a hybrid computational fluid dynamics cfd ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation technique the flow noise calculated with the hybrid computational method is in good agreement with that analyzed by the experimental measurement and empirical formula the numerical calculation results of the flow noise under time varying stream velocity condition reveal that the spectrum and temporal coherence of the flow noise exhibit the periodic changes same as that of the stream velocity these analyses and conclusions are verified by experimental data the study in this paper will contribute to signal processing of the sonobuoy and thus improving snr of the measure signal keywords flow noise sonobuoy spectrum time coherence vertical motion 1 introduction as one of the underwater acoustic measurement devices sonobuoy is of great importance for underwater target localization and ambient noise recording barlow et al 2018 tollefsen et al 2014 tan et al 2011 however the flow noise resulting from the vertical motion of the sonobuoy limits the working performance of sonobuoy this is because the surface buoy of the sonobuoy will float up and down with the sea waves and this vertical movement can be transmitted from surface buoy to underwater hydrophone this will lead to relative movement between the hydrophone and its surrounding seawater thus producing pressure fluctuations on the hydrophone surface and being sensed by the hydrophone chapman 2008 according to the literature of mceachern et al 1995 the flow noise can be generated even at a rather low stream velocity moreover the noise level of the generated flow noise is much greater than that of ambient noise under certain conditions which significantly reduces the signal to noise ratio snr of the sonobuoy holler 2014 willis et al 2013 therefore an investigation on the flow noise property of sonobuoy has great significance for signal processing which can improve the working performance of the sonobuoy when the free drifting hydrophones moves in the horizontal direction with water flow no relative displacement exists between the hydrophone s surface and surrounding water thus the hydrophones experience little signal contamination of flow noise generated from horizontal movement auvinen et al 2020 therefore this paper focuses on studying the flow noise of the sonobuoy caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the hydrophone in practice a suspension system is often considered to isolate the acoustic hydrophone from large vertical motions of the buoy at the ocean surface for the reduction in flow noise for example chapman 2008 applied a low pass mechanical filter comprising a bungee cord and a damper disk to isolate the acoustic sensor from the large vertical motion of the surface buoy huang et al 2018 found that by adding bungee cords with appropriate elastic coefficients can effectively suppress the vertical motions of the hydrophone thus reducing the flow noise of sonobuoy additionally guan et al 2020 also assessed a sonobuoy suspension system composed of bungee cord and damping disk in vertical motion suppression and proposed an established mathematical model considering its added mass and non constant drag coefficient however the above mentioned literature is devoted to investigate the reduction in vertical movement of sonobuoy to avoid the flow noise moreover it has been turned out to be beneficial for the acoustic array signal processing by analysis of the property of flow noise which can be another effective method for improving the working performance of the sonobuoy for example the authors huang et al 2020 studied the flow noise generated by a vertical line array during descent in deep water with spectrum analysis and the results showed that the energy of the flow noise is concentrated mainly in low frequencies and it increases and spreads toward high frequencies with increasing stream velocity auvinen et al 2020 evaluated the performance of a four element horizontal hydrophone array in a tidal channel in the bay of fundy with emphasis on spectral analysis spatial coherence of the recorded noise data gobat et al 1997 detailed efforts to study the relationships between flow noise and acceleration of the hydrophone by the analysis of experimental data on the basis of the advantages of the flow noise property analyses both the experiment and numerical calculations have been used to obtain the flow noise for their physical feature analysis in contrast to the experimental measurement numerical calculation allows to avoid interference from other noise signals the numerical studies of the flow noise were started with lighthill s acoustic analogy theory lighthill 1952 1954 soon afterwards the newly emerging equation of ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation williams et al 1969 was proposed from lighthill equation allowing for the prediction of the underwater flow noise for example in recent years kellett et al 2013 ozden et al 2016 and khalid et al 2019 have employed the computational fluid dynamics cfd based unsteady fluid field calculation approach coupled with the fw h equation for the noise prediction from the above mentioned numerical works it can be seen that there are fewer studies regarding using a hybrid cfd fw h equation method for sonobuoy flow noise prediction in particular the physical properties of the flow noise caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy were not well addressed the present work deals with the flow noise prediction of the hydrophone under time varying stream using the aforementioned hybrid computational method the simulated flow noise allows to be used for analyzing the properties of the flow noise caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy the combination of numerical calculation models and detailed experimental data will lead to derive a more general understanding on the interplay between the spectrum and time coherence of flow noise and the inflow velocity the paper is arranged as follows section ii introduces the theoretical methodology about flow noise numerical calculation and temporal coherence computation sections iii and iv present simulation and experimental analysis results of the flow noise and section v summarizes the conclusions 2 theoretical methodology 2 1 temporal coherence calculation method temporal coherence of a signal is defined by the auto correlation

case is studied and discussed 2 2 flow noise numerical calculation method flow noise predictions based on computational fluid dynamics cfd ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation technique should be investigated in two general steps the initial flow field calculations and the subsequent acoustic computations 2 2 1 flow field equations according to the law of mass conservation and momentum conservation the navier stokes ns equations of three dimensional incompressible viscous fluids li et al 2011 can be written as 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i x j μ u i x j u i u j where f i is an external force x i x j denotes the particle coordinates and it is the function on time t u i and u i are the average velocity and velocity fluctuation of the fluid separately i j 1 2 3 ρ is

u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j 5 μ t c μ k 2 ε where δ ij is the kronecker symbol μ t is the turbulent viscosity k and ε represent turbulent energy and dissipation rate respectively c μ is a constant in this study the renormalization group rng k ε two equation turbulent models were used to calculate the flow field tahmasebi et al 2020 the rng model has an additional term in its ε equation that significantly improves the accuracy of rapidly strained flows moreover the effect of swirl on turbulence is included in the rng model enhancing the accuracy for swirling flows the rng theory provides an analytical formula for turbulent prandtl number but not a constant this improvement achieves good results in the simulation accuracy and the range of application the rng k ε two equation turbulent

equation and the generalized lighthill equation lighthill 1952 1954 in acoustic analogy theory is used to calculate the noise field in this paper we use the fw h equation williams et al 1969 which is

models are adopted to obtain flow field data so the intensity and distribution characteristics of sound sources near the wall can be extracted then the sound field is solved by integral extrapolation of fw h equation only when the velocity reaches the subsonic speed it is necessary to consider the quadruple noise in general the noise sources of underwater vehicle considered are only the monopole

total pressure disturbance at receiver location 12 p x t p t x t p l x t in the above x t denotes the location and time of the receiver p t and p l represent the monopole and dipole noises respectively 2 3 validation of numerical simulation of flow noise the relative movement between hydrophones and seawater can be seen as the seawater flowing past the stationary hydrophone at a certain stream velocity in this subsection the simulated flow noise under a constant stream velocity and time varying stream velocity are given and the simulated results are verified by the experimental data or empirical formula the numerical calculation process of flow noise is as follows 2 3 1 domain and mesh setting the shape of the computational domain is cylinder topology and the hydrophone is put at the origin of the coordinates in the center of the domain the fore body shape of the hydrophone is hemispherical and the maximum diameter d h and length l h of the hydrophone are 0 038 m and 0 10 m respectively by using the d h and l h as the reference values the size of the computational domain is set to 4 5l h 4 5l h m 0 8d h m 0 8d h m π the computational model and unstructured grid of the geometry are created by commercial software ansys icem in this study the total number of the unstructured grid of the computational domain is 633600 which was meshed according to the dimensionless wall distances y 40 the computational domain and the automatic generated grid are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively 2 3 2 flow field and acoustic field calculation the flow noise is calculated with the commercial cfd code ansys fluent 15 0 in two steps at first the unsteady flow field is computed by solving the ns equations with the rng k ε turbulent model the front surface of the domain is set as the velocity inlet while the back surfaces of the domain is set as the velocity outlet the cylindrical plane of the calculation domain is set as the symmetry plane and the non slip wall condition is allocated to the hydrophone surface of the fluid domain then the fw h integration approach is used to calculate the sound field in this study the calculation time step is set as 0 001 s therefore the maximum frequency can be predicted is 500 hz the fluid density and the sound speed are set as 1024 kg m3 and 1500 m s respectively fig 2 a depicts the noise levels of flow noise obtained by simulation under a constant incoming stream velocity v 1 m s the simulation result has been verified by experimental data the measured noise data was obtained from a deep water experiment with a bottom moored vertical array in south china sea 2016 there is flow noise generated during the descent process of the array deployment the descent speed of the hydrophone can be computed from the recorded value of the depth sensor installed on the array the sampling frequency of the depth sensor is 1 hz fig 2b shows depth versus time during the descent of a hydrophone on the array where the designed depth of this hydrophone is 200 m it can be seen that the hydrophone first descended to a depth of 400 m then returned slowly to a depth of 200 m under buoyancy the noise data recorded from time a to time b was used to verify the simulation result the descent velocity of the hydrophone is about 1 m s during this period of time which can be calculated by the depth values as shown in fig 2b fig 3 a shows the noise levels of flow noise obtained by simulation under a time varying stream velocity which has been verified by a tank experiment data in this simulation case the incoming stream velocity is a square wave where the amplitude and period are 0 5 and 2 s respectively it is set as velocity magnitude of the velocity inlet boundary condition by user defined function udf the experiment data was measured by a simplified simulated sonobuoy with a continuous vertical lifting movement in an anechopic pool fig 3b shows the displacement time series of the hydrophone in the water of the pool from the fig 3b it can be seen that movement velocity of the hydrophone can be approximated as a square wave with amplitude and period are 0 5 and 2 s respectively fig 4 a depicts the schematic of experimental measurement of flow noise for the sonobuoy fig 4b shows the simplified sonobuoy used for the experiment from fig 4a it can be seen that the top of the sonobuoy is hoisted by a crane to periodically move up and down for simulating sinusoidal vertical movement of the sonobuoy caused by sea wave the comparison result between the noise levels of the flow noise shown in figs 2a and 3a indicate that the simulation data are in good agreement with the experiment values thus providing a firm basis for flow noise predictions moreover we can find that the flow noise is higher than the background noise which means that the flow noise can reduces the snr of the signal measured by hydrophone besides based on the lighthill equation lauchle 1977 derived the relationship between the noise power g and free stream velocity v by the method of di mensional analysis the relationship is given by 13 g f v 5 in this paper three sets of flow noise under time varying stream velocity were calculated as shown in fig 5 the three sets stream velocities are v 0 52cos πt v 0 98cos πt and v 1 53cos πt m s respectively from fig 5 we can found that the noise levels at a same frequency are proportional to the fifth power of stream velocities which is consistent with the conclusion presented by lauchle 3 simulation result the flow noise was calculated at four sets of time varying stream velocities v sin 4πt v sin 2πt v sin 1 33πt and v sin πt respectively the calculation process and other parameters used for numerical simulation are same as those mentioned above in section 2 2 3 1 spectrum analysis fig 6 depicts the spectrum analysis results of the simulated flow noise calculated at the four sets of time varying stream velocities fig 6a d show the four sets of stream velocity time series they are taken as the set velocity for the inflow surface with udf to simulate the flow noise which is caused by the vertical lifting movement of the hydrophone fig 6e h present the waveforms and spectrograms of the flow noise simulated under the four sets of stream velocity time series respectively it can be seen that the time domain waveform and frequency domain spectrum exhibit the same periodic changes as the incoming stream velocity respectively the comparison between the flow noise sound pressure or spectrogram and the stream velocity reveals that the energy of the flow noise is highly correlated with the stream velocity 3 2 temporal coherence analysis fig 7 shows the temporal coherence of the simulation flow noise computed by eq 1 here t equals to half cycle length of the incoming stream velocity the result reveals that the temporal coherence of the flow noise also shows a periodic change same as the incoming stream velocity 4 experiment the experimental verification was conducted in a large quiet anechoic pool using a simulated sonobuoy shown in fig 4b it has two working conditions for the crane on the top of the anechoic pool the lifting speed of the crane at working condition 2 is faster than the lifting speed of the crane at working condition 2 through the test before the experiment it can be known that the time required for the crane to raise or lower 1 m under working conditions 1 and 2 is 2 s and 1 5 s respectively in this experiment the top of the sonobuoy was hoisted by a crane to do periodical up and down movement according to the parameters shown in the table 1 respectively to simulate the external excitation acting on the surface buoy of the sonobuoy then two sets of measured flow noise of the hydrophone under the two periodic motions can be obtained 4 1 spectrum analysis fig 8 depicts displacement time series of the hydrophone and the corresponding flow noise measured by tank experiment fig 8a and b shows displacement time series of the hydrophone hoisted by the crane under periodic motions 1 and 2 respectively fig 8c and d shows time domain waveforms and spectrograms of the flow noise obtained by simplified sonobuoy under periodic motions 1 and 2 respectively the results indicate that the time domain waveforms and spectrograms also change with periods of 2 s and 1 5 s which is same with the period of hydrophone s motion this conclusion is in agreement with that of the simulated flow noise data shown in fig 6 4 2 temporal coherence analysis fig 9 depicts the temporal coherences of the measured flow noise calculated by eq 1 using the time length t of 1 s and 0 75 s respectively the result reveals that the temporal coherence of the flow noise exhibits a periodic change same as that of the hydrophone periodic motion the conclusion agrees with that of the simulated flow noise see fig 7 5 summary and conclusions the vertical displacement of the wave can be transmitted from the surface buoy of the sonobuoy to the underwater hydrophone the forced relative vertical movement between the hydrophone and surrounding seawater can produce flow noise the flow noise will be sensed by the hydrophone which can limit the working performance of the sonobuoy this thesis details effort to study the spectrum and temporal coherence properties of sonobuoy flow noise caused by the

20581,flow noise caused by sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy reduces the signal to noise ratio snr of the recorded signal therefore understanding the physical properties of the flow noise is important for improving the working performance of the sonobuoy the present work is dedicated to investigate the characteristics of the flow noise of sonobuoy generated from vertical motion based on the combination of numerical calculations and experimental results the flow noise of the hydrophone under time varying stream velocity is predicted using a hybrid computational fluid dynamics cfd ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation technique the flow noise calculated with the hybrid computational method is in good agreement with that analyzed by the experimental measurement and empirical formula the numerical calculation results of the flow noise under time varying stream velocity condition reveal that the spectrum and temporal coherence of the flow noise exhibit the periodic changes same as that of the stream velocity these analyses and conclusions are verified by experimental data the study in this paper will contribute to signal processing of the sonobuoy and thus improving snr of the measure signal keywords flow noise sonobuoy spectrum time coherence vertical motion 1 introduction as one of the underwater acoustic measurement devices sonobuoy is of great importance for underwater target localization and ambient noise recording barlow et al 2018 tollefsen et al 2014 tan et al 2011 however the flow noise resulting from the vertical motion of the sonobuoy limits the working performance of sonobuoy this is because the surface buoy of the sonobuoy will float up and down with the sea waves and this vertical movement can be transmitted from surface buoy to underwater hydrophone this will lead to relative movement between the hydrophone and its surrounding seawater thus producing pressure fluctuations on the hydrophone surface and being sensed by the hydrophone chapman 2008 according to the literature of mceachern et al 1995 the flow noise can be generated even at a rather low stream velocity moreover the noise level of the generated flow noise is much greater than that of ambient noise under certain conditions which significantly reduces the signal to noise ratio snr of the sonobuoy holler 2014 willis et al 2013 therefore an investigation on the flow noise property of sonobuoy has great significance for signal processing which can improve the working performance of the sonobuoy when the free drifting hydrophones moves in the horizontal direction with water flow no relative displacement exists between the hydrophone s surface and surrounding water thus the hydrophones experience little signal contamination of flow noise generated from horizontal movement auvinen et al 2020 therefore this paper focuses on studying the flow noise of the sonobuoy caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the hydrophone in practice a suspension system is often considered to isolate the acoustic hydrophone from large vertical motions of the buoy at the ocean surface for the reduction in flow noise for example chapman 2008 applied a low pass mechanical filter comprising a bungee cord and a damper disk to isolate the acoustic sensor from the large vertical motion of the surface buoy huang et al 2018 found that by adding bungee cords with appropriate elastic coefficients can effectively suppress the vertical motions of the hydrophone thus reducing the flow noise of sonobuoy additionally guan et al 2020 also assessed a sonobuoy suspension system composed of bungee cord and damping disk in vertical motion suppression and proposed an established mathematical model considering its added mass and non constant drag coefficient however the above mentioned literature is devoted to investigate the reduction in vertical movement of sonobuoy to avoid the flow noise moreover it has been turned out to be beneficial for the acoustic array signal processing by analysis of the property of flow noise which can be another effective method for improving the working performance of the sonobuoy for example the authors huang et al 2020 studied the flow noise generated by a vertical line array during descent in deep water with spectrum analysis and the results showed that the energy of the flow noise is concentrated mainly in low frequencies and it increases and spreads toward high frequencies with increasing stream velocity auvinen et al 2020 evaluated the performance of a four element horizontal hydrophone array in a tidal channel in the bay of fundy with emphasis on spectral analysis spatial coherence of the recorded noise data gobat et al 1997 detailed efforts to study the relationships between flow noise and acceleration of the hydrophone by the analysis of experimental data on the basis of the advantages of the flow noise property analyses both the experiment and numerical calculations have been used to obtain the flow noise for their physical feature analysis in contrast to the experimental measurement numerical calculation allows to avoid interference from other noise signals the numerical studies of the flow noise were started with lighthill s acoustic analogy theory lighthill 1952 1954 soon afterwards the newly emerging equation of ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation williams et al 1969 was proposed from lighthill equation allowing for the prediction of the underwater flow noise for example in recent years kellett et al 2013 ozden et al 2016 and khalid et al 2019 have employed the computational fluid dynamics cfd based unsteady fluid field calculation approach coupled with the fw h equation for the noise prediction from the above mentioned numerical works it can be seen that there are fewer studies regarding using a hybrid cfd fw h equation method for sonobuoy flow noise prediction in particular the physical properties of the flow noise caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy were not well addressed the present work deals with the flow noise prediction of the hydrophone under time varying stream using the aforementioned hybrid computational method the simulated flow noise allows to be used for analyzing the properties of the flow noise caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy the combination of numerical calculation models and detailed experimental data will lead to derive a more general understanding on the interplay between the spectrum and time coherence of flow noise and the inflow velocity the paper is arranged as follows section ii introduces the theoretical methodology about flow noise numerical calculation and temporal coherence computation sections iii and iv present simulation and experimental analysis results of the flow noise and section v summarizes the conclusions 2 theoretical methodology 2 1 temporal coherence calculation method temporal coherence of a signal is defined by the auto correlation

conjugate the ensemble average is usually done over time t using the ergodic theorem temporal coherence can be measured by using either narrow band or broadband signals in this paper a narrow band case is studied and discussed 2 2 flow noise numerical calculation method flow noise predictions based on computational fluid dynamics cfd ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation technique should be investigated in two general steps the initial flow field calculations and the subsequent acoustic computations 2 2 1 flow field equations according to the law of mass conservation and momentum conservation the navier stokes ns equations of three dimensional incompressible viscous fluids li et al 2011 can be written as 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i x j μ u i x j u i u j where f i is an external force x i x j denotes the particle coordinates and it is the function on time t u i and u i are the average velocity and velocity fluctuation of the fluid separately i j 1 2 3 ρ is

u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j 5 μ t c μ k 2 ε where δ ij is the kronecker symbol μ t is the turbulent viscosity k and ε represent turbulent energy and dissipation rate respectively c μ is a constant in this study the renormalization group rng k ε two equation turbulent models were used to calculate the flow field tahmasebi et al 2020 the rng model has an additional term in its ε equation that significantly improves the accuracy of rapidly strained flows moreover the effect of swirl on turbulence is included in the rng model enhancing the accuracy for swirling flows the rng theory provides an analytical formula for turbulent prandtl number but not a constant this improvement achieves good results in the simulation accuracy and the range of application the rng k ε two equation turbulent

production rate of turbulent kinetic energy and σ k σ ε c 1ε and c 2ε are constants of the model 2 2 2 acoustic field equations the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is derived from the navier stokes equation and the generalized lighthill equation lighthill 1952 1954 in acoustic analogy theory is used to calculate the noise field in this paper we use the fw h equation williams et al 1969 which is developed from the lighthill s equation to simulated the flow noise 9 1 a 0 2 2 p t 2 2 p 2 x i x j t i j h f x i p i j n j ρ u i u n v n δ f t ρ 0 v n ρ u n v n δ f in which p is the sound pressure

models are adopted to obtain flow field data so the intensity and distribution characteristics of sound sources near the wall can be extracted then the sound field is solved by integral extrapolation of fw h equation only when the velocity reaches the subsonic speed it is necessary to consider the quadruple noise in general the noise sources of underwater vehicle considered are only the monopole and dipole noises farassat et al 1998 proposed a solution for the fw h equation which retains only monopole and dipole noises it can be expressed as a summation of two different terms yielding the total pressure disturbance at receiver location 12 p x t p t x t p l x t in the above x t denotes the location and time of the receiver p t and p l represent the monopole and dipole noises respectively 2 3 validation of numerical simulation of flow noise the relative movement between hydrophones and seawater can be seen as the seawater flowing past the stationary hydrophone at a certain stream velocity in this subsection the simulated flow noise under a constant stream velocity and time varying stream velocity are given and the simulated results are verified by the experimental data or empirical formula the numerical calculation process of flow noise is as follows 2 3 1 domain and mesh setting the shape of the computational domain is cylinder topology and the hydrophone is put at the origin of the coordinates in the center of the domain the fore body shape of the hydrophone is hemispherical and the maximum diameter d h and length l h of the hydrophone are 0 038 m and 0 10 m respectively by using the d h and l h as the reference values the size of the computational domain is set to 4 5l h 4 5l h m 0 8d h m 0 8d h m π the computational model and unstructured grid of the geometry are created by commercial software ansys icem in this study the total number of the unstructured grid of the computational domain is 633600 which was meshed according to the dimensionless wall distances y 40 the computational domain and the automatic generated grid are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively 2 3 2 flow field and acoustic field calculation the flow noise is calculated with the commercial cfd code ansys fluent 15 0 in two steps at first the unsteady flow field is computed by solving the ns equations with the rng k ε turbulent model the front surface of the domain is set as the velocity inlet while the back surfaces of the domain is set as the velocity outlet the cylindrical plane of the calculation domain is set as the symmetry plane and the non slip wall condition is allocated to the hydrophone surface of the fluid domain then the fw h integration approach is used to calculate the sound field in this study the calculation time step is set as 0 001 s therefore the maximum frequency can be predicted is 500 hz the fluid density and the sound speed are set as 1024 kg m3 and 1500 m s respectively fig 2 a depicts the noise levels of flow noise obtained by simulation under a constant incoming stream velocity v 1 m s the simulation result has been verified by experimental data the measured noise data was obtained from a deep water experiment with a bottom moored vertical array in south china sea 2016 there is flow noise generated during the descent process of the array deployment the descent speed of the hydrophone can be computed from the recorded value of the depth sensor installed on the array the sampling frequency of the depth sensor is 1 hz fig 2b shows depth versus time during the descent of a hydrophone on the array where the designed depth of this hydrophone is 200 m it can be seen that the hydrophone first descended to a depth of 400 m then returned slowly to a depth of 200 m under buoyancy the noise data recorded from time a to time b was used to verify the simulation result the descent velocity of the hydrophone is about 1 m s during this period of time which can be calculated by the depth values as shown in fig 2b fig 3 a shows the noise levels of flow noise obtained by simulation under a time varying stream velocity which has been verified by a tank experiment data in this simulation case the incoming stream velocity is a square wave where the amplitude and period are 0 5 and 2 s respectively it is set as velocity magnitude of the velocity inlet boundary condition by user defined function udf the experiment data was measured by a simplified simulated sonobuoy with a continuous vertical lifting movement in an anechopic pool fig 3b shows the displacement time series of the hydrophone in the water of the pool from the fig 3b it can be seen that movement velocity of the hydrophone can be approximated as a square wave with amplitude and period are 0 5 and 2 s respectively fig 4 a depicts the schematic of experimental measurement of flow noise for the sonobuoy fig 4b shows the simplified sonobuoy used for the experiment from fig 4a it can be seen that the top of the sonobuoy is hoisted by a crane to periodically move up and down for simulating sinusoidal vertical movement of the sonobuoy caused by sea wave the comparison result between the noise levels of the flow noise shown in figs 2a and 3a indicate that the simulation data are in good agreement with the experiment values thus providing a firm basis for flow noise predictions moreover we can find that the flow noise is higher than the background noise which means that the flow noise can reduces the snr of the signal measured by hydrophone besides based on the lighthill equation lauchle 1977 derived the relationship between the noise power g and free stream velocity v by the method of di mensional analysis the relationship is given by 13 g f v 5 in this paper three sets of flow noise under time varying stream velocity were calculated as shown in fig 5 the three sets stream velocities are v 0 52cos πt v 0 98cos πt and v 1 53cos πt m s respectively from fig 5 we can found that the noise levels at a same frequency are proportional to the fifth power of stream velocities which is consistent with the conclusion presented by lauchle 3 simulation result the flow noise was calculated at four sets of time varying stream velocities v sin 4πt v sin 2πt v sin 1 33πt and v sin πt respectively the calculation process and other parameters used for numerical simulation are same as those mentioned above in section 2 2 3 1 spectrum analysis fig 6 depicts the spectrum analysis results of the simulated flow noise calculated at the four sets of time varying stream velocities fig 6a d show the four sets of stream velocity time series they are taken as the set velocity for the inflow surface with udf to simulate the flow noise which is caused by the vertical lifting movement of the hydrophone fig 6e h present the waveforms and spectrograms of the flow noise simulated under the four sets of stream velocity time series respectively it can be seen that the time domain waveform and frequency domain spectrum exhibit the same periodic changes as the incoming stream velocity respectively the comparison between the flow noise sound pressure or spectrogram and the stream velocity reveals that the energy of the flow noise is highly correlated with the stream velocity 3 2 temporal coherence analysis fig 7 shows the temporal coherence of the simulation flow noise computed by eq 1 here t equals to half cycle length of the incoming stream velocity the result reveals that the temporal coherence of the flow noise also shows a periodic change same as the incoming stream velocity 4 experiment the experimental verification was conducted in a large quiet anechoic pool using a simulated sonobuoy shown in fig 4b it has two working conditions for the crane on the top of the anechoic pool the lifting speed of the crane at working condition 2 is faster than the lifting speed of the crane at working condition 2 through the test before the experiment it can be known that the time required for the crane to raise or lower 1 m under working conditions 1 and 2 is 2 s and 1 5 s respectively in this experiment the top of the sonobuoy was hoisted by a crane to do periodical up and down movement according to the parameters shown in the table 1 respectively to simulate the external excitation acting on the surface buoy of the sonobuoy then two sets of measured flow noise of the hydrophone under the two periodic motions can be obtained 4 1 spectrum analysis fig 8 depicts displacement time series of the hydrophone and the corresponding flow noise measured by tank experiment fig 8a and b shows displacement time series of the hydrophone hoisted by the crane under periodic motions 1 and 2 respectively fig 8c and d shows time domain waveforms and spectrograms of the flow noise obtained by simplified sonobuoy under periodic motions 1 and 2 respectively the results indicate that the time domain waveforms and spectrograms also change with periods of 2 s and 1 5 s which is same with the period of hydrophone s motion this conclusion is in agreement with that of the simulated flow noise data shown in fig 6 4 2 temporal coherence analysis fig 9 depicts the temporal coherences of the measured flow noise calculated by eq 1 using the time length t of 1 s and 0 75 s respectively the result reveals that the temporal coherence of the flow noise exhibits a periodic change same as that of the hydrophone periodic motion the conclusion agrees with that of the simulated flow noise see fig 7 5 summary and conclusions the vertical displacement of the wave can be transmitted from the surface buoy of the sonobuoy to the underwater hydrophone the forced relative vertical movement between the hydrophone and surrounding seawater can produce flow noise the flow noise will be sensed by the hydrophone which can limit the working performance of the sonobuoy this thesis details effort to study the spectrum and temporal coherence properties of sonobuoy flow noise caused by the sinusoidal vertical motion of the sonobuoy by combining the analysis of the results from numerical calculation models with experimental data the flow noise of the hydrophone under time varying stream velocity was predicted using a hybrid computational fluid dynamics cfd ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation technique the hybrid computational method used for predicting the flow noise has been verified by the experimental data or empirical formula the simulated flow results reveal that the spectrum and temporal coherence of the flow noise exhibits a periodic change same as that of the stream velocity these analysis conclusions are verified by experiment data the study in this paper will be beneficial for signal processing of a sonobuoy to improve snr of the recorded signal credit

20582,analyzing the attenuation of extreme waves by coastal emergent vegetation provides crucial information on revetment planning in this study three kinds of laboratory experiments of wave attenuation by rigid vegetation are performed transmission coefficient k t was used to characterize the effect of wave attenuation the influence of dimensionless factors including relative wave height h h relative width b l relative height h v h and solid volume fraction ϕ on the k t under the action of solitary wave was explored by genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns and multivariate non linear regression mnlr prediction formulae r 2 is up to 0 95 of the k t in different models were established by gp method and the sensitivity of each dimensionless factor was analyzed by statistical analysis anns were used to compare the weight of each factor the power function relationships between k t and factors was obtained by mnlr the results show that gp can qualitatively acquire the sensitivity of parameters and is suitable for the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation wave disspation model providing a more efficient and accurate prediction method the results can provide guidelines for vegetation planting as well as the scientific basis for vegetation revetment engineering keywords emergent vegetation wave attenuation transmission coefficient genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns 1 introduction tsunamis as highly destructive waves can cause serious damage to coastal areas chen et al 2013 emergent vegetation in coastal wetlands is an important components of coastal ecosystems the intertidal aquatic plants represented by mangroves can effectively reduce wave energy and the resistance of their roots trunks and canopy to wave makes them an effective and novel ecological wave attenuation measure augustin et al 2009 huang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 therefore optimizing the cultivation of coastal vegetation and predicting the wave height after vegetation is of significant importance wave attenuation by emergent vegetation which is mainly affected by the hydrodynamic parameters and the vegetation characteristics can be calculated by semi empirical or empirical methods however the interaction between variables and the complex nonlinear relationship has impeded the accurate wave attenuation prediction generally the performance of wave attenuation by vegetation is characterized by drag coefficient c d e g thuy et al 2012 and wave transmission coefficient k t e g arnaud et al 2017 c d is a function of the vegetation configurations reynolds number and other wave factors which can be calculated by drag force and velocity according to the morison equation once c d is obtained the wave attenuation height can be calculated by using a wave elimination model such as dalrymple et al 1984 or kobayashi et al 1993 however measuring the water particle velocity beside vegetation is indefinable and fallible because of the difference in depth and the location of the measuring point furthermore the attenuation law used by different models is discrepant due to the simplification of the model in addition k t ignores the variation of wave height in the vegetation field and that can be directly determined according to the ratio of the transmitted wave to incident wave therefore k t is more suitable to establish the prediction formula in the case of no drag force and water particle velocity so far scholars have done extensive research works on the influencing factors of wave attenuation and have accumulated a large number of high quality multi element and multi scale data hashim and catherine 2013 liu et al 2015 hoque et al 2018 the common approach to derive empirical equation is through multivariate non linear regression mnlr türker et al 2006 derived an empirical relation that defines the amount of erosion under the protection of emergent vegetation chen et al 2016 obtained a formula for predicting the k t of a surface vegetated platform based on numerical experiments and laboratory data he et al 2019 proposed an empirical equation by using mnlr on the basis of experimental data for predicting wave attenuation by the stem root and canopy of vegetation however the complex plant structure composed of roots and leaves and multiple data structures results in poor performance of wave attenuation prediction using mnlr methods genetic programming gp and artificial neural networks anns are robust simple and universal and have a strong ability to solve complex nonlinear problems abbaspour et al 2013 used gp and anns as alternative tools to characterize hydraulic jumps furthermore gp and anns have been successfully applied for the prediction of wave induced scour depth around breakwaters pourzangbar et al 2017 flow resistance caused by flexible vegetation babovic and keijzer 2000 and channel chèzy resistance coefficient giustolisi 2004 these aforementioned works showed that gp and anns could obtain more concise and accurate relationships and these approaches have not been implemented for the prediction of the k t therefore solitary wave attenuation tests by three kinds of artificial vegetation models were carried out in wave flume one of the aims of this study is to predict the wave attenuation using a more accurate empirical equation of k t and we used gp and anns as the intelligent method to contrast with classical mnlr methods another aim of this study is to understand the main influencing factors of emergent vegetation over wave attenuation however it is noted that unlike gp and mnlr anns cannot obtain explicit functional relationships experimental data of different types of plant models cannot be unified at present hence each vegetation model has a corresponding k t prediction formula and result this paper is organized as follows section 2 shows the overview of k t governing parameters and the modeling approach the detailed experimental setup and pre processing of experimental data are reported in section 3 the results of prediction and discussions are given in section 4 and the sensitivity analysis is presented in section 5 the main conclusions of this study are drawn in section 6 2 scour governing variables and soft computing approaches 2 1 transmission coefficient in the wave flume the wave with the incident wave height of h i propagates through the vegetation zone and its wave energy can be divided into three parts one part of the energy propagates through the plant in the form of transmitted wave h t the other part of the energy is blocked by the vegetation and forms the reflected wave the remaining energy is dissipated due to turbulence and frictional heat generated by the interaction between waves and vegetation zones and boundaries 1 k t h t h i solitary wave attenuation in the flume by vegetation depends on two classes of parameters the wave characteristics e g water depth h and wave height h and the vegetation configuration e g vegetation height h v vegetation field length b and distribution density several laboratory measurements are available that provide conducive information about the governing parameters of wave mitigation by vegetation he et al 2019 studied the performance of the stem root and canopy on regular wave attenuation by vegetation and a total of 112 experiments were conducted to test seven vegetation models five wave heights four vegetation densities and four water depths the coefficient of determination r 2 between the k t and dimensionless parameters is 0 822 a general function expression representing k t is given by 2 k t f h h i l h v b ϕ the wave length of a laboratory scale solitary wave can be calculated by huang and yuan 2010 3 l 4 π h 3 3 h i the solid volume fraction can be calculated by the following formula 4 ϕ v s v where v s is the volume of water v is the volume of a vegetated area at still water the parameters of eq 2 were expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters using buckingham s π theorem the dimensionless change of the influencing factors in the relationship can be obtained as follows 5 k t f h h b l h v h ϕ for brevity r h is equal to h h r b is equal to b l α is equal to h v h 6 k t f r h r b α ϕ to sum up the selection of dimensionless parameters was generally considered from four aspects first of all the influence of hydrodynamic factors was considered by relative wave heights h h in solitary waves secondly the interaction of waves and vegetation from the horizontal was analyzed by relative width b l thirdly the interaction of waves and vegetation from the vertical was synthesized by the relative height h v h last the influence of vegetation structure such as plant arrangement and radius was synthesized by the solid volume fraction v s v however considering that under the same distribution density the arrangement of vegetation has little effect on the wave attenuation iimura and tanaka 2012 irtem et al 2009 thuy et al 2009 and the influence of arrangement is not considered separately 2 2 elements of gp gp is an adaptive global optimization search algorithm and its search process is a random search algorithm in essence but the genetic operation in the evolution process can make the path jump to different subspaces randomly which makes its spatial ergodicity better than the traditional heuristic search gp compared with the traditional nonlinear fitting can be more effectively understood the law of the data contained within do not need to assume the potential relationship between the function of the form the hidden relationship and generate automatically reveal data set a functional relation between the dependent variable and independent variables due to the structural characteristics of gp in the representation of candidate solutions and the global nature of the search and optimization mechanism the subjective factors in the model structure design of artificial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks are greatly reduced therefore the genetic programming method was used to obtain the formula for calculating the wave attenuation effect of plants and the sensitivity analysis was carried out gp analysis for k t forecasting process by software eureqa 1 24 0 can be broken down into the following steps step 1 data

simultaneous step 2 data preparation the difference in figure of variables is minor and standardization can be decided according to the prompts of the software step 3 search definition editing the formula to target expression and selecting the appropriate mathematical building blocks i e arithmetic trigonometric exponential in general we need to select as many operators as possible to get a more comprehensive expression but this may lead to subjective overlearning the mathematical building blocks are selected based on the formula of he et al 2019 in this paper the default setting can minimize the mean absolute error mae and it performs well in most cases which is proved by the results obtained by default eureqa will randomly shuffle the data and then split it into training and validation data sets based on the total size of the data the training set was used to generate and optimize solutions and the validation set was used to test how well those models generalize to new

information processing based on the main functions of the human brain such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples and usually do not need to write any task specific rules given the sufficient complexity of training networks neural networks can represent arbitrary nonlinear functions the network is composed of many interconnected nodes neurons they are arranged into three basic

limitations of laboratory site and equipment conditions 1 20 scale pvc pipes models were used to simulate rigid plants with the simulated actual trunk diameter of 0 2 m in this test the rigidity of the pvc pipe is similar to that of the mangrove trunk and the elastic modulus e is 2900 3000 mpa moreover the thickness of the simple pvc plastic pipe is uniform the diameter of the pipe is 1 0 cm and the height is 50 0 cm see fig 3 a the distribution patterns of mangrove forests are related to the topography and landform to reflect the influence of solid various volume fractions 10 model layouts

cylinders the red dots donate as cylinders in the figure the bottom plate consists of holes with a spacing of 0 025 m 3 2 2 vm ⅱ part of this experimental study has been published in he et al 2019 in consideration of complex geometric factors such as the number and diameter of mangrove roots a generalized model was made for the root the geometric scale used in the model is 1 10 the rigid plastic ball frame was used to simulate the root of plants and its elastic modulus is 2 0 5 gpa the plastic ball frame was composed of one size which could represent the complexity of the mangrove root the rhizophora stem diameter ranges from 9 6 cm to 10 4 cm the trunk was assumed to be rigid without bending or breaking a cylinder with a diameter of 1 0 cm was used to simulate the trunk of the mangrove model the elastic modulus of the pvc cylinder is 35 3 3 9 gpa and no deformation occurs under the action of solitary waves the crown has many branches and broad leaves so polyethylene material with certain flexibility was used to simulate the crown of the mangrove the elastic modulus of polyethylene is 1 2 0 1 gpa the diameter of the canopy is 10 0 cm and the height of the crown is 20 0 cm three kinds of model layouts were adopted in this experiment to investigate the influence of various solid volume fractions the plant distribution modes are shown in fig 5 the trunk root and canopy are represented by red dots brown circles and green circles respectively a base plate with 1 5 m long 0 48 m wide and 0 01 m high is used to fix the artificial tree and the bottom plate consists of holes

is 15 9 13 5 gpa and the geometric scale of the model is 1 10 the root adopts multiple plexiglass tubes with an outer diameter of 0 6 cm and a height of 10 0 cm while the trunk adopts a single plexiglass tube with an outer diameter of 1 0 cm and a height of 15 0 cm a number of plexiglass tubes with a diameter of 6 0 mm and a length of 25 0 cm were used to simulate the plant crown each plant

center spacing of adjacent individual plants was 12 3 cm fig 6 3 3 data pre processing poor quality data leads to poor quality mining results and the difference of the order of magnitude will lead to the dominant position of the larger magnitude attribute and slow down the convergence speed of iteration however eureqa and spss both depend on the sample distance is sensitive to the order of magnitude of the data while each factor usually has a different order of magnitude and dimensional order of magnitude therefore decide whether to normalize the scale and offset of the dimensionless data according to the prompts of the eureqa dimensionless data processing mainly solves the comparability of the data the index values are all at the same quantity level which can be used for comprehensive evaluation and analysis table 3 summarizes the main parameters of the three experimental databases the range of transmission coefficient is shown in fig 7 there were no outliers in the boxplot and the median of vm ⅰ vm ⅱ and vm ⅲ is 0 700 0 810 and 0 726 respectively the arithmetic mean values of vm ⅰ vm ⅱ and vm ⅲ are 0 696 0 789 0 722 respectively 4 results and verification of the new formula 4 1 results of vm ⅰ a total number of 150 datasets of vm ⅰ have been used for the prediction of the transmission coefficient using the gp anns and mnlr models the transmission coefficient k t as the dependent variable and the relative wave height r h relative width r b relative height α and solid volume fraction ϕ as the independent variables the steps in exploiting a model with gp and anns are discussed in section 2 table 4 shows the solution equations at different sizes by using the gp method and the solution equations under different fit are obtained gp method has strong randomness the results of each size are different and with a the increase of operation time the equation with higher fitting degree appears constantly the equations size greater than 24 was omitted although the greater the size the optimal fit of the equation is higher however the proposed equations are not in good agreement with both the engineering sense and the existing knowledge of wave attenuation to explore the prediction effect between mnlr gp and anns the comparison of the measured predicted transmission coefficient k t using the scattered diagram for the dataset of vm ⅰ is shown in fig 8 the power exponential function as shown in eq 7 was obtained by using the mnlr method which is the same process as presented in he et al 2019 7 k t 0 475 h h 0 086 b l 0 024 h v h 0 274 ϕ 0 228 the four dimensionless parameters in the experiment were substituted into the gp results the solution equation with a size of 24 in table 4 and the mnlr results eq 7 as indicated in this figure the coefficients of determination r 2 of mnlr gp and anns are 0 75 0 95 and 0 75 respectively the empirical formula gives a better prediction for the approach of gp than others 4 2 results of vm ⅱ a total number of 36 vm ⅱ datasets have been used for the prediction of the transmission coefficient k t using the gp anns and mnlr models to assess the capabilities of mnlr gp and anns in wave attenuation prediction k t is set to be the dependent variable relative wave height r h relative width r b relative height α and volume fraction ϕ are set as the independent variables the result of mnlr method as shown in eq 8 8 k t 11 582 r h 3 169 r b 4 592 α 4 487 ϕ 1 311 0 932 similarly the solution equation of gp method as shown in eq 9 9 k t 0 971 29 6 ϕ 603 r h ϕ 512 r b α ϕ 121 e 3 r b ϕ 748 r h r b ϕ fig 9 a illustrates the relationship between the measured and predicted transmission coefficient of the mnlr result and its determination coefficient r 2 is 0 75 some data points deviate far from the fitting line which indicates that the formula obtained by the mnlr has a poor fitting degree to the measured value the relationship between the measured value and the predicted value of the gp results is shown in fig 9b and its r 2 is 0 95 in contrast to fig 9a there is no major deviation between the data points and the fitting line it shows that the gp method offers more accurate prediction in wave attenuation compared to the mnlr and anns methods 4 3 results of vm ⅲ a total number of 128 vm ⅲ datasets have been used for the prediction of the transmission coefficient using the gp anns and mnlr models the solution equation of mnlr and gp method as shown in eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 k t 0 228 r h 0 137 r b 0 105 α 0 112 ϕ 0 215 11 k t 0 985 1 23 r h 2 0 86 r h 17 3 r h ϕ 63 4 ϕ 2 as indicated in fig 10 the coefficients of determination of the three methods are similar the r 2 of gp and anns methods are slightly higher than that of mnlr prediction 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 gp results it can be seen from table 4 that the dimensionless factors may or may not appear in an optimal formula of a certain size and they may occur once or more among them the solid volume fraction ϕ appears most frequently the relative width r b and the relative height α of the model appeared less frequently and the relative wave height r h appeared least frequently the performance of a dimensionless factor in the gp results is measured by the number of times that a factor appears in all the optimal equations and the number of the optimal equations in which the factor appears the performance of the factors in table 4 is intuitively displayed in fig 11 there is randomness in the results obtained by gp every time the fitting results of the optimal equation exist dimensionless factors changed in the equation in order to avoid the error caused by the randomness of the single operation 10 operations were carried out as indicated in fig 12 the frequency of occurrence of different dimensionless parameters obtained through 10 times of fitting is roughly the same according to fig 13 there is a significant difference in the occurrence of each factor among which ϕ appears the most in the 10 fitting results followed by α r b and r h the fitting results show that there is a close relationship between ϕ and the k t and the ϕ has the greatest influence on the wave attenuation effect by vegetation similarly the same procedure is used to calculate the data of vm ⅱ and vm ⅲ furthermore the frequency of the dimensionless parameters appearing in 10 operations was counted fig 14 a shows that there is a close relationship between the ϕ and k t of vm ⅱ however k t is more sensitive to r h of vm ⅲ shown in fig 14b 5 2 anns results spss statistical analysis tool was used to analyze the experimental data the analysis results are shown in table 5 5 3 comparison between gp and anns methods generally speaking the sensitivity analysis results see table 6 of gp and anns are similar and gp performs well in the sensitivity analysis as for the two methods of gp and anns different results appear it is probably due to the fact that the results of gp are randomly generated leading to slight inconsistency in the optimal equation table of each fitting it can be seen from table 6 that the influence of dimensionless factors of different plant models on the transmission coefficient is not consistent the sensitivity analysis of the gp and the anns shows that the solid volume fraction has a dominant effect on the wave attenuation and the influence of the relative width the relative height and the relative wave height of the model are similar but the influence of the relative wave height is relatively minor vm ⅰ ignored the influence of crown and root and had no density change in the vertical direction this model can be used to characterize rigid plants with unprotruding surface roots large and unbending trunk such as the black pine forest suwa 2013 the planting density of such kind of plant can be improved to achieve a better wave reduction effect for the vm ⅱ model considering the effect of root stem and canopy the effect of solid volume fraction on the wave attenuation of plants is dominant compared with vm ⅰ it can be found that the order of relative height is improved because vm ⅱ takes the influence of plant canopy and root into account and the change of water depth will lead to different plant parts being submerged under wave motion it is similar to the normal mangrove with dense branches and well developed roots when planting this kind of vegetation if it is used to protect the safety of coastal people etc during tsunamis the planting density can be improved to achieve a better wave reduction effect if it is mainly used to resist wind wave and promote sediment deposition the vegetation of different ages and heights can be planted appropriately to achieve a better wave reduction effect in vm ⅲ the effect of relative wave height on wave attenuation was dominant compared with vm ⅱ considering the effect of rhizome and leaves it can be found that the influence factors of relative model width are improved tang et al 2019 pointed out that coastal vegetation could significantly reduce wave height and wave run up and wave run up would decrease monotonously with the increase of vegetation width the model was considered to be similar to the coastal mangroves with dense foliage but relatively hard wood respiration roots or strut roots protruding upward such as sonneratia and avicennia marina similarly when planting this kind of plant it can be properly planted with greater range density to attenuate waves 6 conclusions the experiments studied three non flooded rigid plant models and the influence of the relative wave height relative width relative height and solid volume fraction on the transmission coefficient was considered using multivariate non linear regression genetic programming and artificial neural networks to perform formula fitting and weight analysis of each factor and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the formulas of transmission coefficient and relative wave height relative width relative height and solid volume fraction of three kinds of vegetation were established the inner relationship between the transmission coefficient of flora and the factors in the solitary wave was revealed 2 genetic programming method is useful in understanding and establishing new formulas being capable of analyzing and predicting data effectively and provide new ideas and methods in solving complex problems related to wave dissipation by vegetation 3 the effects of dimensionless factors on the transmission coefficient of different vegetation models are inconsistent it was found that increasing the solid volume fraction can attenuate the wave height more effectively compared to the relative width and relative height credit authorship contribution statement shangpeng

20582,analyzing the attenuation of extreme waves by coastal emergent vegetation provides crucial information on revetment planning in this study three kinds of laboratory experiments of wave attenuation by rigid vegetation are performed transmission coefficient k t was used to characterize the effect of wave attenuation the influence of dimensionless factors including relative wave height h h relative width b l relative height h v h and solid volume fraction ϕ on the k t under the action of solitary wave was explored by genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns and multivariate non linear regression mnlr prediction formulae r 2 is up to 0 95 of the k t in different models were established by gp method and the sensitivity of each dimensionless factor was analyzed by statistical analysis anns were used to compare the weight of each factor the power function relationships between k t and factors was obtained by mnlr the results show that gp can qualitatively acquire the sensitivity of parameters and is suitable for the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation wave disspation model providing a more efficient and accurate prediction method the results can provide guidelines for vegetation planting as well as the scientific basis for vegetation revetment engineering keywords emergent vegetation wave attenuation transmission coefficient genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns 1 introduction tsunamis as highly destructive waves can cause serious damage to coastal areas chen et al 2013 emergent vegetation in coastal wetlands is an important components of coastal ecosystems the intertidal aquatic plants represented by mangroves can effectively reduce wave energy and the resistance of their roots trunks and canopy to wave makes them an effective and novel ecological wave attenuation measure augustin et al 2009 huang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 therefore optimizing the cultivation of coastal vegetation and predicting the wave height after vegetation is of significant importance wave attenuation by emergent vegetation which is mainly affected by the hydrodynamic parameters and the vegetation characteristics can be calculated by semi empirical or empirical methods however the interaction between variables and the complex nonlinear relationship has impeded the accurate wave attenuation prediction generally the performance of wave attenuation by vegetation is characterized by drag coefficient c d e g thuy et al 2012 and wave transmission coefficient k t e g arnaud et al 2017 c d is a function of the vegetation configurations reynolds number and other wave factors which can be calculated by drag force and velocity according to the morison equation once c d is obtained the wave attenuation height can be calculated by using a wave elimination model such as dalrymple et al 1984 or kobayashi et al 1993 however measuring the water particle velocity beside vegetation is indefinable and fallible because of the difference in depth and the location of the measuring point furthermore the attenuation law used by different models is discrepant due to the simplification of the model in addition k t ignores the variation of wave height in the vegetation field and that can be directly determined according to the ratio of the transmitted wave to incident wave therefore k t is more suitable to establish the prediction formula in the case of no drag force and water particle velocity so far scholars have done extensive research works on the influencing factors of wave attenuation and have accumulated a large number of high quality multi element and multi scale data hashim and catherine 2013 liu et al 2015 hoque et al 2018 the common approach to derive empirical equation is through multivariate non linear regression mnlr türker et al 2006 derived an empirical relation that defines the amount of erosion under the protection of emergent vegetation chen et al 2016 obtained a formula for predicting the k t of a surface vegetated platform based on numerical experiments and laboratory data he et al 2019 proposed an empirical equation by using mnlr on the basis of experimental data for predicting wave attenuation by the stem root and canopy of vegetation however the complex plant structure composed of roots and leaves and multiple data structures results in poor performance of wave attenuation prediction using mnlr methods genetic programming gp and artificial neural networks anns are robust simple and universal and have a strong ability to solve complex nonlinear problems abbaspour et al 2013 used gp and anns as alternative tools to characterize hydraulic jumps furthermore gp and anns have been successfully applied for the prediction of wave induced scour depth around breakwaters pourzangbar et al 2017 flow resistance caused by flexible vegetation babovic and keijzer 2000 and channel chèzy resistance coefficient giustolisi 2004 these aforementioned works showed that gp and anns could obtain more concise and accurate relationships and these approaches have not been implemented for the prediction of the k t therefore solitary wave attenuation tests by three kinds of artificial vegetation models were carried out in wave flume one of the aims of this study is to predict the wave attenuation using a more accurate empirical equation of k t and we used gp and anns as the intelligent method to contrast with classical mnlr methods another aim of this study is to understand the main influencing factors of emergent vegetation over wave attenuation however it is noted that unlike gp and mnlr anns cannot obtain explicit functional relationships experimental data of different types of plant models cannot be unified at present hence each vegetation model has a corresponding k t prediction formula and result this paper is organized as follows section 2 shows the overview of k t governing parameters and the modeling approach the detailed experimental setup and pre processing of experimental data are reported in section 3 the results of prediction and discussions are given in section 4 and the sensitivity analysis is presented in section 5 the main conclusions of this study are drawn in section 6 2 scour governing variables and soft computing approaches 2 1 transmission coefficient in the wave flume the wave with the incident wave height of h i propagates through the vegetation zone and its wave energy can be divided into three parts one part of the energy propagates through the plant in the form of transmitted wave h t the other part of the energy is blocked by the vegetation and forms the reflected wave the remaining energy is dissipated due to turbulence and frictional heat generated by the interaction between waves and vegetation zones and boundaries 1 k t h t h i solitary wave attenuation in the flume by vegetation depends on two classes of parameters the wave characteristics e g water depth h and wave height h and the vegetation configuration e g vegetation height h v vegetation field length b and distribution density several laboratory measurements are available that provide conducive information about the governing parameters of wave mitigation by vegetation he et al 2019 studied the performance of the stem root and canopy on regular wave attenuation by vegetation and a total of 112 experiments were conducted to test seven vegetation models five wave heights four vegetation densities and four water depths the coefficient of determination r 2 between the k t and dimensionless parameters is 0 822 a general function expression representing k t is given by 2 k t f h h i l h v b ϕ the wave length of a laboratory scale solitary wave can be calculated by huang and yuan 2010 3 l 4 π h 3 3 h i the solid volume fraction can be calculated by the following formula 4 ϕ v s v where v s is the volume of water v is the volume of a vegetated area at still water the parameters of eq 2 were expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters using buckingham s π theorem the dimensionless change of the influencing factors in the relationship can be obtained as follows 5 k t f h h b l h v h ϕ for brevity r h is equal to h h r b is equal to b l α is equal to h v h 6 k t f r h r b α ϕ to sum up the selection of dimensionless parameters was generally considered from four aspects first of all the influence of hydrodynamic factors was considered by relative wave heights h h in solitary waves secondly the interaction of waves and vegetation from the horizontal was analyzed by relative width b l thirdly the interaction of waves and vegetation from the vertical was synthesized by the relative height h v h last the influence of vegetation structure such as plant arrangement and radius was synthesized by the solid volume fraction v s v however considering that under the same distribution density the arrangement of vegetation has little effect on the wave attenuation iimura and tanaka 2012 irtem et al 2009 thuy et al 2009 and the influence of arrangement is not considered separately 2 2 elements of gp gp is an adaptive global optimization search algorithm and its search process is a random search algorithm in essence but the genetic operation in the evolution process can make the path jump to different subspaces randomly which makes its spatial ergodicity better than the traditional heuristic search gp compared with the traditional nonlinear fitting can be more effectively understood the law of the data contained within do not need to assume the potential relationship between the function of the form the hidden relationship and generate automatically reveal data set a functional relation between the dependent variable and independent variables due to the structural characteristics of gp in the representation of candidate solutions and the global nature of the search and optimization mechanism the subjective factors in the model structure design of artificial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks are greatly reduced therefore the genetic programming method was used to obtain the formula for calculating the wave attenuation effect of plants and the sensitivity analysis was carried out gp analysis for k t forecasting process by software eureqa 1 24 0 can be broken down into the following steps step 1 data entry enter dimensionless numbers into the eureqa by column and give names to each variable on the row named name each row representing a set of measurements or values that are in some sense simultaneous step 2 data preparation the difference in figure of variables is minor and standardization can be decided according to the prompts of the software step 3 search definition editing the formula to target expression and selecting the appropriate mathematical building blocks i e arithmetic trigonometric exponential in general we need to select as many operators as possible to get a more comprehensive expression but this may lead to subjective overlearning the mathematical building blocks are selected based on the formula of he et al 2019 in this paper the default setting can minimize the mean absolute error mae and it performs well in most cases which is proved by the results obtained by default eureqa will randomly shuffle the data and then split it into training and validation data sets based on the total size of the data the training set was used to generate and optimize solutions and the validation set was used to test how well those models generalize to new data eureqa also uses the validation data to filter out the best models to display in the eureqa interface step 4 start and stop the search when the program starts to run generation will be generated

information processing based on the main functions of the human brain such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples and usually do not need to write any task specific rules given the sufficient complexity of training networks neural networks can represent arbitrary nonlinear functions the network is composed of many interconnected nodes neurons they are arranged into three basic

in fig 8 the power exponential function as shown in eq 7 was obtained by using the mnlr method which is the same process as presented in he et al 2019 7 k t 0 475 h h 0 086 b l 0 024 h v h 0 274 ϕ 0 228 the four dimensionless parameters in the experiment were substituted into the gp results the solution equation with a size of 24 in table 4 and the mnlr results eq 7 as indicated in this figure the coefficients of determination r 2 of mnlr gp and anns are 0 75 0 95 and 0 75 respectively the empirical formula gives a better prediction for the approach of gp than others 4 2 results of vm ⅱ a total number of 36 vm ⅱ datasets have been used for the prediction of the transmission coefficient k t using the gp anns and mnlr models to assess the capabilities of mnlr gp and anns in wave attenuation prediction k t is set to be the dependent variable relative wave height r h relative width r b relative height α and volume fraction ϕ are set as the independent variables the result of mnlr method as shown in eq 8 8 k t 11 582 r h 3 169 r b 4 592 α 4 487 ϕ 1 311 0 932 similarly the solution equation of gp method as shown in eq 9 9 k t 0 971 29 6 ϕ 603 r h ϕ 512 r b α ϕ 121 e 3 r b ϕ 748 r h r b ϕ fig 9 a illustrates the relationship between the measured and predicted transmission coefficient of the mnlr result and its determination coefficient r 2 is 0 75 some data points deviate far from the fitting line which indicates that the formula obtained by the mnlr has a poor fitting degree to the measured value the relationship between the measured value and the predicted value of the gp results is shown in fig 9b and its r 2 is 0 95 in contrast to fig 9a there is no major deviation between the data points and the fitting line it shows that the gp method offers more accurate prediction in wave attenuation compared to the mnlr and anns methods 4 3 results of vm ⅲ a total number of 128 vm ⅲ datasets have been used for the prediction of the transmission coefficient using the gp anns and mnlr models the solution equation of mnlr and gp method as shown in eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 k t 0 228 r h 0 137 r b 0 105 α 0 112 ϕ 0 215 11 k t 0 985 1 23 r h 2 0 86 r h 17 3 r h ϕ 63 4 ϕ 2 as indicated in fig 10 the coefficients of determination of the three methods are similar the r 2 of gp and anns methods are slightly higher than that of mnlr prediction 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 gp results it can be seen from table 4 that the dimensionless factors may or may not appear in an optimal formula of a certain size and they may occur once or more among them the solid volume fraction ϕ appears most frequently the relative width r b and the relative height α of the model appeared less frequently and the relative wave height r h appeared least frequently the performance of a dimensionless factor in the gp results is measured by the number of times that a factor appears in all the optimal equations and the number of the optimal equations in which the factor appears the performance of the factors in table 4 is intuitively displayed in fig 11 there is randomness in the results obtained by gp every time the fitting results of the optimal equation exist dimensionless factors changed in the equation in order to avoid the error caused by the randomness of the single operation 10 operations were carried out as indicated in fig 12 the frequency of occurrence of different dimensionless parameters obtained through 10 times of fitting is roughly the same according to fig 13 there is a significant difference in the occurrence of each factor among which ϕ appears the most in the 10 fitting results followed by α r b and r h the fitting results show that there is a close relationship between ϕ and the k t and the ϕ has the greatest influence on the wave attenuation effect by vegetation similarly the same procedure is used to calculate the data of vm ⅱ and vm ⅲ furthermore the frequency of the dimensionless parameters appearing in 10 operations was counted fig 14 a shows that there is a close relationship between the ϕ and k t of vm ⅱ however k t is more sensitive to r h of vm ⅲ shown in fig 14b 5 2 anns results spss statistical analysis tool was used to analyze the experimental data the analysis results are shown in table 5 5 3 comparison between gp and anns methods generally speaking the sensitivity analysis results see table 6 of gp and anns are similar and gp performs well in the sensitivity analysis as for the two methods of gp and anns different results appear it is probably due to the fact that the results of gp are randomly generated leading to slight inconsistency in the optimal equation table of each fitting it can be seen from table 6 that the influence of dimensionless factors of different plant models on the transmission coefficient is not consistent the sensitivity analysis of the gp and the anns shows that the solid volume fraction has a dominant effect on the wave attenuation and the influence of the relative width the relative height and the relative wave height of the model are similar but the influence of the relative wave height is relatively minor vm ⅰ ignored the influence of crown and root and had no density change in the vertical direction this model can be used to characterize rigid plants with unprotruding surface roots large and unbending trunk such as the black pine forest suwa 2013 the planting density of such kind of plant can be improved to achieve a better wave reduction effect for the vm ⅱ model considering the effect of root stem and canopy the effect of solid volume fraction on the wave attenuation of plants is dominant compared with vm ⅰ it can be found that the order of relative height is improved because vm ⅱ takes the influence of plant canopy and root into account and the change of water depth will lead to different plant parts being submerged under wave motion it is similar to the normal mangrove with dense branches and well developed roots when planting this kind of vegetation if it is used to protect the safety of coastal people etc during tsunamis the planting density can be improved to achieve a better wave reduction effect if it is mainly used to resist wind wave and promote sediment deposition the vegetation of different ages and heights can be planted appropriately to achieve a better wave reduction effect in vm ⅲ the effect of relative wave height on wave attenuation was dominant compared with vm ⅱ considering the effect of rhizome and leaves it can be found that the influence factors of relative model width are improved tang et al 2019 pointed out that coastal vegetation could significantly reduce wave height and wave run up and wave run up would decrease monotonously with the increase of vegetation width the model was considered to be similar to the coastal mangroves with dense foliage but relatively hard wood respiration roots or strut roots protruding upward such as sonneratia and avicennia marina similarly when planting this kind of plant it can be properly planted with greater range density to attenuate waves 6 conclusions the experiments studied three non flooded rigid plant models and the influence of the relative wave height relative width relative height and solid volume fraction on the transmission coefficient was considered using multivariate non linear regression genetic programming and artificial neural networks to perform formula fitting and weight analysis of each factor and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the formulas of transmission coefficient and relative wave height relative width relative height and solid volume fraction of three kinds of vegetation were established the inner relationship between the transmission coefficient of flora and the factors in the solitary wave was revealed 2 genetic programming method is useful in understanding and establishing new formulas being capable of analyzing and predicting data effectively and provide new ideas and methods in solving complex problems related to wave dissipation by vegetation 3 the effects of dimensionless factors on the transmission coefficient of different vegetation models are inconsistent it was found that increasing the solid volume fraction can attenuate the wave height more effectively compared to the relative width and relative height credit authorship contribution statement shangpeng

20583,hybrid wind wave farm systems integrate their capabilities to have higher and more reliable synergy than conventional renewable energy plants the energy extractors array layout is a pivotal factor for the output power the aim of this work is to quantify the benefits of combining the wave energy and wind energy into a hybrid system on the egyptian mediterranean north coasts it also aims to investigate the optimal array layout of a hybrid wind wave energy farm numerical analyses using the rans model are applied to different cases regarding the array layout and spacing in order to increase their performance the results indicate that the most optimal array layout is a square staggered one with a spacing of 4 0 rotor diameters along the y axis and 5 0 rotor diameters along the x

integrated systems are advantageous for many countries energy self sufficiency management strategies numerous researches have focused on the compatibility of offshore wind turbines in general and wave energy extractors in particular nonetheless the wind wave combination systems are harmonious in terms of the synergy of strong energies perez collazo and iglesias 2012 perez collazo et al 2013 casale et al 2012 several synergies were achieved including increasing energy yield pérez collazo et al 2015 lowering capital and operating expenses capex opex and sharing transportation operation and maintenance o m costs pérez collazo et al 2015 astariz et al 2015a on a larger scale the wind wave arrays have been combined together using various systems the wind wave system can be combined in three systems pérez collazo et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates the systems used to combine wind and wave energy extractors the co located system is most likely being erected for existing offshore wind farms that have wave energy converters wecs deployed separately from offshore wind turbines the hybrid energy system is where both technologies share the same substructure this device is most likely to be found in newly built energy farms finally the combined energy island method incorporates the two prior cases by integrating floating wind turbines and floating wecs the combined offshore wind wave arrays have critical factors that affect farm performance i e array layout configuration separating distances between extractors number of extractors and energy sources direction andrés et al 2014 in energy farms various array layout scenarios i e linear a b square c triangle d and rhombus e are adopted as shown in fig 2 the separating distances between extractors on the other hand differ as a function of the extractor s diameter d and the number of multiplications n the number of extractors is determined depending on the farm s necessary output capacity another consideration is the incident energy angle θ of the source direction with respect to the layout angle β all of these factors interact to influence the extracted energy and the induced wake which can increase losses a thorough understanding of each extractor s flow control wake interaction behind the extractors and wake decays with their dissipating rate is needed to enforce an appropriate wake mitigation strategy for the extractors array the key constraint influencing wind farm efficiency is wake interactions that are taken into account in wind farm design eliminating wake losses due to wake interactions is dependent on the array configuration and distance between extractors the separating distances between rotors are usually 6d to 10d in the stream wind direction and 3d to 4d in the crosswind direction

must not overlap in order to prevent power losses kotb and soliman 1993 owing to the aerodynamic efficiency of each rotor kotb and haq 1992 several studies have discussed the importance of the spacing between the turbines seeking an optimal layout kotb m a and soliman h a in 1993 kotb and soliman 1993 numerically investigate the performance of staggered hawt rotors with a low overlap area the used model is based on combining momentum blade element and vortex theories the study reveals that the overlapping disk area between the two rotors increases the power deficit the front rotor blocks the rear rotor and reduces its power by less than 15 of 0 26 overlapping area ratio between them raúl et al in 2009 cal et al 2010 experimentally investigate the wakes interaction between wind turbines in a wind tunnel the array of three by three is separated by 3d and 7d in the crosswind and downwind directions respectively bartl j in 2012 bartl et al 2012 experiments with two separating distances 3d and 5d between both a front and a rear wind turbine meanwhile the downstream axial measurements for the model are measured at three locations including a 1d 3d and 5d respectively to investigate the local velocity deficit with its corresponding turbulence intensities these values are significantly higher for the rear turbine than for the frontal one the reduction of power coefficients are about 31 and 33 of the power extracted of the unobstructed front turbine corresponding to the separating distance 3d and 5d respectively regarding the layouts shaheen et al in 2015 shaheen et al 2015 confirm a 34 more increase in performance just by arranging a cluster of savonius turbines in an efficient triangular shape compared to their isolated counterparts shaheen and shaaban in 2016 shaheen and abdallah 2016 have numerically simulated and designed a new efficient array layout that consisted of a triangular patterned cluster of three savonius vawts then they simulated a multiplied cluster of 9 and 27 turbines to develop a wind farm the implemented simulations of the developed triangular arrays layouts kept the same arrangement as the individual cluster that was used before the results showed a successive enhancement of performance while enlarging the farm which resulted in the same power enhancement ratio the wake accumulation caused by the turbines wake interactions in the wind farm showed a decrease in the energy density downstream by 40 and more barthelmie et al 2007b 2010 improvements of wave farms like those of wind farms depend on similar constraints regarding the efficiency point falnes in 1980 falnes 1980 then falnes and budal in 1982 falnes and budal 1982 have proven that performance can be affected by the array layout configuration jung lyul lee and hyuck min kweon in 2012 kweon and lee 2012 have studied the wake interactions between the circular and linear arrays of buoys results show that a linear array is sensitive to incident angles unlike a circular one de andrés a d et al in 2014 andrés et al 2014 have numerically evaluated that the separating distances play a main role in performance however the triangular and square array layouts are favorable for multi directional and uni directional waves respectively silvia bozzi et al in 2017 bozzi et al 2017 have simulated the hydrodynamic interactions between heavings wecs with different separating distances i e 5d 10d and 30d with different layouts i e linear square and rhombus layouts more specifically these parameters affect overall performance and should be considered alejandro lópez ruiz in 2018 lópez ruiz et al 2018a has numerically analyzed the performance of 9 overtopping wecs using three different array layouts i e aligned staggered and arrow layouts in the three spacing of 2d 4d and 6d results show that the performances of the separating distances 4d and 6d for the arrow layout are quite close however the 6d was the most optimal one nevertheless the wave arrays factors play a vital role in the farm performance the factors studied are optimal array layout lópez ruiz et al 2018b child and venugopal 2010 child 2011 moarefdoost et al 2017 separating distance lópez ruiz et al 2018b babarit 2010 and wave direction child and venugopal 2010 child 2011 in recent years co located wave wind systems have been investigated with operational offshore wind farms astariz s et al in 2015 astariz et al 2015b 2015c 2015d propose a periphery distributed array pda as a novel combination to co locating the wecs with an operational offshore wind farm a numerical analysis is implemented for studying the wave height reduction with three spacings for the wecs i e 2 2d 5d and 8 3d astariz et al 2015d and 6 2d 3 8d and 2 2d astariz et al 2015b also the array layout is investigated for both an angle layout and an arc layout astariz et al 2015c the results prove that a wave height reduction within the farm increases the accessible time by up to 82 for the o m astariz et al 2015d the layout is essential for reducing the significant wave height by up to 40 astariz et al 2015b while the wave height reduction is achieved by around 13 5 this reduction improves accessibility for the alpha ventus and lincs by 82 and for the bard 1 and horns rev1 by 70 which increases the operational time up to 90 annually astariz et al 2015c astariz s et al in 2015 astariz and iglesias 2015 compare between the pda and nda to find out which one increases the uniform wave height reduction for more accessibility the study reveals that nda provides a more uniformly distributed wave height reduction by around 5 this reduction is reflected on the wecs with the additional power of 16 5 astariz s and iglesias g in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016a analyze the power production of a co located wecs system their results show an 87 reduction in downtime and a 6 in power variability achieved astariz s et al in 2016 astariz et al 2016 investigate wave height reduction and the shadow effect of a co located system which reflected on the operation and maintenance o m they conclude that farm layout is crucial since a square layout with small separating distances same as that of the horns rev1 farm achieves the largest wave height reduction required astariz s et al in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016b assess the benefits of co locating 56 overtopping wecs using a pda array the results show that the energy yield per unit area increases by 3 4 relative to that of a standalone farm however the shadow effect increases accessibility by 20 70 of a uniform distribution astariz s and iglesias g in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016c investigate a co located array of overtopping wecs this simulation uses a uda of wecs in an appropriate array configuration spaced by 2 2d their result achieves a wave height reduction of 17 with differences between the first and the last rows astariz s et al in 2016 astariz et al 2016 improve the shadow effect to increase accessible time by using a pda co located system as revealed by statistics the renewable energy in egypt expands extensively since the egyptian s share inflation is quite impressive while the use of fossil fuels steeps this energy share is very interesting compared to the global share which has been ranging between 10 and 35 up to 2022 30 of electric 2018 the egyptian s gross electrical generation from renewable sources has increased from 5 8 in 2016 to 20 0 in 2022 e g wind energy is 12 0 of the total of 100 and is expected to reach 42 0 by 2035 e g wind energy is 14 0 of the total of 100 in 2019 the reliability on renewable energy reduced the use of fossil fuel by 4 3 m i l l i o n t o n s as well as reduced emissions e g c o 2 by 11 3 m i l l i o n t o n s new and renewable energy authority 2019 economically speaking offshore renewable energy competes with conventional energy for its consistency dependability and low cost funding the capital expenditure capex of renewable energy has a higher range than its conventional counterparts it reflects on the levelized cost of energy lcoe which is still high worldwide therefore renewable energy is adopted to reduce those expenses as much as possible significant reductions in the feed in tariff are recorded over time which is obviously very promising these reductions result from different parameters e g the increase of technology s reliability the reduction of materials prices the large scale of projects the extractor s size etc the developments of offshore wind turbines are scaling up significantly especially with the large diameter of 222 0 m of 14 0 m w gamesa 2020 the operational costs are dropped which provides more competitive energy prices feed in tariff of the offshore wind technology has been reduced by 29 0 from 2010 to 2019 a and renewable power ge 2019 it was reduced to almost 9 0 only in 2019 international renewable energy agency 2019 while it is suggested that it will be reduced to 29 0 in 2021 compared to the onshore wind of 18 0 only during the same year then 11 2 in 2023 for the offshore wind a and renewable power ge 2019 nevertheless the offshore wind farms have many aspects involved in the overall project costs as shown in fig 3 these different shares would be changed over time which corresponds to the developments in the technology they are also affected by the scale of the project whether it is large with high benefits or it is a utility or pilot project generally preliminary costs are related to project planning design and developments then capital costs are encountered for construction transportation installation and assembly in addition the extractors costs are included as well i e the cost of rotor tower wec substructure power take off pto mechanism floating system mooring system electrical power and control systems safety system fernandez et al 2014 and auxiliaries equipment nielsen 2003 nevertheless the electrical infrastructure has two main parameters gonzalez rodriguez 2017 transmission cable systems have an inner array an export hv subsea cable and an onshore hv cable substation systems have high voltage alternating or direct currents hvac or hvdc an hv connection and an onshore substation system based on the yearly cash flow morgan et al 2003 tudy of the costs o 2020 slengesol et al 2010 rather than the capex itself the opex of a typical offshore wind wave farm breakdown throughout its lifetime is categorized into different aspects these o m parameters include maintenance working boat s expenses electricity and other costs insurance taxes legal site rent administration miscellaneous etc and decommissioning a long time ago egypt had an ambitious strategy for renewable energy egyptian electricity holding company 2018 which aimed at making contribute 40 0 of the total power production by 2035 a stratigy of the r 2020 egypt has long coastlines that are not used for any offshore renewable applications however the capital expenditure capex for this technology is very high these aspects motivate the present work to investigate cost reduction factors one main factor boosting revenue is by using a hybrid system i e wave energy combined with offshore wind energy however until today no studies have been dedicated to the possibility of designing a hybrid farm in egypt due to the lack of any provided studies in the hybrid wind wave farm field the authors have chosen to undertake this task this task involves a studying the possibilities of using the egyptian coastlines for designing and erecting an offshore wind farm on the red sea and the mediterranean sea b proposing a hybrid wind wave farm to reduce the capex opex and c implementing a numerical analysis for optimizing the array layout of the proposed hybrid wind wave farm nevertheless the main contribution of this work is figuring out the possibilities of designing renewable energy applications on egyptian coasts moreover its contribution is optimizing an array layout of a hybrid wind wave energy farm this farm is to be located on the egyptian mediterranean north coasts the novelty of this work lies in specifying out the most optimal array layout of a hybrid wind wave farm most of the previous researches based on the literature review focus on finding out the most optimal array layout of an offshore wind farm or for a wave farm although few researches focus on optimizing a hybrid wind wave array only one array i e a wind array or a wave array is applied however there is no application or research on this point tackling the problem especially on the egyptian coasts the findings of this paper are categorized into two sections firstly is that it is possible to implement the renewable energy application on the egyptian coast especially the north coast secondly an offshore hybrid wind wave farm would use the array layout of a staggered square with the separation distances between the energy extractor of 4 0 and 5 0 of the rotor diameter on both prevailing and perpendicular on the energy directions respectively the main research question is to find out is it financially profiting to go with the renewable applications therefore the main question here is what is the most optimal array layout of an offshore hybrid wind wave farm and its importance regarding the cost reductionof the hybrid farm the research question is handled by putting a methodology considering three phases at the beginning available data about offshore wind application and wave energy application data are collected e g types power take off weight volume location depth etc then a decision is made concerning the use of wind energy application instead of wave energy application and its data availability each phase is explained in the following methodology 2 methodology the problem of optimizing a hybrid wind wave farm layout has various constraints e g farm location number of extractors array layout extractors separating distance and incident wind wave directions an optimization framework is obtained through sequences of simulations these numerical simulations are divided into three main successive phases as illustrated in the flow chart shown in fig 4 in phase one the numerical model is verified and validated then in phase two the model is investigated to find out the most optimum layouts and spacings finally the full hybrid farm layout and performances are examined in phase three 2 1 numerical model regarding the objective applying hybrid wind wave systems would not be similar on both the egyptian mediterranean sea and the red sea this is due to the nature of each site a wind wave farm could be applied in the egyptian red sea through a co located floating system the system may use an independent wecs array to be combined with the zafarana or gabal el zait operational wind farms this is due to the widespread existence of a coral reef in the red sea on the other hand the egyptian mediterranean sea does not have any wind energy applications yet a suggestion for a new farm is to be an offshore hybrid wind wave farm wind atlas for egypt provides reliable and accurate wind energy potential data sets in the mediterranean sea based on the egyptian offshore data the wind speed ranges from 4 0 to 5 0 m s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 meanwhile the egyptian mediterranean offshore wave potential energy measured by the satellite altimetry maps report a mean significant wave height h a from 1 0 to 4 0 m with a corresponding average mean wave period t a from 4 0 to 8 0 s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 2 1 1 wind turbine model setup a straight bladed vertical axis wind turbine is selected for the present study the blade transverse section is naca 0021 type rotor particulars are shown in table 1 castelli et al 2011 a computational scheme for this rotor is shown in fig 5 with domains for the whole rotor as well as its blades boundary conditions include a uniform incident speed of 9 0 m s with a wind direction heading from 0 0 d e g r e e as shown in table 2 the rotor torque coefficient c m is calculated as shown in equation 1 1 c m m 1 2 ρ v 2 a l where m is the torque n m ρ is the air density k g m 3 v is the air speed m s a is the rotor swept area given by a d h in m 2 d is the overall rotor diameter m h is the rotor height m l is the reference length m and also v is the kinematics viscosity m 2 s the power coefficient c p is computed in terms of the tip speed ratio λ and the rotor torque m as given by equation 2 2 c p m ω 1 2 ρ a v 3 c m λ where λ ω r v ω is the angular density r a d s and r is the rotor tip radius m in 2d simulations the reference area a is taken as the turbine diameter d and the reference length l as the turbine radius gomez and montlaur 2014 the time lapse is accounted for every 5 0 d e g r e e of the rotor rotation instead of 1 0 d e g r e e to cut down computational time the corresponding minimum time step given by δ t 5 is 0 002 s to achieve full 7 0 rotations as shown in equation 3 gomez and montlaur 2014 3 δ t 5 5 ω r p s 360 5 6 r p m 2 1 2 wakes interaction simulations the effect of rotor generated wake on neighboring rotors is examined in this section two scenarios are investigated these are side by side rotors and tandem rotors shown in fig 6 a and b respectively three separating distances are suggested 3d 5d and 7d and examined for both scenarios it is expected that the aft rotors in a tandem arrangement slow down due to the shadow or blockage effects of the front rotor while the side rotor will remain unaffected based on experiments carried out in reference cal et al 2010 for similar arrangements 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 reduction in angular speed are assumed for the three separating distances used in the present numerical study fig 7 a and b show 5 rotors arranged in 2 and 3 rows respectively the rotors in the back rows have reduced angular velocity by an amount ranging from 4 5 to 8 of the upstream rotors values as per reference cal et al 2010 noting that the rotors in the same row have the same angular speeds 2 1 3 wind wave offshore farm wake model different optimization methods are involved to cover more successful optimization techniques successful optimization methods for the owts array layout are followed based on the given data i e swamy et al in 2020 swamy et al 2020 azlan et al in 2021 azlan et al 2021 wang and campbell in 2020 wang and campbell 2020 sickler in 2020 sickler 2020 gualtieri in 2019 gualtieri 2019 and dou et al in 2020 dou et al 2020 on the other hand optimization methods for the wecs array layout is used too i e neshat et al in 2020 neshat et al 2020a lyu et al in 2019 lyu et al 2019 neshat et al in 2019 neshat et al 2019a neshat et al in 2019 neshat et al 2019b and neshat et al in 2020 neshat et al 2020b ultimately the model moves from the airfoil flow scale to the turbine rotor scale then the rotors interactions scale and finally the wind farm scale is implemented once the minimum range of separating distances is determined any desired farm output power could be considered using the involved number of wind turbines throughout this part a case study uses the horns rev1 offshore wind farm which employs horizontal axis turbines interacting together generating wake behaviors the overall wind farm consists of an eight column by ten row array approximately 7 from north south with a layout of a rhomboid shape and separation distances of 7d along both the x axis and y axis recently several studies have attempted to examine the farm wake to optimize and understand the horns rev1 this offshore farm was chosen as a case study by many astariz et al 2015b wu and porté agel 2015 peña et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 vigueras rodríguez et al 2012 sorensen et al 2007 in particular a square staggered array layout of vertical axis turbines describes the participating model the overall farm s domain uses a length l f of 9600 m and a width w f of 6000 m representing the stationary rectangle wind model the array layout is located in the center 3200 m far away from the inlet as shown in fig 8 from different array layouts the best three layouts are selected numerically depending on the highest power performance of each layout these spacings will be used in the following cases to construct the full wind wave hybrid farm layout according to the layouts the farms are arranged in a square configuration to provide higher performances astariz et al 2015c meanwhile the staggered layout has been selected for placing the hybrid extractors due to their higher exposure to more energetic incident sources wu and porté agel 2013 and to minimize the wake effect hansen 2014 wu and porté agel 2017 it is also selected for making the maximum possible benefit of wake avoidance wind turbine parameterization for the present work considers the turbine rotors as solid disk obstacles to the wind flow the turbine rotors are represented as cylinders to overcome the computational complexities as those used for the actuator disk model adm wu and porté agel 2013 wu and porté agel 2011 port e agel et al 2013 they are used to determine the aerodynamics coefficients i e c p for every turbine as shown in equation 5 to be used in equation 4 the rotor solidity σ is defined as σ n c r r o t o r it is taken as 0 499 same as in castelli et al 2010 2011 gomez and montlaur 2014 4 p 1 2 ρ a v 3 c p where n is the number of blades 3 c is the airfoil chord 85 8 m m and r r o t o r is the rotor radius 515 0 m m castelli et al 2010 2011 the induction factor a is numerically estimated based on the adm which is proportional to the mean velocity difference as shown in equation 6 5 c p 4 a 1 a 2 6 a 0 5 1 v r e a r v f r o n t where v f r o n t is the upstream velocity and v r e a r is the downstream velocity of the wind turbine rotor the wave modeling is considered similar to the wind modeling due to the physical structure of the hybrid wind wave unit as mentioned previously wecs are supported on the owts substructure therefore the same array layout of the owts is used to be that of the wecs array layout an ellipsoid floating body is the best shape to describe the wave energy extractor in three dimensional space while the simple circle surface is the real description of the ellipsoid wec non dimensional analyses are applied to the wecs array layouts to be generalized with any farm scale as like those of the owts array layouts as well wave surface modeling is implemented with the interaction of the waves motions and the wecs can be shown this method has been used before in different studies and revealed interesting interactions between the waves motions and the wecs with different scopes of analysis in this case the linear airy wave theory is used to describe the incident sinusoidal wave however the numerical model takes the wave motion behaviors instantaneously the surface wave velocity is measured around each extractor to measure the available and the extracted power from each individual wave energy extractor a standalone wec 1 0 m in diameter is used to measure the expected power that can be extracted from each wave energy extractor to be a standard value for further comparisons then each involved array layout is assumed to provide the same amount of the extracted power from the wave energy with respect to the number of extractors however due to the wave interaction with the wecs with different configurations it differs in values so the total amount of the energy extracted by all wecs through each array layout is divided by the amount of energy extracted by the standalone standard wec multiplied by the number of the used wecs through the wave array which is 80 extractors the extracted power from each extractor is computed numerically based on the airy wave theory using equation 7 while the airy wave theory describes the wave parameters in different perspectives the present study is interested in the incident wave celerity to be used in the given equation 7 however the wave height also is used instead of the celerity in different techniques that model uses a two dimensional space to describe the wave surface height elevation with respect to the wave celerity and its changes due to the interactions of the wave with the wave energy extractor and the offshore wind turbine substructure regarding the different array layout configurations so based on the linear airy wave theory the present methodology relies on the surface water velocity to describe different wave parameters as they are related in the airy wave theory nevertheless the technique is based on the x y cartesian coordinate system in a two dimensional analysis where z is the elevation perpendicular on the seabed the plane of the x y domain plane is the main perspective of view as all extractors would be monitored out of the simulation therefore the x z domain or the y z domain does not describe the whole wind farm and wave farm it is not applicable to apply all the wave parameters into two dimensional space simulations i e water depth acceleration wave height and wave period etc previous successful research had followed the same concept and simulated the wave parameters into two dimensional domains e g astariz et al 2015a 2015b 2015c 2015d 2016 astariz and iglesias 2015 2016b 2016c hence modeling the wave domain in three dimensional space requires a high computational power to implement all the wave parameters of the used wave theory similar to wind rotors the wave energy converter wec is modeled as a marine artificial obstacle described as circular shapes with diameters assumed to be 1 0 m for non dimensionality so the device always exposes the same width against the incident waves and is passively oriented along the direction of the wave propagation the eighty wecs are shown in fig 8 here the transmission coefficient k t which is based on the average of 0 40 koutandos et al 2005 and 0 50 evans 1976 used to be 0 45 k t is defined as the amount of energy absorbed from a wave and it varies from 0 i e 100 of incident wave energy absorbed to 100 no energy absorbed the incident waves based on the egyptian mediterranean north coast have an average significant wave height h a of 2 50 m with a corresponding average mean wave period t a of 6 0 s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 ayat 2013 shehata et al 2018 the maximum corresponding wave celerity c is 2 960 m s ayat 2013 shehata et al 2018 queffeulou and croize fillon 2009 ralston et al 2013 zodiatise a 2014 the available wave power is given by equation 7 ram et al 2016 horikawa 1978 venugopal et al 2017 7 p 1 8 ρ g h a 2 c g t h where c g t h is the group velocity defined for any finite depth of water and period as shown in equation 8 8 c g t h 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h g t 2 π tanh k h where h a is the wave height m k is the wave number h is the water depth m ρ is the sea water density equal to 1025 k g m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant 2 2 model mesh verification a high resolution mesh setup using a tetrahedral unstructured fine mesh is adopted a higher mesh density is required in the rotating zones where the flow interacts with the three airfoil blades as shown in fig 9 therefore the far field region has a coarse mesh of 1280 m m maximum face size then the face size for the hub area is 9 0 m m also a fine mesh of 3 5 m m is used for controlling the surface circle areas the three airfoil blades have a trailing edge these blades have refinements of 0 03 m m for their edge as shown in fig 10 meanwhile 6 0 quadrilaterals inflated layers are found around airfoil blades of 0 0125 m m as a first layer height furthermore an extra additional mesh refinement is used around the three airfoil blades consisting of 5 0 layers a mesh independence study is implemented on several models with different mesh ranges based on previous studies that used models of mesh elements the spatial domain discretization ranges from approximately 600 000 to 1 000 000 elements are recommended castelli et al 2011 these mesh values are classified into a coarse mesh of 500 000 to 700 000 elements a medium mesh of 700 000 to 900 000 elements and a fine mesh of 900 000 to 1 100 000 elements the mesh factors mfs are levelled to change the mesh densities by 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 and 1 50 to simplify the comparison between the meshes element numbers and the power coefficient c p as shown in fig 11 a however results from all meshing cases are compared with experimental results castelli et al 2010 i e the pressure coefficient along the airfoil blades and power coefficient c p with a tip speed ratio t s r of λ 2 5 as shown in fig 11 b the model mesh using an approximately 1 193 349 elements with a mesh factor of 1 25 is found to achieve precise results as shown in fig 11 the mesh has been changed according to the different configurations i e twin cluster and full farms regarding verification the meshes used are 2 367 705 and 3 158 844 elements for the twin and cluster models respectively however the used mesh has approximately 4 500 000 elements the models of eighty wind wave extractors are the extractors represented by a circular shape for simplicity 2 3 code validation the code is validated with respect to different turbulent models these values are compared against the same experimental model data castelli et al 2010 the rng k epsilon k ε two equations turbulence model with scalable wall function near wall treatment function is found to have a significant accuracy over the other models during all simulations as shown in fig 12 two transport equations are used to construct the k epsilon k ε approach where the turbulence kinetic energy k is given by equation 9 and its dissipation rate epsilon ε is given by equation 10 the equations are obtained from fluent 2012

discussion in the standalone rotor s simulation ragab et al 2020 the upstream incident flow pressure and velocities clearly are recovered downstream at approximately 6 5d to 7 5d fig 13 a b and c show the velocity field variations past the twin rotor working side by side at 3d 5d and 7d lateral distances regions of low and high velocities are displayed for the longitudinal direction the rear rotors are examined at the shadow effect of the front rotors as shown in fig 14 a b and c respectively inside zone 1 the wake interaction is reduced while the spacing is increased due to the flow recovery after a sufficient distance a sufficient downstream spacing is required to be between 5d and 7d for minimum power losses that affect both rotors negatively also the front rotors experience flow blockage due to the obstacle caused by the flow downstream rear rotor which blocks and slows the incident flow path the power decreases when the spacing gets smaller this is clearly shown in table 3 moreover a comparison between the two rotors in terms of the pressure absorption shows the pressure drop behavior of each rotor the side by side rotors along the y axis reveal that there are no significant change in pressure coefficient c p r values between the 3d 5d and 7d spacings as they are almost 1 0 for both rotors as shown in fig 15 in a b and c respectively the front rotors along the x axis reveal that the c p r for the 3d configuration is 2 9 higher than that of the 5d as shown in fig 16 a and b respectively while the differences between the 5d and 7d separation distances is 1 0 only as shown in b and c respectively also the aft rotors along the x axis show that the 5d has as much as 27 0 higher power than that of the 3d separation distances as shown in a and b respectively but a changing value of 13 53 of the value occurs between the 5d and the 7d separation distances as shown in b and c respectively ragab et al 2020 based on these results the longitudinal spacing along the x axis should not exceed 7d as the pressure coefficient c p r is recovered as observed in fig 16 likewise the 5d spacing also shows a high value less than that of the 7d with a small difference between them furthermore the 6d selected to be involved is assumed to give a high performance according to the references on the other hand the 3d spacing along the y axis shows the highest performance as shown in fig 15 the difference between the 5d and the 3d is high as shown before so the 3d and 4d spacings are used to increase the simulations possibilities same as referenced therefore these distances are applied as least as possible in order to reduce the array s occupying surface area 3 1 multiple rotors wakes interactions in this case the two row layout is used to examine the effect of concentrated velocities in the passage between the rotors at the front row on the second row as shown in fig 17 and fig 18 at zones 2 3 the three row layout examines the third row interaction with the array which has much wake interaction than the two row cases as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 this speed passage is formed due to the flow speed changes around the rotor as found in kotb and aldoss 1991 it is noticed that the local velocities around all the rotors are slightly increased in the lateral direction at the rotor plane these increases are shown in figs 17 and 18 at zones 1 4 5 and 7 and also shown in figs 19 and 20 at zones 1 3 4 5 6 and 8 these cumulative velocities keep increasing and providing higher velocity at the passages between rotors these increases are shown in figs 19 and 20 at zones 2 7 and in figs 17 and 18 at zones 2 3 and 6 the front row causes a velocity deficit due to its wake that affects the rear row which reduces the generated power while increasing the spacing along the x axis leads to reducing the wake interactions for both rotors and gradually increasing the axial velocity also a blockage effect is noticed by 0 5d distance in front of the rotor with a lower velocity upstream as the spacing is reduced the staggered layout shows effectiveness in reducing the spacing to 5d rather than to 7d which reduces the array s surface area therefore it is obvious from examining the results that the higher turbulent variability inside the layout is due to the three rows which is obviously higher than that of the two rows it is also noticed that the wake deflects slightly toward the direction of rotation due to the inducement of the rotor s rotation and this is clearly observed at aldoss and kotb 1988 it is worth mentioning that the two cases are studied to investigate the flow interaction on the turbines rotors average corresponding power coefficients c p are numerically recorded from the moment coefficients c m for all rotors in every simulated model the corresponding t s r uses the maximum value λ 2 50 as shown in fig 12 a summary of the rotors power coefficients c p of each array layout is collected in table 3 regarding the power coefficients c p rotor 01 shows the highest value at the layouts of 3d with 6d for the two rows while the three rows are the 3d with 5d along the y axis and x axis the rotor 02 exhibits the highest value at the layout of the two rows 3d with 6d and the same goes for the 3d with 7d for the three rows the rotor 03 shows the highest value at the layout of the two rows 3d with 6d and 4d with 5d for the three rows while the rotor 04 shows the highest value at the layout 3d with 5d for the two rows and for the three rows it is the 4d with 5d the rotor 05 shows the highest value for the two rows layout of 4d with 5d and 4d with 6d for the three rows moreover the average power coefficients c p of the overall layouts show that the 3d with 5d is the highest then the 4d with 5d along the y axis and x axis for the two and three rows respectively in case of the two rows as shown in fig 21 a the 3d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances have a maximum and minimum c p of 0 395 and 0 361 for the separating distance 5d and 7d respectively the array average c p has slightly decreased between the 5d and 6d separating distance by 0 8 for the last one also the value is decreased for the 7d over 6d separating distance by 0 26 in general the rear row has a 4 33 higher average c p than the front row for the three separating distances however for the two rows as shown in fig 21 b the 4d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum c p of 0 394 and 0 296 for the spacing 5d and 6d respectively the array average c p has decreased for the 6d to be 5 08 less than that of the 5d separating distance the average c p of the 7d has increased by 3 62 more than that of the 6d separating distance meanwhile the rear row has shown an average c p for the three separating distances of 0 96 only more than that of the front row whereas regarding the three rows as shown in fig 22 a the 3d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum c p of 0 363 and 0 125 for the 7d spacing it is also observed that the array average c p has decreased to 3 47 for the 6d less than that of the 5d separating distance with a reduction of 2 29 for the 7d over the 6d separation distance the rear rows have shown an average c p change for the three separating distances only 0 43 increased for the second row while 44 79 decreased for the third row while as shown in fig 22 b the 4d separation distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum power coefficients c p of 0 368 and 0 136 for the 5d and 7d spacing respectively the array average c p has decreased by 2 85 for the 6d less than that of the 5d separating distance while the 7d has decreased by 10 11 over the 6d separating distance the rear rows have shown that the average c p changed for the three separating distances a 2 93 increase in value for the second row while a 29 44 has decreased for the third row regarding the spacing between the energy extractors and how the rotor could be affected when relocated along both directions the rate of change roc analyses the turbine wake decay which is influenced by the neighboring rotors wakes this analysis describes the power coefficient c p changes of each involved rotor relative to the change in separating distances d however an average of every array is used along the x axis and the y axis the rate of change d c p d d is determined across the arrays with accordance to the directions the average power coefficient c p a v g of each rotor is divided by the corresponding separating distance d of the neighboring rotor on both axes as d c p d x and d c p d y along the x axis and the y axis respectively the rate of change d c p d d is quantified as shown in equation 12 while the relation is adjusted for the changeable spacing along the x axis and y axis as shown in equations 13 and 14 respectively 12 d c p d d 0 n c p n c p o δ d 13 d c p d x d c p n d c p o δ x 14 d c p d y d c p n d c p o δ y where d c p d d is the power coefficient c p per separation distance d d c p d x is the rate of change along the x axis d c p d y is the rate of change along the y axis c p n is the c p of the neighbor turbine c p o is the c p of the specified turbine and δ d δ x δ y is the separation distance d notice that δ d is the spacing in general at both directions while δ x and δ y is the separation distance along the x axis and the y axis respectively for the case of the two rows with the 3d separating distance along the y axis as shown in fig 23 a the 6d separating distance along the x axis shows an average amount of 74 9 d c p d x lower than that of the 5d also a 55 37 reduction of the 5d separating distance along the y axis occurs for the 6d the 7d separating distance along the x axis shows that an amount of 78 9 d c p d x is higher than that of the 6d meanwhile in case of the separating distance along the y axis it has increased by 50 76 of d c p d x at the 7d separating distance over the 6d one followed by the 4d separating distance along the y axis the 6d separating distance along the x axis provides a higher gain over the 5d by 109 26 the 6d separating distance along the y axis shows a higher amount of 163 05 d c p d x than that of the 5d in the other direction the 7d separating distance along the x axis has a 67 7 d c p d x decrease over the 6d the same slightly lower value occurs between the 7d separating distance along the y axis and the 6d of 67 18 while the three rows case with the 3d separating distance along the y axis as shown in fig 23 b the 6d separating distance along the x axis shows an average amount of 5 34 d c p d x lower than that of the 5d also the 6d separating distance along the y axis is 13 16 higher than that of the 5d meanwhile the 7d separating distance along the x axis shows an 8 67 d c p d x lower than that of the 6d the 7d separating distance along the y axis has increased by 18 1 over that of the 6d moreover for the 4d separating distance along the y axis the 6d along the x axis is 8 52 less than that of the 5d the 6d along the y axis shows a higher amount of 10 02 d c p d x than that of the 5d in the other direction the 7d along the x axis has increased by 35 47 over the 6d s and the 7d along the y axis has also increased by 78 82 over the 6d s another approach towards calculating the effect of the wake interactions is through analyzing the power captured ratio p c r the p c r is used to assess the energy source for the comparison between different array layouts this is given by the q factor which describes the non dimensional power captured ratio p c r the q factor is given by equation 15 15 q n 1 n p n n p 0 where n is the number of energy converters in the farm p n is the power absorbed by the n th device in the array and p 0 is the power absorbed by an individual converter acting in isolation as a constant reference as shown in fig 24 the separation distances d between rotors are small as the power production is increased however this behavior is unlikely and unexpected the staggered layout provides the backward rows with more incident flow velocities the staggered layout makes the backward rows benefit from the velocities concentration at the passages in between each two rotors of the frontal rows so a recommendation made here is to locate the rotors in a staggered layout close enough to each other with certain limitations also in case of the two rotors aligned behind each other as shown in fig 6 it is expected that the extracted power from the rear rotor is less than that of the frontal rotor the extracted power gets increased whereas the separation distance d between them is increased as well in case of the two rows of rotors aligned exactly in line with each other as the rear rotors are located at the front rotor s shadow it is expected that the average output power of the rear row will be less than the average output power of the front row the average power variations result from the blockage effect in case of the two rows located behind each other but in a staggered layout as shown in fig 7 the average output power for the rear row will be more slightly increased than the average output power of the front row this effect is a result of the higher velocities at the passages between the front row s rotors as shown in table 4 the staggered layout provides more overall output power but in case of the rotors which have an in line layout as shown in fig 6 b power losses occur the separation distance 3d along the x axis has a 39 55 power loss then 13 52 and 0 72 power losses for both the 5d and 7d respectively nevertheless in case of the three rows arrays the layout performance of the spacing 3d with 5d is 6 47 lower than that of the 4d with 6d also the layout of the spacing 4d with 6d is 2 82 lower than that of the 4d with 5d the selected separating distances are the 4d with 5d along the y axis and the x axis then the 4d with 6d along the y axis and x axis and finally the 3d with 5d along the y axis and x axis respectively to be used as a guidance to complete the optimization process 3 2 hybrid offshore wind wave farm the hybrid wind wave farm is divided into the offshore wind turbines array and the wave energy converters array both arrays are simulated separately to describe how the energy extractors are affected by the wake interactions offshore wind and wave layouts have their specified spacings from previous cases 3 2 1 offshore wind farm the rotors wake behaviors have a velocity deficit occurring right behind the rotor in the longitudinal direction downstream the rotors wakes of the frontal rows have shown more wakes interaction behaviors than at the back region while the rear rotors have shown a weaker wake it is noticed that the increased velocities at the passages in between every two rotors as depicted in fig 25 at a b and c have been expected as is in the previous cases also the wake flow has tended to deflect to both sides as the flow approaches and begins to interact with the next rotor while additional expansion of the wakes is generating this is due to the interaction between the two rotors which diverts the wakes furthermore these tendencies are caused by the cumulative blockage effect in front of the rows and the flow of the fluid on both sides as shown in zone 1 the wake field behind the energy extractor is proportional to the incident source speed the closer separation distance d between the offshore wind turbines has caused a slipstreaming or the so called aerodynamics drafting which affects the following energy extractor performance the near wake is directly influenced by the presence of the wind turbine i e blade profile and rotor also the rotors arrays have shown an increase in the side local velocity even more in some scenarios the whole offshore wind farm s wake interactions should be taken into consideration and can extend to several kilometers as shown in zone 2 and its extension the average output powers of the rows have been normalized relative to the front row the three array layouts curves have shown improvements in the output power behavior for the rear rows due to the increasing speed which acts like a kort nozzle due to this effect the rear rows have proven to extract more power than the frontal rows of most cases as exhibited by the slope trend of the curves the seventh row has tended to reduce the output power while the eighth row has increased again to the nearest value as shown in fig 26 3 2 2 wave farm fig 27 shows the surface water field past the 80 wave energy convertors wecs and how each wave energy converter affects the surface velocity field arranged in 3 different layouts these are 4d with 5d 4d with 6d and 3d with 5d along the x axis and y axis as shown in fig 27 at a b and c respectively the figures show reduced water surface velocity in the downstream direction due to the energy extracted by all the extractors in the farm the analysis is applied on the output power of each row the average power of each row is normalized by the extracted power of the front upstream row the results are displayed in fig 28 for the three studied layouts about a 15 reduction occurs in the power extracted from the water waves between the upstream and downstream rows on the average for the three layouts 3 2 3 hybrid wind wave energy farm a comparison between the vawts and obs layouts has been conducted and detailed as shown in fig 29 a and b the velocity deficit behind the hybrid energy extractor whether wind or wave in the wake region is reduced gradually till the flow gets released and retains its streaming velocity when the incident wave is interacted with multiple wecs the wake interactions are measured based on the interaction factor or q factor as expected the array layouts performance is evaluated to show that the layout of 4d along the y axis with 5d along the x axis has the highest performance of 0 20 for the wind array and 0 36 for the wave array the layout of 4d along the y axis with 6d along the x axis shows a higher performance than that of the 3d along the y axis with 5d along the x axis which is the lowest by a 0 12 for the wind array and 2 21 for the wave array the three owts array layouts result in significant overall performances which are considered more constructive performances than those of the three wecs array layouts the optimal array layouts increase the output power by more than 14 0 the array layout is applied to the horns rev offshore wind farm as a real case as such the array layout of 4d with 5d along both the y axis with x axis respectively achieves a reduction of the farm s occupying surface area as shown in table 5 this reduction reaches 52 5 of the total farm surface area which reduces the capex just by arranging the existing extractors in a proper configuration the following table 6 shows a brief results comparison between the present study and similar related studies on the array layout optimization for offshore wind farms wave farms and combined wind wave energy farms nevertheless all the results from these researches and others are listed into the literature review similar behaviors of the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics characteristics of the wind energy extractors wakes and the wave energy extractors wakes are revealed by different researches 3 2 4 economic assessment as the offshore wind turbine uses a fixed substructure it offers a reduction of the total initial cost of around 21 0 appiott et al 2014 regarding the substructure manufacturing and installation only however the hybrid wind wave system will change the costs of different parameters i e concept definition design and development manufacturing installing exploiting and dismantling the total manufacturing cost which is a part of the initial cost ranges from 30 0 to 45 0 of the total project cost around 4 68 m i l l i o n u s d m w castro santos et al 2016 nevertheless there is also a great cost reduction for the hybrid wind wave system according to the life cycle cost which has been conducted on a hybrid wind wave system castro santos et al 2017 the following is revealed the lcoe in u s d m w h of the offshore wind system and the wave system are averaged and the wave system is 473 3 higher than the wind system while the lcoe of the hybrid wind wave system is averaged to be of the range of 31 5 34 7 lower than both the offshore wind system and wave system together moreover the total life cycle cost lcs in u s d of the offshore wind system is averaged too and the wave system is 351 4 higher than the wind system on the other hand the hybrid system is ranged from 66 5 to 69 0 lower than both the offshore wind and wave systems together as for the incomes assessment egypt does not have a specific feed in tariff for offshore wind or wave energy yet therefore the value of the offshore wind energy is considered as the feed in tariff for onshore wind energy based on the given data of the wind farm s cost the need for early stage financing is emphasized by such factors as competition for funding with other renewable and non renewable resources moreover it is interested with the risk associated with these types of projects their capital intensive nature and the general uncertainty of existing regulatory frameworks around the world the horns rev offshore wind farm which is the case study is given a 776 0 m w the estimated average energy cost is calculated using the feed in tariff of 0 0052 u s d k w h younes 2017 it is relative to each array layout regarding the gained power at the present work the evaluated spacing achieves an average power gain of more than 14 0 as shown in table 5 the gained power adds more income to the operating revenue of 4621 3 u s d h instead of 4040 1 u s d h for the existing offshore wind array there are increases in the farm operating income of 212 140 3 u s d h yearly additional to the 14 0 a simple cost management analysis reveals that the mentioned gain in turn is capable of reducing the energy payback time epbt significantly moreover a reduction of the overall farm occupying surface area is achieved by around 52 5 as shown in table 5 this reduction can reduce the project budget by around 15 75 of the total capital expenditure capex a simple comparative analysis of the offshore hybrid wind wave farm against a conventional power plant is conducted an existing steam power plant of 300 0 m w khalil 2008 is compared with an alternative renewable energy system the average provided output power of the steam power plant is 232 55 m w over a year and normalized the equivalent renewable system of 776 0 m w is estimated to consume 4020 68 t o n o f f u e l d a y this fuel has an estimated cost of 1 723 150 2 u s d d a y as per the fuel s local price up to date the fuel is also estimated to emit c o 2 residues of 332 9 t o n d a y the renewable energy system controls the resources of the fuel costs and fuel emissions in table 7 a comparison is made between an existing steam power plant khalil 2008 in egypt and the horns rev offshore wind farm it shows the amount of used and saved parameters while using a form of renewable energy i e fuel costs and fuel emissions it is worth noting that a full economic analysis has not been carried out due to either unavailability or the fact that certain data remain unspecified for every aspect relative to the involved country collecting this data is a difficult task as costs change constantly with developments in technology and much of the cost data is closely guarded by industry 4 conclusion and future works up to that end this paper assesses a preliminary numerical optimization of a hybrid wind wave energy farm on the egyptian mediterranean north coast the rans model is used in the analysis to accomplish its aim of designing the hybrid farm three major consecutive phases are applied in the first one numerical model verification is implemented and verified using a k epsilon k ε rng turbulence model to investigate the different separation distances d between energy extractors systematic simulations are applied to two turbine rotors then five of them different layouts for the spacing of the energy extractors in the transverse and longitudinal directions have been simulated the simulations reveal that a square staggered array configuration is the optimal array layout for the hybrid wind wave farm indeed the hybrid energy extractor either wind or wave layouts show reasonable output power values for both the wind and wave arrays the results evaluated an optimum spacing with the highest performance of 4d with 5d in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively eventually for future investigations a realistic wind and wave spectrum would be used to represent the environment irregularities in the real condition of the egyptian coast experimental investigation is highly recommended to improve the accuracy and reliability of the hybrid wind wave system moreover as an irregular wind wave layout is the best way to overcome the rear rows problems in the regular array a micro sitting optimization of the hybrid energy extractors would be more superior for the sake of the best overall efficiency authorship statement abdallah m ragab conceptualization and design of study resources investigation validation numerical

20583,hybrid wind wave farm systems integrate their capabilities to have higher and more reliable synergy than conventional renewable energy plants the energy extractors array layout is a pivotal factor for the output power the aim of this work is to quantify the benefits of combining the wave energy and wind energy into a hybrid system on the egyptian mediterranean north coasts it also aims to investigate the optimal array layout of a hybrid wind wave energy farm numerical analyses using the rans model are applied to different cases regarding the array layout and spacing in order to increase their performance the results indicate that the most optimal array layout is a square staggered one with a spacing of 4 0 rotor diameters along the y axis and 5 0 rotor diameters along the x axis the revealed optimal layout provides more than a 14 4 increase in performance for the wind and wave arrays compared to an existing offshore wind farm with 52 5 lesser farm occupying surface area

energy converter 1 introduction in recent years different offshore renewable energy ore sources have been combined into a common system to meet a larger portion of the world s energy demand these integrated systems are advantageous for many countries energy self sufficiency management strategies numerous researches have focused on the compatibility of offshore wind turbines in general and wave energy extractors in particular nonetheless the wind wave combination systems are harmonious in terms of the synergy of strong energies perez collazo and iglesias 2012 perez collazo et al 2013 casale et al 2012 several synergies were achieved including increasing energy yield pérez collazo et al 2015 lowering capital and operating expenses capex opex and sharing transportation operation and maintenance o m costs pérez collazo et al 2015 astariz et al 2015a on a larger scale the wind wave arrays have been combined together using various systems the wind wave system can be combined in three systems pérez collazo et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates the systems used to combine wind and wave energy extractors the co located system is most likely being erected for existing offshore wind farms that have wave energy converters wecs deployed separately from offshore wind turbines the hybrid energy system is where both technologies share the same substructure this device is most likely to be found in newly built energy farms finally the combined energy island method incorporates the two prior cases by integrating floating wind turbines and floating wecs the combined offshore wind wave arrays have critical factors that affect farm performance i e array layout configuration separating distances between extractors number of extractors and energy sources direction andrés et al 2014 in energy farms various array layout scenarios i e linear a b square c triangle d and rhombus e are adopted as shown in fig 2 the separating distances between extractors on the other hand differ as a function of the extractor s diameter d and the number of multiplications n the number of extractors is determined depending on the farm s necessary output capacity another consideration is the incident energy angle θ of the source direction with respect to the layout angle β all of these factors interact to influence the extracted energy and the induced wake which can increase losses a thorough understanding of each extractor s flow control wake interaction behind the extractors and wake decays with their dissipating rate is needed to enforce an appropriate wake mitigation strategy for the extractors array the key constraint influencing wind farm efficiency is wake interactions that are taken into account in wind farm design eliminating wake losses due to wake interactions is dependent on the array configuration and distance between extractors the separating distances between rotors are usually 6d to 10d in the stream wind direction and 3d to 4d in the crosswind direction

must not overlap in order to prevent power losses kotb and soliman 1993 owing to the aerodynamic efficiency of each rotor kotb and haq 1992 several studies have discussed the importance of the spacing between the turbines seeking an optimal layout kotb m a and soliman h a in 1993 kotb and soliman 1993 numerically investigate the performance of staggered hawt rotors with a low overlap area the used model is based on combining momentum blade element and vortex theories the study reveals that the overlapping disk area between the two rotors increases the power deficit the front rotor blocks the rear rotor and reduces its power by less than 15 of 0 26 overlapping area ratio between them raúl et al in 2009 cal et al 2010 experimentally investigate the wakes interaction between wind turbines in a wind tunnel the array of three by three is separated by 3d and 7d in the crosswind and downwind directions respectively bartl j in 2012 bartl et al 2012 experiments with two separating distances 3d and 5d between both a front and a rear wind turbine meanwhile the downstream axial measurements for the model are measured at three locations including a 1d 3d and 5d respectively to investigate the local velocity deficit with its corresponding turbulence intensities these values are significantly higher for the rear turbine than for the frontal one the reduction of power coefficients are about 31 and 33 of the power extracted of the unobstructed front turbine corresponding to the separating distance 3d and 5d respectively regarding the layouts shaheen et al in 2015 shaheen et al 2015 confirm a 34 more increase in performance just by arranging a cluster of savonius turbines in an efficient triangular shape compared to their isolated counterparts shaheen and shaaban in 2016 shaheen and abdallah 2016 have numerically simulated and designed a new efficient array layout that consisted of a triangular patterned cluster of three savonius vawts then they simulated a multiplied cluster of 9 and 27 turbines to develop a wind farm the implemented simulations of the developed triangular arrays layouts kept the same arrangement as the individual cluster that was used before the results showed a successive enhancement of performance while enlarging the farm which resulted in the same power enhancement ratio the wake accumulation caused by the turbines wake interactions in the wind farm showed a decrease in the energy density downstream by 40 and more barthelmie et al 2007b 2010 improvements of wave farms like those of wind farms depend on similar constraints regarding the efficiency point falnes in 1980 falnes 1980 then falnes and budal in 1982 falnes and budal 1982 have proven that performance can be affected by the array layout configuration jung lyul lee and hyuck min kweon in 2012 kweon and lee 2012 have studied the wake interactions between the circular and linear arrays of buoys results show that a linear array is sensitive to incident angles unlike a circular one de andrés a d et al in 2014 andrés et al 2014 have numerically evaluated that the separating distances play a main role in performance however the triangular and square array layouts are favorable for multi directional and uni directional waves respectively silvia bozzi et al in 2017 bozzi et al 2017 have simulated the hydrodynamic interactions between heavings wecs with different separating distances i e 5d 10d and 30d with different layouts i e linear square and rhombus layouts more specifically these parameters affect overall performance and should be considered alejandro lópez ruiz in 2018 lópez ruiz et al 2018a has numerically analyzed the performance of 9 overtopping wecs using three different array layouts i e aligned staggered and arrow layouts in the three spacing of 2d 4d and 6d results show that the performances of the separating distances 4d and 6d for the arrow layout are quite close however the 6d was the most optimal one nevertheless the wave arrays factors play a vital role in the farm performance the factors studied are optimal array layout lópez ruiz et al 2018b child and venugopal 2010 child 2011 moarefdoost et al 2017 separating distance lópez ruiz et al 2018b babarit 2010 and wave direction child and venugopal 2010 child 2011 in recent years co located wave wind systems have been investigated with operational offshore wind farms astariz s et al in 2015 astariz et al 2015b 2015c 2015d propose a periphery distributed array pda as a novel combination to co locating the wecs with an operational offshore wind farm a numerical analysis is implemented for studying the wave height reduction with three spacings for the wecs i e 2 2d 5d and 8 3d astariz et al 2015d and 6 2d 3 8d and 2 2d astariz et al 2015b also the array layout is investigated for both an angle layout and an arc layout astariz et al 2015c the results prove that a wave height reduction within the farm increases the accessible time by up to 82 for the o m astariz et al 2015d the layout is essential for reducing the significant wave height by up to 40 astariz et al 2015b while the wave height reduction is achieved by around 13 5 this reduction improves accessibility for the alpha ventus and lincs by 82 and for the bard 1 and horns rev1 by 70 which increases the operational time up to 90 annually astariz et al 2015c astariz s et al in 2015 astariz and iglesias 2015 compare between the pda and nda to find out which one increases the uniform wave height reduction for more accessibility the study reveals that nda provides a more uniformly distributed wave height reduction by around 5 this reduction is reflected on the wecs with the additional power of 16 5 astariz s and iglesias g in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016a analyze the power production of a co located wecs system their results show an 87 reduction in downtime and a 6 in power variability achieved astariz s et al in 2016 astariz et al 2016 investigate wave height reduction and the shadow effect of a co located system which reflected on the operation and maintenance o m they conclude that farm layout is crucial since a square layout with small separating distances same as that of the horns rev1 farm achieves the largest wave height reduction required astariz s et al in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016b assess the benefits of co locating 56 overtopping wecs using a pda array the results show that the energy yield per unit area increases by 3 4 relative to that of a standalone farm however the shadow effect increases accessibility by 20 70 of a uniform distribution astariz s and iglesias g in 2016 astariz and iglesias 2016c investigate a co located array of overtopping wecs this simulation uses a uda of wecs in an appropriate array configuration spaced by 2 2d their result achieves a wave height reduction of 17 with differences between the first and the last rows astariz s et al in 2016 astariz et al 2016 improve the shadow effect to increase accessible time by using a pda co located system as revealed by statistics the renewable energy in egypt expands extensively since the egyptian s share inflation is quite impressive while the use of fossil fuels steeps this energy share is very interesting compared to the global share which has been ranging between 10 and 35 up to 2022 30 of electric 2018 the egyptian s gross electrical generation from renewable sources has increased from 5 8 in 2016 to 20 0 in 2022 e g wind energy is 12 0 of the total of 100 and is expected to reach 42 0 by 2035 e g wind energy is 14 0 of the total of 100 in 2019 the reliability on renewable energy reduced the use of fossil fuel by 4 3 m i l l i o n t o n s as well as reduced emissions e g c o 2 by 11 3 m i l l i o n t o n s new and renewable energy authority 2019 economically speaking offshore renewable energy competes with conventional energy for its consistency dependability and low cost funding the capital expenditure capex of renewable energy has a higher range than its conventional counterparts it reflects on the levelized cost of energy lcoe which is still high worldwide therefore renewable energy is adopted to reduce those expenses as much as possible significant reductions in the feed in tariff are recorded over time which is obviously very promising these reductions result from different parameters e g the increase of technology s reliability the reduction of materials prices the large scale of projects the extractor s size etc the developments of offshore wind turbines are scaling up significantly especially with the large diameter of 222 0 m of 14 0 m w gamesa 2020 the operational costs are dropped which provides more competitive energy prices feed in tariff of the offshore wind technology has been reduced by 29 0 from 2010 to 2019 a and renewable power ge 2019 it was reduced to almost 9 0 only in 2019 international renewable energy agency 2019 while it is suggested that it will be reduced to 29 0 in 2021 compared to the onshore wind of 18 0 only during the same year then 11 2 in 2023 for the offshore wind a and renewable power ge 2019 nevertheless the offshore wind farms have many aspects involved in the overall project costs as shown in fig 3 these different shares would be changed over time which corresponds to the developments in the technology they are also affected by the scale of the project whether it is large with high benefits or it is a utility or pilot project generally preliminary costs are related to project planning design and developments then capital costs are encountered for construction transportation installation and assembly in addition the extractors costs are included as well i e the cost of rotor tower wec substructure power take off pto mechanism floating system mooring system electrical power and control systems safety system fernandez et al 2014 and auxiliaries equipment nielsen 2003 nevertheless the electrical infrastructure has two main parameters gonzalez rodriguez 2017 transmission cable systems have an inner array an export hv subsea cable and an onshore hv cable substation systems have high voltage alternating or direct currents hvac or hvdc an hv connection and an onshore substation system based on the yearly cash flow morgan et al 2003 tudy of the costs o 2020 slengesol et al 2010 rather than the capex itself the opex of a typical offshore wind wave farm breakdown throughout its lifetime is categorized into different aspects these o m parameters include maintenance working boat s expenses electricity and other costs insurance taxes legal site rent administration miscellaneous etc and decommissioning a long time ago egypt had an ambitious strategy for renewable energy egyptian electricity holding company 2018 which aimed at making contribute 40 0 of the total power production by 2035 a stratigy of the r 2020 egypt has long coastlines that are not used for any offshore renewable applications however the capital expenditure capex for this technology is very high these aspects motivate the present work to investigate cost reduction factors one main factor boosting revenue is by using a hybrid system i e wave energy combined with offshore wind energy however until today no studies have been dedicated to the possibility of designing a hybrid farm in egypt due to the lack of any provided studies in the hybrid wind wave farm field the authors have chosen to undertake this task this task involves a studying the possibilities of using the egyptian coastlines for designing and erecting an offshore wind farm on the red sea and the mediterranean sea b proposing a hybrid wind wave farm to reduce the capex opex and c implementing a numerical analysis for optimizing the array layout of the proposed hybrid wind wave farm nevertheless the main contribution of this work is figuring out the possibilities of designing renewable energy applications on egyptian coasts moreover its contribution is optimizing an array layout of a hybrid wind wave energy farm this farm is to be located on the egyptian mediterranean north coasts the novelty of this work lies in specifying out the most optimal array layout of a hybrid wind wave farm most of the previous researches based on the literature review focus on finding out the most optimal array layout of an offshore wind farm or for a wave farm although few researches focus on optimizing a hybrid wind wave array only one array i e a wind array or a wave array is applied however there is no application or research on this point tackling the problem especially on the egyptian coasts the findings of this paper are categorized into two sections firstly is that it is possible to implement the renewable energy application on the egyptian coast especially the north coast secondly an offshore hybrid wind wave farm would use the array layout of a staggered square with the separation distances between the energy extractor of 4 0 and 5 0 of the rotor diameter on both prevailing and perpendicular on the energy directions respectively the main research question is to find out is it financially profiting to go with the renewable applications therefore the main question here is what is the most optimal array layout of an offshore hybrid wind wave farm and its importance regarding the cost reductionof the hybrid farm the research question is handled by putting a methodology considering three phases at the beginning available data about offshore wind application and wave energy application data are collected e g types power take off weight volume location depth etc then a decision is made concerning the use of wind energy application instead of wave energy application and its data availability each phase is explained in the following methodology 2 methodology the problem of optimizing a hybrid wind wave farm layout has various constraints e g farm location number of extractors array layout extractors separating distance and incident wind wave directions an optimization framework is obtained through sequences of simulations these numerical simulations are divided into three main successive phases as illustrated in the flow chart shown in fig 4 in phase one the numerical model is verified and validated then in phase two the model is investigated to find out the most optimum layouts and spacings finally the full hybrid farm layout and performances are examined in phase three 2 1 numerical model regarding the objective applying hybrid wind wave systems would not be similar on both the egyptian mediterranean sea and the red sea this is due to the nature of each site a wind wave farm could be applied in the egyptian red sea through a co located floating system the system may use an independent wecs array to be combined with the zafarana or gabal el zait operational wind farms this is due to the widespread existence of a coral reef in the red sea on the other hand the egyptian mediterranean sea does not have any wind energy applications yet a suggestion for a new farm is to be an offshore hybrid wind wave farm wind atlas for egypt provides reliable and accurate wind energy potential data sets in the mediterranean sea based on the egyptian offshore data the wind speed ranges from 4 0 to 5 0 m s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 meanwhile the egyptian mediterranean offshore wave potential energy measured by the satellite altimetry maps report a mean significant wave height h a from 1 0 to 4 0 m with a corresponding average mean wave period t a from 4 0 to 8 0 s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 2 1 1 wind turbine model setup a straight bladed vertical axis wind turbine is selected for the present study the blade transverse section is naca 0021 type rotor particulars are shown in table 1 castelli et al 2011 a computational scheme for this rotor is shown in fig 5 with domains for the whole rotor as well as its blades boundary conditions include a uniform incident speed of 9 0 m s with a wind direction heading from 0 0 d e g r e e as shown in table 2 the rotor torque coefficient c m is calculated as shown in equation 1 1 c m m 1 2 ρ v 2 a l where m is the torque n m ρ is the air density k g m 3 v is the air speed m s a is the rotor swept area given by a d h in m 2 d is the overall rotor diameter m h is the rotor height m l is the reference length m and also v is the kinematics viscosity m 2 s the power coefficient c p is computed in terms of the tip speed ratio λ and the rotor torque m as given by equation 2 2 c p m ω 1 2 ρ a v 3 c m λ where λ ω r v ω is the angular density r a d s and r is the rotor tip radius m in 2d simulations the reference area a is taken as the turbine diameter d and the reference length l as the turbine radius gomez and montlaur 2014 the time lapse is accounted for every 5 0 d e g r e e of the rotor rotation instead of 1 0 d e g r e e to cut down computational time the corresponding minimum time step given by δ t 5 is 0 002 s to achieve full 7 0 rotations as shown in equation 3 gomez and montlaur 2014 3 δ t 5 5 ω r p s 360 5 6 r p m 2 1 2 wakes interaction simulations the effect of rotor generated wake on neighboring rotors is examined in this section two scenarios are investigated these are side by side rotors and tandem rotors shown in fig 6 a and b respectively three separating distances are suggested 3d 5d and 7d and examined for both scenarios it is expected that the aft rotors in a tandem arrangement slow down due to the shadow or blockage effects of the front rotor while the side rotor will remain unaffected based on experiments carried out in reference cal et al 2010 for similar arrangements 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 reduction in angular speed are assumed for the three separating distances used in the present numerical study fig 7 a and b show 5 rotors arranged in 2 and 3 rows respectively the rotors in the back rows have reduced angular velocity by an amount ranging from 4 5 to 8 of the upstream rotors values as per reference cal et al 2010 noting that the rotors in the same row have the same angular speeds 2 1 3 wind wave offshore farm wake model different optimization methods are involved to cover more successful optimization techniques successful optimization methods for the owts array layout are followed based on the given data i e swamy et al in 2020 swamy et al 2020 azlan et al in 2021 azlan et al 2021 wang and campbell in 2020 wang and campbell 2020 sickler in 2020 sickler 2020 gualtieri in 2019 gualtieri 2019 and dou et al in 2020 dou et al 2020 on the other hand optimization methods for the wecs array layout is used too i e neshat et al in 2020 neshat et al 2020a lyu et al in 2019 lyu et al 2019 neshat et al in 2019 neshat et al 2019a neshat et al in 2019 neshat et al 2019b and neshat et al in 2020 neshat et al 2020b ultimately the model moves from the airfoil flow scale to the turbine rotor scale then the rotors interactions scale and finally the wind farm scale is implemented once the minimum range of separating distances is determined any desired farm output power could be considered using the involved number of wind turbines throughout this part a case study uses the horns rev1 offshore wind farm which employs horizontal axis turbines interacting together generating wake behaviors the overall wind farm consists of an eight column by ten row array approximately 7 from north south with a layout of a rhomboid shape and separation distances of 7d along both the x axis and y axis recently several studies have attempted to examine the farm wake to optimize and understand the horns rev1 this offshore farm was chosen as a case study by many astariz et al 2015b wu and porté agel 2015 peña et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 vigueras rodríguez et al 2012 sorensen et al 2007 in particular a square staggered array layout of vertical axis turbines describes the participating model the overall farm s domain uses a length l f of 9600 m and a width w f of 6000 m representing the stationary rectangle wind model the array layout is located in the center 3200 m far away from the inlet as shown in fig 8 from different array layouts the best three layouts are selected numerically depending on the highest power performance of each layout these spacings will be used in the following cases to construct the full wind wave hybrid farm layout according to the layouts the farms are arranged in a square configuration to provide higher performances astariz et al 2015c meanwhile the staggered layout has been selected for placing the hybrid extractors due to their higher exposure to more energetic incident sources wu and porté agel 2013 and to minimize the wake effect hansen 2014 wu and porté agel 2017 it is also selected for making the maximum possible benefit of wake avoidance wind turbine parameterization for the present work considers the turbine rotors as solid disk obstacles to the wind flow the turbine rotors are represented as cylinders to overcome the computational complexities as those used for the actuator disk model adm wu and porté agel 2013 wu and porté agel 2011 port e agel et al 2013 they are used to determine the aerodynamics coefficients i e c p for every turbine as shown in equation 5 to be used in equation 4 the rotor solidity σ is defined as σ n c r r o t o r it is taken as 0 499 same as in castelli et al 2010 2011 gomez and montlaur 2014 4 p 1 2 ρ a v 3 c p where n is the number of blades 3 c is the airfoil chord 85 8 m m and r r o t o r is the rotor radius 515 0 m m castelli et al 2010 2011 the induction factor a is numerically estimated based on the adm which is proportional to the mean velocity difference as shown in equation 6 5 c p 4 a 1 a 2 6 a 0 5 1 v r e a r v f r o n t where v f r o n t is the upstream velocity and v r e a r is the downstream velocity of the wind turbine rotor the wave modeling is considered similar to the wind modeling due to the physical structure of the hybrid wind wave unit as mentioned previously wecs are supported on the owts substructure therefore the same array layout of the owts is used to be that of the wecs array layout an ellipsoid floating body is the best shape to describe the wave energy extractor in three dimensional space while the simple circle surface is the real description of the ellipsoid wec non dimensional analyses are applied to the wecs array layouts to be generalized with any farm scale as like those of the owts array layouts as well wave surface modeling is implemented with the interaction of the waves motions and the wecs can be shown this method has been used before in different studies and revealed interesting interactions between the waves motions and the wecs with different scopes of analysis in this case the linear airy wave theory is used to describe the incident sinusoidal wave however the numerical model takes the wave motion behaviors instantaneously the surface wave velocity is measured around each extractor to measure the available and the extracted power from each individual wave energy extractor a standalone wec 1 0 m in diameter is used to measure the expected power that can be extracted from each wave energy extractor to be a standard value for further comparisons then each involved array layout is assumed to provide the same amount of the extracted power from the wave energy with respect to the number of extractors however due to the wave interaction with the wecs with different configurations it differs in values so the total amount of the energy extracted by all wecs through each array layout is divided by the amount of energy extracted by the standalone standard wec multiplied by the number of the used wecs through the wave array which is 80 extractors the extracted power from each extractor is computed numerically based on the airy wave theory using equation 7 while the airy wave theory describes the wave parameters in different perspectives the present study is interested in the incident wave celerity to be used in the given equation 7 however the wave height also is used instead of the celerity in different techniques that model uses a two dimensional space to describe the wave surface height elevation with respect to the wave celerity and its changes due to the interactions of the wave with the wave energy extractor and the offshore wind turbine substructure regarding the different array layout configurations so based on the linear airy wave theory the present methodology relies on the surface water velocity to describe different wave parameters as they are related in the airy wave theory nevertheless the technique is based on the x y cartesian coordinate system in a two dimensional analysis where z is the elevation perpendicular on the seabed the plane of the x y domain plane is the main perspective of view as all extractors would be monitored out of the simulation therefore the x z domain or the y z domain does not describe the whole wind farm and wave farm it is not applicable to apply all the wave parameters into two dimensional space simulations i e water depth acceleration wave height and wave period etc previous successful research had followed the same concept and simulated the wave parameters into two dimensional domains e g astariz et al 2015a 2015b 2015c 2015d 2016 astariz and iglesias 2015 2016b 2016c hence modeling the wave domain in three dimensional space requires a high computational power to implement all the wave parameters of the used wave theory similar to wind rotors the wave energy converter wec is modeled as a marine artificial obstacle described as circular shapes with diameters assumed to be 1 0 m for non dimensionality so the device always exposes the same width against the incident waves and is passively oriented along the direction of the wave propagation the eighty wecs are shown in fig 8 here the transmission coefficient k t which is based on the average of 0 40 koutandos et al 2005 and 0 50 evans 1976 used to be 0 45 k t is defined as the amount of energy absorbed from a wave and it varies from 0 i e 100 of incident wave energy absorbed to 100 no energy absorbed the incident waves based on the egyptian mediterranean north coast have an average significant wave height h a of 2 50 m with a corresponding average mean wave period t a of 6 0 s ozturk and norman 2004 mosetti et al 1994 ayat 2013 shehata et al 2018 the maximum corresponding wave celerity c is 2 960 m s ayat 2013 shehata et al 2018 queffeulou and croize fillon 2009 ralston et al 2013 zodiatise a 2014 the available wave power is given by equation 7 ram et al 2016 horikawa 1978 venugopal et al 2017 7 p 1 8 ρ g h a 2 c g t h where c g t h is the group velocity defined for any finite depth of water and period as shown in equation 8 8 c g t h 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h g t 2 π tanh k h where h a is the wave height m k is the wave number h is the water depth m ρ is the sea water density equal to 1025 k g m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant 2 2 model mesh verification a high resolution mesh setup using a tetrahedral unstructured fine mesh is adopted a higher mesh density is required in the rotating zones where the flow interacts with the three airfoil blades as shown in fig 9 therefore the far field region has a coarse mesh of 1280 m m maximum face size then the face size for the hub area is 9 0 m m also a fine mesh of 3 5 m m is used for controlling the surface circle areas the three airfoil blades have a trailing edge these blades have refinements of 0 03 m m for their edge as shown in fig 10 meanwhile 6 0 quadrilaterals inflated layers are found around airfoil blades of 0 0125 m m as a first layer height furthermore an extra additional mesh refinement is used around the three airfoil blades consisting of 5 0 layers a mesh independence study is implemented on several models with different mesh ranges based on previous studies that used models of mesh elements the spatial domain discretization ranges from approximately 600 000 to 1 000 000 elements are recommended castelli et al 2011 these mesh values are classified into a coarse mesh of 500 000 to 700 000 elements a medium mesh of 700 000 to 900 000 elements and a fine mesh of 900 000 to 1 100 000 elements the mesh factors mfs are levelled to change the mesh densities by 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 and 1 50 to simplify the comparison between the meshes element numbers and the power coefficient c p as shown in fig 11 a however results from all meshing cases are compared with experimental results castelli et al 2010 i e the pressure coefficient along the airfoil blades and power coefficient c p with a tip speed ratio t s r of λ 2 5 as shown in fig 11 b the model mesh using an approximately 1 193 349 elements with a mesh factor of 1 25 is found to achieve precise results as shown in fig 11 the mesh has been changed according to the different configurations i e twin cluster and full farms regarding verification the meshes used are 2 367 705 and 3 158 844 elements for the twin and cluster models respectively however the used mesh has approximately 4 500 000 elements the models of eighty wind wave extractors are the extractors represented by a circular shape for simplicity 2 3 code validation the code is validated with respect to different turbulent models these values are compared against the same experimental model data castelli et al 2010 the rng k epsilon k ε two equations turbulence model with scalable wall function near wall treatment function is found to have a significant accuracy over the other models during all simulations as shown in fig 12 two transport equations are used to construct the k epsilon k ε approach where the turbulence kinetic energy k is given by equation 9 and its dissipation rate epsilon ε is given by equation 10 the equations are obtained from fluent 2012

discussion in the standalone rotor s simulation ragab et al 2020 the upstream incident flow pressure and velocities clearly are recovered downstream at approximately 6 5d to 7 5d fig 13 a b and c show the velocity field variations past the twin rotor working side by side at 3d 5d and 7d lateral distances regions of low and high velocities are displayed for the longitudinal direction the rear rotors are examined at the shadow effect of the front rotors as shown in fig 14 a b and c respectively inside zone 1 the wake interaction is reduced while the spacing is increased due to the flow recovery after a sufficient distance a sufficient downstream spacing is required to be between 5d and 7d for minimum power losses that affect both rotors negatively also the front rotors experience flow blockage due to the obstacle caused by the flow downstream rear rotor which blocks and slows the incident flow path the power decreases when the spacing gets smaller this is clearly shown in table 3 moreover a comparison between the two rotors in terms of the pressure absorption shows the pressure drop behavior of each rotor the side by side rotors along the y axis reveal that there are no significant change in pressure coefficient c p r values between the 3d 5d and 7d spacings as they are almost 1 0 for both rotors as shown in fig 15 in a b and c respectively the front rotors along the x axis reveal that the c p r for the 3d configuration is 2 9 higher than that of the 5d as shown in fig 16 a and b respectively while the differences between the 5d and 7d separation distances is 1 0 only as shown in b and c respectively also the aft rotors along the x axis show that the 5d has as much as 27 0 higher power than that of the 3d separation distances as shown in a and b respectively but a changing value of 13 53 of the value occurs between the 5d and the 7d separation distances as shown in b and c respectively ragab et al 2020 based on these results the longitudinal spacing along the x axis should not exceed 7d as the pressure coefficient c p r is recovered as observed in fig 16 likewise the 5d spacing also shows a high value less than that of the 7d with a small difference between them furthermore the 6d selected to be involved is assumed to give a high performance according to the references on the other hand the 3d spacing along the y axis shows the highest performance as shown in fig 15 the difference between the 5d and the 3d is high as shown before so the 3d and 4d spacings are used to increase the simulations possibilities same as referenced therefore these distances are applied as least as possible in order to reduce the array s occupying surface area 3 1 multiple rotors wakes interactions in this case the two row layout is used to examine the effect of concentrated velocities in the passage between the rotors at the front row on the second row as shown in fig 17 and fig 18 at zones 2 3 the three row layout examines the third row interaction with the array which has much wake interaction than the two row cases as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 this speed passage is formed due to the flow speed changes around the rotor as found in kotb and aldoss 1991 it is noticed that the local velocities around all the rotors are slightly increased in the lateral direction at the rotor plane these increases are shown in figs 17 and 18 at zones 1 4 5 and 7 and also shown in figs 19 and 20 at zones 1 3 4 5 6 and 8 these cumulative velocities keep increasing and providing higher velocity at the passages between rotors these increases are shown in figs 19 and 20 at zones 2 7 and in figs 17 and 18 at zones 2 3 and 6 the front row causes a velocity deficit due to its wake that affects the rear row which reduces the generated power while increasing the spacing along the x axis leads to reducing the wake interactions for both rotors and gradually increasing the axial velocity also a blockage effect is noticed by 0 5d distance in front of the rotor with a lower velocity upstream as the spacing is reduced the staggered layout shows effectiveness in reducing the spacing to 5d rather than to 7d which reduces the array s surface area therefore it is obvious from examining the results that the higher turbulent variability inside the layout is due to the three rows which is obviously higher than that of the two rows it is also noticed that the wake deflects slightly toward the direction of rotation due to the inducement of the rotor s rotation and this is clearly observed at aldoss and kotb 1988 it is worth mentioning that the two cases are studied to investigate the flow interaction on the turbines rotors average corresponding power coefficients c p are numerically recorded from the moment coefficients c m for all rotors in every simulated model the corresponding t s r uses the maximum value λ 2 50 as shown in fig 12 a summary of the rotors power coefficients c p of each array layout is collected in table 3 regarding the power coefficients c p rotor 01 shows the highest value at the layouts of 3d with 6d for the two rows while the three rows are the 3d with 5d along the y axis and x axis the rotor 02 exhibits the highest value at the layout of the two rows 3d with 6d and the same goes for the 3d with 7d for the three rows the rotor 03 shows the highest value at the layout of the two rows 3d with 6d and 4d with 5d for the three rows while the rotor 04 shows the highest value at the layout 3d with 5d for the two rows and for the three rows it is the 4d with 5d the rotor 05 shows the highest value for the two rows layout of 4d with 5d and 4d with 6d for the three rows moreover the average power coefficients c p of the overall layouts show that the 3d with 5d is the highest then the 4d with 5d along the y axis and x axis for the two and three rows respectively in case of the two rows as shown in fig 21 a the 3d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances have a maximum and minimum c p of 0 395 and 0 361 for the separating distance 5d and 7d respectively the array average c p has slightly decreased between the 5d and 6d separating distance by 0 8 for the last one also the value is decreased for the 7d over 6d separating distance by 0 26 in general the rear row has a 4 33 higher average c p than the front row for the three separating distances however for the two rows as shown in fig 21 b the 4d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum c p of 0 394 and 0 296 for the spacing 5d and 6d respectively the array average c p has decreased for the 6d to be 5 08 less than that of the 5d separating distance the average c p of the 7d has increased by 3 62 more than that of the 6d separating distance meanwhile the rear row has shown an average c p for the three separating distances of 0 96 only more than that of the front row whereas regarding the three rows as shown in fig 22 a the 3d separating distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum c p of 0 363 and 0 125 for the 7d spacing it is also observed that the array average c p has decreased to 3 47 for the 6d less than that of the 5d separating distance with a reduction of 2 29 for the 7d over the 6d separation distance the rear rows have shown an average c p change for the three separating distances only 0 43 increased for the second row while 44 79 decreased for the third row while as shown in fig 22 b the 4d separation distance along the y axis for the three separating distances has shown a maximum and minimum power coefficients c p of 0 368 and 0 136 for the 5d and 7d spacing respectively the array average c p has decreased by 2 85 for the 6d less than that of the 5d separating distance while the 7d has decreased by 10 11 over the 6d separating distance the rear rows have shown that the average c p changed for the three separating distances a 2 93 increase in value for the second row while a 29 44 has decreased for the third row regarding the spacing between the energy extractors and how the rotor could be affected when relocated along both directions the rate of change roc analyses the turbine wake decay which is influenced by the neighboring rotors wakes this analysis describes the power coefficient c p changes of each involved rotor relative to the change in separating distances d however an average of every array is used along the x axis and the y axis the rate of change d c p d d is determined across the arrays with accordance to the directions the average power coefficient c p a v g of each rotor is divided by the corresponding separating distance d of the neighboring rotor on both axes as d c p d x and d c p d y along the x axis and the y axis respectively the rate of change d c p d d is quantified as shown in equation 12 while the relation is adjusted for the changeable spacing along the x axis and y axis as shown in equations 13 and 14 respectively 12 d c p d d 0 n c p n c p o δ d 13 d c p d x d c p n d c p o δ x 14 d c p d y d c p n d c p o δ y where d c p d d is the power coefficient c p per separation distance d d c p d x is the rate of change along the x axis d c p d y is the rate of change along the y axis c p n is the c p of the neighbor turbine c p o is the c p of the specified turbine and δ d δ x δ y is the separation distance d notice that δ d is the spacing in general at both directions while δ x and δ y is the separation distance along the x axis and the y axis respectively for the case of the two rows with the 3d separating distance along the y axis as shown in fig 23 a the 6d separating distance along the x axis shows an average amount of 74 9 d c p d x lower than that of the 5d also a 55 37 reduction of the 5d separating distance along the y axis occurs for the 6d the 7d separating distance along the x axis shows that an amount of 78 9 d c p d x is higher than that of the 6d meanwhile in case of the separating distance along the y axis it has increased by 50 76 of d c p d x at the 7d separating distance over the 6d one followed by the 4d separating distance along the y axis the 6d separating distance along the x axis provides a higher gain over the 5d by 109 26 the 6d separating distance along the y axis shows a higher amount of 163 05 d c p d x than that of the 5d in the other direction the 7d separating distance along the x axis has a 67 7 d c p d x decrease over the 6d the same slightly lower value occurs between the 7d separating distance along the y axis and the 6d of 67 18 while the three rows case with the 3d separating distance along the y axis as shown in fig 23 b the 6d separating distance along the x axis shows an average amount of 5 34 d c p d x lower than that of the 5d also the 6d separating distance along the y axis is 13 16 higher than that of the 5d meanwhile the 7d separating distance along the x axis shows an 8 67 d c p d x lower than that of the 6d the 7d separating distance along the y axis has increased by 18 1 over that of the 6d moreover for the 4d separating distance along the y axis the 6d along the x axis is 8 52 less than that of the 5d the 6d along the y axis shows a higher amount of 10 02 d c p d x than that of the 5d in the other direction the 7d along the x axis has increased by 35 47 over the 6d s and the 7d along the y axis has also increased by 78 82 over the 6d s another approach towards calculating the effect of the wake interactions is through analyzing the power captured ratio p c r the p c r is used to assess the energy source for the comparison between different array layouts this is given by the q factor which describes the non dimensional power captured ratio p c r the q factor is given by equation 15 15 q n 1 n p n n p 0 where n is the number of energy converters in the farm p n is the power absorbed by the n th device in the array and p 0 is the power absorbed by an individual converter acting in isolation as a constant reference as shown in fig 24 the separation distances d between rotors are small as the power production is increased however this behavior is unlikely and unexpected the staggered layout provides the backward rows with more incident flow velocities the staggered layout makes the backward rows benefit from the velocities concentration at the passages in between each two rotors of the frontal rows so a recommendation made here is to locate the rotors in a staggered layout close enough to each other with certain limitations also in case of the two rotors aligned behind each other as shown in fig 6 it is expected that the extracted power from the rear rotor is less than that of the frontal rotor the extracted power gets increased whereas the separation distance d between them is increased as well in case of the two rows of rotors aligned exactly in line with each other as the rear rotors are located at the front rotor s shadow it is expected that the average output power of the rear row will be less than the average output power of the front row the average power variations result from the blockage effect in case of the two rows located behind each other but in a staggered layout as shown in fig 7 the average output power for the rear row will be more slightly increased than the average output power of the front row this effect is a result of the higher velocities at the passages between the front row s rotors as shown in table 4 the staggered layout provides more overall output power but in case of the rotors which have an in line layout as shown in fig 6 b power losses occur the separation distance 3d along the x axis has a 39 55 power loss then 13 52 and 0 72 power losses for both the 5d and 7d respectively nevertheless in case of the three rows arrays the layout performance of the spacing 3d with 5d is 6 47 lower than that of the 4d with 6d also the layout of the spacing 4d with 6d is 2 82 lower than that of the 4d with 5d the selected separating distances are the 4d with 5d along the y axis and the x axis then the 4d with 6d along the y axis and x axis and finally the 3d with 5d along the y axis and x axis respectively to be used as a guidance to complete the optimization process 3 2 hybrid offshore wind wave farm the hybrid wind wave farm is divided into the offshore wind turbines array and the wave energy converters array both arrays are simulated separately to describe how the energy extractors are affected by the wake interactions offshore wind and wave layouts have their specified spacings from previous cases 3 2 1 offshore wind farm the rotors wake behaviors have a velocity deficit occurring right behind the rotor in the longitudinal direction downstream the rotors wakes of the frontal rows have shown more wakes interaction behaviors than at the back region while the rear rotors have shown a weaker wake it is noticed that the increased velocities at the passages in between every two rotors as depicted in fig 25 at a b and c have been expected as is in the previous cases also the wake flow has tended to deflect to both sides as the flow approaches and begins to interact with the next rotor while additional expansion of the wakes is generating this is due to the interaction between the two rotors which diverts the wakes furthermore these tendencies are caused by the cumulative blockage effect in front of the rows and the flow of the fluid on both sides as shown in zone 1 the wake field behind the energy extractor is proportional to the incident source speed the closer separation distance d between the offshore wind turbines has caused a slipstreaming or the so called aerodynamics drafting which affects the following energy extractor performance the near wake is directly influenced by the presence of the wind turbine i e blade profile and rotor also the rotors arrays have shown an increase in the side local velocity even more in some scenarios the whole offshore wind farm s wake interactions should be taken into consideration and can extend to several kilometers as shown in zone 2 and its extension the average output powers of the rows have been normalized relative to the front row the three array layouts curves have shown improvements in the output power behavior for the rear rows due to the increasing speed which acts like a kort nozzle due to this effect the rear rows have proven to extract more power than the frontal rows of most cases as exhibited by the slope trend of the curves the seventh row has tended to reduce the output power while the eighth row has increased again to the nearest value as shown in fig 26 3 2 2 wave farm fig 27 shows the surface water field past the 80 wave energy convertors wecs and how each wave energy converter affects the surface velocity field arranged in 3 different layouts these are 4d with 5d 4d with 6d and 3d with 5d along the x axis and y axis as shown in fig 27 at a b and c respectively the figures show reduced water surface velocity in the downstream direction due to the energy extracted by all the extractors in the farm the analysis is applied on the output power of each row the average power of each row is normalized by the extracted power of the front upstream row the results are displayed in fig 28 for the three studied layouts about a 15 reduction occurs in the power extracted from the water waves between the upstream and downstream rows on the average for the three layouts 3 2 3 hybrid wind wave energy farm a comparison between the vawts and obs layouts has been conducted and detailed as shown in fig 29 a and b the velocity deficit behind the hybrid energy extractor whether wind or wave in the wake region is reduced gradually till the flow gets released and retains its streaming velocity when the incident wave is interacted with multiple wecs the wake interactions are measured based on the interaction factor or q factor as expected the array layouts performance is evaluated to show that the layout of 4d along the y axis with 5d along the x axis has the highest performance of 0 20 for the wind array and 0 36 for the wave array the layout of 4d along the y axis with 6d along the x axis shows a higher performance than that of the 3d along the y axis with 5d along the x axis which is the lowest by a 0 12 for the wind array and 2 21 for the wave array the three owts array layouts result in significant overall performances which are considered more constructive performances than those of the three wecs array layouts the optimal array layouts increase the output power by more than 14 0 the array layout is applied to the horns rev offshore wind farm as a real case as such the array layout of 4d with 5d along both the y axis with x axis respectively achieves a reduction of the farm s occupying surface area as shown in table 5 this reduction reaches 52 5 of the total farm surface area which reduces the capex just by arranging the existing extractors in a proper configuration the following table 6 shows a brief results comparison between the present study and similar related studies on the array layout optimization for offshore wind farms wave farms and combined wind wave energy farms nevertheless all the results from these researches and others are listed into the literature review similar behaviors of the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics characteristics of the wind energy extractors wakes and the wave energy extractors wakes are revealed by different researches 3 2 4 economic assessment as the offshore wind turbine uses a fixed substructure it offers a reduction of the total initial cost of around 21 0 appiott et al 2014 regarding the substructure manufacturing and installation only however the hybrid wind wave system will change the costs of different parameters i e concept definition design and development manufacturing installing exploiting and dismantling the total manufacturing cost which is a part of the initial cost ranges from 30 0 to 45 0 of the total project cost around 4 68 m i l l i o n u s d m w castro santos et al 2016 nevertheless there is also a great cost reduction for the hybrid wind wave system according to the life cycle cost which has been conducted on a hybrid wind wave system castro santos et al 2017 the following is revealed the lcoe in u s d m w h of the offshore wind system and the wave system are averaged and the wave system is 473 3 higher than the wind system while the lcoe of the hybrid wind wave system is averaged to be of the range of 31 5 34 7 lower than both the offshore wind system and wave system together moreover the total life cycle cost lcs in u s d of the offshore wind system is averaged too and the wave system is 351 4 higher than the wind system on the other hand the hybrid system is ranged from 66 5 to 69 0 lower than both the offshore wind and wave systems together as for the incomes assessment egypt does not have a specific feed in tariff for offshore wind or wave energy yet therefore the value of the offshore wind energy is considered as the feed in tariff for onshore wind energy based on the given data of the wind farm s cost the need for early stage financing is emphasized by such factors as competition for funding with other renewable and non renewable resources moreover it is interested with the risk associated with these types of projects their capital intensive nature and the general uncertainty of existing regulatory frameworks around the world the horns rev offshore wind farm which is the case study is given a 776 0 m w the estimated average energy cost is calculated using the feed in tariff of 0 0052 u s d k w h younes 2017 it is relative to each array layout regarding the gained power at the present work the evaluated spacing achieves an average power gain of more than 14 0 as shown in table 5 the gained power adds more income to the operating revenue of 4621 3 u s d h instead of 4040 1 u s d h for the existing offshore wind array there are increases in the farm operating income of 212 140 3 u s d h yearly additional to the 14 0 a simple cost management analysis reveals that the mentioned gain in turn is capable of reducing the energy payback time epbt significantly moreover a reduction of the overall farm occupying surface area is achieved by around 52 5 as shown in table 5 this reduction can reduce the project budget by around 15 75 of the total capital expenditure capex a simple comparative analysis of the offshore hybrid wind wave farm against a conventional power plant is conducted an existing steam power plant of 300 0 m w khalil 2008 is compared with an alternative renewable energy system the average provided output power of the steam power plant is 232 55 m w over a year and normalized the equivalent renewable system of 776 0 m w is estimated to consume 4020 68 t o n o f f u e l d a y this fuel has an estimated cost of 1 723 150 2 u s d d a y as per the fuel s local price up to date the fuel is also estimated to emit c o 2 residues of 332 9 t o n d a y the renewable energy system controls the resources of the fuel costs and fuel emissions in table 7 a comparison is made between an existing steam power plant khalil 2008 in egypt and the horns rev offshore wind farm it shows the amount of used and saved parameters while using a form of renewable energy i e fuel costs and fuel emissions it is worth noting that a full economic analysis has not been carried out due to either unavailability or the fact that certain data remain unspecified for every aspect relative to the involved country collecting this data is a difficult task as costs change constantly with developments in technology and much of the cost data is closely guarded by industry 4 conclusion and future works up to that end this paper assesses a preliminary numerical optimization of a hybrid wind wave energy farm on the egyptian mediterranean north coast the rans model is used in the analysis to accomplish its aim of designing the hybrid farm three major consecutive phases are applied in the first one numerical model verification is implemented and verified using a k epsilon k ε rng turbulence model to investigate the different separation distances d between energy extractors systematic simulations are applied to two turbine rotors then five of them different layouts for the spacing of the energy extractors in the transverse and longitudinal directions have been simulated the simulations reveal that a square staggered array configuration is the optimal array layout for the hybrid wind wave farm indeed the hybrid energy extractor either wind or wave layouts show reasonable output power values for both the wind and wave arrays the results evaluated an optimum spacing with the highest performance of 4d with 5d in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively eventually for future investigations a realistic wind and wave spectrum would be used to represent the environment irregularities in the real condition of the egyptian coast experimental investigation is highly recommended to improve the accuracy and reliability of the hybrid wind wave system moreover as an irregular wind wave layout is the best way to overcome the rear rows problems in the regular array a micro sitting optimization of the hybrid energy extractors would be more superior for the sake of the best overall efficiency authorship statement abdallah m ragab conceptualization and design of study resources investigation validation numerical

20584,during the water entry process autonomous underwater vehicles auvs take a long time to reach a horizontal attitude to reduce the time and distance required to adjust the attitude an auv with an asymmetric nose shape is proposed in this paper a numerical model based on the volume of fluid vof method is established to describe the cavity and trajectory characteristics of an auv with a high speed water entry since the velocity of the auv impacting the water surface is greater than 0 3 ma the tait equation is used to describe the compressibility effects in water and the air phase is modelled as an ideal gas the simulation results such as cavitation shape and velocity are compared with the experimental data from an earlier study good comparative results reveal the accuracy and performance of the employed numerical method subsequently the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent is used to simulate and analyse the variations in the trajectory characteristics with different water entry velocities water entry angles nose shapes and rudder deflection angles the results obtained in this study can provide a good guideline for the trajectory control and nose shape design of an auv keywords auv water entry asymmetric nose shape cfd 1 introduction in the initial stage of water entry due to the presence of a cavity in the water only the nose of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is in contact with the water and the rudder is exposed inside the cavity and thus cannot control the attitude this phenomenon increases the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude the battlefield environment is constantly changing and for underwater vehicles such as torpedoes used in combat scenarios the most suitable attack time is fleeting therefore it is of great significance to study how to reduce the time required to adjust the attitude and distance of an auv after it enters water water entry is a nonlinear and unsteady process involving multiphase flow therefore this process has attracted much attention from scholars many studies have been conducted through experiments theoretical studies and numerical simulations worthington worthington and cole 1897 worthington and cole 1900 used flash camera technology to obtain images of the vertical water entry process of spheres he qualitatively analysed the development process and early closure of water entry cavitation watanabe 1934 carried out low speed water entry tests of vehicles with different head shapes and studied the water entry impact characteristics and the relationship between the maximum resistance and the water entry speed shi honghui 2000 honghui and takami 2001 conducted a series of vertical water entry experiments with optical observation technology and rifles he obtained the characteristics of unsteady flow such as water splash backflow and cavitation flow and showed that the trajectory deviation is related to the depth truscott tadd trevor truscott cav 2009 carried out small angle water entry experiments using bullets with different shapes to study the deflection of the water entry trajectory the results showed that the model with a large slenderness ratio and blunt head could move stably in water aristoff et al aristoff and bush 2009 aristoff et al 2010 performed experimental and theoretical research on the vertical water entry process of spheres the closure forms were divided into surface closure deep closure shallow closure and quasi static closure and a theoretical model was proposed to solve the relationship between the time and depth of the pinch wang et al yun et al 2014 used a high speed camera to study the water entry trajectory and the evolution process of the cavitation shapes for different head shapes the results showed that the head shape has a great influence on the deviation of the water entry trajectory alaoui et al 2012 presented an original experimental approach to determine the three dimensional water impact at constant speed the results indicated that the resistance coefficient depends on only the cone angle and the impact load coefficient increases with decreasing cone angle jiang et al jiang and li 2014 jiang et al 2016 used a nail gun to inject nails into different concentrations of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac solution and water for experiments and carried out numerical simulations the cavitation of nails in the solution was larger than that in water and the resistance coefficient was smaller hurd et al 2017 studied the water entry problem for a deformable sphere nested cavities were observed behind the sphere and the deformation and vibration of the deformable sphere were related to the material and impact conditions of the sphere chen et al cheng et al 2017 studied the influences of different rudder angles on the trajectory the experimental results showed that increasing the rudder angle could improve the deflection ability of the vehicle with the development of computer technology numerical methods have gradually become an important method to solve the water entry problem gaudet 1998 carried out a numerical simulation study on the vertical water entry process for a disc at a low froude number the results showed that the closed depth of the water cavity and the drag coefficient of the disc were related to the mass of the disc abraham et al 2014 studied the resistance of spheres during the process of entering water through mathematical modelling and numerical simulation it was concluded that changes in the velocity surface tension flow state and reynolds number of the sphere had negligible effects on the drag coefficient however the drag was mainly influenced by the momentum transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid erfanian et al 2015 performed numerical simulations and experimental research on ball head projectiles entering water the simulation results such as the air cavity shape and the projectile trajectory were compared with the experimental data good agreement was observed between the numerical results and the experiments nguyen et al 2016 developed a preconditioned navier stokes n s method for multiphase flow with application to the water entry problem for moving bodies the method employed a dual time preconditioned technique with multiblock and parallel computing to improve the computational productivity valdi et al 2018 carried out numerical simulations on the water entry processes of cubes spheres cylinders and cones the research showed that the resistance of a cube was the largest and that of a cone was the smallest kiara et al 2017 established a smooth particle method sph for the numerical simulation of the two dimensional free falling process of cylinders at different speeds and densities iranmanesh et al iranmanesh and passandidehfard 2017 carried out numerical calculations on the water entry of a small ball and cylinder and compared the results with experimental data they studied the influence of the cylinder diameter length and impact speed on the dimensionless depth chen et al 2019 analysed the cavity dynamics of high speed water entry by performing a two dimensional numerical simulation of a projectile at a speed of 900 m s zhao et al hou et al 2018 used the les model to study the cavity evolution mechanism flow pattern and parametric study at three different water enter angles yan et al 2018 studied the water impact on air launched auvs both the experimental results and numerical results indicated that the water impact acceleration of the auv was second order with respect to the velocity of the water entry and was proportional to the square of the angle of the water entry zhang et al jiayue et al 2019 studied the water entry behaviour of a vehicle with a downward tail as reviewed above we found that most of the research focused on the water entry problem for symmetrical objects and studies on the water entry problem for asymmetrical objects are scarce at present chen et al cheng et al 2017 studied the influences of different rudder angles on the trajectory however the law between the trajectory and different asymmetric nose shapes and rudder deflection angles is unknown so corresponding research needs to be carried out therefore in this paper a numerical simulation of the water entry problem for an auv with an asymmetric nose shape is carried out the reynolds average navier stokes rans model finite volume method fvm zwart gerber belamri cavitation model and volume of fluid vof multiphase model are used to establish numerical models the six degrees of freedom 6 dof overset grid is used to solve the large displacement problem of the mesh the water entry trajectory with different water entry velocities water entry angles asymmetric nose shapes and rudder deflection angles are analysed in this paper the law of the cavity evolution and water entry trajectory under different conditions is obtained the research results can provide a theoretical reference for engineering practice 2 problem description the auv model used in this paper is shown in fig 1 its length is l 2730 mm different head shapes cause slightly different model lengths maximum diameter d 324 mm excluding the rudder mass m 215 kg moment of inertia ix 3 234 kg m2 iy 131 124 kg m2 and iz 131 124 kg m2 fig 2 illustrates the asymmetric nose shape of the auv this shape is achieved by removing some sections from the symmetric head shi et al 2019b the axisymmetric nose is the pointed arch head and the pointed arch head should be cut to form an arc surface the pointed arch head is represented as the part below the straight line a c in fig 2 the pointed arch segment is represented by a b and b c and a b and b c are symmetrical about the axis the cut arc is shown as a e in fig 2 a e is an arc tangent to a b at point a its corresponding centre point is d and its radius is r the arc a e intersects the contour of the pointed arch head at point e the centre point d is located on the straight line a c the length of r is the length of straight line a d and the length of straight line a d is l0 the arc a e can be completely defined by the radius r by changing the value of r we can change the shape of the head the larger the r value is the less the removed section is in this paper three different r values are selected to study the effect of the head shape on the water entry trajectory of the auv as shown in fig 3 taking the anticlockwise direction as positive and the rudder rotates 5 and 5 around the steering engine as shown in fig 4 3 numerical method the velocity of the auv impacting the water surface is greater than 0 3 ma therefore the fluid compressibility is taken into account and the tait equation is used to describe the compressibility of water the compressibility of air and vapour is described by the ideal gas law the cavitation flow around the auv is simulated using the vof flow model coupled with the cavitation model the cfd code fluent v19 2 is used to solve the rans equations in addition the user defined function udf is used to define the movement of the auv 3 1 governing equations the governing equations

computational domain and mesh generation the computational domain used in this paper is shown in fig 5 the domain is a rectangle with a length of 18 m the upper part of the domain is filled with air and the lower part is filled with water the initial heights of the air and water are 4 1 m and 14 9 m respectively all six sides of the calculation domain are set as the pressure outlet boundary the water entry angle β is the angle between the axis of the vehicle and the free surface the distance between the head of the auv and the liquid level is 0 1 m an overset mesh and 6dof body are used to simulate the process of water entry this method can improve the calculation efficiency and reduce the calculation error caused by mesh updating fig 6 shows the grid distribution of the computational domain 3 3 validation of the present numerical model the experimental research on large scale bodies under high speed water enter conditions is relatively scarce so validation of the numerical model is separated into two steps first the cfd model is validated using the experimentally measured velocity of a large scale body under a low speed 72 m s water enter condition and uncertainly analysis in cfd is carried out with the numerical results then the cfd model is validated using the experimentally measured velocity of a small scale body under a high speed 125 65 m s water enter condition if the numerical method can predict the velocity of the above two conditions accurately it can predict the velocity of a large scale body under a high speed water enter condition the experiment conducted by yao shi shi et al 2019b is used for the validation of a large scale body under a low speed water enter condition the verification simulations are performed at a water entry velocity of v 72 m s and water entry angle of β 60 uncertainty analysis in cfd is carried out with the numerical results of the velocity of auv at 100 ms three sets of meshes rg 2 3 are generated for grid resolution verification which have approximately 6 06 million fine mesh 2 97 million medium mesh and 1 41 million coarse mesh cells fig 7 a summarizes the experimental results and the results with different grid resolutions three sets of time steps rt 2 are used for time resolution verification which are 0 33 ms 0 46 ms and 0 66 ms fig 7 b summarizes the experimental results and the results with different

different grid size and three different time steps gives approximately results this finding indicates that further increasing the grid and time resolutions will not significantly affect the cfd results as shown in fig 7 a and b therefore the grid with 2 97million elements and time step of 0 46 ms are chosen for further simulation fig 8 shows the comparison of cavity formation between the experiment and numerical results the figure shows that the experimental and numerical results are in good agreement and that the established numerical model can precisely simulate the development of cavities the experiment conducted by z j song song et al 2020 is used for the validation of a small scale body under a high speed water enter condition the initial water entry velocity is 125 65 m s fig 9 shows the comparison between the experimental and numerical results for the velocity of the vehicle under water and the relative deviation of velocity is 1 5 at 3 ms which verifies the predictive capability of the numerical model fig 10 shows the comparison of cavity formation between the experiment and numerical results the figure shows that the experimental and numerical results are in good agreement and that the established numerical model can precisely simulate the development of cavities 4 results and discussion 4 1 general flow characteristics to clearly explain the water entry problem of auvs it is necessary to analyse the flow structures of the entire flow field during the water entry process of auvs a typical case of water entry angle β 60 water entry velocity v 150 m s r 312 mm and rudder deflection angle α 0 is taken into consideration to investigate the unsteady characteristics of cavity evolution cavity contours at typical moments are presented in fig 11 according to the trend of cavity evolution the entire cavity development process can be divided into four stages hou et al 2018 the impacting water surface stage the cavity formation stage the cavity closure stage and the navigating after cavity separation stage in the impacting water surface stage the auv hits the water surface and transfers kinetic energy to the surrounding fluid then the fluid separates from the auv nose leading to flow splitting shi et al 2019a as shown in fig 11 a affected by the asymmetric nose shape of the auv the fluid in the back flow of the auv obtains more energy therefore the cavity in the back flow of the auv is larger than that in the front flow as shown in fig 11 a and b in the cavity formation stage the cavity expands and connects with the atmosphere with the movement of the auv at this time the kinetic energy of the fluid is converted into the potential energy of draining water in oblique conditions the horizonal velocity component points to the fluid in the front flow of the auv therefore the fluid in the front flow gradually obtains more energy and the cavity in the front flow of the auv gradually becomes larger than that in the back flow as shown in fig 11 c and d meanwhile the initial jetting extends to the upper right side fig 11 c and the splash height on the right side is larger than the left side counterparts fig 11 d the height of the splash increases gradually and reaches a peak at 69 1 ms after which the splash curtain begins to fall in the cavity closure stage due to the hydrostatic pressure the cavity gradually collapses fig 11 e shows that the necking phenomenon aggravates at 88 6 ms and the cavity collapses at a single point at 112 3 ms as shown in fig 11 f after cavity closure the auv continues to navigate during the navigation after the cavity separation stage until 146 9 ms at which point the auv reaches the horizontal attitude as shown in fig 11 h fig 12 shows the configuration of the cavity at typical moments in the process of cavity wall necking from 88 6 ms to 112 3 ms under the effect of inertial force and hydrostatic pressure the cavity wall dilates and constricts at the same time jiayue et al 2019 according to the law of conservation of energy as the auv impacts the free surface the auv transfers kinetic energy to the surrounding fluid the fluid particle obtains a certain speed to move radially and the cavity wall begins to dilate under the effect of hydrostatic pressure the kinetic energy of the fluid particles is gradually transformed into the pressure potential energy of the surrounding water when the radial expansion velocity of the fluid particles is reduced to zero the motion of the fluid particles starts to reverse and the cavity wall begins to constrict 4 2 effect of water entry velocity on trajectory in this section three different water entry velocities of 150 m s 200 m s and 300 m s with water entry angles of 60 nose shapes of r 312 mm and rudder deflection angles of 0 were set to develop a parametric study and investigate the influence of water entry velocity on the underwater trajectory of asymmetric auvs fig 13 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different impact velocities the figure shows that the underwater trajectories for the three velocities are similar with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 13 b and c the displacements of the three velocities show similar tendencies fig 13 b shows that the displacements of the three different water entry velocities in the x direction are 9 26 m 9 16 m and 9 12 m from fig 13 c the displacements of the three different water entry velocities in the y direction are 10 09 m 10 11 m and 10 06 m the results indicate that the water entry trajectory is not affected by the water entry velocity the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 14 a and the curves of three different water entry velocities show similar tendencies however the velocity drop becomes faster with increasing water entry velocity fig 14 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 14 b shows that the trend of the x direction velocity is decreasing however there is an acceleration phenomenon in the middle section with the increase in the water entry velocity this acceleration phenomenon in the x direction becomes more obvious and the acceleration occurs earlier at the same time that the acceleration phenomenon occurs in the x direction the acceleration of the velocity in the y direction also increases which can be seen from the slope of the curves in fig 14 c this acceleration phenomenon is related to the peak value of angular velocity fig 16 the larger the peak value of the angle velocity is more obvious the acceleration phenomenon in the x direction is and the earlier the peak value of the angular velocity appears the earlier the acceleration phenomenon occurs fig 15 shows the time history of angular displacement where the cases of three different water entry velocities have similar trends the asymmetric nose makes the auv rotate anticlockwise and the auv reaches the horizontal attitude more quickly with the increase in water entry velocity reaching horizontal at 146 9 ms 108 8 ms and 71 6 ms for velocities of 150 m s 200 m s and 300 m s respectively fig 16 shows the time history of angular velocity and the peak value of angular velocity is greater and appears earlier as the water entry velocity increases this result occurs because as the water entry velocity increases the force on the auv nose rises which increases the moment on the auv and results in an increase in the angular velocity therefore the greater the water entry velocity is the shorter the time required for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 3 effect of water entry angle on trajectory in this section four different water entry angles of 60 70 80 and 90 with a water entry velocity of 150 m s nose shape of r 312 mm and rudder deflection angle of 0 are studied to investigate the influence of the water entry angle on the trajectory fig 17 a shows the water entry trajectories for different water entry angles the water entry trajectories of the four water entry angles show similar tendencies with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 17 b and c the displacements of the four water entry angles also show similar tendencies from fig 17 b the displacements of the four water entry angles in the x direction are 9 26 m 8 58 m 8 05 m and 7 38 m for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively from fig 17 c the displacements of the four water entry angles in the y direction are 10 09 m 11 17 m 12 96 m and 16 15 m for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively the results indicate that the larger the water entry angle is the longer the water entry trajectory will be the time histories of the velocity curves for different water entry angles are shown in fig 18 a the curves are similar for all the water entry angles however the larger the water entry angle is the faster the velocity drop fig 18 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 18 b shows that the velocity curves of the 60 and 70 water entry angles have similar trends and the curves of the 80 and 90 water entry angles have similar trends but these two trends are clearly different before the acceleration phenomenon appears the speed of the auv at water entry angles of 60 and 70 decreases while the speed at water entry angles of 80 and 90 increases after the acceleration phenomenon appears the velocities of the four entry angles show similar tendencies the acceleration phenomenon of the four water entry angles occurs at the same time because the peak value of the angular velocity appear at the same time the results show that the larger the water entry angle is the more obvious the acceleration phenomenon fig 19 shows the time histories of the angular displacement curves for different water entry angles the curves are similar for all the water entry angles however with the increase in the water entry angle the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude increases which is 146 9 ms 180 ms 216 ms and 266 ms for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively fig 20 shows the time history of angular velocity for different water entry angles and it is clear from the figure that all the curves show similar behaviour the peak angular velocity of the auv is almost the same and the peak value of the angular velocity also appears at the same time because of the same nose shape and water entry velocity the moment on the auv is the same and the angular velocity is the same as well therefore the larger the water entry angle is the longer the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 4 effect of nose shape on trajectory in this section three different nose shapes of r 270 mm r 312 mm and symmetric nose with a water entry velocity of 150 m s water entry angle of 60 and rudder deflection angle of 0 are taken to investigate the influence of nose shape on the underwater trajectory fig 21 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different nose shapes all the curves show similar tendencies with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 21 b and c the displacements for the three nose shapes also show similar behaviour from fig 21 b the displacement of three different nose shapes in the x direction is 7 30 m 9 26 m and 11 30 m for r 270 mm r 312 mm and symmetric nose respectively from fig 21 c the displacement of three different nose shapes in the y direction is 8 51 m 10 09 m and 14 46 m for r 270 mm r 312 mm and a symmetric nose respectively therefore it can be concluded that the larger the r value of the nose shape the longer the water entry trajectory the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 22 a and the curves of the three different nose shapes show similar tendencies however the larger the r value of the nose shape is the slower the velocity decrease as the r value increases the contact area of the nose with water decreases resulting in a reduced drag force fig 22 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 22 b shows that with increasing r value the acceleration phenomenon occurs later because the peak value of angular velocity appears later fig 23 shows the time history of angular displacement where the cases for the three different nose shapes have similar trends the asymmetric nose makes the auv rotate anticlockwise and it is seen that the auv reaches the horizontal attitude more slowly with the increase in the r value reaching horizontal after 115 6 ms 146 9 ms and 200 ms for r values of 270 mm 312 mm and symmetric nose respectively fig 24 shows the time history of angular velocity it is clear that as the r value increases the peak value of angular velocity decreases and appears later this result is because as the r value increases the force on the auv nose decreases which decreases the moment on the auv and results in a decrease in the angular velocity therefore the greater the r value is the longer the time of auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 5 effect of rudder deflection angle on trajectory in this section three different rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 with water entry velocities of 150 m s water entry angles of 60 and head shapes of r 312 mm were set to develop a parametric study and investigate the influence of the rudder deflection angle on the underwater trajectory of asymmetric auvs fig 25 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different rudder deflection angles the figure shows that the underwater trajectories for three different rudder deflection angles are similar with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 25 b and c the displacements of the three rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners from fig 25 b the displacement of three different rudder deflection angles in the x direction is 9 97 m 9 26 m and 8 40 m for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively from fig 25 c the displacement of the three different rudder deflection angles in the y direction is 10 23 m 10 09 m and 9 69 m for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively the results indicate that with the rudder deflected anticlockwise the shorter the water entry trajectory will be the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 26 a and the curves for the three different rudder deflection angles are similar to each other fig 26 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively from fig 26 b it can be observed that the curves of the three different rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners this acceleration phenomenon in the x direction occurs at the same time because the peak value of angular velocity appears at the same time fig 27 shows the time history of angular displacement where the angular displacements of three different rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners with the anticlockwise rudder deflection the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decreases with times of 161 4 ms 146 9 ms and 132 6 ms for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively fig 28 shows the time history of angular velocity for different rudder deflection angles and it is clear from the figure that the curves are slightly different from each other the peak angular velocity of the auv is close and the peak value of the angular velocity also appears at the same time before reaching the peak value of the angular velocity the angular velocity is almost the same because the contact area of the rudder with water is decreased and the moment of the auv is mainly generated by the nose subsequently the contact area of the rudder with the water becomes larger resulting in a large moment as the rudder deflects anticlockwise the moment generated by the rudder is in the same direction as that generated by the nose so the angular velocity of the auv increases 5 conclusions based on the established computational model of water entry developed in this study numerical simulations of the water entry trajectory for an asymmetric auv under various water entry velocities water entry angles nose shapes and rudder deflection angles were carried out the main conclusions are as follows 1 cavity evolution can be divided into four stages impacting water surface forming cavity cavity closure and navigating after cavity separation in the process of cavity wall necking under the effects of inertial force and hydrostatic pressure the cavity wall dilates and constricts at the same time 2 the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decreases with increasing water entry velocity the trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude is not affected by the water entry velocity 3 both the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude increase with increasing water entry angle 4 the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude are closely related to the nose shape of the auv the larger the r value of the nose shape is the smaller the force on the auv nose the smaller the moment on the auv and the slower the angle velocity of the auv consequently the longer the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude will be 5 both the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decrease when the rudder angle deflects counterclockwise this is due to the larger moment on the auv in this paper the water entry trajectories of auvs with asymmetric nose shapes are simulated under ideal conditions and the influence of auv attitudes and surface waves on the water entry trajectories are not considered in practical applications the auv attitude and surface wave will affect the water entry trajectory of auv therefore the future work needs to study the influence of different auv attitudes and surface waves on the water entry trajectories of auvs with

20584,during the water entry process autonomous underwater vehicles auvs take a long time to reach a horizontal attitude to reduce the time and distance required to adjust the attitude an auv with an asymmetric nose shape is proposed in this paper a numerical model based on the volume of fluid vof method is established to describe the cavity and trajectory characteristics of an auv with a high speed water entry since the velocity of the auv impacting the water surface is greater than 0 3 ma the tait equation is used to describe the compressibility effects in water and the air phase is modelled as an ideal gas the simulation results such as cavitation shape and velocity are compared with the experimental data from an earlier study good comparative results reveal the accuracy and performance of the employed numerical method subsequently the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent is used to simulate and analyse the variations in the trajectory characteristics with different water entry velocities water entry angles nose shapes and rudder deflection angles the results obtained in this study can provide a good guideline for the trajectory control and nose shape design of an auv keywords auv water entry asymmetric nose shape cfd 1 introduction in the initial stage of water entry due to the presence of a cavity in the water only the nose of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is in contact with the water and the rudder is exposed inside the cavity and thus cannot control the attitude this phenomenon increases the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude the battlefield environment is constantly changing and for underwater vehicles such as torpedoes used in combat scenarios the most suitable attack time is fleeting therefore it is of great significance to study how to reduce the time required to adjust the attitude and distance of an auv after it enters water water entry is a nonlinear and unsteady process involving multiphase flow therefore this process has attracted much attention from scholars many studies have been conducted through experiments theoretical studies and numerical simulations worthington worthington and cole 1897 worthington and cole 1900 used flash camera technology to obtain images of the vertical water entry process of spheres he qualitatively analysed the development process and early closure of water entry cavitation watanabe 1934 carried out low speed water entry tests of vehicles with different head shapes and studied the water entry impact characteristics and the relationship between the maximum resistance and the water entry speed shi honghui 2000 honghui and takami 2001 conducted a series of vertical water entry experiments with optical observation technology and rifles he obtained the characteristics of unsteady flow such as water splash backflow and cavitation flow and showed that the trajectory deviation is related to the depth truscott tadd trevor truscott cav 2009 carried out small angle water entry experiments using bullets with different shapes to study the deflection of the water entry trajectory the results showed that the model with a large slenderness ratio and blunt head could move stably in water aristoff et al aristoff and bush 2009 aristoff et al 2010 performed experimental and theoretical research on the vertical water entry process of spheres the closure forms were divided into surface closure deep closure shallow closure and quasi static closure and a theoretical model was proposed to solve the relationship between the time and depth of the pinch wang et al yun et al 2014 used a high speed camera to study the water entry trajectory and the evolution process of the cavitation shapes for different head shapes the results showed that the head shape has a great influence on the deviation of the water entry trajectory alaoui et al 2012 presented an original experimental approach to determine the three dimensional water impact at constant speed the results indicated that the resistance coefficient depends on only the cone angle and the impact load coefficient increases with decreasing cone angle jiang et al jiang and li 2014 jiang et al 2016 used a nail gun to inject nails into different concentrations of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac solution and water for experiments and carried out numerical simulations the cavitation of nails in the solution was larger than that in water and the resistance coefficient was smaller hurd et al 2017 studied the water entry problem for a deformable sphere nested cavities were observed behind the sphere and the deformation and vibration of the deformable sphere were related to the material and impact conditions of the sphere chen et al cheng et al 2017 studied the influences of different rudder angles on the trajectory the experimental results showed that increasing the rudder angle could improve the deflection ability of the vehicle with the development of computer technology numerical methods have gradually become an important method to solve the water entry problem gaudet 1998 carried out a numerical simulation study on the vertical water entry process for a disc at a low froude number the results showed that the closed depth of the water cavity and the drag coefficient of the disc were related to the mass of the disc abraham et al 2014 studied the resistance of spheres during the process of entering water through mathematical modelling and numerical simulation it was concluded that changes in the velocity surface tension flow state and reynolds number of the sphere had negligible effects on the drag coefficient however the drag was mainly influenced by the momentum transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid erfanian et al 2015 performed numerical simulations and experimental research on ball head projectiles entering water the simulation results such as the air cavity shape and the projectile trajectory were compared with the experimental data good agreement was observed between the numerical results and the experiments nguyen et al 2016 developed a preconditioned navier stokes n s method for multiphase flow with application to the water entry problem for moving bodies the method employed a dual time preconditioned technique with multiblock and parallel computing to improve the computational productivity valdi et al 2018 carried out numerical simulations on the water entry processes of cubes spheres cylinders and cones the research showed that the resistance of a cube was the largest and that of a cone was the smallest kiara et al 2017 established a smooth particle method sph for the numerical simulation of the two dimensional free falling process of cylinders at different speeds and densities iranmanesh et al iranmanesh and passandidehfard 2017 carried out numerical calculations on the water entry of a small ball and cylinder and compared the results with experimental data they studied the influence of the cylinder diameter length and impact speed on the dimensionless depth chen et al 2019 analysed the cavity dynamics of high speed water entry by performing a two dimensional numerical simulation of a projectile at a speed of 900 m s zhao et al hou et al 2018 used the les model to study the cavity evolution mechanism flow pattern and parametric study at three different water enter angles yan et al 2018 studied the water impact on air launched auvs both the experimental results and numerical results indicated that the water impact acceleration of the auv was second order with respect to the velocity of the water entry and was proportional to the square of the angle of the water entry zhang et al jiayue et al 2019 studied the water entry behaviour of a vehicle with a downward tail as reviewed above we found that most of the research focused on the water entry problem for symmetrical objects and studies on the water entry problem for asymmetrical objects are scarce at present chen et al cheng et al 2017 studied the influences of different rudder angles on the trajectory however the law between the trajectory and different asymmetric nose shapes and rudder deflection angles is unknown so corresponding research needs to be carried out therefore in this paper a numerical simulation of the water entry problem for an auv with an asymmetric nose shape is carried out the reynolds average navier stokes rans model finite volume method fvm zwart gerber belamri cavitation model and volume of fluid vof multiphase model are used to establish numerical models the six degrees of freedom 6 dof overset grid is used to solve the large displacement problem of the mesh the water entry trajectory with different water entry velocities water entry angles asymmetric nose shapes and rudder deflection angles are analysed in this paper the law of the cavity evolution and water entry trajectory under different conditions is obtained the research results can provide a theoretical reference for engineering practice 2 problem description the auv model used in this paper is shown in fig 1 its length is l 2730 mm different head shapes cause slightly different model lengths maximum diameter d 324 mm excluding the rudder mass m 215 kg moment of inertia ix 3 234 kg m2 iy 131 124 kg m2 and iz 131 124 kg m2 fig 2 illustrates the asymmetric nose shape of the auv this shape is achieved by removing some sections from the symmetric head shi et al 2019b the axisymmetric nose is the pointed arch head and the pointed arch head should be cut to form an arc surface the pointed arch head is represented as the part below the straight line a c in fig 2 the pointed arch segment is represented by a b and b c and a b and b c are symmetrical about the axis the cut arc is shown as a e in fig 2 a e is an arc tangent to a b at point a its corresponding centre point is d and its radius is r the arc a e intersects the contour of the pointed arch head at point e the centre point d is located on the straight line a c the length of r is the length of straight line a d and the length of straight line a d is l0 the arc a e can be completely defined by the radius r by changing the value of r we can change the shape of the head the larger the r value is the less the removed section is in this paper three different r values are selected to study the effect of the head shape on the water entry trajectory of the auv as shown in fig 3 taking the anticlockwise direction as positive and the rudder rotates 5 and 5 around the steering engine as shown in fig 4 3 numerical method the velocity of the auv impacting the water surface is greater than 0 3 ma therefore the fluid compressibility is taken into account and the tait equation is used to describe the compressibility of water the compressibility of air and vapour is described by the ideal gas law the cavitation flow around the auv is simulated using the vof flow model coupled with the cavitation model the cfd code fluent v19 2 is used to solve the rans equations in addition the user defined function udf is used to define the movement of the auv 3 1 governing equations the governing equations

computational domain and mesh generation the computational domain used in this paper is shown in fig 5 the domain is a rectangle with a length of 18 m the upper part of the domain is filled with air and the lower part is filled with water the initial heights of the air and water are 4 1 m and 14 9 m respectively all six sides of the calculation domain are set as the pressure outlet boundary the water entry angle β is the angle between the axis of the vehicle and the free surface the distance between the head of the auv and the liquid level is 0 1 m an overset mesh and 6dof body are used to simulate the process of water entry this method can improve the calculation efficiency and reduce the calculation error caused by mesh updating fig 6 shows the grid distribution of the computational domain 3 3 validation of the present numerical model the experimental research on large scale bodies under high speed water enter conditions is relatively scarce so validation of the numerical model is separated into two steps first the cfd model is validated using the experimentally measured velocity of a large scale body under a low speed 72 m s water enter condition and uncertainly analysis in cfd is carried out with the numerical results then the cfd model is validated using the experimentally measured velocity of a small scale body under a high speed 125 65 m s water enter condition if the numerical method can predict the velocity of the above two conditions accurately it can predict the velocity of a large scale body under a high speed water enter condition the experiment conducted by yao shi shi et al 2019b is used for the validation of a large scale body under a low speed water enter condition the verification simulations are performed at a water entry velocity of v 72 m s and water entry angle of β 60 uncertainty analysis in cfd is carried out with the numerical results of the velocity of auv at 100 ms three sets of meshes rg 2 3 are generated for grid resolution verification which have approximately 6 06 million fine mesh 2 97 million medium mesh and 1 41 million coarse mesh cells fig 7 a summarizes the experimental results and the results with different grid resolutions three sets of time steps rt 2 are used for time resolution verification which are 0 33 ms 0 46 ms and 0 66 ms fig 7 b summarizes the experimental results and the results with different

different grid size and three different time steps gives approximately results this finding indicates that further increasing the grid and time resolutions will not significantly affect the cfd results as shown in fig 7 a and b therefore the grid with 2 97million elements and time step of 0 46 ms are chosen for further simulation fig 8 shows the comparison of cavity formation between the experiment and numerical results the figure shows that the experimental and numerical results are in good agreement and that the established numerical model can precisely simulate the development of cavities the experiment conducted by z j song song et al 2020 is used for the validation of a small scale body under a high speed water enter condition the initial water entry velocity is 125 65 m s fig 9 shows the comparison between the experimental and numerical results for the velocity of the vehicle under water and the relative deviation of velocity is 1 5 at 3 ms which verifies the predictive capability of the numerical model fig 10 shows the comparison of cavity formation between the experiment and numerical results the figure shows that the experimental and numerical results are in good agreement and that the established numerical model can precisely simulate the development of cavities 4 results and discussion 4 1 general flow characteristics to clearly explain the water entry problem of auvs it is necessary to analyse the flow structures of the entire flow field during the water entry process of auvs a typical case of water entry angle β 60 water entry velocity v 150 m s r 312 mm and rudder deflection angle α 0 is taken into consideration to investigate the unsteady characteristics of cavity evolution cavity contours at typical moments are presented in fig 11 according to the trend of cavity evolution the entire cavity development process can be divided into four stages hou et al 2018 the impacting water surface stage the cavity formation stage the cavity closure stage and the navigating after cavity separation stage in the impacting water surface stage the auv hits the water surface and transfers kinetic energy to the surrounding fluid then the fluid separates from the auv nose leading to flow splitting shi et al 2019a as shown in fig 11 a affected by the asymmetric nose shape of the auv the fluid in the back flow of the auv obtains more energy therefore the cavity in the back flow of the auv is larger than that in the front flow as shown in fig 11 a and b in the cavity formation stage the cavity expands and connects with the atmosphere with the movement of the auv at this time the kinetic energy of the fluid is converted into the potential energy of draining water in oblique conditions the horizonal velocity component points to the fluid in the front flow of the auv therefore the fluid in the front flow gradually obtains more energy and the cavity in the front flow of the auv gradually becomes larger than that in the back flow as shown in fig 11 c and d meanwhile the initial jetting extends to the upper right side fig 11 c and the splash height on the right side is larger than the left side counterparts fig 11 d the height of the splash increases gradually and reaches a peak at 69 1 ms after which the splash curtain begins to fall in the cavity closure stage due to the hydrostatic pressure the cavity gradually collapses fig 11 e shows that the necking phenomenon aggravates at 88 6 ms and the cavity collapses at a single point at 112 3 ms as shown in fig 11 f after cavity closure the auv continues to navigate during the navigation after the cavity separation stage until 146 9 ms at which point the auv reaches the horizontal attitude as shown in fig 11 h fig 12 shows the configuration of the cavity at typical moments in the process of cavity wall necking from 88 6 ms to 112 3 ms under the effect of inertial force and hydrostatic pressure the cavity wall dilates and constricts at the same time jiayue et al 2019 according to the law of conservation of energy as the auv impacts the free surface the auv transfers kinetic energy to the surrounding fluid the fluid particle obtains a certain speed to move radially and the cavity wall begins to dilate under the effect of hydrostatic pressure the kinetic energy of the fluid particles is gradually transformed into the pressure potential energy of the surrounding water when the radial expansion velocity of the fluid particles is reduced to zero the motion of the fluid particles starts to reverse and the cavity wall begins to constrict 4 2 effect of water entry velocity on trajectory in this section three different water entry velocities of 150 m s 200 m s and 300 m s with water entry angles of 60 nose shapes of r 312 mm and rudder deflection angles of 0 were set to develop a parametric study and investigate the influence of water entry velocity on the underwater trajectory of asymmetric auvs fig 13 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different impact velocities the figure shows that the underwater trajectories for the three velocities are similar with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 13 b and c the displacements of the three velocities show similar tendencies fig 13 b shows that the displacements of the three different water entry velocities in the x direction are 9 26 m 9 16 m and 9 12 m from fig 13 c the displacements of the three different water entry velocities in the y direction are 10 09 m 10 11 m and 10 06 m the results indicate that the water entry trajectory is not affected by the water entry velocity the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 14 a and the curves of three different water entry velocities show similar tendencies however the velocity drop becomes faster with increasing water entry velocity fig 14 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 14 b shows that the trend of the x direction velocity is decreasing however there is an acceleration phenomenon in the middle section with the increase in the water entry velocity this acceleration phenomenon in the x direction becomes more obvious and the acceleration occurs earlier at the same time that the acceleration phenomenon occurs in the x direction the acceleration of the velocity in the y direction also increases which can be seen from the slope of the curves in fig 14 c this acceleration phenomenon is related to the peak value of angular velocity fig 16 the larger the peak value of the angle velocity is more obvious the acceleration phenomenon in the x direction is and the earlier the peak value of the angular velocity appears the earlier the acceleration phenomenon occurs fig 15 shows the time history of angular displacement where the cases of three different water entry velocities have similar trends the asymmetric nose makes the auv rotate anticlockwise and the auv reaches the horizontal attitude more quickly with the increase in water entry velocity reaching horizontal at 146 9 ms 108 8 ms and 71 6 ms for velocities of 150 m s 200 m s and 300 m s respectively fig 16 shows the time history of angular velocity and the peak value of angular velocity is greater and appears earlier as the water entry velocity increases this result occurs because as the water entry velocity increases the force on the auv nose rises which increases the moment on the auv and results in an increase in the angular velocity therefore the greater the water entry velocity is the shorter the time required for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 3 effect of water entry angle on trajectory in this section four different water entry angles of 60 70 80 and 90 with a water entry velocity of 150 m s nose shape of r 312 mm and rudder deflection angle of 0 are studied to investigate the influence of the water entry angle on the trajectory fig 17 a shows the water entry trajectories for different water entry angles the water entry trajectories of the four water entry angles show similar tendencies with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 17 b and c the displacements of the four water entry angles also show similar tendencies from fig 17 b the displacements of the four water entry angles in the x direction are 9 26 m 8 58 m 8 05 m and 7 38 m for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively from fig 17 c the displacements of the four water entry angles in the y direction are 10 09 m 11 17 m 12 96 m and 16 15 m for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively the results indicate that the larger the water entry angle is the longer the water entry trajectory will be the time histories of the velocity curves for different water entry angles are shown in fig 18 a the curves are similar for all the water entry angles however the larger the water entry angle is the faster the velocity drop fig 18 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 18 b shows that the velocity curves of the 60 and 70 water entry angles have similar trends and the curves of the 80 and 90 water entry angles have similar trends but these two trends are clearly different before the acceleration phenomenon appears the speed of the auv at water entry angles of 60 and 70 decreases while the speed at water entry angles of 80 and 90 increases after the acceleration phenomenon appears the velocities of the four entry angles show similar tendencies the acceleration phenomenon of the four water entry angles occurs at the same time because the peak value of the angular velocity appear at the same time the results show that the larger the water entry angle is the more obvious the acceleration phenomenon fig 19 shows the time histories of the angular displacement curves for different water entry angles the curves are similar for all the water entry angles however with the increase in the water entry angle the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude increases which is 146 9 ms 180 ms 216 ms and 266 ms for 60 70 80 and 90 respectively fig 20 shows the time history of angular velocity for different water entry angles and it is clear from the figure that all the curves show similar behaviour the peak angular velocity of the auv is almost the same and the peak value of the angular velocity also appears at the same time because of the same nose shape and water entry velocity the moment on the auv is the same and the angular velocity is the same as well therefore the larger the water entry angle is the longer the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 4 effect of nose shape on trajectory in this section three different nose shapes of r 270 mm r 312 mm and symmetric nose with a water entry velocity of 150 m s water entry angle of 60 and rudder deflection angle of 0 are taken to investigate the influence of nose shape on the underwater trajectory fig 21 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different nose shapes all the curves show similar tendencies with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 21 b and c the displacements for the three nose shapes also show similar behaviour from fig 21 b the displacement of three different nose shapes in the x direction is 7 30 m 9 26 m and 11 30 m for r 270 mm r 312 mm and symmetric nose respectively from fig 21 c the displacement of three different nose shapes in the y direction is 8 51 m 10 09 m and 14 46 m for r 270 mm r 312 mm and a symmetric nose respectively therefore it can be concluded that the larger the r value of the nose shape the longer the water entry trajectory the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 22 a and the curves of the three different nose shapes show similar tendencies however the larger the r value of the nose shape is the slower the velocity decrease as the r value increases the contact area of the nose with water decreases resulting in a reduced drag force fig 22 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively fig 22 b shows that with increasing r value the acceleration phenomenon occurs later because the peak value of angular velocity appears later fig 23 shows the time history of angular displacement where the cases for the three different nose shapes have similar trends the asymmetric nose makes the auv rotate anticlockwise and it is seen that the auv reaches the horizontal attitude more slowly with the increase in the r value reaching horizontal after 115 6 ms 146 9 ms and 200 ms for r values of 270 mm 312 mm and symmetric nose respectively fig 24 shows the time history of angular velocity it is clear that as the r value increases the peak value of angular velocity decreases and appears later this result is because as the r value increases the force on the auv nose decreases which decreases the moment on the auv and results in a decrease in the angular velocity therefore the greater the r value is the longer the time of auv to reach the horizontal attitude 4 5 effect of rudder deflection angle on trajectory in this section three different rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 with water entry velocities of 150 m s water entry angles of 60 and head shapes of r 312 mm were set to develop a parametric study and investigate the influence of the rudder deflection angle on the underwater trajectory of asymmetric auvs fig 25 a shows the water entry trajectories for three different rudder deflection angles the figure shows that the underwater trajectories for three different rudder deflection angles are similar with regard to the x direction and y direction displacement as shown in fig 25 b and c the displacements of the three rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners from fig 25 b the displacement of three different rudder deflection angles in the x direction is 9 97 m 9 26 m and 8 40 m for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively from fig 25 c the displacement of the three different rudder deflection angles in the y direction is 10 23 m 10 09 m and 9 69 m for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively the results indicate that with the rudder deflected anticlockwise the shorter the water entry trajectory will be the time histories of the velocity curves are shown in fig 26 a and the curves for the three different rudder deflection angles are similar to each other fig 26 b and c show the time history of the x direction and y direction velocities respectively from fig 26 b it can be observed that the curves of the three different rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners this acceleration phenomenon in the x direction occurs at the same time because the peak value of angular velocity appears at the same time fig 27 shows the time history of angular displacement where the angular displacements of three different rudder deflection angles vary in similar manners with the anticlockwise rudder deflection the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decreases with times of 161 4 ms 146 9 ms and 132 6 ms for rudder deflection angles of 5 0 and 5 respectively fig 28 shows the time history of angular velocity for different rudder deflection angles and it is clear from the figure that the curves are slightly different from each other the peak angular velocity of the auv is close and the peak value of the angular velocity also appears at the same time before reaching the peak value of the angular velocity the angular velocity is almost the same because the contact area of the rudder with water is decreased and the moment of the auv is mainly generated by the nose subsequently the contact area of the rudder with the water becomes larger resulting in a large moment as the rudder deflects anticlockwise the moment generated by the rudder is in the same direction as that generated by the nose so the angular velocity of the auv increases 5 conclusions based on the established computational model of water entry developed in this study numerical simulations of the water entry trajectory for an asymmetric auv under various water entry velocities water entry angles nose shapes and rudder deflection angles were carried out the main conclusions are as follows 1 cavity evolution can be divided into four stages impacting water surface forming cavity cavity closure and navigating after cavity separation in the process of cavity wall necking under the effects of inertial force and hydrostatic pressure the cavity wall dilates and constricts at the same time 2 the time for the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decreases with increasing water entry velocity the trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude is not affected by the water entry velocity 3 both the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude increase with increasing water entry angle 4 the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude are closely related to the nose shape of the auv the larger the r value of the nose shape is the smaller the force on the auv nose the smaller the moment on the auv and the slower the angle velocity of the auv consequently the longer the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude will be 5 both the time and trajectory of the auv to reach the horizontal attitude decrease when the rudder angle deflects counterclockwise this is due to the larger moment on the auv in this paper the water entry trajectories of auvs with asymmetric nose shapes are simulated under ideal conditions and the influence of auv attitudes and surface waves on the water entry trajectories are not considered in practical applications the auv attitude and surface wave will affect the water entry trajectory of auv therefore the future work needs to study the influence of different auv attitudes and surface waves on the water entry trajectories of auvs with asymmetric nose shapes credit author contribution statement xihui wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft guang pan supervision writing review editing xi chen visualization
