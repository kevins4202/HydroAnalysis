12890,one of the most promising strategies for maintaining stable water sources for on site wastewater reuse is greywater reclamation particularly laundry wastewater reclamation this study proposes an efficient strategy for the pre treatment of laundry wastewater which reduces membrane fouling and improves flux recovery after membrane cleaning the fouling behavior organic retention and flux recovery rates of ceramic ultrafiltration uf membranes were comprehensively investigated using synthetic laundry wastewater under identical applied pressure and temperature conditions a fouling resistance that corresponded to the water permeate flux and normalized flux was explored total organic carbon toc retention was also tested to investigate the feasibility of using ceramic uf membranes as an effective pre treatment for laundry wastewater reclamation furthermore four different cleaning strategies for the fouled ceramic membranes were systematically compared including deionized di water alkaline acidic and combined alkaline and acidic chemical agents to provide an in depth understanding of the potential recovery rates of the membranes relative to the initial state the filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater samples collected from a university student dormitory was compared with synthetic laundry wastewater this work provided valuable information on fouling behavior and cleaning strategies that could advance ceramic uf membrane pre treatment technology for sustainable laundry wastewater reuse despite the challenges associated with the organic fouling and the potential of incomplete flux recovery in engineered systems our findings provide insights into fouling mechanisms and cleaning strategies that could enable the optimization of engineered wastewater reuse systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic membrane cleaning strategy flux recovery laundry wastewater water reuse 1 introduction freshwater shortages and the increasing demand for energy efficient water distribution solutions have prompted the reuse of various wastewater sources for non potable to potable purposes 1 3 water sources for non potable applications have recently garnered increasing attention particularly those produced in large volumes and in decentralized systems that collect and treat onsite available waters e g laundry wastewater an average industrial laundromat consumes approximately 15 l per 1 kg of laundry accounting for 5 19 of total yearly household water consumption 4 in addition to domestic outputs an industrial scale laundry business could produce over 200 m3 of wastewater per day 5 therefore many studies have assessed the potential of laundry wastewater reuse for various purposes ranging from small on site pilot scale operations to urban scale experiments 6 9 however chemical additives in laundry wastewater have been proven to reduce the efficiency of purification processes and complicate laundry wastewater reclamation 10 12 surfactants particularly anionic surfactants are a major component of laundry detergent and they contribute significantly to the toxicity and organic pollution of laundry wastewater 13 laundry wastewater has a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration that ranges between 280 and 5150 mg l which is higher than most greywater or combined inputs excluding laundry table s1 of appendix a 14 adequate removal of these pollutants from laundry wastewaters could promote on site reuse for various non potable and potable purposes thereby significantly reducing excessive energy costs financial costs and water consumption 15 16 the demand for wastewater reclamation requires the establishment of energy efficient and economically decentralized water treatment facilities to supply safe and affordable water supply to urban areas 17 19 however establishing a decentralized water treatment facility in urban areas with limited space constitutes an important challenge advanced compact water treatment technologies are necessary because these facilities are expected to supply high quality water to a large population in a spatially restricted environment 20 23 many efforts have been made to treat laundry wastewater through biological removal 24 26 the treatment of laundry wastewater is uniquely challenging due to its high concentrations of oils surfactants suspended solids and cod as well as the potential presence of organic solvents and heavy metals therefore advanced combinations of different biological physical and chemical systems have been recently proposed to treat laundry wastewater 27 28 membrane based separation such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf is currently the most widely used water reclamation technology 29 32 this technology is known to produce low suspended solids and organic permeates which is critical for the implementation of different forms of water reuse and fit for purpose treatment procedures 33 34 uf membranes have been incorporated in numerous studies for the pre treatment of wastewater prior to reverse osmosis ro treatment which is a technique that is commonly incorporated into advanced wastewater reclamation treatment systems for potable or non potable purposes 35 37 by incorporating uf membranes suspended solids and biological contaminants are removed before ro treatment thereby minimizing fouling on downstream ro membranes for instance the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater by a combination of membrane bioreactor mbr and ro treatment resulted in water that fully complied with the water quality requirements on a large scale unit with a total wastewater capacity of 200 m3 d 2 38 in some cases such as boiler make up water the conversion of reclaimed water into high purity water requires the use of ro as part of an advanced treatment process to reduce the hardness of the feed water unless an alternative is shown to provide an equivalent water quality low pressure uf membranes retain large organic molecules more effectively than mf membranes and are therefore uniquely well suited for greywater reclamation however increased fouling problems in uf membranes with high flux operation remain a major challenge in industrial applications compared to polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are better suited for the treatment of large volumes of laundry wastewater due to their hydrophilic properties ceramic uf membranes are 1 5 to 2 0 times less susceptible to membrane fouling and deliver better permeate water quality because organic substances establish weaker interactions with uf membrane surfaces compared to polymeric membranes 39 one of the most important factors affecting the extent of water flux and antifouling as well as the overall performance of the uf membrane is the membrane material a variety of inorganic material based membranes such as titania 40 42 alumina 43 mullite 44 silicon carbide 45 46 pyrophyllite 47 48 and zirconia 49 have been employed to enhance filtration performance a previous study reported that the effect of pore size could be affected by the membrane materials with hydrophilic membranes causing less fouling than hydrophobic membranes with smaller pore sizes 50 insights into the production operation and maintenance costs of ceramic uf membranes for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater can be obtained by assessing the performance of efficient and cost effective ceramic membrane materials our previous work on a widely available and inexpensive titanium oxide tio2 ceramic uf membranes demonstrated that it could retain up to 73 7 of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs i e a surfactant at 1000 mg l approximately 480 mg l of toc concentration which is the concentration of typical anionic surfactants produced from domestic laundry wastewater 51 therefore it is worth investigating whether ceramic uf membranes can be used in other applications for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater apart from filtration and treatment performance the cleaning strategies of ceramic uf membranes after laundry wastewater reclamation have not been thoroughly examined even though membrane fouling is a major drawback for long term filtration to regenerate organically fouled membranes most ceramic uf filtration studies suggest a combination of backwash and alkaline chemical cleaning 52 53 since physical and chemical cleaning methods prevent membranes from accumulating irreversible fouling efficient cleaning techniques to improve recovery and antifouling performance are urgently needed to establish proper maintenance guidelines for ceramic uf membranes only a few studies evaluating ceramic membrane performance for the treatment of surfactant containing simulated wastewater have been published and the performance of ceramic uf membranes has not been tested using real laundry wastewater in this study we demonstrate the feasibility of uf treatment for both synthetic and real laundry wastewaters with low fouling and high water flux using a tio2 ceramic uf membrane the fouling behavior of the ceramic uf membrane was thoroughly investigated for the treatment of laundry wastewater fouling resistance and organic retention were systematically investigated for diverse wastewater properties synthetic and real laundry wastewater and operating conditions applied pressure and temperature afterward the fouled ceramic uf membranes were regenerated using four different cleaning strategies which were subsequently analyzed and compared in terms of filtration and treatment performance to determine the best chemical cleaning method to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to comprehensively evaluate the fouling and cleaning of ceramic uf membranes as a feasible option for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic uf membrane filtration experiments a commercially available tio2 ceramic uf membrane sterlitech corp kent wa with a 1 kda nominal pore size and a 13 1 cm2 effective surface area was employed in a bench scale membrane filtration system as shown in fig s1 of appendix a a ceramic uf membrane was placed inside a disc holder between two viton o rings the laundry wastewater was fed into the disc holder at a positive gauge pressure using a gear pump labscitech inc corona ca after filtration the effluent was collected in a glass beaker that was constantly weighed using an automated electronic scale gx 4000 a d co ltd tokyo japan with the weight of the changing volume indicating flux changes ceramic uf filtration experiments were conducted at two different applied pressures 1 5 and 3 0 bar to investigate their effect on fouling behavior as well as filtration and treatment performance throughout the experiment 1 l of feed was stirred at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer msh 20a daihan scientific co ltd wonju south korea and kept at a constant temperature of 20 8 0 6 c room temperature except when the membrane was tested for temperature variation in which case the feed was heated to 69 9 4 9 c heated temperature inside an incubator jsgi 250t js research inc gongju south korea these temperatures were selected to represent the range of discharged laundry wastewater that can result from hot water washing machines with temperatures of 70 c 54 after each filtration experiment the ceramic membranes were removed from the disc holder and rinsed with di water to identify more effective and reliable cleaning methods for ceramic membranes various physical or chemical cleaning methods proposed in other studies or manufacturer recommendations were investigated by quantifying changes in flux decline and recovery as well as the removal of organic foulants to evaluate the effect of single chemical cleaning agents such as 0 5 m naoh and 0 0075 m h3po4 the ceramic membrane was soaked in chemical solutions heated to 50 c for 15 min and then flushed with di water at room temperature for 30 min to remove the remaining chemical reagents the ceramic membrane was similarly soaked in a series of heated 0 5 m naoh and 0 0075 m h3po4 solutions and flushed with di water prior to each experiment pure water permeability was examined on physically or chemically cleaned ceramic uf membranes to confirm that its recovered flux met the initial conditions the chemical formula and concentration of naoh and h3po4 were consistent with the manufacturer s recommended cleaning procedure to gain insights into the fouling and cleaning mechanisms of the ceramic membrane all experiments were repeated using synthetic and real laundry wastewater 2 2 characterization of ceramic uf membrane the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the ceramic uf membrane were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem auriga carl zeiss oberkochen germany to capture the layer structures as well as the thickness of the membrane fouling that occurs after filtration atomic force microscopy afm hr afm afmworkshop corp hilton head island sc was used to measure the surface roughness of the ceramic uf membrane the chemical structure of the ceramic uf membrane was investigated using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis and water contact angle measurement the atomic composition of the active surface layer was determined using an fe sem instrument which was also employed for eds analysis water contact angle wca measurements were performed to characterize the surface hydrophilicity of the ceramic uf membrane using a contact angle analyzer phoenix 300 touch surface electro optics co ltd suwon south korea with a 1 2 μl droplet of distilled water 2 3 membrane resistance determination membrane resistance r is a common indicator used to examine membrane fouling which is defined as the deposition of materials on or inside the structure of membranes that is not easily reversed by simply releasing pressure or backwashing fouling

viscosity and j is the volumetric flux of the permeate 2 4 synthetic and real laundry wastewater the chemical composition of synthetic laundry wastewater was slightly modified see table 1 from a study that investigated biologically treated laundry wastewater 55 the wastewater sample contained 100 mg l of sdbs c18h29nao3s sigma aldrich france a common anionic surfactant used in the manufacturing of household chemical products this concentration reflects the measured concentrations of anionic surfactants in commercially and domestically produced laundry wastewater the chemicals used for the preparation of synthetic laundry wastewater included sdbs ammonium sulfate h8n2o4s 99 w w magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgo4s 98 w w beef extract powder for microbiology potassium phosphate monobasic h2ko4p 99 w w urea ch4n2o 98 w w and bacto peptone all of the above synthetic laundry wastewater constituents were supplied by sigma aldrich except for bacto peptone which was purchased from gibco each chemical was thoroughly dissolved in di water after being meticulously measured real laundry wastewater samples were retrieved from a storage tank that collected laundry wastewater generated from a university student dormitory in our school the tank was completely mixed until fully homogenized prior to wastewater sampling and subsequently taken through a sampling port where laundry wastewater was extracted from a tank below the wastewater samples were kept in polypropylene containers and immediately transferred to the laboratory the wastewater samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within a week of collection table 2 details the properties of the synthetic and real laundry wastewater samples 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of feed and permeate were used to calculate the retention rate which represents the amounts of substances retained by the ceramic uf membrane ph and conductivity were measured using a portable electrode meter hq40d hach company loveland co total nitrogen total phosphorus and cod concentrations in wastewater samples were pretreated with commercial test kits before being analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr3900 hach company loveland co total nitrogen product 2714100 hach company loveland co and phosphorus product 2742645 hach company loveland co were measured via the acid persulfate digestion method using test n tube vials whereas cod was measured via the hach digestion method usepa cod digestion approach after the wastewater sample was filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf syringe filter a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu corp kyoto japan was used to analyze dissolved organic carbon doc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ceramic uf membrane 3 1 1 morphological properties of the ceramic uf membrane understanding the morphological properties of the tested ceramic uf membrane is important to further understand its fouling behavior and retention performance fig 1 presents a cross sectional and surface fe sem image of the pristine ceramic uf membrane used in this study the ceramic uf membrane is composed of three layers a top active layer an intermediate layer and a highly porous support layer all of which are composed of nano to micron sized tio2 particles the active layer was observed at approximately 15 μm and pollutants were filtered as feed entered the active layer by a sieve like structure created by overlapping tio2 particles that became coarser at the top surface the surface roughness of the ceramic uf membrane was determined through non contact mode of afm during the experiment direct contact caused unidentifiable streaks to appear on the topographic results and therefore only the non contact results were reported in this study fig 2 surface roughness was characterized based on various parameters including root mean squared rms roughness s q 68 8 nm mean roughness s a 54 8 nm and maximum peak height s p 260 4 nm the afm analysis results of the ceramic uf membrane were reported based on a 10 μm 10 μm area 5 μm division with a vertical z axis of 0 43 μm the pore size estimation by polyethylene glycol peg retention with various molecular weights 0 3 600 kda was equivalent to the 5 2 kda or 4 0 nm reported in our previous study 51 3 1 2 chemical properties of ceramic uf membrane the chemical properties of the ceramic uf membrane were investigated using surface charge eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and contact angle measurement to identify the chemical interaction between the solutes and the ceramic uf membrane surface the results from the surface charge ft ir and xps analysis for the characterization of the chemical functional groups and elemental compositions of the ceramic uf membrane surface were provided in our previous work 56 fig 3 presents the atomic constituents of the ceramic uf membrane in descending order indicating that the results correlate with the chemical composition provided by the manufacturer the weight percentage of oxygen and titanium were 34 2 and 31 7 respectively being the first and second most abundant elements in the ceramic uf membrane despite being considered a relative indicator hydrophilicity is a significant factor that is directly related to filtration performance 57 the value of the water contact angle was equivalent to 78 0 which was formed by a 0 001 0 002 ml water droplet these findings indicated that the ceramic uf membrane was slightly more hydrophobic than a membrane with the same material 41 3 2 filtration and treatment performance of synthetic laundry wastewater 3 2 1 effect of applied pressure fig 4 illustrates the filtration and treatment performance of the ceramic uf membrane when processing synthetic laundry wastewater at 1 5 and 3 0 bar water permeate flux changes were recorded using an automated weight measurement system at a constant applied pressure and were subsequently normalized by dividing the initial water flux higher volumes of permeate were produced at 3 0 bar than at 1 5 bar throughout the experiment because the water permeate flux was subjected to a pressure gradient although not exactly proportionate the initial water permeate fluxes for each process were 6 7 and 4 1 l m 2 h 1 respectively fig 4a furthermore after each water permeate flux curve reached a steady state the water permeate flux obtained at 3 0 bar of applied pressure was greater than that at a 1 5 bar applied pressure 2 5 and 1 6 l m 2 h 1 respectively however the normalized flux for both applied pressures showed similar trends and the differences were minimal suggesting that the degree of fouling in both conditions was similar fig 4b in fig 4c which was computed using eq 3 the gradual build up of membrane fouling at each applied pressure is represented as fouling resistance 58 the membrane driven at 3 0 bar exhibited greater increments and an overall higher fouling resistance value because more severe fouling is expected at 3 0 bar compared to 1 5 bar this suggests that thick compact layers of cake or organics formed as a result of high pressure operations significantly contributed to the formation of fouling resistance nevertheless the high pressure operation exhibited better toc removal efficiency of 42 8 which was higher than the 34 6 achieved at 1 5 bar fig 4d this was consistent with our previous study which found that sdbs retention was higher at higher pressures 51 the ceramic uf filtration of synthetic laundry wastewater resulted in slightly lower toc removal efficiencies than for pure surfactant solutions because other organic and inorganic substances may influence the treatment performance through chemical interactions between the ceramic membrane surface and the solutes significant pore clogging and cake layer formation were observed even though important constituents such as sdbs and dissolved ions were much smaller than the average pore size of the ceramic uf membrane 59 another study reported that the thickness of this cake layer tends to increase with applied pressure when using tight uf membranes 60 the retention of smaller molecules was improved by reducing the porosity and average pore diameter of a membrane as more pollutants rapidly deposit to form a thick compact foulant layer 61 suggesting that the high pressure operation would improve toc retention and favor the performance of laundry wastewater treatment 3 2 2 effect of temperature the effect of feed water temperature on filtration and treatment performance was evaluated to simulate laundry wastewater conditions as laundry is often washed at temperatures ranging from intermediate to extremely hot presumably reaching up to 90 c for front loading washers in an incubator a feed water tank was automatically controlled to represent laundry wastewater at room temperature rt 20 8 0 6 c or heated temperature ht 69 9 4 9 c the initial water permeate flux was measured at 10 1 l m 2 h 1 rt and 31 2 l m 2 h 1 ht fig 5a indicating that relatively higher water permeate flux was observed in the ht condition due to the influence of solution viscosity 62 64 specifically the weakening of intermolecular forces between molecules as temperature rises facilitates molecular diffusion and reduces viscosity which weakens the drag force of molecules and promotes particle detachment 65 67 furthermore the thermal expansion of the membrane pore size may allow the membrane to become more accessible to wastewater pollutants 68 fig 5a shows that after 15 h of filtration the water permeate flux between the rt and ht conditions was nearly identical even slightly lower in the ht condition given that the ht curve displayed a rapid decline and consistently rendered lower values than that of rt the membrane fouling tendency increased as temperature increased according to the normalized flux in fig 5b after 15 h of filtration the fouling resistance of ht exceeded that of rt fig 5c indicating that the resistance could be induced by increased adsorption due to internal fouling such as pore blocking 63 as a result even while the initial permeate flux of the membranes increase as the temperature rises increasing fouling tendencies eventually result in lower water permeate flux than at lower temperatures furthermore owing to the increased permeate flux the membrane pores were exposed to a greater amount of solutes making them susceptible to fouling as increased temperatures result in increased permeability a significant amount of solute escaped the membrane without being filtered as shown in fig 5d the rt operation exhibited a better toc removal efficiency of 42 8 10 0 which was much higher than the 11 9 2 2 at the ht condition as reported in previous studies 69 although higher temperatures are associated with higher permeabilities the ht operation presented higher toc concentrations in the permeate throughout the filtration period indicating that the selectivity of the ceramic uf membrane against organic substances within laundry wastewater may be significantly reduced there are some potential advantages of implementing typical conditions of laundry wastewater with temperatures ranging from 25 to 40 c which result from cold or warm washing options the proposed implementation might also be convenient for laundry wastewater with temperatures of 70 c as these conditions might deteriorate the lifespan of the polymeric membrane these results combined with those from the filtration and treatment performance evaluation indicate that laundry wastewaters discharged from hot water washing machine conditions were required to improve the efficiency of ceramic uf membrane pre treatment through the integration of an advanced treatment step to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to suggest the use of ceramic uf membranes for the treatment of hot laundry wastewater as a feasible option in standalone water reuse systems however the development of a hybrid system for the separation of organic contaminants after downstream advanced treatment remains an important challenge 3 3 effect of cleaning strategies on flux recovery and treatment performance we investigated the effects of four different cleaning strategies on the flux recovery of fouled ceramic uf membranes relative to the initial flux condition to identify the most suitable cleaning method for the treatment of laundry wastewater the soak and flush method is a common cleaning procedure which entails soaking the ceramic membrane in different cleaning agents for a certain amount of time and subsequently flushing it with di water before reuse fig 6 shows the flux decline curves after each cleaning step for the four different cleaning strategies di naoh h3po4 naoh and h3po4 the water permeate flux for the caustic cleaning method c naoh was significantly recovered and almost reached the initial water flux 7 l m 2 h 1 meaning that the flux decline was minimal in most cases the water permeate flux decreased after the first and second cleaning steps a di b naoh h3po4 and d h3po4 however the acid cleaning method with h3po4 d h3po4 was largely ineffective as the recovery rates declined even more than di washing which was initially expected to yield the lowest recovery rates furthermore the permeate flux after the combined caustic and acid cleaning procedure b naoh h3po4 achieved better recoveries than when acid cleaning was used d h3po4 these observations suggest that alkaline based cleaning solutions could be effective in removing foulants during ceramic uf membrane filtration for the treatment of laundry wastewater under a relatively high ph e g naoh cleaning organic foulants are known to attain better conformational linearity allowing them to become structurally loose and sparse 70 as a result they can quickly detach from the membrane surface facilitating foulant removal via forward flushing 70 71 deprotonation at the membrane surface also causes an increase in the electron receptor contribution to the polar component of surface tension which increases membrane surface hydrophilicity 72 table 3 shows the recovered flux and toc retention for four different cleaning methods after the first and second cleaning procedures alkaline based chemical reagents are more effective at removing foulants than acidic reagents due to the presence of hydroxyl ions in caustic solutions therefore alkaline reagents could be an effective alternative strategy for the flux recovery of ceramic uf membranes by facilitating the detachment of organic foulants which were formulated as a major fraction of the laundry wastewater used in this study however prolonged exposure to alkaline solutions for membrane cleaning may disrupt filtration and treatment performance similar studies on polymeric membranes suggest that alkaline cleaning solutions cause membrane expansion by increasing flux and decreasing retention 73 the recovered flux exceeded the initial water flux only for caustic cleaning while toc retention was slightly lower than the value obtained for the combined caustic and acid cleaning method exposing such polymeric membranes to neutral or low ph solutions has been shown to stimulate re protonation and enhance membrane selectivity 74 75 therefore a dual step caustic and acid chemical cleaning protocol might remove organic foulants from laundry wastewater while preserving the physiocochemical properties of the membrane future studies should thus investigate the specific classification and fraction of dissolved organic matters doms in the cleaned solutions to gain insights into the type of foulants that are more efficiently removed by different chemical cleaning solutions which can be achieved using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd 3 4 filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater the filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater could provide key insights into the feasibility of ceramic uf membranes as synthetic laundry wastewater could not accurately represent real life commercial and domestic laundry wastewater here we expected to gain insights into the real world applicability of ceramic uf membranes for greywater pre treatment by comparing the filtration and treatment performance of synthetic and real laundry wastewater in terms of water quality fig 7a and b present the water permeate flux and normalized flux for treating 100 mg l sdbs extracted from our previous study 51 synthetic and real laundry wastewater the membrane for the treatment of synthetic wastewater was likely to have formed the thickest gel layer because synthetic wastewater contained the highest doc concentration as shown in table 2 dom has been identified as a major cause of membrane fouling in the treatment of domestic wastewater in several studies 76 77 as dom concentration in the feed increases more dom molecules agglomerate into a thick layer of gel causing considerable fouling resistance 60 78 79 table 2 shows that real laundry wastewater samples had fewer organic contaminants and lower cod toc and doc concentrations while having a higher concentration of total and volatile solids as a result organic fouling as the collection of carbon based materials on a filtration membrane caused the largest flux reduction and lowest water permeate flux in synthetic wastewater filtration fig 7b these findings were consistent with a previous study that reported that after filtering natural organic matter solutions containing silica particles and electrolytes polymeric uf membranes experienced greater flux decline than solutions containing only natural organic matter and electrolytes accounting for 74 and 49 decreases in flux rates respectively 80 however it is worth noting that the treatment performance can vary and may be influenced by other factors such as the type of detergent washer load volumes and speed of the washing machine fig 8 shows how the ceramic uf membrane removes toc from sdbs synthetic and real laundry wastewaters at an applied pressure of 3 0 bar at room temperature the ceramic uf membrane presented the highest toc retention 26 4 with synthetic laundry wastewater compared to sdbs 21 6 and real laundry wastewater 9 4 although not proportionate feeds with higher toc and doc concentrations in synthetic laundry wastewater had increased toc retention rates given that a polymeric uf membrane with a 10 kda pore size could retain up to 66 of cod from a high strength textile laundry wastewater with 1500 2500 mg l cod concentrations cod or toc retention rates tend to increase as cod or toc concentrations in the feed increases 81 the overall results showed that filtration which was more likely to induce severe pore blockage reduced membrane permeability and therefore prevented organic matters from exiting the membrane 73 unlike synthetic laundry wastewater which consists primarily of organic matter real laundry wastewater contains suspended or colloidal particulates which may affect toc retention performance our findings indicated that ceramic uf pre treatment has the greatest potential for the decentralized treatment and reuse of domestic wastewater at urban sites where suspended particulates predominate such as laundry wastewater at sites where organic matter is also present ceramic membrane pre treatment could be used as part of a wastewater reuse treatment approach to reduce the contaminants however advanced treatment by physicochemical processes would still be required retention of suspended particulates by ceramic uf membrane will likely be less important at laundry wastewater reuse sites than in the experiments described herein as real world concentrations are typically below the concentrations at which suspended or colloidal fouling occurred in the experiments however ceramic uf pre treatment is likely to be ineffective for surfactant or detergent retention due to their low molecular weight ceramic membranes are known for their fouling and filtration behaviors therefore the cleaning studies could serve as a means of reducing the uncertainty associated with economic feasibility and facilitate faster and more cost effective ceramic membrane development and implementation in this study we progressively optimized our fouling and cleaning strategies to accurately reflect the conditions in a domestic environment however the ceramic uf pre treatment would have to optimized to obtain the equivalent particulate and organic retention after scale up additional research is also needed to assess the long term performance of the membranes under realistic operating conditions to support the adoption of these efficient treatment technologies and to promote the widespread reuse of non potable water 4 conclusions this study proposed optimized operating conditions for a ceramic uf membrane with a 1 kda pore size to treat laundry wastewater based on the analysis of fouling behavior and water flux recovery after applying various cleaning strategies morphological and chemical properties such as microporous structure surface roughness chemical composition and surface hydrophilicity were obtained for the ceramic uf membrane and this information was used to assess the feasibility of this technology for the treatment of laundry wastewater lower applied pressure at room temperature conditions resulted in significant flux decline decreased fouling resistance and higher toc retention in synthetic laundry wastewater afterward fouled ceramic membranes were cleaned using different cleaning methods with alkaline based cleaning agents exhibiting improved water flux recovery in turn this was attributed to the effective detachment of organic foulants attached to the ceramic uf membrane our findings also demonstrated that a potential chemical cleaning method including alkaline solutions followed by acidic solutions increases the effectiveness of cleaning strategies in terms of flux recovery and toc retention real laundry wastewater which contains less organic and more particulate matter than synthetic laundry wastewater has a smaller flux decline curve than synthetic laundry wastewater because organic matter is more effective in limiting the fouling sources for the treatment of laundry wastewater the ceramic uf membrane was largely effective at removing suspended particulates in real laundry wastewater but was less effective in retaining organic matter in summary this study is the first to investigate the fouling and flux behavior of ceramic uf membrane for the treatment of laundry wastewater as well as appropriate cleaning strategies although the ceramic uf membranes may retain large amounts of organics and suspended solids coupling them with more integrated and acknowledged techniques e g ro membranes could significantly improve retention rates furthermore additional studies involving various real laundry wastewaters for sustainable water treatment are also required to validate our

12890,one of the most promising strategies for maintaining stable water sources for on site wastewater reuse is greywater reclamation particularly laundry wastewater reclamation this study proposes an efficient strategy for the pre treatment of laundry wastewater which reduces membrane fouling and improves flux recovery after membrane cleaning the fouling behavior organic retention and flux recovery rates of ceramic ultrafiltration uf membranes were comprehensively investigated using synthetic laundry wastewater under identical applied pressure and temperature conditions a fouling resistance that corresponded to the water permeate flux and normalized flux was explored total organic carbon toc retention was also tested to investigate the feasibility of using ceramic uf membranes as an effective pre treatment for laundry wastewater reclamation furthermore four different cleaning strategies for the fouled ceramic membranes were systematically compared including deionized di water alkaline acidic and combined alkaline and acidic chemical agents to provide an in depth understanding of the potential recovery rates of the membranes relative to the initial state the filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater samples collected from a university student dormitory was compared with synthetic laundry wastewater this work provided valuable information on fouling behavior and cleaning strategies that could advance ceramic uf membrane pre treatment technology for sustainable laundry wastewater reuse despite the challenges associated with the organic fouling and the potential of incomplete flux recovery in engineered systems our findings provide insights into fouling mechanisms and cleaning strategies that could enable the optimization of engineered wastewater reuse systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic membrane cleaning strategy flux recovery laundry wastewater water reuse 1 introduction freshwater shortages and the increasing demand for energy efficient water distribution solutions have prompted the reuse of various wastewater sources for non potable to potable purposes 1 3 water sources for non potable applications have recently garnered increasing attention particularly those produced in large volumes and in decentralized systems that collect and treat onsite available waters e g laundry wastewater an average industrial laundromat consumes approximately 15 l per 1 kg of laundry accounting for 5 19 of total yearly household water consumption 4 in addition to domestic outputs an industrial scale laundry business could produce over 200 m3 of wastewater per day 5 therefore many studies have assessed the potential of laundry wastewater reuse for various purposes ranging from small on site pilot scale operations to urban scale experiments 6 9 however chemical additives in laundry wastewater have been proven to reduce the efficiency of purification processes and complicate laundry wastewater reclamation 10 12 surfactants particularly anionic surfactants are a major component of laundry detergent and they contribute significantly to the toxicity and organic pollution of laundry wastewater 13 laundry wastewater has a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration that ranges between 280 and 5150 mg l which is higher than most greywater or combined inputs excluding laundry table s1 of appendix a 14 adequate removal of these pollutants from laundry wastewaters could promote on site reuse for various non potable and potable purposes thereby significantly reducing excessive energy costs financial costs and water consumption 15 16 the demand for wastewater reclamation requires the establishment of energy efficient and economically decentralized water treatment facilities to supply safe and affordable water supply to urban areas 17 19 however establishing a decentralized water treatment facility in urban areas with limited space constitutes an important challenge advanced compact water treatment technologies are necessary because these facilities are expected to supply high quality water to a large population in a spatially restricted environment 20 23 many efforts have been made to treat laundry wastewater through biological removal 24 26 the treatment of laundry wastewater is uniquely challenging due to its high concentrations of oils surfactants suspended solids and cod as well as the potential presence of organic solvents and heavy metals therefore advanced combinations of different biological physical and chemical systems have been recently proposed to treat laundry wastewater 27 28 membrane based separation such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf is currently the most widely used water reclamation technology 29 32 this technology is known to produce low suspended solids and organic permeates which is critical for the implementation of different forms of water reuse and fit for purpose treatment procedures 33 34 uf membranes have been incorporated in numerous studies for the pre treatment of wastewater prior to reverse osmosis ro treatment which is a technique that is commonly incorporated into advanced wastewater reclamation treatment systems for potable or non potable purposes 35 37 by incorporating uf membranes suspended solids and biological contaminants are removed before ro treatment thereby minimizing fouling on downstream ro membranes for instance the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater by a combination of membrane bioreactor mbr and ro treatment resulted in water that fully complied with the water quality requirements on a large scale unit with a total wastewater capacity of 200 m3 d 2 38 in some cases such as boiler make up water the conversion of reclaimed water into high purity water requires the use of ro as part of an advanced treatment process to reduce the hardness of the feed water unless an alternative is shown to provide an equivalent water quality low pressure uf membranes retain large organic molecules more effectively than mf membranes and are therefore uniquely well suited for greywater reclamation however increased fouling problems in uf membranes with high flux operation remain a major challenge in industrial applications compared to polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are better suited for the treatment of large volumes of laundry wastewater due to their hydrophilic properties ceramic uf membranes are 1 5 to 2 0 times less susceptible to membrane fouling and deliver better permeate water quality because organic substances establish weaker interactions with uf membrane surfaces compared to polymeric membranes 39 one of the most important factors affecting the extent of water flux and antifouling as well as the overall performance of the uf membrane is the membrane material a variety of inorganic material based membranes such as titania 40 42 alumina 43 mullite 44 silicon carbide 45 46 pyrophyllite 47 48 and zirconia 49 have been employed to enhance filtration performance a previous study reported that the effect of pore size could be affected by the membrane materials with hydrophilic membranes causing less fouling than hydrophobic membranes with smaller pore sizes 50 insights into the production operation and maintenance costs of ceramic uf membranes for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater can be obtained by assessing the performance of efficient and cost effective ceramic membrane materials our previous work on a widely available and inexpensive titanium oxide tio2 ceramic uf membranes demonstrated that it could retain up to 73 7 of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs i e a surfactant at 1000 mg l approximately 480 mg l of toc concentration which is the concentration of typical anionic surfactants produced from domestic laundry wastewater 51 therefore it is worth investigating whether ceramic uf membranes can be used in other applications for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater apart from filtration and treatment performance the cleaning strategies of ceramic uf membranes after laundry wastewater reclamation have not been thoroughly examined even though membrane fouling is a major drawback for long term filtration to regenerate organically fouled membranes most ceramic uf filtration studies suggest a combination of backwash and alkaline chemical cleaning 52 53 since physical and chemical cleaning methods prevent membranes from accumulating irreversible fouling efficient cleaning techniques to improve recovery and antifouling performance are urgently needed to establish proper maintenance guidelines for ceramic uf membranes only a few studies evaluating ceramic membrane performance for the treatment of surfactant containing simulated wastewater have been published and the performance of ceramic uf membranes has not been tested using real laundry wastewater in this study we demonstrate the feasibility of uf treatment for both synthetic and real laundry wastewaters with low fouling and high water flux using a tio2 ceramic uf membrane the fouling behavior of the ceramic uf membrane was thoroughly investigated for the treatment of laundry wastewater fouling resistance and organic retention were systematically investigated for diverse wastewater properties synthetic and real laundry wastewater and operating conditions applied pressure and temperature afterward the fouled ceramic uf membranes were regenerated using four different cleaning strategies which were subsequently analyzed and compared in terms of filtration and treatment performance to determine the best chemical cleaning method to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to comprehensively evaluate the fouling and cleaning of ceramic uf membranes as a feasible option for the treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic uf membrane filtration experiments a commercially available tio2 ceramic uf membrane sterlitech corp kent wa with a 1 kda nominal pore size and a 13 1 cm2 effective surface area was employed in a bench scale membrane filtration system as shown in fig s1 of appendix a a ceramic uf membrane was placed inside a disc holder between two viton o rings the laundry wastewater was fed into the disc holder at a positive gauge pressure using a gear pump labscitech inc corona ca after filtration the effluent was collected in a glass beaker that was constantly weighed using an automated electronic scale gx 4000 a d co ltd tokyo japan with the weight of the changing volume indicating flux changes ceramic uf filtration experiments were conducted at two different applied pressures 1 5 and 3 0 bar to investigate their effect on fouling behavior as well as filtration and treatment performance throughout the experiment 1 l of feed was stirred at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer msh 20a daihan scientific co ltd wonju south korea and kept at a constant temperature of 20 8 0 6 c room temperature except when the membrane was tested for temperature variation in which case the feed was heated to 69 9 4 9 c heated temperature inside an incubator jsgi 250t js research inc gongju south korea these temperatures were selected to represent the range of discharged laundry wastewater that can result from hot water washing machines with temperatures of 70 c 54 after each filtration experiment the ceramic membranes were removed from the disc holder and rinsed with di water to identify more effective and reliable cleaning methods for ceramic membranes various physical or chemical cleaning methods proposed in other studies or manufacturer recommendations were investigated by quantifying changes in flux decline and recovery as well as the removal of organic foulants to evaluate the effect of single chemical cleaning agents such as 0 5 m naoh and 0 0075 m h3po4 the ceramic membrane was soaked in chemical solutions heated to 50 c for 15 min and then flushed with di water at room temperature for 30 min to remove the remaining chemical reagents the ceramic membrane was similarly soaked in a series of heated 0 5 m naoh and 0 0075 m h3po4 solutions and flushed with di water prior to each experiment pure water permeability was examined on physically or chemically cleaned ceramic uf membranes to confirm that its recovered flux met the initial conditions the chemical formula and concentration of naoh and h3po4 were consistent with the manufacturer s recommended cleaning procedure to gain insights into the fouling and cleaning mechanisms of the ceramic membrane all experiments were repeated using synthetic and real laundry wastewater 2 2 characterization of ceramic uf membrane the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the ceramic uf membrane were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem auriga carl zeiss oberkochen germany to capture the layer structures as well as the thickness of the membrane fouling that occurs after filtration atomic force microscopy afm hr afm afmworkshop corp hilton head island sc was used to measure the surface roughness of the ceramic uf membrane the chemical structure of the ceramic uf membrane was investigated using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis and water contact angle measurement the atomic composition of the active surface layer was determined using an fe sem instrument which was also employed for eds analysis water contact angle wca measurements were performed to characterize the surface hydrophilicity of the ceramic uf membrane using a contact angle analyzer phoenix 300 touch surface electro optics co ltd suwon south korea with a 1 2 μl droplet of distilled water 2 3 membrane resistance determination membrane resistance r is a common indicator

viscosity and j is the volumetric flux of the permeate 2 4 synthetic and real laundry wastewater the chemical composition of synthetic laundry wastewater was slightly modified see table 1 from a study that investigated biologically treated laundry wastewater 55 the wastewater sample contained 100 mg l of sdbs c18h29nao3s sigma aldrich france a common anionic surfactant used in the manufacturing of household chemical products this concentration reflects the measured concentrations of anionic surfactants in commercially and domestically produced laundry wastewater the chemicals used for the preparation of synthetic laundry wastewater included sdbs ammonium sulfate h8n2o4s 99 w w magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgo4s 98 w w beef extract powder for microbiology potassium phosphate monobasic h2ko4p 99 w w urea ch4n2o 98 w w and bacto peptone all of the above synthetic laundry wastewater constituents were supplied by sigma aldrich except for bacto peptone which was purchased from gibco each chemical was thoroughly dissolved in di water after being meticulously measured real laundry wastewater samples were retrieved from a storage tank that collected laundry wastewater generated from a university student dormitory in our school the tank was completely mixed until fully homogenized prior to wastewater sampling and subsequently taken through a sampling port where laundry wastewater was extracted from a tank below the wastewater samples were kept in polypropylene containers and immediately transferred to the laboratory the wastewater samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within a week of collection table 2 details the properties of the synthetic and real laundry wastewater samples 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of feed and permeate were used to calculate the retention rate which represents the amounts of substances retained by the ceramic uf membrane ph and conductivity were measured using a portable electrode meter hq40d hach company loveland co total nitrogen total phosphorus and cod concentrations in wastewater samples were pretreated with commercial test kits before being analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr3900 hach company loveland co total nitrogen product 2714100 hach company loveland co and phosphorus product 2742645 hach company loveland co were measured via the acid persulfate digestion method using test n tube vials whereas cod was measured via the hach digestion method usepa cod digestion approach after the wastewater sample was filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf syringe filter a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu corp kyoto japan was used to analyze dissolved organic carbon doc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ceramic uf membrane 3 1 1 morphological properties of the ceramic uf membrane understanding the morphological properties of the tested ceramic uf membrane is important to further understand its fouling behavior and retention performance fig 1 presents a cross sectional and surface fe sem image of the pristine ceramic uf membrane used in this study the ceramic uf membrane is composed of three layers a top active layer an intermediate layer and a highly porous support layer all of which are composed of nano to micron sized tio2 particles the active layer was observed at approximately 15 μm and pollutants were filtered as feed entered the active layer by a sieve like structure created by overlapping tio2 particles that became coarser at the top surface the surface roughness of the ceramic uf membrane was determined through non contact mode of afm during the experiment direct contact caused unidentifiable streaks to appear on the topographic results and therefore only the non contact results were reported in this study fig 2 surface roughness was characterized based on various parameters including root mean squared rms roughness s q 68 8 nm mean roughness s a 54 8 nm and maximum peak height s p 260 4 nm the afm analysis results of the ceramic uf membrane were reported based on a 10 μm 10 μm area 5 μm division with a vertical z axis of 0 43 μm the pore size estimation by polyethylene glycol peg retention with various molecular weights 0 3 600 kda was equivalent to the 5 2 kda or 4 0 nm reported in our previous study 51 3 1 2 chemical properties of ceramic uf membrane the chemical properties of the ceramic uf membrane were investigated using surface charge eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and contact angle measurement to identify the chemical interaction between the solutes and the ceramic uf membrane surface the results from the surface charge ft ir and xps analysis for the characterization of the chemical functional groups and elemental compositions of the ceramic uf membrane surface were provided in our previous work 56 fig 3 presents the atomic constituents of the ceramic uf membrane in descending order indicating that the results correlate with the chemical composition provided by the manufacturer the weight percentage of oxygen and titanium were 34 2 and 31 7 respectively being the first and second most abundant elements in the ceramic uf membrane despite being considered a relative indicator hydrophilicity is a significant factor that is directly related to filtration performance 57 the value of the water contact angle was equivalent to 78 0 which was formed by a 0 001 0 002 ml water droplet these findings indicated that the ceramic uf membrane was slightly more hydrophobic than a membrane with the same material 41 3 2 filtration and treatment performance of synthetic laundry wastewater 3 2 1 effect of applied pressure fig 4 illustrates the filtration and treatment performance of the ceramic uf membrane when processing synthetic laundry wastewater at 1 5 and 3 0 bar water permeate flux changes were recorded using an automated weight measurement system at a constant applied pressure and were subsequently normalized by dividing the initial water flux higher volumes of permeate were produced at 3 0 bar than at 1 5 bar throughout the experiment because the water permeate flux was subjected to a pressure gradient although not exactly proportionate the initial water permeate fluxes for each process were 6 7 and 4 1 l m 2 h 1 respectively fig 4a furthermore after each water permeate flux curve reached a steady state the water permeate flux obtained at 3 0 bar of applied pressure was greater than that at a 1 5 bar applied pressure 2 5 and 1 6 l m 2 h 1 respectively however the normalized flux for both applied pressures showed similar trends and the differences were minimal suggesting that the degree of fouling in both conditions was similar fig 4b in fig 4c which was computed using eq 3 the gradual build up of membrane fouling at each applied pressure is represented as fouling resistance 58 the membrane driven at 3 0 bar exhibited greater increments and an overall higher fouling resistance value because more severe fouling is expected at 3 0 bar compared to 1 5 bar this suggests that thick compact layers of cake or organics formed as a result of high pressure operations significantly contributed to the formation of fouling resistance nevertheless the high pressure operation exhibited better toc removal efficiency of 42 8 which was higher than the 34 6 achieved at 1 5 bar fig 4d this was consistent with our previous study which found that sdbs retention was higher at higher pressures 51 the ceramic uf filtration of synthetic laundry wastewater resulted in slightly lower toc removal efficiencies than for pure surfactant solutions because other organic and inorganic substances may influence the treatment performance through chemical interactions between the ceramic membrane surface and the solutes significant pore clogging and cake layer formation were observed even though important constituents such as sdbs and dissolved ions were much smaller than the average pore size of the ceramic uf membrane 59 another study reported that the thickness of this cake layer tends to increase with applied pressure when using tight uf membranes 60 the retention of smaller molecules was improved by reducing the porosity and average pore diameter of a membrane as more pollutants rapidly deposit to form a thick compact foulant layer 61 suggesting that the high pressure operation would improve toc retention and favor the performance of laundry wastewater treatment 3 2 2 effect of temperature the effect of feed water temperature on filtration and treatment performance was evaluated to simulate laundry wastewater conditions as laundry is often washed at temperatures ranging from intermediate to extremely hot presumably reaching up to 90 c for front loading washers in an incubator a feed water tank was automatically controlled to represent laundry wastewater at room temperature rt 20 8 0 6 c or heated temperature ht 69 9 4 9 c the initial water permeate flux was measured at 10 1 l m 2 h 1 rt and 31 2 l m 2 h 1 ht fig 5a indicating that relatively higher water permeate flux was observed in the ht condition due to the influence of solution viscosity 62 64 specifically the weakening of intermolecular forces between molecules as temperature rises facilitates molecular diffusion and reduces viscosity which weakens the drag force of molecules and promotes particle detachment 65 67 furthermore the thermal expansion of the membrane pore size may allow the membrane to become more accessible to wastewater pollutants 68 fig 5a shows that after 15 h of filtration the water permeate flux between the rt and ht conditions was nearly identical even slightly lower in the ht condition given that the ht curve displayed a rapid decline and consistently rendered lower values than that of rt the membrane fouling tendency increased as temperature increased according to the normalized flux in fig 5b after 15 h of filtration the fouling resistance of ht exceeded that of rt fig 5c indicating that the resistance could be induced by increased adsorption due to internal fouling such as pore blocking 63 as a result even while the initial permeate flux of the membranes increase as the temperature rises increasing fouling tendencies eventually result in lower water permeate flux than at lower temperatures furthermore owing to the increased permeate flux the membrane pores were exposed to a greater amount of solutes making them susceptible to fouling as increased temperatures result in increased permeability a significant amount of solute escaped the membrane without being filtered as shown in fig 5d the rt operation exhibited a better toc removal efficiency of 42 8 10 0 which was much higher than the 11 9 2 2 at the ht condition as reported in previous studies 69 although higher temperatures are associated with higher permeabilities the ht operation presented higher toc concentrations in the permeate throughout the filtration period indicating that the selectivity of the ceramic uf membrane against organic substances within laundry wastewater may be significantly reduced there are some potential advantages of implementing typical conditions of laundry wastewater with temperatures ranging from 25 to 40 c which result from cold or warm washing options the proposed implementation might also be convenient for laundry wastewater with temperatures of 70 c as these conditions might deteriorate the lifespan of the polymeric membrane these results combined with those from the filtration and treatment performance evaluation indicate that laundry wastewaters discharged from hot water washing machine conditions were required to improve the efficiency of ceramic uf membrane pre treatment through the integration of an advanced treatment step to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to suggest the use of ceramic uf membranes for the treatment of hot laundry wastewater as a feasible option in standalone water reuse systems however the development of a hybrid system for the separation of organic contaminants after downstream advanced treatment remains an important challenge 3 3 effect of cleaning strategies on flux recovery and treatment performance we investigated the effects of four different cleaning strategies on the flux recovery of fouled ceramic uf membranes relative to the initial flux condition to identify the most suitable cleaning method for the treatment of laundry wastewater the soak and flush method is a common cleaning procedure which entails soaking the ceramic membrane in different cleaning agents for a certain amount of time and subsequently flushing it with di water before reuse fig 6 shows the flux decline curves after each cleaning step for the four different cleaning strategies di naoh h3po4 naoh and h3po4 the water permeate flux for the caustic cleaning method c naoh was significantly recovered and almost reached the initial water flux 7 l m 2 h 1 meaning that the flux decline was minimal in most cases the water permeate flux decreased after the first and second cleaning steps a di b naoh h3po4 and d h3po4 however the acid cleaning method with h3po4 d h3po4 was largely ineffective as the recovery rates declined even more than di washing which was initially expected to yield the lowest recovery rates furthermore the permeate flux after the combined caustic and acid cleaning procedure b naoh h3po4 achieved better recoveries than when acid cleaning was used d h3po4 these observations suggest that alkaline based cleaning solutions could be effective in removing foulants during ceramic uf membrane filtration for the treatment of laundry wastewater under a relatively high ph e g naoh cleaning organic foulants are known to attain better conformational linearity allowing them to become structurally loose and sparse 70 as a result they can quickly detach from the membrane surface facilitating foulant removal via forward flushing 70 71 deprotonation at the membrane surface also causes an increase in the electron receptor contribution to the polar component of surface tension which increases membrane surface hydrophilicity 72 table 3 shows the recovered flux and toc retention for four different cleaning methods after the first and second cleaning procedures alkaline based chemical reagents are more effective at removing foulants than acidic reagents due to the presence of hydroxyl ions in caustic solutions therefore alkaline reagents could be an effective alternative strategy for the flux recovery of ceramic uf membranes by facilitating the detachment of organic foulants which were formulated as a major fraction of the laundry wastewater used in this study however prolonged exposure to alkaline solutions for membrane cleaning may disrupt filtration and treatment performance similar studies on polymeric membranes suggest that alkaline cleaning solutions cause membrane expansion by increasing flux and decreasing retention 73 the recovered flux exceeded the initial water flux only for caustic cleaning while toc retention was slightly lower than the value obtained for the combined caustic and acid cleaning method exposing such polymeric membranes to neutral or low ph solutions has been shown to stimulate re protonation and enhance membrane selectivity 74 75 therefore a dual step caustic and acid chemical cleaning protocol might remove organic foulants from laundry wastewater while preserving the physiocochemical properties of the membrane future studies should thus investigate the specific classification and fraction of dissolved organic matters doms in the cleaned solutions to gain insights into the type of foulants that are more efficiently removed by different chemical cleaning solutions which can be achieved using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd 3 4 filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater the filtration and treatment performance of real laundry wastewater could provide key insights into the feasibility of ceramic uf membranes as synthetic laundry wastewater could not accurately represent real life commercial and domestic laundry wastewater here we expected to gain insights into the real world applicability of ceramic uf membranes for greywater pre treatment by comparing the filtration and treatment performance of synthetic and real laundry wastewater in terms of water quality fig 7a and b present the water permeate flux and normalized flux for treating 100 mg l sdbs extracted from our previous study 51 synthetic and real laundry wastewater the membrane for the treatment of synthetic wastewater was likely to have formed the thickest gel layer because synthetic wastewater contained the highest doc concentration as shown in table 2 dom has been identified as a major cause of membrane fouling in the treatment of domestic wastewater in several studies 76 77 as dom concentration in the feed increases more dom molecules agglomerate into a thick layer of gel causing considerable fouling resistance 60 78 79 table 2 shows that real laundry wastewater samples had fewer organic contaminants and lower cod toc and doc concentrations while having a higher concentration of total and volatile solids as a result organic fouling as the collection of carbon based materials on a filtration membrane caused the largest flux reduction and lowest water permeate flux in synthetic wastewater filtration fig 7b these findings were consistent with a previous study that reported that after filtering natural organic matter solutions containing silica particles and electrolytes polymeric uf membranes experienced greater flux decline than solutions containing only natural organic matter and electrolytes accounting for 74 and 49 decreases in flux rates respectively 80 however it is worth noting that the treatment performance can vary and may be influenced by other factors such as the type of detergent washer load volumes and speed of the washing machine fig 8 shows how the ceramic uf membrane removes toc from sdbs synthetic and real laundry wastewaters at an applied pressure of 3 0 bar at room temperature the ceramic uf membrane presented the highest toc retention 26 4 with synthetic laundry wastewater compared to sdbs 21 6 and real laundry wastewater 9 4 although not proportionate feeds with higher toc and doc concentrations in synthetic laundry wastewater had increased toc retention rates given that a polymeric uf membrane with a 10 kda pore size could retain up to 66 of cod from a high strength textile laundry wastewater with 1500 2500 mg l cod concentrations cod or toc retention rates tend to increase as cod or toc concentrations in the feed increases 81 the overall results showed that filtration which was more likely to induce severe pore blockage reduced membrane permeability and therefore prevented organic matters from exiting the membrane 73 unlike synthetic laundry wastewater which consists primarily of organic matter real laundry wastewater contains suspended or colloidal particulates which may affect toc retention performance our findings indicated that ceramic uf pre treatment has the greatest potential for the decentralized treatment and reuse of domestic wastewater at urban sites where suspended particulates predominate such as laundry wastewater at sites where organic matter is also present ceramic membrane pre treatment could be used as part of a wastewater reuse treatment approach to reduce the contaminants however advanced treatment by physicochemical processes would still be required retention of suspended particulates by ceramic uf membrane will likely be less important at laundry wastewater reuse sites than in the experiments described herein as real world concentrations are typically below the concentrations at which suspended or colloidal fouling occurred in the experiments however ceramic uf pre treatment is likely to be ineffective for surfactant or detergent retention due to their low molecular weight ceramic membranes are known for their fouling and filtration behaviors therefore the cleaning studies could serve as a means of reducing the uncertainty associated with economic feasibility and facilitate faster and more cost effective ceramic membrane development and implementation in this study we progressively optimized our fouling and cleaning strategies to accurately reflect the conditions in a domestic environment however the ceramic uf pre treatment would have to optimized to obtain the equivalent particulate and organic retention after scale up additional research is also needed to assess the long term performance of the membranes under realistic operating conditions to support the adoption of these efficient treatment technologies and to promote the widespread reuse of non potable water 4 conclusions this study proposed optimized operating conditions for a ceramic uf membrane with a 1 kda pore size to treat laundry wastewater based on the analysis of fouling behavior and water flux recovery after applying various cleaning strategies morphological and chemical properties such as microporous structure surface roughness chemical composition and surface hydrophilicity were obtained for the ceramic uf membrane and this information was used to assess the feasibility of this technology for the treatment of laundry wastewater lower applied pressure at room temperature conditions resulted in significant flux decline decreased fouling resistance and higher toc retention in synthetic laundry wastewater afterward fouled ceramic membranes were cleaned using different cleaning methods with alkaline based cleaning agents exhibiting improved water flux recovery in turn this was attributed to the effective detachment of organic foulants attached to the ceramic uf membrane our findings also demonstrated that a potential chemical cleaning method including alkaline solutions followed by acidic solutions increases the effectiveness of cleaning strategies in terms of flux recovery and toc retention real laundry wastewater which contains less organic and more particulate matter than synthetic laundry wastewater has a smaller flux decline curve than synthetic laundry wastewater because organic matter is more effective in limiting the fouling sources for the treatment of laundry wastewater the ceramic uf membrane was largely effective at removing suspended particulates in real laundry wastewater but was less effective in retaining organic matter in summary this study is the first to investigate the fouling and flux behavior of ceramic uf membrane for the treatment of laundry wastewater as well as appropriate cleaning strategies although the ceramic uf membranes may retain large amounts of organics and suspended solids coupling them with more integrated and acknowledged techniques e g ro membranes could significantly improve retention rates furthermore additional studies involving various real laundry wastewaters for sustainable water treatment are also required to validate our

spectrometry ft icr ms waste treatment plant excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems 1 introduction hospitals generate a large amount of wastewater containing numerous pollutants such as organic matter pathogenic microorganisms heavy metals dyes drug residues and pharmaceutical personal care products ppcps 1 the amount of wastewater generated from hospitals is reportedly in the range of 400 1200 l day per bed in developed countries and 200 400 l day in developing countries with an average of approximately 750 l day per bed 2 biomedical wastewater treatment is of particular importance in reducing hazardous matter and ecological risks from hospitals 3 as well as in promoting the beneficial reuse of treated water some studies have been carried out on hospital solid waste management or pretreatment through coagulation flocculation and flotation 4 but there is limited data on dissolved phase wastewater 5 reported studies on hospital wastewater treatment are generally focused on one type of pollutant in dissolved phase and tests were made on synthetic wastewater 2 the presence of a large amount and multiformity of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater presents a huge challenge to treatment processes e g biological chemical physical and technologies e g membrane filtration 6 7 dom in wastewater effluent can act as precursors of undesirable disinfection by products dbps and aids in the indirect photolysis of many organic contaminants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and ppcps 8 9 dom also provides energy for microbes and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus for aquatic plankton and affects microbial activity in the biochemical mbr tank due to its high mobility and diversity dom is a proven major transporter of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and can potentially change their sorption and fate in the environment 8 10 11 moreover dom greatly affects wastewater treatment performance including membrane fouling and oxidant demand among others 12 effective tools are required to characterize dom however molecular characterization of dom remains a challenge in many cases only selected compounds e g pharmaceuticals in the water phase were investigated in hospital wastewater 13 over the last decade several methods for onsite treatment of hospital wastewater have been proposed to enable the effective removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogenic microorganisms have been investigated 2 studies focused on certain types of compounds may not provide adequate guidance on real water treatment containing complex organic compounds to our knowledge no full scale studies of dom in hospital wastewater hww have been reported in the high throughput analysis at the molecular level accordingly it is difficult to evaluate the removal efficiency of each treatment unit without knowledge of dom therefore non targeted analysis of dissolved organic compounds in medical wastewater is essential currently it is not feasible to perform quantitative characterization of dom at the level of full molecular structures 14 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a promising tool that can simultaneously

results and discussion 3 1 composition of dom in the initial effluent 3 1 1 dom characterized by ft icr ms vs wastewater dom there were 2927 formulae assigned in the final dataset of the initial influent a summary of the characteristics of the dom in hospital wastewater hww is presented in table 2 including comparisons with other types of wastewater e g natural dom from the suwannee river and industrial parks iww municipal wastewater mww and drinking water dw the dom formulae in hospital wastewater are located in the aliphatic and peptide region the dominating compounds are oxygen depleted and saturated fig 2 the composition of dom is similar to that of the dom in a municipal wastewater treatment plant at castell d aro spain 31 there are few compounds in the carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram region fig 2 which are recognized as common and recalcitrant dom in natural systems the hospital wastewater differs significantly from the reported dom from a chemical industrial park in taixing city jiangsu province of china which is dominated by compounds located in the cram region 16 3 1 2 dom characterized by ft icr ms vs natural dom there were a total of 533 formulae in both dom in hospital wastewater and natural dom of the suwannee river nom from ihss fig 3a shows that the shared formulae are mainly in the range of h c from 1 to 1 5 and o c from 0 2 0 5 the blue dots show that the aliphatic formulae are concentrated in the hospital dom while the orange dots show that the cram is concentrated in the nom typically the proportion of aliphatic compounds is 10 times higher than the dom from the suwannee river investigated in this study 20 vs 2 fig 4 in contrast dom in hospital wastewater shows less aromaticity the hospital wastewater contains few aromatic or condensed aromatic compounds which accounted for 10 of all the compounds fig 4 fig 5 shows a typical feature of hospital wastewater in further detail which is the large proportion of sulfur containing compounds including chos and chnos the cho compounds are less than half of the total amount chno compounds in hospital wastewater are nearly twice that in nom fig 5 the significant proportion of heteroaromatic compounds in medical wastewater indicates the potential for being a precursor in the formation of sulfur containing or nitrogen containing volatile compounds 32 34 it is noteworthy that the dom in hospital wastewater shows a much lower average weighted m z at 346 compared to m z at 406 in the nom from ihss table 1 suggesting smaller molecules compared to nom this is important as the water treatment plant may consist of membrane filtering or reverse osmosis through which larger molecules are retained and water is purified the m z result suggests that stricter controls in the membrane filtering system are needed for dom in hospital wastewater compared to nom 3 1 3 dom characterized by eems the eems of extracted dom showed that the wastewater was dominated by protein like compounds it has been reported that the protein like or biopolymer dom can be lost during spe 30 35 suggesting an even higher proportion of protein like compounds than that in the measured spectra of extracted dom this is consistent with the results of ft icr ms there are fluorescent signals in the range of excitation at 290 310 nm and emission at 380 400 nm fig 6a compared to the nom from the suwannee river which is dominated by the humic like peak c the dom in medical wastewater exhibits the less conjugated and less aromatic functional group of the humic like peak m in summary compared to nom the dom in medical wastewater exhibited a lower unsaturation degree a lower molecular weight and a higher proportion of heteroatomic organic matter e g chno chos and chno medical wastewater differs significantly from wastewater containing effluent from a chemical industry park which is enriched in highly unsaturated and aromatic compounds 16 the formulae of the latter were located mainly in the cram and carbohydrate regions 3 2 removal of dom in the wastewater treatment plant 3 2 1 performance of bio tanks in an mbr unit with anaerobic aerobic tanks chos and chnos components were preferentially removed after the combined aerobic and anaerobic degradation of bioavailable compounds in wastewater fig 5 the longer emission wavelength of the humic like peak suggests more conjugated aromatic structures 36 which was consistent with the increased aromaticity index the bio tanks are capable of significantly degrading dom resulting in considerable changes in the molecular composition of dom table 1 dom is more aromatic compared to the primary effluent fig 4 there is increased diversity of compounds and accumulation of chno compounds the bio tanks including anoxic oxic and mbr units were reported to lead to a slight change in the molecular formulae of waste water from an industry park 16 whereas we observed the most significant change in the bio tanks this indicates the dom in medical waste is relatively more bioavailable compared to the wastewater containing effluent from the chemical industry park similar to the findings in a municipal wastewater treatment plant the largest changes in dom optical properties and composition were induced by secondary treatment 17 this results in the loss of highly saturated formulae and the production of more aromatic complex and less bioavailable dom the secondary treatment processes produced dom with a distinct molecular composition an increase in unsaturated molecular features of the effluent organic matter was observed after secondary biological treatment of municipal wastewater which shows a similar distribution of dom in the aliphatic and unsaturated region in the van krevelen diagram 31 this suggests that both the municipal and medical wastewater are more bioavailable and transformed in bio tanks however there is no reduction in the m z of large molecules this phenomenon is different from that observed in reported study the large molecules were preferentially degraded in domestic wastewater 37 the latter has a higher proportion of the large bioavailable molecules they tend to be biopolymers e g proteins and carbohydrates in municipal wastewater containing domestic sewage 37 3 2 2 performance of a disinfection unit the disinfection process resulted in subtle changes in dom composition based on the van krevelen diagram a slight increase in aliphatic compounds and the reduced aromatic index suggest the breakdown of highly unsaturated aromatic compounds fig 4 a loss of fluorescent signals was observed especially in the humic like region of the eems fig 6 similarly it was reported that secondary clarification and uv disinfection result in subtle yet detectable changes in dom composition in a municipal wastewater plant with limited aromatic compounds 17 the disinfection process may shift the composition of dom to a large extent for the wastewater dom containing cram and polyphenol tannins compounds it has been reported that precursors with lower h c and higher aromaticity were readily degraded with products featuring lower molecular weight after disinfection in a municipal treatment nanjing china 38 an increase in the oxygen content of compounds was observed after ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops treatment and via oxygenation processes 38 in comparison the dom in hospital wastewater is less sensitive to the disinfection process compared to the wastewater concentrated in cram lignin like compounds this is because hww dom consists of few light absorbing aromatic compounds and polyphenol like compounds therefore it is less sensitive to uv radiation nevertheless the process with uv and potassium monopersulfate is not only helpful in disinfection but also effective in the removal of remaining aromatic pharmaceuticals or humic substances from medical wastewater the loss of fluorescent peak in the humic like region may result from the degradation of fluorescent pharmaceuticals considering that there are few cram compounds in the van krevelen diagram moreover we have tested pharmaceuticals which were located in the humic like regions of eems fig s1 it is found that the humic like peaks are not necessarily humic substances the lost signal of humic like compounds may be due to the degradation of fluorescent medicals e g pharmaceuticals in hww furthermore the photodegradation rates of compounds could be accelerated by dom mainly through excited triplet dom 39 therefore disinfection e g by uv and monopersulfate is an important and useful step for hww dom treatment after the bio tanks 3 2 3 performance of a reverse osmosis unit after reverse osmosis a similar distribution of dom was observed in the van krevelen diagram the decreased formulae are dispersedly shown in the van krevelen diagram fig 7 and the light blue dots suggest a slight difference in the change of the decreased formulae compared to the bio tanks and disinfection processes the dispersed blue dots indicate low selectivity of reverse osmosis the red yellow dots show the compounds that disappeared after reverse osmosis and were likely to exist in the clean effluent which can be used cyclically to achieve circular re utilization and conserve water resources the compounds lost in the ro concentrate tend to be aliphatic compounds fig 7 this is reasonable as the aliphatic compounds show less polarity and more electrical neutrality the permeability of compounds through ro membrane depends on not only the size but also electrostatic interaction 40 in accordance with this study it was reported that the fraction of nom found in ro permeates was dominated by low molecular weight neutrals 40 in this study the similar m z ratio suggests a similar distribution of molecular weight in the mass spectra of initial water and ro concentrates the permeable dom is limited and results in a slight change of concentrates after ro similarly it has been reported that the terminal units of reverse osmosis can remove most dom with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc declining by 94 6 16 doc was effectively retained and concentrated after ro despite of limited permeates ro is an efficient and non selective removal process for extractable dom 3 2 4 open database of all dom formulae identified in the treatment plant based on the findings a dataset for wastewater treatment was developed all the data is provided as part of the supplementary materials the database includes the dom formulae in this paper the water treatment plant in this study is sourced from large general hospital wastewater with various medical services and broad use of medical organics therefore the dom database can be a highly informative representative of hospitals when used as a reference in designing effective treatment processes in the future multiple techniques are needed for the treatment of a complex mixture of effluents 41 therefore more data are expected for the development of an improved design of treatment plant in line with the investigation of innovative treatment on dom it should be noted that the compounds analyzed by ft icr ms are the extractable portion after spe innovative analytical techniques of ft icr ms are required to assess the unextractable compounds at the molecular level 3 3 ecological risk of dom in medical wastewater from hospitals and pollution control 3 3 1 features of dom in untreated hospital wastewater and its ecological risk nearly 3000 compounds were identified in a single dom sample of hospital wastewater suggesting high diversity of components in dissolved phase of hww dominant aliphatic and highly unsaturated compounds are distinct features of hospital wastewater in contrast to the natural dom there are few cram compounds in the hww and 20 formulae shared in both wastewater and unpolluted natural samples more than 80 of the total formulae are unique in hww dom in natural water or wastewater is highly diverse with thousands of formulae detected in a single sample most of them were structurally uncharacterized this makes it difficult to evaluate the exact ecological risk for individual components in medical dom natural dom widely co exists with organisms without ecological risk reported in comparison the large amounts of unique formulae in medical wastewater suggest uncertainties in the level of ecological risk and the applicable removal technique for example the conventional treatment plants are not established for eliminating pharmaceuticals and an additional oxidation elimination process is necessary for medical water treatment 13 42 in the context of small clinics medical wastewater containing various pharmaceuticals may be discharged into the municipal sewage system hww is treated by municipal wastewater treatment plants 20 despite the impact of pharmaceuticals in reported studies special caution is needed to explore the ecological risk of dom in un preprocessed medical sewage hospital wastewater is enriched in chno chos and chnos compounds first the potential risk of releasing nitrate or ammonium should be noted nitrogen containing dom provides energy for microbes and nutrients for aquatic plankton and affects microbial activity 43 second it has been reported that hospital wastewater was released into septic tanks without treatment which could lead to groundwater contamination and result in diseases without implementing a strict detoxification process 1 third the unexpected sulfur containing organics generated after degradation may produce either smaller and volatile compounds or sulfides 32 34 this might result in odorous catabolites once the biodegradable compounds are degraded and become precursors of heteroatoms containing volatile compounds finally in some cases hospital wastewater is directly discharged into the sewer system to be co treated with urban wastewater 44 chlorine disinfectant is commonly used 45 there is less risk of disinfection by products dpbs from hww humic substances which are important precursors of dpbs 9 nitrogen containing and peptide like compounds were widely detected in hww by ft icr ms and they may be precursors of n dpbs 46 3 3 2 removal of dom in treated hospital wastewater and challenges our results indicate that medical wastewater could be effectively treated via bio tanks disinfection and reverse osmosis to reduce the environmental impact of the wastewater and the process is applicable in water reuse initiatives similarly the tn has been decreased from 150 0 mg l to 24 2 mg l with remaining 5 9 mg l nh3 nh₄ and 6 1 mg l no3 the removal effects of all the units are summarized in fig 8 the treatment processes promote dom biodegradation of wastewater in bio tanks oxidative degradation of aromatic compounds in the disinfection unit and less selective removal in the reverse osmosis unit the pharmaceutical products were detected in a mww plant with wastewater from a hospital and the immunotoxic potential have been reported 47 carbamazepine gemfibrozil and norfloxacin were detected in mixed domestic wastewaters 47 these pharmaceutical products are fluorescent aromatic components disinfection with uv and potassium monopersulfate is recommended for medical wastewater which is an efficient way to promote the degradation of these fluorescent aromatic compounds however the organic compounds transformed and degraded during the biodegradation and disinfection processes were not thoroughly mineralized to inorganic carbon or particulate organics the concentration of doc remained similar with only 10 removed after processing in both bio tanks and disinfection unit the doc concentration in the influent of ro was 32 mg c l compared to bio tanks and disinfection unit reverse osmosis most effectively concentrated doc which nearly doubled 56 mg l in the concentrated waste compared to the inlet water some formulae were difficult to be removed during the water treatment processes the most abundant formulae that remained after the series of treatment processes are shown in a table table s1 sulfur containing and aliphatic unsaturated components with 3 4 dbe were found to persist in the units these were probably benzene sulfonate surfactants resistant to all the treatment units benzene sulfonate surfactants may cause an inhibition effect during microbial degradation in the anaerobic aerobic tank and result in further ecological risk in the treated effluent the persistent compounds are smaller in size average of m z 297 compared to the dom in the initial step average of m z 346 the remarkable proportion of aliphatic compounds with low polarity and more electro neutrality tends to be permeable this suggests the need for a stricter reverse osmosis process compared to nom enriched in humic like compounds with larger molecular weight similarly it was reported that the molecular composition of dom in the secondary effluent and reclaimed water was dominated by chos formulae in a large scale wastewater treatment plant for municipal wastewater in beijing 48 as chos compounds tend to be readily degraded in the mbr system with an anaerobic aerobic tank a more thorough degradation or optimization of function in the mbr is recommended for persistent benzene sulfonate surfactant like compounds besides it should be noted that the ro retentates might contain concentrated medicals which are easily captured in the membrane or concentrated waters on the one hand the membrane should be carefully cleaned or disposed to avoid the secondary contamination and environmental risk on the other hand the numerous nitrogen containing compounds tend to form positive ions amino amine h and block the ro membrane for example it has been reported that the ro membrane is electronegative and sensitively blocked when neutralized by cationic surfactant 49 4 conclusions we examined the dom in hospital wastewater at the molecular level and evaluated the ecological risk to support better environmental management nearly 3000 compounds were identified in the initial sewage with a dominant protein like peak in eems and low aromaticity index heteroatom containing formulae in hww indicate higher nutrient releasing capacity of organic compounds that could impact aquatic systems the removal of medical dom via the hww treatment plant was further investigated significant degradation of aliphatic compounds was observed after treatment in units of anaerobic aerobic tanks disinfection with uv and potassium monopersulfate is useful in eliminating aromatic and fluorescent compounds but does not impact the major components which were mainly aliphatic or unsaturated compounds reverse osmosis shows only a slight selective effect in the removal of dom with concentrated cram compounds all the samples shared a similar distribution in the aliphatic region in the van krevelen diagram dom in all steps was dominated by less aromatic and smaller formulae compared to ihss nom standards from suwannee river indicating the necessity of a rigorous reverse osmosis process more specifically care should be taken in removing benzene sulfonate surfactant and nitrogen containing highly unsaturated compounds that are smaller in size this study provided important information to the non targeted and high throughput screening of dom from hww effluent and a chemical fingerprint of dom transformation in an actual hww treatment plant at the molecular level knowledge of these characteristics compared to other types of water treatment is indispensable to large scale design prior to the application of technologies for medical wastewater treatment the following are the

12891,hospitals generate large volumes of wastewater dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater effluent can act as precursors of disinfection by products transporter of pollutants and affect the performance of treatment plants this study aims to characterize the composition of dom in medical wastewater and investigate the selectivity of the hospital treatment plant in the removal of dom dom was characterized by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eems dom of medical wastewater was dominated by aliphatic and highly unsaturated compounds a feature that is remarkably different from that of natural dom in the membrane bioreactor mbr unit more chno compounds and highly unsaturated compounds were

concentrated and removed these steps were complementary in the removal of dom suggesting effective transformation and elimination of dom this study contributes to a better understanding of the features of dom in medical wastewater and treatment plant performance in the removal of dom which is indispensable for the large scale design and application of technologies for hospital wastewater treatment especially in the context of the covid 19 pandemic graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dissolved organic matter hospital wastewater fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms waste treatment plant excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems 1 introduction hospitals generate a large amount of wastewater containing numerous pollutants such as organic matter pathogenic microorganisms heavy metals dyes drug residues and pharmaceutical personal care products ppcps 1 the amount of wastewater generated from hospitals is reportedly in the range of 400 1200 l day per bed in developed countries and 200 400 l day in developing countries with an average of approximately 750 l day per bed 2 biomedical wastewater treatment is of particular importance in reducing hazardous matter and ecological risks from hospitals 3 as well as in promoting the beneficial reuse of treated water some studies have been carried out on hospital solid waste management or pretreatment through coagulation flocculation and flotation 4 but there is limited data on dissolved phase wastewater 5 reported studies on hospital wastewater treatment are generally focused on one type of pollutant in dissolved phase and tests were made on synthetic wastewater 2 the presence of a large amount and multiformity of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater presents a huge challenge to treatment processes e g biological chemical physical and technologies e g membrane filtration 6 7 dom in wastewater effluent can act as precursors of undesirable disinfection by products dbps and aids in the indirect photolysis of many organic contaminants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and ppcps 8 9 dom also provides energy for microbes and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus for aquatic plankton and affects microbial activity in the biochemical mbr tank due to its high mobility and diversity dom is a proven major transporter of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and can potentially change their sorption and fate in the environment 8 10 11 moreover dom greatly affects wastewater treatment performance including membrane fouling and oxidant demand among others 12 effective tools are required to characterize dom however molecular characterization of dom remains a challenge in many cases only selected compounds e g pharmaceuticals in the water phase were investigated in hospital wastewater 13 over the last decade several methods for onsite treatment of hospital wastewater have been proposed to enable the effective removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogenic microorganisms have been investigated 2 studies focused on certain types of compounds may not provide adequate guidance on real water treatment containing complex organic compounds to our knowledge no full scale studies of dom in hospital wastewater hww have been reported in the high throughput analysis at the molecular level accordingly it is difficult to evaluate the removal efficiency of each treatment unit without knowledge of dom therefore non targeted analysis of dissolved organic compounds in medical wastewater is essential currently it is not feasible to perform quantitative characterization of dom at the level of full molecular structures 14 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a promising tool that can simultaneously characterize thousands of individual dom formulae at the molecular level this method has been applied in several studies on wastewater treatment 15 17 in addition to ft icr ms dom in natural water or wastewater can be characterized by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy 18 19 studies have shown a positive correlation between the fluorescence of hospital wastewater and the removal of pharmaceuticals thus eems could be particularly useful in identifying the variations in the properties of medical sewage 20 this study focused on the characterization of dom and its implications for water treatment systems in hospital both eems and ft icr ms were applied to better understand the dom composition from wastewater samples this study involved the development of a dom database for medical wastewater treatment specifically a fine chemical fingerprint of dom transformation in hospital wastewater treatment plants via an mbr system with anaerobic aerobic tanks disinfection unit and reverse osmosis membrane further the results facilitate the evaluation of ecological risks in untreated hww and support decisions on the sewage purification system in hospitals based on a better understanding of comprehensive treatment technologies 2 material and methods 2 1 setup of a wastewater plant the wastewater samples were collected from guangdong provincial people s

comparison the dom in hospital wastewater is less sensitive to the disinfection process compared to the wastewater concentrated in cram lignin like compounds this is because hww dom consists of few light absorbing aromatic compounds and polyphenol like compounds therefore it is less sensitive to uv radiation nevertheless the process with uv and potassium monopersulfate is not only helpful in disinfection but also effective in the removal of remaining aromatic pharmaceuticals or humic substances from medical wastewater the loss of fluorescent peak in the humic like region may result from the degradation of fluorescent pharmaceuticals considering that there are few cram compounds in the van krevelen diagram moreover we have tested pharmaceuticals which were located in the humic like regions of eems fig s1 it is found that the humic like peaks are not necessarily humic substances the lost signal of humic like compounds may be due to the degradation of fluorescent medicals e g pharmaceuticals in hww furthermore the photodegradation rates of compounds could be accelerated by dom mainly through excited triplet dom 39 therefore disinfection e g by uv and monopersulfate is an important and useful step for hww dom treatment after the bio tanks 3 2 3 performance of a reverse osmosis unit after reverse osmosis a similar distribution of dom was observed in the van krevelen diagram the decreased formulae are dispersedly shown in the van krevelen diagram fig 7 and the light blue dots suggest a slight difference in the change of the decreased formulae compared to the bio tanks and disinfection processes the dispersed blue dots indicate low selectivity of reverse osmosis the red yellow dots show the compounds that disappeared after reverse osmosis and were likely to exist in the clean effluent which can be used cyclically to achieve circular re utilization and conserve water resources the compounds lost in the ro concentrate tend to be aliphatic compounds fig 7 this is reasonable as the aliphatic compounds show less polarity and more electrical neutrality the permeability of compounds through ro membrane depends on not only the size but also electrostatic interaction 40 in accordance with this study it was reported that the fraction of nom found in ro permeates was dominated by low molecular weight neutrals 40 in this study the similar m z ratio suggests a similar distribution of molecular weight in the mass spectra of initial water and ro concentrates the permeable dom is limited and results in a slight change of concentrates after ro similarly it has been reported that the terminal units of reverse osmosis can remove most dom with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc declining by 94 6 16 doc was effectively retained and concentrated after ro despite of limited permeates ro is an efficient and non selective removal process for extractable dom 3 2 4 open database of all dom formulae identified in the treatment plant based on the findings a dataset for wastewater treatment was developed all the data is provided as part of the supplementary materials the database includes the dom formulae in this paper the water treatment plant in this study is sourced from large general hospital wastewater with various medical services and broad use of medical organics therefore the dom database can be a highly informative representative of hospitals when used as a reference in designing effective treatment processes in the future multiple techniques are needed for the treatment of a complex mixture of effluents 41 therefore more data are expected for the development of an improved design of treatment plant in line with the investigation of innovative treatment on dom it should be noted that the compounds analyzed by ft icr ms are the extractable portion after spe innovative analytical techniques of ft icr ms are required to assess the unextractable compounds at the molecular level 3 3 ecological risk of dom in medical wastewater from hospitals and pollution control 3 3 1 features of dom in untreated hospital wastewater and its ecological risk nearly 3000 compounds were identified in a single dom sample of hospital wastewater suggesting high diversity of components in dissolved phase of hww dominant aliphatic and highly unsaturated compounds are distinct features of hospital wastewater in contrast to the natural dom there are few cram compounds in the hww and 20 formulae shared in both wastewater and unpolluted natural samples more than 80 of the total formulae are unique in hww dom in natural water or wastewater is highly diverse with thousands of formulae detected in a single sample most of them were structurally uncharacterized this makes it difficult to evaluate the exact ecological risk for individual components in medical dom natural dom widely co exists with organisms without ecological risk reported in comparison the large amounts of unique formulae in medical wastewater suggest uncertainties in the level of ecological risk and the applicable removal technique for example the conventional treatment plants are not established for eliminating pharmaceuticals and an additional oxidation elimination process is necessary for medical water treatment 13 42 in the context of small clinics medical wastewater containing various pharmaceuticals may be discharged into the municipal sewage system hww is treated by municipal wastewater treatment plants 20 despite the impact of pharmaceuticals in reported studies special caution is needed to explore the ecological risk of dom in un preprocessed medical sewage hospital wastewater is enriched in chno chos and chnos compounds first the potential risk of releasing nitrate or ammonium should be noted nitrogen containing dom provides energy for microbes and nutrients for aquatic plankton and affects microbial activity 43 second it has been reported that hospital wastewater was released into septic tanks without treatment which could lead to groundwater contamination and result in diseases without implementing a strict detoxification process 1 third the unexpected sulfur containing organics generated after degradation may produce either smaller and volatile compounds or sulfides 32 34 this might result in odorous catabolites once the biodegradable compounds are degraded and become precursors of heteroatoms containing volatile compounds finally in some cases hospital wastewater is directly discharged into the sewer system to be co treated with urban wastewater 44 chlorine disinfectant is commonly used 45 there is less risk of disinfection by products dpbs from hww humic substances which are important precursors of dpbs 9 nitrogen containing and peptide like compounds were widely detected in hww by ft icr ms and they may be precursors of n dpbs 46 3 3 2 removal of dom in treated hospital wastewater and challenges our results indicate that medical wastewater could be effectively treated via bio tanks disinfection and reverse osmosis to reduce the environmental impact of the wastewater and the process is applicable in water reuse initiatives similarly the tn has been decreased from 150 0 mg l to 24 2 mg l with remaining 5 9 mg l nh3 nh₄ and 6 1 mg l no3 the removal effects of all the units are summarized in fig 8 the treatment processes promote dom biodegradation of wastewater in bio tanks oxidative degradation of aromatic compounds in the disinfection unit and less selective removal in the reverse osmosis unit the pharmaceutical products were detected in a mww plant with wastewater from a hospital and the immunotoxic potential have been reported 47 carbamazepine gemfibrozil and norfloxacin were detected in mixed domestic wastewaters 47 these pharmaceutical products are fluorescent aromatic components disinfection with uv and potassium monopersulfate is recommended for medical wastewater which is an efficient way to promote the degradation of these fluorescent aromatic compounds however the organic compounds transformed and degraded during the biodegradation and disinfection processes were not thoroughly mineralized to inorganic carbon or particulate organics the concentration of doc remained similar with only 10 removed after processing in both bio tanks and disinfection unit the doc concentration in the influent of ro was 32 mg c l compared to bio tanks and disinfection unit reverse osmosis most effectively concentrated doc which nearly doubled 56 mg l in the concentrated waste compared to the inlet water some formulae were difficult to be removed during the water treatment processes the most abundant formulae that remained after the series of treatment processes are shown in a table table s1 sulfur containing and aliphatic unsaturated components with 3 4 dbe were found to persist in the units these were probably benzene sulfonate surfactants resistant to all the treatment units benzene sulfonate surfactants may cause an inhibition effect during microbial degradation in the anaerobic aerobic tank and result in further ecological risk in the treated effluent the persistent compounds are smaller in size average of m z 297 compared to the dom in the initial step average of m z 346 the remarkable proportion of aliphatic compounds with low polarity and more electro neutrality tends to be permeable this suggests the need for a stricter reverse osmosis process compared to nom enriched in humic like compounds with larger molecular weight similarly it was reported that the molecular composition of dom in the secondary effluent and reclaimed water was dominated by chos formulae in a large scale wastewater treatment plant for municipal wastewater in beijing 48 as chos compounds tend to be readily degraded in the mbr system with an anaerobic aerobic tank a more thorough degradation or optimization of function in the mbr is recommended for persistent benzene sulfonate surfactant like compounds besides it should be noted that the ro retentates might contain concentrated medicals which are easily captured in the membrane or concentrated waters on the one hand the membrane should be carefully cleaned or disposed to avoid the secondary contamination and environmental risk on the other hand the numerous nitrogen containing compounds tend to form positive ions amino amine h and block the ro membrane for example it has been reported that the ro membrane is electronegative and sensitively blocked when neutralized by cationic surfactant 49 4 conclusions we examined the dom in hospital wastewater at the molecular level and evaluated the ecological risk to support better environmental management nearly 3000 compounds were identified in the initial sewage with a dominant protein like peak in eems and low aromaticity index heteroatom containing formulae in hww indicate higher nutrient releasing capacity of organic compounds that could impact aquatic systems the removal of medical dom via the hww treatment plant was further investigated significant degradation of aliphatic compounds was observed after treatment in units of anaerobic aerobic tanks disinfection with uv and potassium monopersulfate is useful in eliminating aromatic and fluorescent compounds but does not impact the major components which were mainly aliphatic or unsaturated compounds reverse osmosis shows only a slight selective effect in the removal of dom with concentrated cram compounds all the samples shared a similar distribution in the aliphatic region in the van krevelen diagram dom in all steps was dominated by less aromatic and smaller formulae compared to ihss nom standards from suwannee river indicating the necessity of a rigorous reverse osmosis process more specifically care should be taken in removing benzene sulfonate surfactant and nitrogen containing highly unsaturated compounds that are smaller in size this study provided important information to the non targeted and high throughput screening of dom from hww effluent and a chemical fingerprint of dom transformation in an actual hww treatment plant at the molecular level knowledge of these characteristics compared to other types of water treatment is indispensable to large scale design prior to the application of technologies for medical wastewater treatment the following are the

12892,this paper aims to scrutinize the comparative performance of hybrid biofilter via column mode to boost the reduction rate of cr vi and organic pollutants in various pre treated tannery wastewater the pre treated water through aluminium formate aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were passed through two divergent biofilter medium discretely with i immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b and ii co immobilized microbial biochar beads co im b m b biosorption efficiency of the hybrid biofilter was examined with respect to ph initial adsorbate concentration time flow rate breakthrough curve and regeneration studies the results exhibited that aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater when passed through im s am b under optimized conditions the reduction rate of cr vi cod and sulphate was 92 5 89 5 and 75 respectively whereas co im b m b surpassed it by 6 7 6 5 and 19 respectively with a contact time of 90 min flow rate 2 ml min depth 30 cm and ph 6 further the raw and treated sample of co im b m b was studied for its morphology and surface chemistry via fe sem edx ftir and xrd analysis the results revealed that cr vi reduction is predominantly through precipitation electrostatic attraction and metal complexation it was observed that electrostatic attraction of cationic charged biochar surface to cr vi ions results in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii and complexation between cr iii further the functional groups present on the microbial biomass dpaml065 surface were also found responsible for cr vi reduction thus co im b m b in hybrid biofilter presents an economical approach in reducing cr vi from tannery wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium formate bacillus sp dpaml065 co immobilized biochar microbial beads hexavalent chromium column study 1 introduction chromium is a significant environmental concern that is predominantly used in tanneries cement industries steel and alloys production photographic material electroplating dyes and pigments 1 3 chromium is scrutinized as one of the top 20 contaminants recorded under the group of lethal substances from the past 15 years 4 primarily chromium exists in the form of cr iii and cr vi hexavalent chromium cr vi is 500 times more lethal than trivalent chromium cr iii due to its mobility and solubility which generally occurs in the form of bichromate hcro4 or dichromate cr2o7 2 5 6 it also affects the digestive tract resulting in the cause of nausea epigastric pain and diarrhoea 7 11 trivalent chromium is not soluble in an aqueous system and shows no toxic effects world health organization who prescribed the discharge limit of cr vi for potable water is 0 05 mg l and for inland surface water is 0 1 mg l 12 thus treatment of cr vi is a matter of concern to the environment to remove chromium in tannery wastewater several researchers documented many conventional treatment methods such as chemical coagulation ion exchange filtration reverse osmosis electrochemical treatment membrane filtration and adsorption technologies 13 15 among these adsorption is a low cost effective simple and favourable process with additional advantages over other treatment processes 16 17 simultaneously biosorption low cost treatment has been used for the removal of chromium from tannery wastewater researchers have delineated the importance of biochar which has a carbon rich solid derived from biomass it has a high degree of porosity and substantial surface area procured from a limited oxygen environment many research studies culminated that biomass can be reshaped into value added biochar for the removal of chromium and other heavy metals in wastewater treatments and act as an emerging and promising treatment technology 18 19 an urgent need to remove the lethal metals through cautious and economical methods leads to a search for substitute materials that can efficiently decrease the heavy metal concentrations to the prescribed levels entrenched by the legislation 1 2 researchers examined that in batch experimental studies different adsorbent and biowaste materials such as eggshell neem sawdust olive pomace etc were successfully used to reduce the pollutants in the environment 20 23 in addition researchers well documented that the utilization of biowaste as biochar is used for the removal of heavy metals through batch kinetic and equilibrium studies however the biosorption potential of biosorbent attained from batch equilibrium studies is applicable in the contribution of fundamental knowledge regarding the potency of metal biosorbent but the data relevant to batch experimental studies is unacceptable to most treatment methods like continuous operations in which the retention period is inadequate to accomplish the equilibrium 24 in the field scale the experimental column studies are put forward for continuous wastewater treatment to reap the benefit and thereby improve the concentration variability of the metal biosorption 25 thus it is important to execute experimental column studies although the drawbacks related to the use of live microbes cause cell death due to cr vi toxicity cell damage lack of nutrient supply and segregation in addition ionically cross linked sodium alginate beads are in sustainable long term stability in physiological conditions which can be diffused due to release of cations into the surrounding media due to interchange reactions with monovalent cations of the treated wastewater in column studies in this context researchers documented the biological treatment system which assists natural processes to degrade the pollutants via microorganisms along with biochar as a filter bed medium 26 27 biofiltration process is popularly used in the domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants biosorption and biotransformation are the two biological methods that attract less energy consumption with no secondary pollutant production the authors delineated that free cells have been extensively used for the microbial reduction of cr vi into non toxic cr iii but result in cell destruction 28 31 but co immobilization of an entire cell has more advantages such as strength proficiency in reusability and uncomplicated separation immobilized cells have propounded advantages such as permeability of the cell wall fast reaction rate due to the escalate mass of the cells increased metabolism of the cells beside it has high operational stability and has better control thus immobilized cells act as an alternative reinforce biocatalyst in environmental applications in biofiltration process heavy metal removal takes place mainly through i adsorption and ii diffusion 32 lazaridis and charalambous 33 reported cr vi removal using composite alginate goethite beads calcium alginate beads were used to remove inorganic contaminants from wastewater 34 konovalova et al 35 pattanapipitpaisal et al 36 camargo et al 30 reported the immobilized bacterial species in bioconversion of cr vi to cr iii hence the objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of a hybrid biofilter treatment system for various coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater with the comparison of two different filter bed mediums for the removal of toxic pollutants organic and inorganic through experimental column studies several factors that influence the biosorption of cr vi such as ph the concentration of cr vi breakthrough curve retention time and flow rate were examined fe sem and edx analyses were carried out to illuminate the morphology and elemental components involved during cr vi reduction ftir analysis supported the functional groups involved in the reduction of cr vi xrd studies were conducted in order to check the nature of the co immobilized biochar microbial beads before and after the biosorption and the components that participated during the exhaustion of chromium ions regeneration and reusability were performed to inspect the stability of the beads pre treatment of tannery wastewater with various coagulants followed by biological treatment using immobilized and co immobilized biochar microbial beads for the complete removal of pollutants were explored thus this approach provides a suitable coagulant for the pre treatment of synthetic tannery wastewater followed by the hybrid biological treatment system to reduce the contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 the tannery wastewater to assess the physicochemical analysis of the real tannery wastewater the samples were fetched from kolkata leather complex which is located in rajar hart west bengal india the treatment plant collects effluents from 500 working tanneries which are involved in chrome and vegetable tanning process basically the treatment plant sticks to four steps mainly i equalization ii settling iii coagulation and iv aerobic activated sludge process tannery wastewater was collected from the equalization tank in a few sample bottles pre washed with 1 n hno3 to see the characteristics represented in table 1 the parameters were evaluated through standard methods reported by the american public health association 37 2 2 chemicals and reagents ferrous ammonium sulphate hexahydrate sodium acetate potassium nitrate and 1 5 diphenylcarbazide were obtained from loba chemie india silver sulphate purified was purchased from central drug house p ltd india aluminium hydroxide was provided by s d fine chem p ltd india and formic acid was obtained from sisco research laboratories p ltd india sodium alginate kaolin humic acid barium sulphate potassium dichromate calcium chloride acetic acid sodium chloride nitric acid barium chloride magnesium chloride hexahydrate ferric chloride acetone ammonium chloride sodium hydroxide ferroin indicator solution and aluminium sulphate were procured from merck india dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate was picked up from fisher scientific india all the reagents were prepared in millipore water 2 3 preparation of synthetic tannery wastewater based on the physicochemical characteristics of real tannery wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared in the lab conditions represented in table 1 according to the method prescribed by faouzi et al 2013 38 to improve the concentration of chromium vi in the wastewater 100 mg l of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added prepared by using potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as a source further the ph of the prepared stock solution was adjusted with 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh besides humic acid was added to boost the organic matter to simulate it as real wastewater turbidity was developed in the wastewater by using kaolin powder the ph of the wastewater was regulated using 0 1 n hno3 and 0 1 n naoh 2 4 preparation of bacillus cereus dpaml065 free biosorbent in this study tannery sludge isolated bacillus sp dpaml065 was segregated from the growth medium by percolation and the deposition was cleansed thrice with millipore water merck germany the microbial biomass was subjected to moderate heat of 40 c for 12 h as a result the heat inactivated microbial biomass was pulverized and used as a control sample bacillus sp dpamlo65 as free biosorbent 39 2 5 preparation of composite biosorbents 2 5 1 immobilization of biosorbent microbial biomass in sodium alginate beads immobilization was carried out with sodium alginate c6h7nao6 as per the method prescribed by arıca et al 2004 40 in which 2 w v of sodium alginate was liquefied in hot millipore water merck germany then the prepared microbial biomass was amalgamated with the sodium alginate solution at 3 3 ratios to achieve complete homogenization the solution was placed on a magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm for 2 h further the suspension was ejected through a syringe dropwise in an earlier cooled 4 c of 0 1 mol l calcium chloride cacl2 the prepared beads were allowed to polymerize for 60 min and segregated from the solution with a buchner funnel then the beads were rinsed thrice with millipore water the beads are named immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b and stored at 4 c in millipore water prior to biosorption 2 5 2 co immobilization of biochar and microbial biomass in sodium alginate beads co immobilization was performed by adding the biochar to sodium alginate solution to reach the endmost concentration of 3 w v the isolated free biomass of bacillus sp dpaml065 was mixed with sodium alginate biochar suspension the same protocol was accompanied by beads formation through the syringe method the co immobilized biosorbent beads with biochar in calcium alginate suspension were named as co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b then the beads were stockpiled at 4 c in millipore water until biosorption 2 6 design of hybrid biofilter treatment system and its preparation tannery wastewater is one of the most complex wastewaters compared to other polluted waters which follows the pre treatment method with various metallic coagulants such as aluminium and iron based salts which pulls out the metal residues in the treated water that is non degradable and also not an eco friendly approach in addition when the pre treated wastewater is passed through a secondary treatment system the residual metal in the treated water retards the biological system due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates in order to overcome these drawbacks a low cost eco friendly packed bed column reactor was fabricated to treat the synthetic tannery wastewater depicted in fig 1 column studies were carried out through a thick plexiglass material with an internal diameter of 6 cm and 60 cm in height represented in fig 1 the biofilter column bed was constructed with three layers of varied materials sand co im b m b im s am b separately and gravel stones column bed materials such as sand and gravel stones were brought from the construction site inside iit ism campus dhanbad biochar was prepared from eggshells collected from a market place in a clean poly bag and carried to the laboratory eggshell debris was pre washed with 0 1 n hcl prepared using millipore water merck germany to get rid of bulk matter and to develop porosity and surface area the shells were heat dried in a hot air oven at 60 c for 2 h and then calcination was carried out at 800 c for 4 h 41 the samples were allowed to cool at room temperature and then blended for uniform particle size the packed bed column experiment was carried out to treat the concentrated synthetic tannery wastewater as well as the pre treated synthetic wastewater with various metallic coagulants to check the efficiency of hybrid biofilter system to assess the performance of hybrid biofilter as well as the best effective coagulant treated water cr vi was considered as a goal parameter during the treatment process optimization studies of hybrid biofilter were carried out with respect to flow rate and contact time along with a varied depth of the filter media 2 7 analytical methods analysis has been carried out for various parameters such as ph conductivity hexavalent chromium cr vi chemical oxygen demand cod sulphate and turbidity as per the method prescribed by apha 37 standard protocols by using the digital turbidity meter electronics india pvt ltd turbidity was measured the ph of the solution was analyzed using a benchtop ph meter hanna instruments germany hexavalent chromium and sulphate so4 2 were measured with uv vis spectrophotometer uv1800 shimadzu japan at 540 nm and 420 nm respectively using quartz cell cod was assessed using a cod digester hi 839800 hanna instruments germany fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was carried out to see the functional groups on the surface of the co im b m b x ray powder diffraction xrd was used to detect the phase identification of raw and treated crystalline material of co im b m b all experiments were conducted in triplicates for reproducibility purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characteristics of real tannery wastewater tannery wastewater samples collected from kolkata leather complex were assessed to prepare synthetic wastewater in the laboratory conditions as per the protocol suggested by faouzi et al 38 the physicochemical characteristics such as ph cod cr vi conductivity sulphate total dissolved solids tds chlorides and turbidity were evaluated in both the real and synthetic tannery wastewater and represented in table 1 3 2 pre treatment of tannery wastewater followed by the hybrid biofilter treatment system tannery industries generate an extensive amount of wastewater during the process of making leather generally tannery industries follow the most conventional pre treatment methods where coagulation plays a key role in which metallic coagulants aluminium sulphate ferric chloride and aluminium formate were used to remove the toxic pollutants among these few coagulants leave their residuals which are non biodegradable in the treated wastewater in our previous studies 42 43 pre treatment has been carried out with metallic coagulants and a simple biochar filtration bed as post treatment for the pre treated wastewater hence secondary treatment is necessary to treat the residuals like sulphates and chlorides in the pre treated water which hinders the biological treatment system to develop a hybrid biofilter treatment system for the removal of residual pollutants in pre treated tannery wastewater a prior experimental set up has been carried out to ensure the feasibility of the hybrid biofilter for the synthetic tannery wastewater 3 3 optimization of hybrid biofilter with respect to ph ph plays a vital role during the biosorption of cr vi optimization of hybrid biofilter with respect to ph was carried out with two types of microbial beads i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads discretely by passing synthetic tannery wastewater with a cr vi concentration of 100 mg l fig 2 a depicts the reduction of cr vi with varied ph i e ph 4 0 10 0 at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min with a depth of 30 cm and time 90 min from fig 2 a it can be seen clearly that as the ph of the solution increases from 4 0 to 6 0 a good reduction rate i e 91 5 of cr vi was achieved with co immobilized biochar microbial beads the reason attributed to the fact that ph dependence of the metal adsorption is predominantly associated to the type and ionic state of the functional groups present on the surface of the biosorbent and metal chemistry in the solution chromium ions co exist in varied forms cr2o7 2 hcro4 cr3o10 2 cr4o13 2 at a ph range from 1 0 to 6 0 of which hcro4 predominates 43 44 hence cr vi reduction was more at acidic ph and thus designates that the increased h ions on the surface of the biochar and microbial biomass remarkably showed strong electrostatic attraction between cationic surface of the biochar microbial beads and chromate ions 44 46 this study was also in good agreement with the other researchers supporting the role of functional groups carboxyl alcoholic or phenolic hydroxyl usually acknowledged as the important groups that come up with coordination between heavy metals and sorbent surface 47 50 unlike co immobilized biochar microbial beads im s am b exhibited 81 of cr vi reduction low biosorption could be due to the presence of oh and cooh in carboxyl groups of guluronate and mannurate residues alone in alginate beads that allow biosorption capacity through chelation and ion exchange mechanisms and as the ph increases anionic hydroxide complex generation decreases which in turn down the degree of metal ions sorption 51 52 3 4 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed and its effect on cr vi reduction synthetic tannery wastewater was passed through the biofilter bed system composed with the foremost layer of sand which has cationic charged particles on their surface thus helps in aggregation of particles and destabilization of flocs during the treatment 53 to ease the cr vi reduction two types of beads i e i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads with varied cr vi concentrations 40 mg l to 120 mg l at a flow rate of 2 ml min for time 90 min at a constant depth of 30 cm were used individually in the biofilter bed to compare the efficiency in reduction of cr vi ions fig 2 b elucidates that at ph 6 0 with low cr vi concentrations both i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads showed 97 8 and 90 8 of cr vi reduction the reason for the increased cr vi reduction at lower concentrations could be the complete utilization of all active sites on the surface of the beads is adequate to conquer the metal ions 54 as cr vi concentration is increased the reduction rate of cr vi was decreased to 91 5 and 81 the possible reason might be due to the presence of high concentrations of cr vi where more ions are competing for the accessible binding sites hence the rate of adsorption was decreased 52 in fig 2 b it can be clearly seen that the reduction efficiency of cr vi is more in co immobilized biochar microbial beads when compared to immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads the possible reason might be due to binding of cationic and anionic metal species to the bacterial cell wall bacillus species dpaml065 as well as the biochar predominates the surface adsorption 52 gravel stone layer is the bottom layer in the biofilter bed to block the outflow of beads compaction and adhesion occur for the effective removal of metal ions when the particle size is smaller than the filter media pore size thereby the pollutants are trapped on the top of the gravel filter and removed successfully 55 3 5 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed system with a varied flow rate flow rate is one of the predominant aspects in evaluating sorbents for continuous treatment of metal effluents in field scale studies optimization of flow rate is carried out with optimized ph and concentration at a constant depth of 30 cm time 90 min with immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads and co immobilized biochar microbial beads discretely by varying the flow rates from 1 0 3 5 ml min to enhance cr vi reduction the pre treated synthetic tannery wastewater with various coagulants such as aluminium formate aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were passed individually through the biofilter bed from fig 3 a and b it distinctly showed that the reduction rate of cr vi was higher at a low flow rate which can be elucidated that at the lower flow rate the retention time of the adsorbate was more for mass transfer and has more binding sites for the metal ions as the flow rate increases the reduction rate of cr vi is decreased the reason might be less retention time of cr vi in the filter bed that is not sufficient to reach the desired flow rate as a result it leaves the bed before interaction occurs 1 2 fig 3 a revealed that at a flow rate of 2 ml min immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads showed only 81 reduction rate of cr vi for raw water whereas for coagulant pre treated wastewater c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 exhibited 92 5 89 2 and 88 respectively the reason could be due to the release of ca2 ions bound to carboxyl groups of the biopolymers via ion exchange mechanism and thereby the reduction efficiency is decreased 4 in fig 3 b co immobilized biochar microbial beads showed 91 5 reduction of cr vi for raw water that might be due to the presence of positively charged functional groups on the surface of the bacteria as well as the slow release of bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions on the biochar surface which enhanced the reduction rate of cr vi via electrostatic attraction 42 but in case of pre treated water showed the maximum cr vi reduction i e 99 2 94 and 93 2 respectively among these aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater showed the best reduction rate that could be due to the presence of formate ions in the pre treated wastewater precipitation of cr vi occurs by the hydrolysis of bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions on the biochar beads as well as the functional groups on the cell surface of the bacteria bacillus sp dpaml065 this results in the electrostatic attraction ion exchange as well as complex formation between the anionic heavy metal ion and the biomass 39 42 56 hence cr vi adsorption takes place reacts with hydroxyl groups in the form of chromium hydroxide 57 60 3 6 optimization of biofilter bed with respect to contact time the effect of contact time is an imperative factor during the biosorption mechanism to optimize the retention time of the hybrid biofilter cr vi was considered as a goal parameter hence optimization was carried out using a co im b m b and b im s am b in the biofilter bed separately with varied contact time from 30 to 180 min having a constant depth of 30 cm and flow rate 2 ml min fig 3 c and d clearly showed that the maximum percentage reduction of cr vi was achieved at a contact time of 90 min with a flow rate of 2 ml min after that the reduction rate was slightly reduced with rise in contact time that might be due to the saturation of the breakthrough curve time of the filter bed where the adsorption zone reached quickly during the treatment process 2 42 in fig 3 d co im b m b showed the reduction rate of cr vi of 99 2 92 4 91 5 and 91 for c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 and raw wastewater respectively at 90 min of contact time the reason for higher reduction of cr vi in case of c3h3alo6 pre treated wastewater was due to the presence of formate ions under acidic conditions oxidation reduction reactions take place with additional functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyls and aromatic ᴫ conjugated systems in the biochar as well as microbial biomass surface which provide electrons to cr 6 due to their strong affinity under acidic conditions 42 52 61 62 thus it indicates that cr vi adsorption mechanism occurred due to the involvement of protons present on the surface of the co im b m b thus electrostatic and chemical interaction occurs in fig 3 c im s am b exhibited cr vi reduction of 92 5 89 5 88 0 and 81 0 respectively for c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 and raw wastewater at 90 min of contact time the reason attributed to the fact that low reduction of cr vi was due to the presence of carboxylic groups obtained from microbial biomass which gets ionized at higher ph and replaced by metal cations as a result the ion exchange mechanism has occurred and the rate of cr vi adsorption on immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads was moderate 4 hence biosorption of cr vi occurs through dissociation of hydrated complexes and interaction of active sites on the surface of the im s am b 63 3 7 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed system with a varied bed height the efficiency of the biofilter medium was compared separately by varying the depth from 10 to 50 cm at an optimized ph 6 0 with a constant flow rate of 2 ml min and time 90 min fig 3 e and f depicts the im s am b and co im b m b efficiency for cr vi removal with varying bed height when the depth is 10 cm the reduction rate of cr vi was low 79 6 and 69 7 for raw wastewater in case of co im b m b and im s am b respectively the reason ascribed to the fact that at low bed depth the axial phenomenon preponderates the mass transfer and lowers the diffusion rate of metal ions 64 further the depth of the bed has been increased from 20 cm to 30 cm then it exhibited 89 6 and 82 3 reduction of cr vi for raw wastewater in case of co im b m b and im s am b respectively the reason for higher reduction rate is due to the longer stay of the influent in the column which provides a large surface area with more active binding sites in the filter bed as a result it allows cr vi ions to hold for a long period in the filter bed column thus the ions are diffused inside the biosorbent 42 65 66 as the depth of the filter bed was increased from 40 cm to 50 cm the reduction of cr vi was increased further to 91 5 and 89 7 respectively for co im b m b and im s am b filter mediums however with the increase in bed depth the corresponding adsorption capacity gets decreased the reason could be due to the reduced slope of the breakthrough curve with a rise in depth of the filter bed stipulating the adsorption capacity of the co im b m b for cr vi and was negatively corresponded with the depth of the hybrid biofilter 65 67 under optimized conditions im s am b revealed that co im b m b surpassed the reduction efficiency of cr vi for raw wastewater when compared with im s am b the reason for lower reduction of cr vi was due to the filter medium in which im s am b have a few functional groups such as carbonyl amino and phosphate groups on the surface of the beads and offers limited active binding sites for cr vi biosorption 65 but in the case of co im b m b biochar and microbial biomass both provide additional functional groups as a result more active binding sites are favourable in adsorption of cr vi ions the maximum reduction rate of cr vi 99 2 with co im b m b and 92 4 with im s am b has achieved for aluminium formate pre treated wastewater the reason for the high reduction was due to the presence of formate ions precipitation occurred in the form of cr oh2 in the pre treated wastewater and the release of carbonate bi carbonate ions and hydroxide ions in the co immobilized biochar microbial beads in the column 42 43 in addition carboxylic carbonyl and amino groups favoured the binding of cr vi to the active sites through biosorption thus precipitation complexation and electrostatic attraction mechanisms occurred 39 but in the case of im s am b ion exchange mechanism was the only mechanism where few functional groups of carboxylic amino and hydroxyl groups are responsible for chromium binding sites 62 3 8 breakthrough curve analysis to verify the effectiveness of the continuous column system the breakthrough curve kinetic studies of column modelling has been carried out with co immobilized biochar microbial beads and immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads for the aluminium formate coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater for this a unified logistic model represented by eq 1 has been used to express three kinetic models viz thomas bohart adams and yoon nelson 68 69 1 ln c o c 1 a bt where a and b parameters have different definitions based on the model its simplistic equation is rewritten as eq 2 in its breakthrough curve form 2 c c o 1 1 exp a bt where a refers to k th q th m q k ba n o l u and k yn τ b equals to k th c o k ba c o and k yn for thomas bohart adams b a and yoon nelson y n models respectively k th ml mg min k ba ml mg min and k yn 1 min 1 are rate constants of thomas b a and y n models respectively q ml min q th mg g and m g represent the volumetric flow rate pollutant loading per unit mass of adsorbents and mass of adsorbents used respectively n o mg l l cm and u cm min refer to saturated concentration depth of the bed and solution velocity calculated from volumetric flow rate respectively finally τ min and c o mg l represent the time for 50 breakthrough and influent concentration respectively for the breakthrough curve analysis the concentration of cr vi is 20 mg l at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min with a fixed bed depth of 30 cm the calculated kinetic coefficients are shown in table 2 and the obtained curves are shown in fig 4 the logistic equation used to derive values of a and b parameters has a correlation coefficient 0 9 hence the kinetics parameters were well fitted with the simplistic model for both the mediums thus it can be effectively used for the continuous system as shown in fig 4 the breakthrough point was attained at 90 min for aluminium formate pre treated tannery wastewater thus it can be concluded that at low inlet concentrations a slower breakthrough curve and high treated volume are acquired for aluminium formate pre treated tannery wastewater the possible reason for slow transport of chromium ions onto the co immobilized biochar microbial beads was due to the lower concentration gradient which resulted in the slow breakthrough curve at the same time the saturation of the accessible binding sites of chromium ions has decreased the breakthrough time this happened when the decrease in contact time among the metal ions and the adsorbent does not allow the complete saturation of the ions on the active binding sites and thus led to a reduction in the amount of cr vi ions adsorbed 70 but in case of immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads the breakthrough curve was faster and the performance of the media was not efficient as co immobilized biochar microbial beads the reason for lower adsorption could be due to the saturation in a short time leads to less breakthrough time where the amount of adsorbent accessible for the sorption of metal ions 14 3 9 effect of hybrid biofilter in the removal of cod fig 5 a and b depicts the individual removal of cod with co im b m b and im s am b in the hybrid biofilter during the treatment of tannery wastewater to scrutinize the cod removal raw and various pre treated tannery wastewater is passed through the biofilter bed under optimum conditions fig 5 b revealed that with a contact time of 90 min co im b m b showed a higher removal rate of cod i e 96 with aluminium formate pre treated wastewater while others showed 70 80 and 82 respectively the reason for the higher removal rate of cod with co im b m b was the co precipitation of the organic matter and the other chemical compounds accountable for cod with the colloidal chromium hydroxide ions on the surface of the biochar microbial biomass as the time increases the removal rate of cod was decreased the decrease in cod removal could be due to the charge reversal on the surface of the co im b m b further the same was repeated with im s am b in the hybrid biofilter for the removal of cod hence it showed 89 5 80 78 and 63 removal the lower reduction rate of cod with sodium alginate microbial beads in the hybrid biofilter is attributed to mono and polynuclear species on the surface of the biosorbent 43 3 10 effect of hybrid biofilter in the removal of sulphate excessive accumulation of sulphate in water causes corrosion scaling of the equipment and affecting the environment 71 fig 5 c and d represents the discrete reduction rate of sulphate with im s am b and co im b m b in the hybrid biofilter throughout the treatment of tannery wastewater under optimum conditions sulphate reduction was examined with various pre treated and raw tannery wastewater by passing through the hybrid biofilter bed fig 5 d depicts the co im b m b in hybrid biofilter exhibited 94 81 80 and 70 reduction of sulphate with aluminium formate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate and raw tannery wastewater respectively the higher reduction rate of sulphate was observed with aluminium formate pre treated wastewater the possible reason might be due to the presence of residual aluminium ions in the pre treated water which binds the counter anion sulphate and has the capacity to produce hydroxide precipitates besides the biochar present in the co im b m b composed of calcium also binds with sulphate present in tannery wastewater thereby the reduction of sulphate is occurred 43 in fig 5 c im s am b showed the sulphate reduction rate of 75 70 68 and 63 for aluminium formate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate and raw tannery wastewater respectively the reason for low sulphate reduction could be due to the anionic charge which prevents the adsorption of sulphate on the surface of the im s am b thereby the ph of the wastewater increases and solubility of sulphate is decreased remarkably in the tannery wastewater 72 74 3 11 regeneration and reusability of hybrid biofilter column regeneration of the biosorbent is indispensable to make the wastewater treatment more economical in terms of cost 65 fig 6 depicts the regeneration cycle experimental studies with i co im b m b and ii im s am b and carried out individually with an optimized time 90 min at a depth of 30 cm along with the cr vi concentration of 100 mg l the filter bed was regenerated with 0 4 m sodium hydroxide solvent naoh the exhausted hybrid biofilter column bed with different filter media were pre washed with 0 4 m naoh by passing it in an upward direction at optimized conditions with a flow rate of 2 ml min from fig 6 it can be observed that when the bed is treated with 0 4 m naoh co im b m b exhibited 89 5 while im s am b showed 73 in the first regeneration cycle the reason for high removal in co im b m b is due to the precipitation mechanism i e at alkaline conditions cr vi is reduced by oh ions present on the biochar microbial beads 58 75 further in the second and third cycle cr vi reduction rate was moderately reduced to 80 and 60 respectively the lower reduction rate of cr vi with im s am b was due to the presence of electrostatic repulsion of the same ion charge in the filter during the experimental studies the regeneration efficiency of cr vi uptake in the hybrid biofilter bed was gradually decreased in the third cycle with a reduction rate of 72 and 60 respectively the reason attributed to the fact that expeditious decrease in absorption was due to the irreversibly left chromium ions bound to the biomass results in deficient desorption as well as the reduced microporosity and deficiency of the functional groups in the filtration bed 42 76 77 however the regeneration study implied that co im b m b exhibited the best performance in the first three cycles with a good reduction rate of cr vi as compared to im s am b hybrid biofilter experimental studies revealed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b exhibited good removal of pollutants from the raw and various coagulant pre treated tannery wastewaters when compared to immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b as per our previous studies deepa et al 2018 43 and arukula et al 2019 42 the coagulation and filtration studies were carried out with aluminium formate coagulant and eggshell biochar for the treatment of tannery wastewater where nearly 80 90 of cr vi removal was observed during the pre treatment and post treatment but no complete removal of the pollutants was observed when compared to these treatments the hybrid biofilter treatment showed complete removal of pollutants compared to other treatment methods with high and feasible regeneration capacity thus the regeneration study with 0 4 m naoh is considerably low cost and effective solution to regenerate the column using co im b m b further the characterization studies were carried out for the raw and treated wastewater of co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b in order to know about the detailed mechanism and functional groups involved in the reduction of chromium ions during the hybrid biofilter treatment process 3 12 characterization of co immobilized biochar microbial beads the foremost elemental compositions of the biochar used during co immobilization of microbial biochar beads were examined through the chns o analyzer to see the amount of carbon and hydrogen present in the biochar sample as its characteristics then composition of biochar proximate analysis on wet basis with a fixed carbon 0 0328 moisture 0 0214 ash 0 0464 and elemental analysis dry basis carbon 9 2980 hydrogen 0 1689 respectively the morphological characteristics of the co immobilization of microbial biochar beads raw and treated were scrutinized through fe sem and edx analyzer ftir analysis was carried out to know the speciation of the functional groups crystalline structure crystalline phase and its chemical composition studies were carried out with xrd analysis 3 13 fe sem and edx analysis fig 7 represents the morphological structure and surface characterization of both raw and treated samples of co immobilized biochar microbial beads analyzed through fe sem in fig 7 a it was observed that untreated co immobilized biochar microbial beads were covered with the slime layer of the microbial growth bacillus species dpaml065 in a thick denser mode and showed a rough irregular cracked appearance with the existence of some crystal compounds which permit to reciprocate the substances and enhances the adsorption mechanism but fig 7 d revealed that the microstructural analysis showed some significant changes in co immobilized biochar microbial beads the morphological studies revealed that the slime layer was slightly reduced to the dense and compact matrix by decreasing the robustness of beads which might be due to the biosorption phenomenon of the pollutants during the treatment process energy dispersive x ray analysis edx was carried out to see the quantification of elements in both treated and untreated samples as shown in fig 7 b and e respectively the quantification of the elements in both raw and treated samples is given in table 3 which mainly consists of carbon oxygen calcium silicon magnesium sulfur etc designate the appearance of certain elements entangled in the chemical composition of the synthetic tannery wastewater during the adsorption 78 3 14 ftir analysis the surface functional groups of raw and treated co immobilized biochar microbial beads were analyzed by ftir analysis and depicted in fig 8 their group frequency wavenumber cm 1 is represented in table 4 the peak at 3570 58 cm 1 in raw sample denotes oh group but in the treated sample the band shifted to 3496 26 cm 1 and

reduces the chromium ions 80 the peak 2678 03 cm 1 and 2361 48 cm 1 represents co of carbonyl acid groups with strong stretching vibrations the band 2505 30 cm 1 2344 27 cm 1 2338 08 cm 1 and 2078 64 cm 1 corresponds to the aromatic combination bands cc and co in aromatic rings of conjugated ketones that participated in the exhaustion of chromium ions 81 the peak 2119 24 cm 1 denotes reactive carbonyl group but in co im b m b the peak at 1790 99 cm 1 denotes metal carbonyl compounds and the peak 1796 50 cm 1 and 1601 66 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of co may affect the ᴫ ᴫ interactions which control the adsorption when the biosorbent interface with the surface of carbonyl and alkene groups of the biosorbent 82 the band at 1560 46 cm 1 and 1554 95 cm 1 attributed to aromatic compounds cc with stretching vibrations of ketones and quinines the peak at 1439 34 cm 1 designates the presence of methylene group with ch bending but in the treated sample the band raised and appeared at 1445 93 cm 1 indicating long chain linear aliphatic structure which results in crystallinity and a high degree of regularity for the linear backbone structure the peak at 1191 60 cm 1 depicts the cn amine group 42 the band at 1105 58 cm 1 in co im b m b was assigned to the hydroxyl group of co carboxyl in raw peak at 1111 08 cm 1 signifies cn stretching vibrations the peak at 1082 18 cm 1 in co im b m b typify aromatic phosphates poc with stretching vibrations the band at 944 55 cm 1 symbolizes ch out of plane bending with broad peak with a medium absorption in co im b m b band has been shifted to 892 25 cm 1 represents cch2 with a plane bend the peaks at 898 44 cm 1 771 13 cm 1 714 01 cm 1 and 707 820 cm 1 designate skeletal cc vibrations and alkyl halide group of ccl the results are in good agreement with the data reported by 39 42 83 thus carbonyl carboxyl ligands amino and hydroxyl groups provide the major biosorption sites for chromium ions binding 84 3 15 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction studies xrd has been carried out with anhydrous cr vi treated and non treated cr vi pellets and were examined with bruker model kappa apex ii fig 9 depicts the xrd analysis of a raw b treated co immobilized biochar microbial beads in which it had shown the crystalline phase of calcite before the treatment having the compounds with a remarkable peak around of 20 2ө 24 8 29 4 34 9 have been observed through the peak s information from jcpds file hence let out the presence of calcium oxide which is a well know calcite compound 85 additionally there are several other peaks at 31 8 45 4 47 8 attribute the presence of polysaccharides that might be due to the presence of functional groups on the surface of the in co im b m b in the treated sample the amorphous nature of the compounds with small peaks after the treatment of co im b m b has been observed hence it showed some low intensity at 27 52 66 5 peaks revealed the presence of chromium ions indicating that during the treatment of the synthetic wastewater co im b m b participated in the exhaustion of chromium ions in addition some low intensity peaks were observed at 30 21 and 49 5 which revealed the presence of some polysaccharides and sodium salts further it clearly stated that co im b m b participated in the reduction of chromium ions during the treatment process 4 conclusion in this study the performance of a hybrid biofilter treatment system was evaluated in terms of cr vi reduction from various pre treated coagulation carried out through different metallic coagulants tannery wastewater cr vi reduction efficiency and the organic pollutants such as cod and sulphate removal were compared with distinct filter media such as co immobilized biochar microbial beads and immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads individually in the hybrid biofilter treatment the study confirmed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads enhanced the cr vi reduction cod and sulphate with 99 2 96 and 94 respectively through precipitation electrostatic attraction surface complexation when the coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater aluminium formate is passed through the biofilter bed ftir analysis of co im b m b disclosed that the presence of carboxylic hydroxylic and carbonyl groups are engaged in the reduction of cr vi ions xrd results revealed some polysaccharide peaks which were also involved during the exhaustion of chromium ions the study illustrated that aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater exhibited robust effects when it comes to contact with the co im b m b resulting in alkaline condition thereby enhancing the reduction rate of cr vi was observed this study showed that 99 2 of cr vi was reduced through precipitation and complexation mechanisms during the biological treatment organic coagulant aluminium formate having formate has more predominance over sulphate and chloride coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater because it is unbound to corrosive free and non lethal regeneration and reusability studies confirmed that co im b m b could be reused by using 0 4 m naoh up to three cycles in addition this study also concluded that aluminium formate organic coagulant could increase the biosorption competence of the hybrid biofilter with the addition of carbon source which acts as a nutrient in the biological treatment further this study suggests that pre treatment of tannery wastewater with aluminium formate coagulant accompanied by hybrid biofilter having co immobilized biochar microbial beads as a filter medium could be the most appropriate method for the reduction of cr vi and other organic pollutants from tannery wastewater besides this study showed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads used in this experiment were environmentally friendly and feasible as well as irreplaceable for the biosorption of cr vi declaration of competing interest authors have no conflicts of interest acknowledgement the

resource development mhrd government of india new delhi to carry out this research work 
12892,this paper aims to scrutinize the comparative performance of hybrid biofilter via column mode to boost the reduction rate of cr vi and organic pollutants in various pre treated tannery wastewater the pre treated water through aluminium formate aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were passed through two divergent biofilter medium discretely with i immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b and ii co immobilized microbial biochar beads co im b m b biosorption efficiency of the hybrid biofilter was examined with respect to ph initial adsorbate concentration time flow rate breakthrough curve and regeneration studies the results exhibited that aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater when passed through im s am b under optimized conditions the reduction rate of cr vi cod and sulphate was 92 5 89 5 and 75 respectively whereas co im b m b surpassed it by 6 7 6 5 and 19 respectively with a contact time of 90 min flow rate 2 ml min depth 30 cm and ph 6 further the raw and treated sample of co im b m b was studied for its morphology and surface chemistry via fe sem edx ftir and xrd analysis the results revealed that cr vi reduction is predominantly through precipitation electrostatic attraction and metal complexation it was observed that electrostatic attraction of cationic charged biochar surface to cr vi ions results in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii and complexation between cr iii further the functional groups present on the microbial biomass dpaml065 surface were also found responsible for cr vi reduction thus co im b m b in hybrid biofilter presents an economical approach in reducing cr vi from tannery wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium formate bacillus sp dpaml065 co immobilized biochar microbial beads hexavalent chromium column study 1 introduction chromium is a significant environmental concern that is predominantly used in tanneries cement industries steel and alloys production photographic material electroplating dyes and pigments 1 3 chromium is scrutinized as one of the top 20 contaminants recorded under the group of lethal substances from the past 15 years 4 primarily chromium exists in the form of cr iii and cr vi hexavalent chromium cr vi is 500 times more lethal than trivalent chromium cr iii due to its mobility and solubility which generally occurs in the form of bichromate hcro4 or dichromate cr2o7 2 5 6 it also affects the digestive tract resulting in the cause of nausea epigastric pain and diarrhoea 7 11 trivalent chromium is not soluble in an aqueous system and shows no toxic effects world health organization who prescribed the discharge limit of cr vi for potable water is 0 05 mg l and for inland surface water is 0 1 mg l 12 thus treatment of cr vi is a matter of concern to the environment to remove chromium in tannery wastewater several researchers documented many conventional treatment methods such as chemical coagulation ion exchange filtration reverse osmosis electrochemical treatment membrane filtration and adsorption technologies 13 15 among these adsorption is a low cost effective simple and favourable process with additional advantages over other treatment processes 16 17 simultaneously biosorption low cost treatment has been used for the removal of chromium from tannery wastewater researchers have delineated the importance of biochar which has a carbon rich solid derived from biomass it has a high degree of porosity and substantial surface area procured from a limited oxygen environment many research studies culminated that biomass can be reshaped into value added biochar for the removal of chromium and other heavy metals in wastewater treatments and act as an emerging and promising treatment technology 18 19 an urgent need to remove the lethal metals through cautious and economical methods leads to a search for substitute materials that can efficiently decrease the heavy metal concentrations to the prescribed levels entrenched by the legislation 1 2 researchers examined that in batch experimental studies different adsorbent and biowaste materials such as eggshell neem sawdust olive pomace etc were successfully used to reduce the pollutants in the environment 20 23 in addition researchers well documented that the utilization of biowaste as biochar is used for the removal of heavy metals through batch kinetic and equilibrium studies however the biosorption potential of biosorbent attained from batch equilibrium studies is applicable in the contribution of fundamental knowledge regarding the potency of metal biosorbent but the data relevant to batch experimental studies is unacceptable to most treatment methods like continuous operations in which the retention period is inadequate to accomplish the equilibrium 24 in the field scale the experimental column studies are put forward for continuous wastewater treatment to reap the benefit and thereby improve the concentration variability of the metal biosorption 25 thus it is important to execute experimental column studies although the drawbacks related to the use of live microbes cause cell death due to cr vi toxicity cell damage lack of nutrient supply and segregation in addition ionically cross linked sodium alginate beads are in sustainable long term stability in physiological conditions which can be diffused due to release of cations into the surrounding media due to interchange reactions with monovalent cations of the treated wastewater in column studies in this context researchers documented the biological treatment system which assists natural processes to degrade the pollutants via microorganisms along with biochar as a filter bed medium 26 27 biofiltration process is popularly used in the domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants biosorption and biotransformation are the two biological methods that attract less energy consumption with no secondary pollutant production the authors delineated that free cells have been extensively used for the microbial reduction of cr vi into non toxic cr iii but result in cell destruction 28 31 but co immobilization of an entire cell has more advantages such as strength proficiency in reusability and uncomplicated separation immobilized cells have propounded advantages such as permeability of the cell wall fast reaction rate due to the escalate mass of the cells increased metabolism of the cells beside it has high operational stability and has better control thus immobilized cells act as an alternative reinforce biocatalyst in environmental applications in biofiltration process heavy metal removal takes place mainly through i adsorption and ii diffusion 32 lazaridis and charalambous 33 reported cr vi removal using composite alginate goethite beads calcium alginate beads were used to remove inorganic contaminants from wastewater 34 konovalova et al 35 pattanapipitpaisal et al 36 camargo et al 30 reported the immobilized bacterial species in bioconversion of cr vi to cr iii hence the objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of a hybrid biofilter treatment system for various coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater with the comparison of two different filter bed mediums for the removal of toxic pollutants organic and inorganic through experimental column studies several factors that influence the biosorption of cr vi such as ph the concentration of cr vi breakthrough curve retention time and flow rate were examined fe sem and edx analyses were carried out to illuminate the morphology and elemental components involved during cr vi reduction ftir analysis supported the functional groups involved in the reduction of cr vi xrd studies were conducted in order to check the nature of the co immobilized biochar microbial beads before and after the biosorption and the components that participated during the exhaustion of chromium ions regeneration and reusability were performed to inspect the stability of the beads pre treatment of tannery wastewater with various coagulants followed by biological treatment using immobilized and co immobilized biochar microbial beads for the complete removal of pollutants were explored thus this approach provides a suitable coagulant for the pre treatment of synthetic tannery wastewater followed by the hybrid biological treatment system to reduce the contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 the tannery wastewater to assess the physicochemical analysis of the real tannery wastewater the samples were fetched from kolkata leather complex which is located in rajar hart west bengal india the treatment plant collects effluents from 500 working tanneries which are involved in chrome and vegetable tanning process basically the treatment plant sticks to four steps mainly i equalization ii settling iii coagulation and iv aerobic activated sludge process tannery wastewater was collected from the equalization tank in a few sample bottles pre washed with 1 n hno3 to see the characteristics represented in table 1 the parameters were evaluated through standard methods reported by the american public health association 37 2 2 chemicals and reagents ferrous ammonium sulphate hexahydrate sodium acetate potassium nitrate and 1 5 diphenylcarbazide were obtained from loba chemie india silver

india all the reagents were prepared in millipore water 2 3 preparation of synthetic tannery wastewater based on the physicochemical characteristics of real tannery wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared in the lab conditions represented in table 1 according to the method prescribed by faouzi et al 2013 38 to improve the concentration of chromium vi in the wastewater 100 mg l of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added prepared by using potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as a source further the ph of the prepared stock solution was adjusted with 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh besides humic acid was added to boost the organic matter to simulate it as real wastewater turbidity was developed in the wastewater by using kaolin powder the ph of the wastewater was regulated using 0 1 n hno3 and 0 1 n naoh 2 4 preparation of bacillus cereus dpaml065 free biosorbent in this study tannery sludge isolated bacillus sp dpaml065 was segregated from the growth medium by percolation and the deposition was cleansed thrice with millipore water merck germany the microbial biomass was subjected to moderate heat of 40 c for 12 h as a result the heat inactivated microbial biomass was pulverized and used as a control sample bacillus sp dpamlo65 as free biosorbent 39 2 5 preparation of composite biosorbents 2 5 1 immobilization of biosorbent microbial biomass in sodium alginate beads immobilization was carried out with sodium alginate c6h7nao6 as per the method prescribed by arıca et al 2004 40 in which 2 w v of sodium alginate was liquefied in hot millipore water merck germany then the prepared microbial biomass was amalgamated with the sodium alginate solution at 3 3 ratios to achieve complete homogenization the solution was placed on a magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm for 2 h further the suspension was ejected through a syringe dropwise in an earlier cooled 4 c of 0 1 mol l calcium chloride cacl2 the prepared beads were allowed to polymerize for 60 min and segregated from the solution with a buchner funnel then the beads were rinsed thrice with millipore water the beads are named immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b and stored at 4 c in millipore water prior to biosorption 2 5 2 co immobilization of biochar and microbial biomass in sodium alginate beads co immobilization was performed by adding the biochar to sodium alginate solution to reach the endmost concentration of 3 w v the isolated free biomass of bacillus sp dpaml065 was mixed with sodium alginate biochar suspension the same protocol was accompanied by beads formation through the syringe method the co immobilized biosorbent beads with biochar in calcium alginate suspension were named as co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b then the beads were stockpiled at 4 c in millipore water until biosorption 2 6 design of hybrid biofilter treatment system and its preparation tannery wastewater is one of the most complex wastewaters compared to other polluted waters which follows the pre treatment method with various metallic coagulants such as aluminium and iron based salts which pulls out the metal residues in the treated water that is non degradable and also not an eco friendly approach in addition when the pre treated wastewater is passed through a secondary treatment system the residual metal in the treated water retards the biological system due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates in order to overcome these drawbacks a low cost eco friendly packed bed column reactor was fabricated to treat the synthetic tannery wastewater depicted in fig 1 column studies were carried out through a thick plexiglass material with an internal diameter of 6 cm and 60 cm in height represented in fig 1 the biofilter column bed was constructed with three layers of varied materials sand co im b m b im s am b separately and gravel stones column bed materials such as sand and gravel stones were brought from the construction site inside iit ism campus dhanbad biochar was prepared from eggshells collected from a market place in a clean poly bag and carried to the laboratory eggshell debris was pre washed with 0 1 n hcl prepared using millipore water merck germany to get rid of bulk matter and to develop porosity and surface area the shells were heat dried in a hot air oven at 60 c for 2 h and then calcination was carried out at 800 c for 4 h 41 the samples were allowed to cool at room temperature and then blended for uniform particle size the packed bed column experiment was carried out to treat the concentrated synthetic tannery wastewater as well as the pre treated synthetic wastewater with various metallic coagulants to check the efficiency of hybrid biofilter system to assess the performance of hybrid biofilter as well as the best effective coagulant treated water cr vi was considered as a goal parameter during the treatment process optimization studies of hybrid biofilter were carried out with respect to flow rate and contact time along with a varied depth of the filter media 2 7 analytical methods analysis has been carried out for various parameters such as ph conductivity hexavalent chromium cr vi chemical oxygen demand cod sulphate and turbidity as per the method prescribed by apha 37 standard protocols by using the digital turbidity meter electronics india pvt ltd turbidity was measured the ph of the solution was analyzed using a benchtop ph meter hanna instruments germany hexavalent chromium and sulphate so4 2 were measured with uv vis spectrophotometer uv1800 shimadzu japan at 540 nm and 420 nm respectively

the co im b m b x ray powder diffraction xrd was used to detect the phase identification of raw and treated crystalline material of co im b m b all experiments were conducted in triplicates for reproducibility purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characteristics of real tannery wastewater tannery wastewater samples collected from kolkata leather complex were assessed to prepare synthetic wastewater in the laboratory conditions as per the protocol suggested by faouzi et al 38 the physicochemical characteristics such as ph cod cr vi conductivity sulphate total dissolved solids tds chlorides and turbidity were evaluated in both the real and synthetic tannery wastewater and represented in table 1 3 2 pre treatment of tannery wastewater followed by the hybrid biofilter treatment system tannery industries generate an extensive amount of wastewater during the process of making leather generally tannery industries follow the most conventional pre treatment methods where coagulation plays a key role in which metallic coagulants aluminium sulphate ferric chloride and aluminium formate were used to remove the toxic pollutants among these few coagulants leave their residuals which are non biodegradable in the treated wastewater in our previous studies 42 43 pre treatment has been carried out with metallic coagulants and a simple biochar filtration bed as post treatment for the pre treated wastewater hence secondary treatment is necessary to treat the residuals like sulphates and chlorides in the pre treated water which hinders the biological treatment system to develop a hybrid biofilter treatment system for the removal of residual pollutants in pre treated tannery wastewater a prior experimental set up has been carried out to ensure the feasibility of the hybrid biofilter for the synthetic tannery wastewater 3 3 optimization of hybrid biofilter with respect to ph ph plays a vital role during the biosorption of cr vi optimization of hybrid biofilter with respect to ph was carried out with two types of microbial beads i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads discretely by passing synthetic tannery wastewater with a cr vi concentration of 100 mg l fig 2 a depicts the reduction of cr vi with varied ph i e ph 4 0 10 0 at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min with a depth of 30 cm and time 90 min from fig 2 a it can be seen clearly that as the ph of the solution increases from 4 0 to 6 0 a good reduction rate i e 91 5 of cr vi was achieved with co immobilized biochar microbial beads the reason attributed to the fact that ph dependence of the metal adsorption is predominantly associated to the type and ionic state of the functional groups present on the surface of the biosorbent and metal chemistry in the solution chromium ions co exist in varied forms cr2o7 2 hcro4 cr3o10 2 cr4o13 2 at a ph range from 1 0 to 6 0 of which hcro4 predominates 43 44 hence cr vi reduction was more at acidic ph and thus designates that the increased h ions on the surface of the biochar and microbial biomass remarkably showed strong electrostatic attraction between cationic surface of the biochar microbial beads and chromate ions 44 46 this study was also in good agreement with the other researchers supporting the role of functional groups carboxyl alcoholic or phenolic hydroxyl usually acknowledged as the important groups that come up with coordination between heavy metals and sorbent surface 47 50 unlike co immobilized biochar microbial beads im s am b exhibited 81 of cr vi reduction low biosorption could be due to the presence of oh and cooh in carboxyl groups of guluronate and mannurate residues alone in alginate beads that allow biosorption capacity through chelation and ion exchange mechanisms and as the ph increases anionic hydroxide complex generation decreases which in turn down the degree of metal ions sorption 51 52 3 4 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed and its effect on cr vi reduction synthetic tannery wastewater was passed through the biofilter bed system composed with the foremost layer of sand which has cationic charged particles on their surface thus helps in aggregation of particles and destabilization of flocs during the treatment 53 to ease the cr vi reduction two types of beads i e i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads with varied cr vi concentrations 40 mg l to 120 mg l at a flow rate of 2 ml min for time 90 min at a constant depth of 30 cm were used individually in the biofilter bed to compare the efficiency in reduction of cr vi ions fig 2 b elucidates that at ph 6 0 with low cr vi concentrations both i co immobilized biochar microbial beads and ii immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads showed 97 8 and 90 8 of cr vi reduction the reason for the increased cr vi reduction at lower concentrations could be the complete utilization of all active sites on the surface of the beads is adequate to conquer the metal ions 54 as cr vi concentration is increased the reduction rate of cr vi was decreased to 91 5 and 81 the possible reason might be due to the presence of high concentrations of cr vi where more ions are competing for the accessible binding sites hence the rate of adsorption was decreased 52 in fig 2 b it can be clearly seen that the reduction efficiency of cr vi is more in co immobilized biochar microbial beads when compared to immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads the possible reason might be due to binding of cationic and anionic metal species to the bacterial cell wall bacillus species dpaml065 as well as the biochar predominates the surface adsorption 52 gravel stone layer is the bottom layer in the biofilter bed to block the outflow of beads compaction and adhesion occur for the effective removal of metal ions when the particle size is smaller than the filter media pore size thereby the pollutants are trapped on the top of the gravel filter and removed successfully 55 3 5 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed system with a varied flow rate flow rate is one of the predominant aspects in evaluating sorbents for continuous treatment of metal effluents in field scale studies optimization of flow rate is carried out with optimized ph and concentration at a constant depth of 30 cm time 90 min with immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads and co immobilized biochar microbial beads discretely by varying the flow rates from 1 0 3 5 ml min to enhance cr vi reduction the pre treated synthetic tannery wastewater with various coagulants such as aluminium formate aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were passed individually through the biofilter bed from fig 3 a and b it distinctly showed that the reduction rate of cr vi was higher at a low flow rate which can be elucidated that at the lower flow rate the retention time of the adsorbate was more for mass transfer and has more binding sites for the metal ions as the flow rate increases the reduction rate of cr vi is decreased the reason might be less retention time of cr vi in the filter bed that is not sufficient to reach the desired flow rate as a result it leaves the bed before interaction occurs 1 2 fig 3 a revealed that at a flow rate of 2 ml min immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads showed only 81 reduction rate of cr vi for raw water whereas for coagulant pre treated wastewater c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 exhibited 92 5 89 2 and 88 respectively the reason could be due to the release of ca2 ions bound to carboxyl groups of the biopolymers via ion exchange mechanism and thereby the reduction efficiency is decreased 4 in fig 3 b co immobilized biochar microbial beads showed 91 5 reduction of cr vi for raw water that might be due to the presence of positively charged functional groups on the surface of the bacteria as well as the slow release of bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions on the biochar surface which enhanced the reduction rate of cr vi via electrostatic attraction 42 but in case of pre treated water showed the maximum cr vi reduction i e 99 2 94 and 93 2 respectively among these aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater showed the best reduction rate that could be due to the presence of formate ions in the pre treated wastewater precipitation of cr vi occurs by the hydrolysis of bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions on the biochar beads as well as the functional groups on the cell surface of the bacteria bacillus sp dpaml065 this results in the electrostatic attraction ion exchange as well as complex formation between the anionic heavy metal ion and the biomass 39 42 56 hence cr vi adsorption takes place reacts with hydroxyl groups in the form of chromium hydroxide 57 60 3 6 optimization of biofilter bed with respect to contact time the effect of contact time is an imperative factor during the biosorption mechanism to optimize the retention time of the hybrid biofilter cr vi was considered as a goal parameter hence optimization was carried out using a co im b m b and b im s am b in the biofilter bed separately with varied contact time from 30 to 180 min having a constant depth of 30 cm and flow rate 2 ml min fig 3 c and d clearly showed that the maximum percentage reduction of cr vi was achieved at a contact time of 90 min with a flow rate of 2 ml min after that the reduction rate was slightly reduced with rise in contact time that might be due to the saturation of the breakthrough curve time of the filter bed where the adsorption zone reached quickly during the treatment process 2 42 in fig 3 d co im b m b showed the reduction rate of cr vi of 99 2 92 4 91 5 and 91 for c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 and raw wastewater respectively at 90 min of contact time the reason for higher reduction of cr vi in case of c3h3alo6 pre treated wastewater was due to the presence of formate ions under acidic conditions oxidation reduction reactions take place with additional functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyls and aromatic ᴫ conjugated systems in the biochar as well as microbial biomass surface which provide electrons to cr 6 due to their strong affinity under acidic conditions 42 52 61 62 thus it indicates that cr vi adsorption mechanism occurred due to the involvement of protons present on the surface of the co im b m b thus electrostatic and chemical interaction occurs in fig 3 c im s am b exhibited cr vi reduction of 92 5 89 5 88 0 and 81 0 respectively for c3h3alo6 al2o so4 3 fecl3 and raw wastewater at 90 min of contact time the reason attributed to the fact that low reduction of cr vi was due to the presence of carboxylic groups obtained from microbial biomass which gets ionized at higher ph and replaced by metal cations as a result the ion exchange mechanism has occurred and the rate of cr vi adsorption on immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads was moderate 4 hence biosorption of cr vi occurs through dissociation of hydrated complexes and interaction of active sites on the surface of the im s am b 63 3 7 optimization of hybrid biofilter bed system with a varied bed height the efficiency of the biofilter medium was compared separately by varying the depth from 10 to 50 cm at an optimized ph 6 0 with a constant flow rate of 2 ml min and time 90 min fig 3 e and f depicts the im s am b and co im b m b efficiency for cr vi removal with varying bed height when the depth is 10 cm the reduction rate of cr vi was low 79 6 and 69 7 for raw wastewater in case of co im b m b and im s am b respectively the reason ascribed to the fact that at low bed depth the axial phenomenon preponderates the mass transfer and lowers the diffusion rate of metal ions 64 further the depth of the bed has been increased from 20 cm to 30 cm then it exhibited 89 6 and 82 3 reduction of cr vi for raw wastewater in case of co im b m b and im s am b respectively the reason for higher reduction rate is due to the longer stay of the influent in the column which provides a large surface area with more active binding sites in the filter bed as a result it allows cr vi ions to hold for a long period in the filter bed column thus the ions are diffused inside the biosorbent 42 65 66 as the depth of the filter bed was increased from 40 cm to 50 cm the reduction of cr vi was increased further to 91 5 and 89 7 respectively for co im b m b and im s am b filter mediums however with the increase in bed depth the corresponding adsorption capacity gets decreased the reason could be due to the reduced slope of the breakthrough curve with a rise in depth of the filter bed stipulating the adsorption capacity of the co im b m b for cr vi and was negatively corresponded with the depth of the hybrid biofilter 65 67 under optimized conditions im s am b revealed that co im b m b surpassed the reduction efficiency of cr vi for raw wastewater when compared with im s am b the reason for lower reduction of cr vi was due to the filter medium in which im s am b have a few functional groups such as carbonyl amino and phosphate groups on the surface of the beads and offers limited active binding sites for cr vi biosorption 65 but in the case of co im b m b biochar and microbial biomass both provide additional functional groups as a result more active binding sites are favourable in adsorption of cr vi ions the maximum reduction rate of cr vi 99 2 with co im b m b and 92 4 with im s am b has achieved for aluminium formate pre treated wastewater the reason for the high reduction was due to the presence of formate ions precipitation occurred in the form of cr oh2 in the pre treated wastewater and the release of carbonate bi carbonate ions and hydroxide ions in the co immobilized biochar microbial beads in the column 42 43 in addition carboxylic carbonyl and amino groups favoured the binding of cr vi to the active sites through biosorption thus precipitation complexation and electrostatic attraction mechanisms occurred 39 but in the case of im s am b ion exchange mechanism was the only mechanism where few functional groups of carboxylic amino and hydroxyl groups are responsible for chromium binding sites 62 3 8 breakthrough curve analysis to verify the effectiveness of the continuous column system the breakthrough curve kinetic studies of column modelling has been carried out with co immobilized biochar microbial beads and immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads for the aluminium formate coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater for this a unified logistic model represented by eq 1 has been used to express three kinetic models viz thomas bohart adams and yoon nelson 68 69 1 ln c o c 1 a bt where a and b parameters have different definitions based on the model its simplistic equation is rewritten as eq 2 in its breakthrough curve form 2 c c o 1 1 exp a bt where a refers to k th q th m q k ba n o l u and k yn τ b equals to k th c o k ba c o and k yn for thomas bohart adams b a and yoon nelson y n models respectively k th ml mg min k ba ml mg min and k yn 1 min 1 are rate constants of thomas b a and y n models respectively q ml min q th mg g and m g represent the volumetric flow rate pollutant loading per unit mass of adsorbents and mass of adsorbents used respectively n o mg l l cm and u cm min refer to saturated concentration depth of the bed and solution velocity calculated from volumetric flow rate respectively finally τ min and c o mg l represent the time for 50 breakthrough and influent concentration respectively for the breakthrough curve analysis the concentration of cr vi is 20 mg l at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min with a fixed bed depth of 30 cm the calculated kinetic coefficients are shown in table 2 and the obtained curves are shown in fig 4 the logistic equation used to derive values of a and b parameters has a correlation coefficient 0 9 hence the kinetics parameters were well fitted with the simplistic model for both the mediums thus it can be effectively used for the continuous system as shown in fig 4 the breakthrough point was attained at 90 min for aluminium formate pre treated tannery wastewater thus it can be concluded that at low inlet concentrations a slower breakthrough curve and high treated volume are acquired for aluminium formate pre treated tannery wastewater the possible reason for slow transport of chromium ions onto the co immobilized biochar microbial beads was due to the lower concentration gradient which resulted in the slow breakthrough curve at the same time the saturation of the accessible binding sites of chromium ions has decreased the breakthrough time this happened when the decrease in contact time among the metal ions and the adsorbent does not allow the complete saturation of the ions on the active binding sites and thus led to a reduction in the amount of cr vi ions adsorbed 70 but in case of immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads the breakthrough curve was faster and the performance of the media was not efficient as co immobilized biochar microbial beads the reason for lower adsorption could be due to the saturation in a short time leads to less breakthrough time where the amount of adsorbent accessible for the sorption of metal ions 14 3 9 effect of hybrid biofilter in the removal of cod fig 5 a and b depicts the individual removal of cod with co im b m b and im s am b in the hybrid biofilter during the treatment of tannery wastewater to scrutinize the cod removal raw and various pre treated tannery wastewater is passed through the biofilter bed under optimum conditions fig 5 b revealed that with a contact time of 90 min co im b m b showed a higher removal rate of cod i e 96 with aluminium formate pre treated wastewater while others showed 70 80 and 82 respectively the reason for the higher removal rate of cod with co im b m b was the co precipitation of the organic matter and the other chemical compounds accountable for cod with the colloidal chromium hydroxide ions on the surface of the biochar microbial biomass as the time increases the removal rate of cod was decreased the decrease in cod removal could be due to the charge reversal on the surface of the co im b m b further the same was repeated with im s am b in the hybrid biofilter for the removal of cod hence it showed 89 5 80 78 and 63 removal the lower reduction rate of cod with sodium alginate microbial beads in the hybrid biofilter is attributed to mono and polynuclear species on the surface of the biosorbent 43 3 10 effect of hybrid biofilter in the removal of sulphate excessive accumulation of sulphate in water causes corrosion scaling of the equipment and affecting the environment 71 fig 5 c and d represents the discrete reduction rate of sulphate with im s am b and co im b m b in the hybrid biofilter throughout the treatment of tannery wastewater under optimum conditions sulphate reduction was examined with various pre treated and raw tannery wastewater by passing through the hybrid biofilter bed fig 5 d depicts the co im b m b in hybrid biofilter exhibited 94 81 80 and 70 reduction of sulphate with aluminium formate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate and raw tannery wastewater respectively the higher reduction rate of sulphate was observed with aluminium formate pre treated wastewater the possible reason might be due to the presence of residual aluminium ions in the pre treated water which binds the counter anion sulphate and has the capacity to produce hydroxide precipitates besides the biochar present in the co im b m b composed of calcium also binds with sulphate present in tannery wastewater thereby the reduction of sulphate is occurred 43 in fig 5 c im s am b showed the sulphate reduction rate of 75 70 68 and 63 for aluminium formate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate and raw tannery wastewater respectively the reason for low sulphate reduction could be due to the anionic charge which prevents the adsorption of sulphate on the surface of the im s am b thereby the ph of the wastewater increases and solubility of sulphate is decreased remarkably in the tannery wastewater 72 74 3 11 regeneration and reusability of hybrid biofilter column regeneration of the biosorbent is indispensable to make the wastewater treatment more economical in terms of cost 65 fig 6 depicts the regeneration cycle experimental studies with i co im b m b and ii im s am b and carried out individually with an optimized time 90 min at a depth of 30 cm along with the cr vi concentration of 100 mg l the filter bed was regenerated with 0 4 m sodium hydroxide solvent naoh the exhausted hybrid biofilter column bed with different filter media were pre washed with 0 4 m naoh by passing it in an upward direction at optimized conditions with a flow rate of 2 ml min from fig 6 it can be observed that when the bed is treated with 0 4 m naoh co im b m b exhibited 89 5 while im s am b showed 73 in the first regeneration cycle the reason for high removal in co im b m b is due to the precipitation mechanism i e at alkaline conditions cr vi is reduced by oh ions present on the biochar microbial beads 58 75 further in the second and third cycle cr vi reduction rate was moderately reduced to 80 and 60 respectively the lower reduction rate of cr vi with im s am b was due to the presence of electrostatic repulsion of the same ion charge in the filter during the experimental studies the regeneration efficiency of cr vi uptake in the hybrid biofilter bed was gradually decreased in the third cycle with a reduction rate of 72 and 60 respectively the reason attributed to the fact that expeditious decrease in absorption was due to the irreversibly left chromium ions bound to the biomass results in deficient desorption as well as the reduced microporosity and deficiency of the functional groups in the filtration bed 42 76 77 however the regeneration study implied that co im b m b exhibited the best performance in the first three cycles with a good reduction rate of cr vi as compared to im s am b hybrid biofilter experimental studies revealed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b exhibited good removal of pollutants from the raw and various coagulant pre treated tannery wastewaters when compared to immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads im s am b as per our previous studies deepa et al 2018 43 and arukula et al 2019 42 the coagulation and filtration studies were carried out with aluminium formate coagulant and eggshell biochar for the treatment of tannery wastewater where nearly 80 90 of cr vi removal was observed during the pre treatment and post treatment but no complete removal of the pollutants was observed when compared to these treatments the hybrid biofilter treatment showed complete removal of pollutants compared to other treatment methods with high and feasible regeneration capacity thus the regeneration study with 0 4 m naoh is considerably low cost and effective solution to regenerate the column using co im b m b further the characterization studies were carried out for the raw and treated wastewater of co immobilized biochar microbial beads co im b m b in order to know about the detailed mechanism and functional groups involved in the reduction of chromium ions during the hybrid biofilter treatment process 3 12 characterization of co immobilized biochar microbial beads the foremost elemental compositions of the biochar used during co immobilization of microbial biochar beads were examined through the chns o analyzer to see the amount of carbon and hydrogen present in the biochar sample as its characteristics then composition of biochar proximate analysis on wet basis with a fixed carbon 0 0328 moisture 0 0214 ash 0 0464 and elemental analysis dry basis carbon 9 2980 hydrogen 0 1689 respectively the morphological characteristics of the co immobilization of microbial biochar beads raw and treated were scrutinized through fe sem and edx analyzer ftir analysis was carried out to know the speciation of the functional groups crystalline structure crystalline phase and its chemical composition studies were carried out with xrd analysis 3 13 fe sem and edx analysis fig 7 represents the morphological structure and surface characterization of both raw and treated samples of co immobilized biochar microbial beads analyzed through fe sem in fig 7 a it was observed that untreated co immobilized biochar microbial beads were covered with the slime layer of the microbial growth bacillus species dpaml065 in a thick denser mode and showed a rough irregular cracked appearance with the existence of some crystal compounds which permit to reciprocate the substances and enhances the adsorption mechanism but fig 7 d revealed that the microstructural analysis showed some significant changes in co immobilized biochar microbial beads the morphological studies revealed that the slime layer was slightly reduced to the dense and compact matrix by decreasing the robustness of beads which might be due to the biosorption phenomenon of the pollutants during the treatment process energy dispersive x ray analysis edx was carried out to see the quantification of elements in both treated and untreated samples as shown in fig 7 b and e respectively the quantification of the elements in both raw and treated samples is given in table 3 which mainly consists of carbon oxygen calcium silicon magnesium sulfur etc designate the appearance of certain elements entangled in the chemical composition of the synthetic tannery wastewater during the adsorption 78 3 14 ftir analysis the surface functional groups of raw and treated co immobilized biochar microbial beads were analyzed by ftir analysis and depicted in fig 8 their group frequency wavenumber cm 1 is represented in table 4 the peak at 3570 58 cm 1 in raw sample denotes oh group but in the treated sample the band shifted to 3496 26 cm 1 and indicated oh bond with broad stretching vibrations has been adsorbed on the surface of the co im b m b the peak 3363 44 cm 1 depicts primary aliphatic amines with nh bonded groups 39 the peak 3300 13

ch stretching vibration of saturated aliphatic species the peaks 2920 27 cm 1 2925 28 cm 1 and 2867 97 cm 1 denotes asymmetric vibrations of ch2 79 the peak 2867 97 cm 1 signifies aliphatic ch stretching vibrations with strong intensity on the surface of the raw sample in co im b m b cr vi biosorption was occurred due to the shifting of the peak 2522 51 cm 1 represents ch covalent bond thus reduces the chromium ions 80 the peak 2678 03 cm 1 and 2361 48 cm 1 represents co of carbonyl acid groups with strong stretching vibrations the band 2505 30 cm 1 2344 27 cm 1 2338 08 cm 1 and 2078 64 cm 1 corresponds to the aromatic combination bands cc and co in aromatic rings of conjugated ketones that participated in the exhaustion of chromium ions 81 the peak 2119 24 cm 1 denotes reactive carbonyl group but in co im b m b the peak at 1790 99 cm 1 denotes metal carbonyl compounds and the peak 1796 50 cm 1 and 1601 66 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of co may affect the ᴫ ᴫ interactions which control the adsorption when the biosorbent interface with the surface of carbonyl and alkene groups of the biosorbent 82 the band at 1560 46 cm 1 and 1554 95 cm 1 attributed to aromatic compounds cc with stretching vibrations of ketones and quinines the peak at 1439 34 cm 1 designates the presence of methylene group with ch bending but in the treated sample the band raised and appeared at 1445 93 cm 1 indicating long chain linear aliphatic structure which results in crystallinity and a high degree of regularity for the linear backbone structure the peak at 1191 60 cm 1 depicts the cn amine group 42 the band at 1105 58 cm 1 in co im b m b was assigned to the hydroxyl group of co carboxyl in raw peak at 1111 08 cm 1 signifies cn stretching vibrations the peak at 1082 18 cm 1 in co im b m b typify aromatic phosphates poc with stretching vibrations the band at 944 55 cm 1 symbolizes ch out of plane bending with broad peak with a medium absorption in co im b m b band has been shifted to 892 25 cm 1 represents cch2 with a plane bend the peaks at 898 44 cm 1 771 13 cm 1 714 01 cm 1 and 707 820 cm 1 designate skeletal cc vibrations and alkyl halide group of ccl the results are in good agreement with the data reported by 39 42 83 thus carbonyl carboxyl ligands amino and hydroxyl groups provide the major biosorption sites for chromium ions binding 84 3 15 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction studies xrd has been carried out with anhydrous cr vi treated and non treated cr vi pellets and were examined with bruker model kappa apex ii fig 9 depicts the xrd analysis of a raw b treated co immobilized biochar microbial beads in which it had shown the crystalline phase of calcite before the treatment having the compounds with a remarkable peak around of 20 2ө 24 8 29 4 34 9 have been observed through the peak s information from jcpds file hence let out the presence of calcium oxide which is a well know calcite compound 85 additionally there are several other peaks at 31 8 45 4 47 8 attribute the presence of polysaccharides that might be due to the presence of functional groups on the surface of the in co im b m b in the treated sample the amorphous nature of the compounds with small peaks after the treatment of co im b m b has been observed hence it showed some low intensity at 27 52 66 5 peaks revealed the presence of chromium ions indicating that during the treatment of the synthetic wastewater co im b m b participated in the exhaustion of chromium ions in addition some low intensity peaks were observed at 30 21 and 49 5 which revealed the presence of some polysaccharides and sodium salts further it clearly stated that co im b m b participated in the reduction of chromium ions during the treatment process 4 conclusion in this study the performance of a hybrid biofilter treatment system was evaluated in terms of cr vi reduction from various pre treated coagulation carried out through different metallic coagulants tannery wastewater cr vi reduction efficiency and the organic pollutants such as cod and sulphate removal were compared with distinct filter media such as co immobilized biochar microbial beads and immobilized sodium alginate microbial beads individually in the hybrid biofilter treatment the study confirmed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads enhanced the cr vi reduction cod and sulphate with 99 2 96 and 94 respectively through precipitation electrostatic attraction surface complexation when the coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater aluminium formate is passed through the biofilter bed ftir analysis of co im b m b disclosed that the presence of carboxylic hydroxylic and carbonyl groups are engaged in the reduction of cr vi ions xrd results revealed some polysaccharide peaks which were also involved during the exhaustion of chromium ions the study illustrated that aluminium formate coagulant pre treated wastewater exhibited robust effects when it comes to contact with the co im b m b resulting in alkaline condition thereby enhancing the reduction rate of cr vi was observed this study showed that 99 2 of cr vi was reduced through precipitation and complexation mechanisms during the biological treatment organic coagulant aluminium formate having formate has more predominance over sulphate and chloride coagulant pre treated tannery wastewater because it is unbound to corrosive free and non lethal regeneration and reusability studies confirmed that co im b m b could be reused by using 0 4 m naoh up to three cycles in addition this study also concluded that aluminium formate organic coagulant could increase the biosorption competence of the hybrid biofilter with the addition of carbon source which acts as a nutrient in the biological treatment further this study suggests that pre treatment of tannery wastewater with aluminium formate coagulant accompanied by hybrid biofilter having co immobilized biochar microbial beads as a filter medium could be the most appropriate method for the reduction of cr vi and other organic pollutants from tannery wastewater besides this study showed that co immobilized biochar microbial beads used in this experiment were environmentally friendly and feasible as well as irreplaceable for the biosorption of cr vi declaration of competing interest authors have no conflicts of interest acknowledgement the

12893,this study aims to evaluate an advanced activated sludge process that integrates activated sludge process with biological fenton reaction to enhance antibiotic treatment in wastewater the target antibiotic used in this study was sulfamethoxazole smx an anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr containing magnetite was proposed anaerobic and aerobic sludge was exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions for treating synthetic wastewater containing 1 mg l smx and 405 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod stable and enhanced smx removal was observed in the sbrs with magnetite which achieved more than 86 removal 40 higher than that without magnetite magnetite dosage at 1 and 3 g l did not significantly affect smx removal fluorescence observations indicated the formation of hydroxyl radicals ohs in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates this elucidated the primary mechanism of the significant smx removal it was shown that fe iii in the magnetite was reduced to fe ii and then oxidized to fe iii under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively creating continuous oxidation reduction of magnetite moreover hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was microbially generated under aerobic conditions and drove the biological fenton reaction approximately 90 of cod was removed under steady state conditions in the sbrs containing magnetite the higher cod removal in sbrs with magnetite was due to microbial fe iii reduction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sbr magnetite hydrogen peroxide biological fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction antibiotics as one group of the emerging contaminants ecs have been detected in wastewater over the world and their impacts on the ecosystem have been of great concern furthermore the loss of efficiency of antibiotics used for treatment of humans and animals is a direct result of the genesis and spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria 1 antibiotics originate from the excreta of humans and flow into the municipal wastewater discharge from hospitals and runoffs from animal and aquaculture industries also serve as antibiotic sources originally wastewater treatment plants wwtps that employ physical chemical biological and disinfection processes are adopted to reduce conventional organic matters and pathogens prior to discharge sufficient treatment of ecs is not conducted in most wwtps most ecs can pass through wwtps because of their refractory characteristics and continuous introduction 2 therefore the development of feasible efficient and sustainable solutions for treating wastewater containing ecs is needed in conventional wwtps activated sludge process based treatment is the most widely utilized technique for antibiotic removal their treatment efficiencies vary considerably due to the different physical and chemical properties of different types of antibiotics as well as variation in operating conditions of different wwtps 3 yu et al 4 reported that the removal of sulfamethoxazole smx was 65 96 in a wwtp in china when the influent smx concentration was 0 5 10 μg l however brown et al 5 and ternes et al 6 only observed 20 24 smx removal from municipal wastewater recently higher antibiotic removal was reported with treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops with a principle of fenton reaction eq 1 and especially the photo fenton process electro fenton process and heterogeneous magnetic metal catalytic fenton process 7 10 the hydroxyl radicals ohs produced by the fenton reaction are highly effective against a variety of refractory organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals pesticides and dyes however the unsustainable issues with these aops are the comparatively high energy consumption and cost of operation and maintenance due to uv radiation ozone production or reagents e g hydrogen peroxide injections limiting their applications 11 1 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 ohˉ ho attempts have been made to address these inadequacies by using heterogeneous iron catalysts in the fenton reaction and some recent investigations have suggested that magnetite might be a potential fenton catalyst in a neutral ph environment 12 14 magnetite which contains fe ii and fe iii is an electrical conductor in which electrons can be transported between the two oxidation states of iron according to previous studies the addition of magnetite particles to activated sludge caused some unconventional phenomena for instance when activated sludge in a sequencing batch reactor sbr was exposed to magnetite nanoparticles for a prolonged period the generated reactive oxygen species ros and lactate dehydrogenase would cause toxicity to the microbial activity 15 however peng et al 16 and ikemoto et al 17 found an increase in the number of iron reducing bacteria irb and improved sludge hydrolysis after the addition of magnetite to anaerobic sludge under long term exposure to magnetite the efficacy of activated sludge in terms of both antibiotics and cod removal has not been researched in addition the continuous demand for hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to activate the fenton reaction is unsustainable and uneconomical moreover h2o2 is easily decomposed into water owing to its unstable nature consequently it is more appealing to generate h2o2 in situ rather than transporting it to the application site for pollutant degradation h2o2 was found to be produced under aerobic conditions by irb via microbial oxygen respiration 18 it was also reported that facultative anaerobic bacteria could utilize nadh lactate and pyruvate accumulated in their cells under anaerobic conditions and produce h2o2 after oxygen exposure 19 21 however there have been few studies on microbial h2o2 production by mixed culture of microorganisms in activated sludge in our previous study 22 an anaerobic aerobic sbr supplemented with magnetite was proposed as an advanced activated sludge process to simultaneously remove smx and conventional organic matters in wastewater under neutral conditions without an external supply of h2o2 significant smx removal was observed in the sbr with magnetite however these results were not obtained under steady state operation because only 4 cycles 8 days were conducted it is expected that h2o2 may accumulate in a short time when the activated sludge is aerated which may lead to the continuous production of ohs the ohs production is considered effective for the degradation of refractory pollutants however it may affect the activities of activated sludge and may decrease the overall treatment performance smx was used as a model antibiotic in this study because it is ubiquitously present in raw wastewater and it impacts aquatic organisms under various exposure situations even in trace quantities 23 although the concentrations of smx found in municipal wastewater range from a few nanograms to tens of micrograms the concentration of smx used in this study was set at a much greater level 1 mg l to evaluate the potential performance of the proposed sbrs the main objective of this study was to verify the stability of long term treatments using anaerobic aerobic sbrs with magnetite to achieve this we i designed three identical sbrs with and without magnetite and operated them to reach steady state conditions ii investigated the treatment performances of the sbrs at different magnetite dosages and hydraulic retention time hrt conditions and iii analyzed the primary mechanisms of smx removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operating cycles

with 5 6 mg l do three sbrs were operated in a sequence of two phases phase i and phase ii phase i and phase ii consisted of 19 and 25 operating cycles respectively each cycle consisted of an anaerobic period and an aerobic period referring to yang et al 24 each period in phase i and phase ii was set as 3 days and 1 day respectively the operation proceeded with an anaerobic period and at the end of each cycle the stirrer and gas supply were stopped for 30 min to enable sludge settling then the supernatant was replaced with new synthetic wastewater with a volume exchange ratio of 50 1 l prior to altering the conditions the samples were collected using a syringe 2 2 experimental materials aerobic activated sludge was collected from a return activated sludge of a wwtp in the kanto region of japan while anaerobic sludge was provided by prof li yu you at tohoku university japan these seed sludges were different from those used in our previous study to verify the reproducibility

fluorescein apf with a property of 5 mm n n dimethylformamide dmf solution was purchased from goryo chemical sapporo japan the dmf solution was diluted to 10 μm with a 0 1 phosphate buffer of ph 7 4 before use the composition of synthetic wastewater was determined referring to the literature 25 and the concentrations were adjusted to provide an influent cod of 405 mg l casein peptone 150 glucose

water from a millipore system 2 3 chemical analysis 2 3 1 water quality parameters analysis parameters including mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi were measured according to standard methods 2005 26 the cod analysis was performed using the closed reflux method in accordance with standard methods 2005 26 do and ph were measured using an orion star a223 do meter and an eutech pc 450 digital meter respectively thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the cod and smx removal efficiencies were calculated using eq 2 2 removal efficiecy c inf c eff c inf 100 where cinf and ceff indicate the influent and effluent concentrations of each cycle respectively 2 3 2 smx analysis an agilent 1260 infinity ii high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a diode array detector was used to measure the concentrations of smx the detection wavelength and column temperature were set at 268 nm and 40 c respectively before analysis samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature 20 25 c and the supernatant was then filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter ptfe025045l membrane solutions a sample volume of 20 μl was injected using an autosampler separations were performed on a 4 6 150 mm l column ods gl sciences tokyo japan mobile phase eluent a 0 3 acetic acid in acetonitrile and b 0 3 acetic acid in ultrapure water were delivered at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min through the column in time dependent gradient proportions for 13 min elution was initiated with 34 a for 6 min then increased to 100 a in 0 1 min and maintained for 2 9 min then it was returned to the initial condition in 0 1 min and was maintained for 3 9 min the retention time of smx was 4 min the standard curves obtained from calibration always had a coefficient of determination greater than 0 99 2 3 3 h2o2 and fe analysis h2o2 concentration was quantified using a modified chromogenic assay based on the oxidative coupling of dmab and mbth 27 28 samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm at room temperature 20 25 c for 5 min and 1 ml of the supernatant was placed in a cuvette an aliquot of 400 μl of 12 5 mm dmab reagent 51 6 mg of dmab into 25 ml of 0 375 m sodium phosphate buffer solution and 80 μl of 1 3 mm mbth followed by 20 μl of 5 units horseradish peroxidase were added to the cuvette the reaction mixture was rested at room temperature 20 25 c for 5 min before being cooled at 0 c for 10 min to terminate the enzyme activity a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 160 shimadzu was employed to collect triplicate absorption values at 590 nm the presence of fe in magnetite was identified as hcl extractable fe by dissolving a mixture of sludge and magnetite in 6 m hcl 29 the concentrations of dissolved ferrous ions in the hcl extraction were then measured spectrophotometrically using a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method 10 30 the total fe concentration was determined by reduction of ferric to ferrous ions using hydroxylamine hydrochloride the difference between ferrous and total fe was used to calculate the ferric concentration prior to analysis all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter ptfe025045l membrane solutions x ray diffraction xrd was performed using an x ray diffractometer inet ultima iii rigaku with a cu kα radiation source 2 3 4 the detection of hydroxyl radicals fluorescence probes were used to identify the formation of ohs one milliliter of a mixture of sludge and magnetite was withdrawn from each reactor during aerobic periods and subsequently incubated in 10 ml diluted dmf solution 10 μm in beakers small magnetic stirrers were used to ensure sufficient contact between the sample and the apf the incubation period was 2 days under aerobic conditions the incubated mixture was stimulated for 10 min at a wavelength of 490 nm and viewed through a 515 nm emission filter to trace the fluorescence of ohs an olympus bx60 equipped with a digital microscope camera moticams1 motic amoy china was employed image processing was performed using motic images plus 2 4s 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the sbrs 3 1 1 physical and biological properties of the activated sludge mlss mlvss and svi measurements were conducted to assess the physical and biological sludge characteristics which were measured every 3 cycles fig 1 shows the measured values for all reactors generally mlss and mlvss concentrations of all reactors grew slightly as the experiment progressed fig 1 throughout the experiment the mlss of sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 increased from 3 0 3 9 and 5 9 g l to 4 1 5 3 and 7 2 g l respectively while the mlvss of sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 increased from 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 g l to 3 1 3 6 and 3 5 g l respectively these results revealed that the activated sludge and microorganisms were acclimated and enriched throughout the long term operation of all the systems this suggests that supplemental magnetite did not inhibit microbial viability the svi of the three sbrs showed a slight downward trend in phase i and were maintained at approximately 124 92 and 73 ml g of mlss in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively in phase ii svi has been considered the standard measure for determining the physical properties of activated sludge in terms of settling a low svi suggests good sludge compactability and a higher svi generally indicates sludge bulking 32 the svi values of sbr1 and sbr2 were lower compared to those of the sbr0 control reactor fig 1 namal 33 reported that adding magnetite to anaerobic reactors could result in a better quality effluent owing to the enhanced settleability of the sludge 3 1 2 cod and smx removal efficiency cod removal is an important criterion for determining the performance of conventional wastewater treatments the changes in cod removal are shown in fig 2 and these demonstrate similar trends corresponding to changes in the mlvss fig 1 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 cod removal increased and then approached steady state levels in phase i while those in phase ii were almost maintained at steady state levels the cod removal efficiencies at steady state conditions in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 were approximately 84 1 0 89 1 4 and 90 0 7 in phase i and 84 0 7 90 0 8 and 89 0 7 in phase ii respectively this shows that the overall cod removal was unaffected when the anaerobic and aerobic period was reduced from 3 days to 1 day cod removal was enhanced by approximately 6 upon the addition of magnetite the results also suggest that the biodegradation of conventional organic pollutants in the anaerobic aerobic sbr was not substantially affected by the magnetite dosage because no significant differences in cod removal efficiency were observed between sbr1 and sbr2 yang et al 24 also demonstrated that the addition of magnetite particles to microaerobic up flow sludge reactors did not inhibit microbial growth and organic decomposition reactions due to the lower toxicity of micron scale particles compared with that of nanoscale particles the smx removal efficiency of each cycle is shown in fig 3 with patterns similar to those of the h2o2 concentrations fig 4 sbr1 and sbr2 outperformed sbr0 in the removal of smx smx removal efficiencies in the three sbrs presented upward and asymptotic trends during phase i from 27 to 46 43 to 79 and 45 to 82 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively in phase ii they were kept stable at approximately 48 2 2 88 2 4 and 86 1 8 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively smx removal efficiency was slightly increased when the anaerobic and aerobic period decreased from 3 days to 1 day on comparing the efficiencies in sbr1 and sbr2 no significant differences were observed even though magnetite concentrations were 1 and 3 g l respectively this might be due to the aggregation of magnetite particles and unfavorable reactions occurring between existing iron species and hydroxyl radicals 34 smx concentrations after anaerobic periods were also monitored fig s1 and the results demonstrated that smx was primarily removed in aerobic phases because less than 0 13 mg l of smx was decreased during anaerobic periods in section 3 1 3 the microbial h2o2 production is discussed and it was observed that h2o2 was mainly produced during aerobic periods it can be considered that the oxidation of h2o2 was catalyzed by the fe ii existed in the magnetite generating hydroxyl radicals which decomposed smx during aerobic periods both biodegradation and sorption contributed to smx removal in the biological treatment however sorption to activated sludge was determined to be a minor removal mechanism for smx as previous studies have demonstrated that solid sorption was considerable in refractory organic pollutants with an n octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow above 4 0 while smx has a log kow value of 0 89 35 36 our preliminary batch experiment showed that the maximum adsorption rate of smx was 8 3 indicating that less than 0 1 mg l of smx was adsorbed onto magnetite fig s2 smx biodegradation via activated sludge process ranged from almost complete removal to very limited biodegradation our results obtained from sbr0 were similar to those reported in previous literature 37 where limited smx removal was observed in activated sludge systems with a removal efficiency of 36 5 11 5 when the influent smx concentration was 66 8 7 0 μg l in contrast suárez et al 38 observed that anoxic and aerobic activated sludge systems reached smx removal efficiencies of approximately 64 70 many factors can affect the biological treatment such as water components and microorganism species 39 40 the presence of magnetite caused a change in the types of microorganisms and corresponding biological reactions which also affected the treatment performance in removing smx 40 the predominant microorganism species need to be identified in further studies to evaluate the performance precisely 3 1 3 microbial h2o2 production the h2o2 concentration in the supernatant was quantified at the end of each aerobic period and the accumulated h2o2 concentration was dependent on the amount of h2o2 released into the system as well as the balance between its production and consumption the three sbrs showed an increase and subsequent asymptotic approach to a certain level of h2o2 concentrations during phases i and ii fig 4 for example in sbr1 and sbr2 h2o2 concentrations increased from approximately 15 to 40 μm in phase i and from 40 to 51 μm in phase ii in sbr0 the h2o2 concentration increased from 11 to approximately 20 μm in phase i while it was maintained at approximately 22 μm in phase ii h2o2 concentrations after anaerobic periods were below 8 μm in the three sbrs data not shown these results indicated that h2o2 was mainly produced during the aerobic phases and the addition of magnetite enhanced its production it was reported that s onedensis mr 1 generated approximately 20 26 μm h2o2 under aerobic and anoxic oxic conditions 41 our results for sbr1 and sbr2 showed that more than twice h2o2 accumulation was detected compared to that reported previously abiotic h2o2 production was investigated by conducting a preliminary batch experiment under the same operating conditions as the sbr experiment the results showed that the abiotic production of h2o2 was smaller than 8 μm in the presence of 1 and 3 g l magnetite this indicates the accumulated h2o2 in sbrs was mainly microbially produced 3 2 advanced biological oxidation 3 2 1 oxidation reduction cycle of magnetite the reduction and oxidation of magnetite were then analyzed from the 15 19th cycles and from the 40 44th cycles during phases i and ii respectively originally magnetite consists of fe ii and fe iii in a molar ratio of 1 2 under the microbial metabolism effect of ferrous oxidizing bacteria and ferric reducing bacteria magnetite can be used as an electron donor and acceptor under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively these iron metabolizing microorganisms also have the ability to grow during the dissimilatory iron redox process 35 42 therefore it can be considered that the ratio of fe ii and fe iii in magnetite changes with the participation of different bacteria fig 5 shows that fe iii concentrations decreased and increased under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively and fe ii concentrations exhibited the opposite trend in sbr1 and sbr2 the amount of microbially produced fe ii was similar this indicates that a large amount of magnetite was not utilized by irb in sbr2 the total fe concentration in sbr0 decreased from 0 04 to 0 004 mm within these 10 cycles fig 5 a suggesting the occurrence of iron leaching almost no iron leaching was observed in sbr1 and sbr2 because their total fe concentrations were maintained within a certain range figs 5 b and 5 c indicating the modified anaerobic aerobic sbr with magnetite was feasible for long term operation the amount of microbially reduced fe iii under anaerobic conditions and oxidized fe ii under aerobic conditions in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 were 0 1 0 04 2 7 0 2 and 2 9 0 9 mm and 0 1 0 03 2 6 0 4 and 2 8 0 9 mm respectively in sbr1 and sbr2 the reduction of fe iii during anaerobic periods was almost equivalent to the amount of oxidized fe ii during aerobic periods this indicates that the continuous use of magnetite for the biological fenton reaction was with great potential lovley and phillips 43 elucidated the potential of fe iii reduction to utilize the reducing equivalent and contribute to organic matter decomposition the stoichiometric relationship between microbial fe ii production and cod oxidation was then calculated as δ cod δ fe ii 6 72 mg cod mmol fe ii 43 44 these results explain the approximately 6 higher cod removal in sbr1 and sbr2 than that in sbr0 the magnetite and sludge complexes obtained from sbr1 and sbr2 after the 25th cycle was subjected to xrd analysis to further elucidate the structural integrity of magnetite fig 6 the characteristic peaks of these two samples were consistent with the standard card of magnetite jcpds card no 00 011 0614 this suggests that maximum magnetite was not converted into other types of iron oxides during the experimental operation 3 2 2 smx removal mechanisms to identify the enhanced smx removal in sbr1 and sbr2 was attributed to the biological fenton reaction the formation of ohs was detected fluorescence probes are effective for detecting ohs and providing temporal and spatial images apf as a selectable fluorescein can be used by neutrophils with high resistance to autoxidation images of the mixture of activated sludge and magnetite under aerobic conditions were captured under visible light irradiation and after fluorescent excitation were compared in fig 7 a 7 b and 7 c as shown in fig 7 b 2 and c 2 clear fluorescent emission was observed in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates implying the formation of ohs and the occurrence of biological fenton reaction the same observations were made for the activated sludge under anaerobic conditions whereas no clear fluorescent emissions were observed fig s3 this also explained that smx was mainly removed during aerobic periods in sbr1 and sbr2 magnetite catalyzed the oxidation of the microbially produced h2o2 and generated multiple ohs with strong potential to decompose smx during aerobic periods however extremely weak fluorescence was observed in the sbr0 sample under fluorescent irradiation fig 7 a 2 this may be due to the slight presence of iron compounds in the seed sludge which reacted with h2o2 fig 5 a fig 4 and produced a limited amount of ohs after the systems reached a steady state the production of h2o2 remained at a stable level during aerobic periods and the reduction of iron during anaerobic periods contributed to the continued occurrence of the biological fenton reaction this resulted in stable and enhanced smx removal in the sbrs containing magnetite the productions of ohs in sbr1 and sbr2 were supposed to be comparable since the fluorescence intensities observed in their matrixes of magnetite sludge aggregates were similar and almost identical smx removals were observed in sbr1 and sbr2 4 conclusions this study evaluated an anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr supplemented with magnetite for the enhanced treatment of antibiotic wastewater steady state levels were observed in the three sbrs under steady state conditions sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 removed approximately 84 90 and 89 of cod respectively the microbial fe iii reduction resulted in approximately 6 higher cod removal in the sbrs with magnetite further experimental results elucidated that stable and enhanced removal of sulfamethoxazole smx was achieved under long term operation in sbrs containing magnetite with a final removal efficiency of more than 86 while it was only 46 in the sbr without magnetite it was interesting to observe significantly higher accumulation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in sbrs with magnetite alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions created continuous oxidation reduction cycle of magnetite and the microbially produced fe ii catalyzed the biological fenton reaction leading to the production of hydroxyl radicals ohs fluorescence observation results indicated the formation of ohs in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates this is considered the primary mechanism for the enhanced smx removal our results suggest that the proposed anaerobic aerobic sbr with magnetite has long term operation potential for enhanced treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics further studies are encouraged to investigate mechanisms and reaction kinetics with greater precision and applicability regarding practical implications in wastewater

12893,this study aims to evaluate an advanced activated sludge process that integrates activated sludge process with biological fenton reaction to enhance antibiotic treatment in wastewater the target antibiotic used in this study was sulfamethoxazole smx an anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr containing magnetite was proposed anaerobic and aerobic sludge was exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions for treating synthetic wastewater containing 1 mg l smx and 405 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod stable and enhanced smx removal was observed in the sbrs with magnetite which achieved more than 86 removal 40 higher than that without magnetite magnetite dosage at 1 and 3 g l did not significantly affect smx removal fluorescence observations indicated the formation of hydroxyl radicals ohs in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates this elucidated the primary mechanism of the significant smx removal it was shown that fe iii in the magnetite was reduced to fe ii and then oxidized to fe iii under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively creating continuous oxidation reduction of magnetite moreover hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was microbially generated under aerobic conditions and drove the biological fenton reaction approximately 90 of cod was removed under steady state conditions in the sbrs containing magnetite the higher cod removal in sbrs with magnetite was due to microbial fe iii reduction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sbr magnetite hydrogen peroxide biological fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction antibiotics as one group of the emerging contaminants ecs have been detected in wastewater over the world and their impacts on the ecosystem have been of great concern furthermore the loss of efficiency of antibiotics used for treatment of humans and animals is a direct result of the genesis and spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria 1 antibiotics originate from the excreta of humans and flow into the municipal wastewater discharge from hospitals and runoffs from animal and aquaculture industries also serve as antibiotic sources originally wastewater treatment plants wwtps that employ physical chemical biological and disinfection processes are adopted to reduce conventional organic matters and pathogens prior to discharge sufficient treatment of ecs is not conducted in most wwtps most ecs can pass through wwtps because of their refractory characteristics and continuous introduction 2 therefore the development of feasible efficient and sustainable solutions for treating wastewater containing ecs is needed in conventional wwtps activated sludge process based treatment is the most widely utilized technique for antibiotic removal their treatment efficiencies vary considerably due to the different physical and chemical properties of different types of antibiotics as well as variation in operating conditions of different wwtps 3 yu et al 4 reported that the removal of sulfamethoxazole smx was 65 96 in a wwtp in china when the influent smx concentration was 0 5 10 μg l however brown et al 5 and ternes et al 6 only observed 20 24 smx removal from municipal wastewater recently higher antibiotic removal was reported with treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops with a principle of fenton reaction eq 1 and especially the photo fenton process electro fenton process and heterogeneous magnetic metal catalytic fenton process 7 10 the hydroxyl radicals ohs produced by the fenton reaction are highly effective against a variety of refractory organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals pesticides and dyes however the unsustainable issues with these aops are the comparatively high energy consumption and cost of operation and maintenance due to uv radiation ozone production or reagents e g hydrogen peroxide injections limiting their applications 11 1 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 ohˉ ho attempts have been made to address these inadequacies by using heterogeneous iron catalysts in the fenton reaction and some recent investigations have suggested that magnetite might be a potential fenton catalyst in a neutral ph environment

maintained for 2 9 min then it was returned to the initial condition in 0 1 min and was maintained for 3 9 min the retention time of smx was 4 min the standard curves obtained from calibration always had a coefficient of determination greater than 0 99 2 3 3 h2o2 and fe analysis h2o2 concentration was quantified using a modified chromogenic assay based on the oxidative coupling of dmab and mbth 27 28 samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm at room temperature 20 25 c for 5 min and 1 ml of the supernatant was placed in a cuvette an aliquot of 400 μl of 12 5 mm dmab reagent 51 6 mg of dmab into 25 ml of 0 375 m sodium phosphate buffer solution and 80 μl of 1 3 mm mbth followed by 20 μl of 5 units horseradish peroxidase were added to the cuvette the reaction mixture was rested at room temperature 20 25 c for 5 min before being cooled at 0 c for 10 min to terminate the enzyme activity a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 160 shimadzu was employed to collect triplicate absorption values at 590 nm the presence of fe in magnetite was identified as hcl extractable fe by dissolving a mixture of sludge and magnetite in 6 m hcl 29 the concentrations of dissolved ferrous ions in the hcl extraction were then measured spectrophotometrically using a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method 10 30 the total fe concentration was determined by reduction of ferric to ferrous ions using hydroxylamine hydrochloride the difference between ferrous and total fe was used to calculate the ferric concentration prior to analysis all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter ptfe025045l membrane solutions x ray diffraction xrd was performed using an x ray diffractometer inet ultima iii rigaku with a cu kα radiation source 2 3 4 the detection of hydroxyl radicals fluorescence probes were used to identify the formation of ohs one milliliter of a mixture of sludge and magnetite was withdrawn from each reactor during aerobic periods and subsequently incubated in 10 ml diluted dmf solution 10 μm in beakers small magnetic stirrers were used to ensure sufficient contact between the sample and the apf the incubation period was 2 days under aerobic conditions the incubated mixture was stimulated for 10 min at a wavelength of 490 nm and viewed through a 515 nm emission filter to trace the fluorescence of ohs an olympus bx60 equipped with a digital microscope camera moticams1 motic amoy china was employed image processing was performed using motic images plus 2 4s 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the sbrs 3 1 1 physical and biological properties of the activated sludge mlss mlvss and svi measurements were conducted to assess the physical and biological sludge characteristics which were measured every 3 cycles fig 1 shows the measured values for all reactors generally mlss and mlvss concentrations of all reactors grew slightly as the experiment progressed fig 1 throughout the experiment the mlss of sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 increased from 3 0 3 9 and 5 9 g l to 4 1 5 3 and 7 2 g l respectively while the mlvss of sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 increased from 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 g l to 3 1 3 6 and 3 5 g l respectively these results revealed that the activated sludge and microorganisms were acclimated and enriched throughout the long term operation of all the systems this suggests that supplemental magnetite did not inhibit microbial viability the svi of the three sbrs showed a slight downward trend in phase i and were maintained at approximately 124 92 and 73 ml g of mlss in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively in phase ii svi has been considered the standard measure for determining the physical properties of activated sludge in terms of settling a low svi suggests good sludge compactability and a higher svi generally indicates sludge bulking 32 the svi values of sbr1 and sbr2 were lower compared to those of the sbr0 control reactor fig 1 namal 33 reported that adding magnetite to anaerobic reactors could result in a better quality effluent owing to the enhanced settleability of the sludge 3 1 2 cod and smx removal efficiency cod removal is an important criterion for determining the performance of conventional wastewater treatments the changes in cod removal are shown in fig 2 and these demonstrate similar trends corresponding to changes in the mlvss fig 1 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 cod removal increased and then approached steady state levels in phase i while those in phase ii were almost maintained at steady state levels the cod removal efficiencies at steady state conditions in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 were approximately 84 1 0 89 1 4 and 90 0 7 in phase i and 84 0 7 90 0 8 and 89 0 7 in phase ii respectively this shows that the overall cod removal was unaffected when the anaerobic and aerobic period was reduced from 3 days to 1 day cod removal was enhanced by approximately 6 upon the addition of magnetite the results also suggest that the biodegradation of conventional organic pollutants in the anaerobic aerobic sbr was not substantially affected by the magnetite dosage because no significant differences in cod removal efficiency were observed between sbr1 and sbr2 yang et al 24 also demonstrated that the addition of magnetite particles to microaerobic up flow sludge reactors did not inhibit microbial growth and organic decomposition reactions due to the lower toxicity of micron scale particles compared with that of nanoscale particles the smx removal efficiency of each cycle is shown in fig 3 with patterns similar to those of the h2o2 concentrations fig 4 sbr1 and sbr2 outperformed sbr0 in the removal of smx smx removal efficiencies in the three sbrs presented upward and asymptotic trends during phase i from 27 to 46 43 to 79 and 45 to 82 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively in phase ii they were kept stable at approximately 48 2 2 88 2 4 and 86 1 8 in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 respectively smx removal efficiency was slightly increased when the anaerobic and aerobic period decreased from 3 days to 1 day on comparing the efficiencies in sbr1 and sbr2 no significant differences were observed even though magnetite concentrations were 1 and 3 g l respectively this might be due to the aggregation of magnetite particles and unfavorable reactions occurring between existing iron species and hydroxyl radicals 34 smx concentrations after anaerobic periods were also monitored fig s1 and the results demonstrated that smx was primarily removed in aerobic phases because less than 0 13 mg l of smx was decreased during anaerobic periods in section 3 1 3 the microbial h2o2 production is discussed and it was observed that h2o2 was mainly produced during aerobic periods it can be considered that the oxidation of h2o2 was catalyzed by the fe ii existed in the magnetite generating hydroxyl radicals which decomposed smx during aerobic periods both biodegradation and sorption contributed to smx removal in the biological treatment however sorption to activated sludge was determined to be a minor removal mechanism for smx as previous studies have demonstrated that solid sorption was considerable in refractory organic pollutants with an n octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow above 4 0 while smx has a log kow value of 0 89 35 36 our preliminary batch experiment showed that the maximum adsorption rate of smx was 8 3 indicating that less than 0 1 mg l of smx was adsorbed onto magnetite fig s2 smx biodegradation via activated sludge process ranged from almost complete removal to very limited biodegradation our results obtained from sbr0 were similar to those reported in previous literature 37 where limited smx removal was observed in activated sludge systems with a removal efficiency of 36 5 11 5 when the influent smx concentration was 66 8 7 0 μg l in contrast suárez et al 38 observed that anoxic and aerobic activated sludge systems reached smx removal efficiencies of approximately 64 70 many factors can affect the biological treatment such as water components and microorganism species 39 40 the presence of magnetite caused a change in the types of microorganisms and corresponding biological reactions which also affected the treatment performance in removing smx 40 the predominant microorganism species need to be identified in further studies to evaluate the performance precisely 3 1 3 microbial h2o2 production the h2o2 concentration in the supernatant was quantified at the end of each aerobic period and the accumulated h2o2 concentration was dependent on the amount of h2o2 released into the system as well as the balance between its production and consumption the three sbrs showed an increase and subsequent asymptotic approach to a certain level of h2o2 concentrations during phases i and ii fig 4 for example in sbr1 and sbr2 h2o2 concentrations increased from approximately 15 to 40 μm in phase i and from 40 to 51 μm in phase ii in sbr0 the h2o2 concentration increased from 11 to approximately 20 μm in phase i while it was maintained at approximately 22 μm in phase ii h2o2 concentrations after anaerobic periods were below 8 μm in the three sbrs data not shown these results indicated that h2o2 was mainly produced during the aerobic phases and the addition of magnetite enhanced its production it was reported that s onedensis mr 1 generated approximately 20 26 μm h2o2 under aerobic and anoxic oxic conditions 41 our results for sbr1 and sbr2 showed that more than twice h2o2 accumulation was detected compared to that reported previously abiotic h2o2 production was investigated by conducting a preliminary batch experiment under the same operating conditions as the sbr experiment the results showed that the abiotic production of h2o2 was smaller than 8 μm in the presence of 1 and 3 g l magnetite this indicates the accumulated h2o2 in sbrs was mainly microbially produced 3 2 advanced biological oxidation 3 2 1 oxidation reduction cycle of magnetite the reduction and oxidation of magnetite were then analyzed from the 15 19th cycles and from the 40 44th cycles during phases i and ii respectively originally magnetite consists of fe ii and fe iii in a molar ratio of 1 2 under the microbial metabolism effect of ferrous oxidizing bacteria and ferric reducing bacteria magnetite can be used as an electron donor and acceptor under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively these iron metabolizing microorganisms also have the ability to grow during the dissimilatory iron redox process 35 42 therefore it can be considered that the ratio of fe ii and fe iii in magnetite changes with the participation of different bacteria fig 5 shows that fe iii concentrations decreased and increased under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively and fe ii concentrations exhibited the opposite trend in sbr1 and sbr2 the amount of microbially produced fe ii was similar this indicates that a large amount of magnetite was not utilized by irb in sbr2 the total fe concentration in sbr0 decreased from 0 04 to 0 004 mm within these 10 cycles fig 5 a suggesting the occurrence of iron leaching almost no iron leaching was observed in sbr1 and sbr2 because their total fe concentrations were maintained within a certain range figs 5 b and 5 c indicating the modified anaerobic aerobic sbr with magnetite was feasible for long term operation the amount of microbially reduced fe iii under anaerobic conditions and oxidized fe ii under aerobic conditions in sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 were 0 1 0 04 2 7 0 2 and 2 9 0 9 mm and 0 1 0 03 2 6 0 4 and 2 8 0 9 mm respectively in sbr1 and sbr2 the reduction of fe iii during anaerobic periods was almost equivalent to the amount of oxidized fe ii during aerobic periods this indicates that the continuous use of magnetite for the biological fenton reaction was with great potential lovley and phillips 43 elucidated the potential of fe iii reduction to utilize the reducing equivalent and contribute to organic matter decomposition the stoichiometric relationship between microbial fe ii production and cod oxidation was then calculated as δ cod δ fe ii 6 72 mg cod mmol fe ii 43 44 these results explain the approximately 6 higher cod removal in sbr1 and sbr2 than that in sbr0 the magnetite and sludge complexes obtained from sbr1 and sbr2 after the 25th cycle was subjected to xrd analysis to further elucidate the structural integrity of magnetite fig 6 the characteristic peaks of these two samples were consistent with the standard card of magnetite jcpds card no 00 011 0614 this suggests that maximum magnetite was not converted into other types of iron oxides during the experimental operation 3 2 2 smx removal mechanisms to identify the enhanced smx removal in sbr1 and sbr2 was attributed to the biological fenton reaction the formation of ohs was detected fluorescence probes are effective for detecting ohs and providing temporal and spatial images apf as a selectable fluorescein can be used by neutrophils with high resistance to autoxidation images of the mixture of activated sludge and magnetite under aerobic conditions were captured under visible light irradiation and after fluorescent excitation were compared in fig 7 a 7 b and 7 c as shown in fig 7 b 2 and c 2 clear fluorescent emission was observed in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates implying the formation of ohs and the occurrence of biological fenton reaction the same observations were made for the activated sludge under anaerobic conditions whereas no clear fluorescent emissions were observed fig s3 this also explained that smx was mainly removed during aerobic periods in sbr1 and sbr2 magnetite catalyzed the oxidation of the microbially produced h2o2 and generated multiple ohs with strong potential to decompose smx during aerobic periods however extremely weak fluorescence was observed in the sbr0 sample under fluorescent irradiation fig 7 a 2 this may be due to the slight presence of iron compounds in the seed sludge which reacted with h2o2 fig 5 a fig 4 and produced a limited amount of ohs after the systems reached a steady state the production of h2o2 remained at a stable level during aerobic periods and the reduction of iron during anaerobic periods contributed to the continued occurrence of the biological fenton reaction this resulted in stable and enhanced smx removal in the sbrs containing magnetite the productions of ohs in sbr1 and sbr2 were supposed to be comparable since the fluorescence intensities observed in their matrixes of magnetite sludge aggregates were similar and almost identical smx removals were observed in sbr1 and sbr2 4 conclusions this study evaluated an anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr supplemented with magnetite for the enhanced treatment of antibiotic wastewater steady state levels were observed in the three sbrs under steady state conditions sbr0 sbr1 and sbr2 removed approximately 84 90 and 89 of cod respectively the microbial fe iii reduction resulted in approximately 6 higher cod removal in the sbrs with magnetite further experimental results elucidated that stable and enhanced removal of sulfamethoxazole smx was achieved under long term operation in sbrs containing magnetite with a final removal efficiency of more than 86 while it was only 46 in the sbr without magnetite it was interesting to observe significantly higher accumulation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in sbrs with magnetite alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions created continuous oxidation reduction cycle of magnetite and the microbially produced fe ii catalyzed the biological fenton reaction leading to the production of hydroxyl radicals ohs fluorescence observation results indicated the formation of ohs in the matrix of magnetite sludge aggregates this is considered the primary mechanism for the enhanced smx removal our results suggest that the proposed anaerobic aerobic sbr with magnetite has long term operation potential for enhanced treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics further studies are encouraged to investigate mechanisms and reaction kinetics with greater precision and applicability regarding practical implications in wastewater

12894,the present experimental study aimed to investigate the performance and characteristics of the dissolved oxygen in water aeration under the variations of the gap between the air nozzle and the outlet of new developed swirl flow type of the microbubble generator mbg the present experimental investigation the flow rates of both of air qg and the water ql were determined in the range of 0 1 0 8 l min and 20 50 l min respectively the shadow photographic technique was used to extract the results of a high speed camera of microbubbles images to find the bubbles size and their distribution the dynamic physical absorption model was used to measure the coefficient of the oxygen volumetric mass transfer kla the results show that the microbubbles size diameter average davg and peak pdf curve produced by the swirl mbg type was smaller and more uniform than that of produced by orifice mbg type next the characteristics of the microbubbles were investigated by the combinations of qg ql and the gap between the air nozzle and the outlet of the microbubble generator here it is noticed that the higher the gas flow rate the higher the average diameter of the bubble the higher the liquid flow rate the lower the average diameter of the bubble furthermore the ql increases with kla finally the empirical correlations to predict the kla davg and the log normal distribution of the bubble diameter were proposed keywords microbubble generator swirl flow dimensional analysis mean absolute percentage error 1 introduction in general the researchers have various opinions on the size of the microbubble here tabei et al 1 and sadatomi et al 2 defined that the diameter of microbubble is less than 100 μm furthermore budhijanto et al 3 and juwana et al 4 described that diameter of the microbubble is less than 200 μm moreover liu e al 5 addressed that the diameter ranges of 50 200 μm while temesgen et al 6 proposed the range of 1 100 μm as the microbubble the applications of the microbubbles can be found in the wastewater treatment 1 4 7 12 in the flotation technology the microbubbles with a diameter of 100 μm or less can be used to remove the pollutants such as colloids metal ions micro organisms proteins oil emulsions fine and very fine particles in water treatment 8 the microbubbles with a relatively larger diameter of 500 2000 μm can be used to lift the large particles in mineral flotation 13 15 there are three types of microbubble generator mbg depending on the method to produce the microbubbles the first method uses the principle of pressurized liquid flow here a spherical body in a tube mbg is used to decrease the pressure inside the mbg as patented by sadatomi sadatomi et al 2 16 used a spherical body and a porous pipe orifice in the water flow of a pipe to produce a high turbulent flow hence the pressure inside the mbg decreases until below the atmospheric pressure automatically the air flow is sucked of into the inside of mbg and produces the bubbles into smaller ones the suction force capacity positively correlates with the nozzle negative pressure 11 in this type the spherical body can be also substituted using the ventury to decrease the pressure inside the mbg as reported by fujiwara et al 12 the second type of the mbg uses the principle of the rotary liquid flow as proposed by li et al 14 here the tangential pressurized water is utilized to the conical container inside the mbg in order to increase the intensity of the turbulence hence the air can be drawn automatically and break the bubbles size into smaller ones the characteristics and mixing process mechanism of gas and water in the mbg swirl type was simulated using cfd by alam et al 21 22 the simulation shows that the negative pressure in the center axial of nozzle effectively inhale the gas automatically due to water rotating flow levitsky et al 17 reported that the main part of swirl type mbg is the vortex chamber to feed the water tangentially while gas is feeded radially moreover xu et al 18 reported the relationship between the self suction force and the nozzle diameter several methods in this category are the porous membrane type mbg 19 the electrolysis type mbg 20 and the porous mullet ceramic technique type mbg 21 finally the third method is the low power generation technique several methods in this category are the microchannel technique type mbg 22 and the ultrasonic system type mbg 23 30 31 the essential characteristics of the microbubble are high gas dilution low rising velocity and high interfacial area the most important description in determining the microbubbles properties is the bubbles size distribution 24 the smaller bubbles size will increase the interfacial of the gas liquid area and automatically the gas holds up and the bubble rise velocity increases and decreases respectively the other important parameter should be considered is the oxygen mass transfer coefficient whereas the aeration system of mbg uses the combination of the specific design and fluids flow rate to attain a high oxygen mass transfer coefficient 25 the experimental and simulation investigation show that the increase of re number will increase the impact force upon the bubbles and will decrease the diameter of the bubble and finally will add the retention time of bubbles in the water 26 the swirl type mbg is the most effective microbubble generator to produce the smaller the diameter of the microbubbles as reported by tabei et al 1 terasaka et al 27 xu et al 18 and kogawa et al 28 who developed the swirl type mbg by using vane guide flow here the gas and liquid are mixed inside the cone shape chamber and break up into the microbubbles next tabei et al 1 and parmar et al 29 developed the inlet tangential flow to mix the swirl liquid flow and gas inside the mixing chamber the above investigations present only the results quantitatively in terms of the graphs and tables without considering the possible correlations among the performance the variables of design and the variation of the involved fluids flow conditions to fill those gaps the objective of the present work is to investigate the performance of the swirl type mbg in the form of the probability diameter function pdf the mass transfer rate and proposes the performance correlations of the involved parameter through dimensional analysis it presents two key performances such as the specific measure of air inlet distance to mixing channel and the flow rates conditions the comparison study with the porous orifice type mbg will be also presented 2 experimental apparatus and procedure the schematic diagram of the apparatus used in the present experimental study is shown in fig 1 here the water was used as tested liquid and air at atmospheric pressure as the gas the test section was a glass walled tub with a thickness of 13 mm a length of 280 cm a width of 60 cm and filled with water with a height of 40 cm the mbg was placed 20 cm below the water surface the water was in closed circulation by using a centrifugal pump whereas the discharged water flow rate was varied by adjusting the pump rotation using a variable speed drive measured using a water rotameter the physical mechanism of the microbubbles generation in a swirl type of mbg is shown in fig 2 it consists of an inlet water channel swirling chamber a and mixing channel b as follows 1 water enters the tangential inlet channel which is located on the swirling chamber wall in order to form a swirling flow under this condition the ratio of the angular momentum flux to the axial momentum flux swirl number increases hence the turbulence intensity also increases significantly automatically the pressure at the center of the vortex decreases 2 a sudden contraction in the mixing channel will decrease the water pressure below the atmospheric pressure hence the air is sucked in automatically the two phases of air and water are mixed in the mixing channel which then becomes a bubbly flow and will be broken down due to sudden enlargement at the mbg outlet in the present experimental study the images of the bubbles were recorded using the shadow image technique the recorded images were located between the camera the diffuser screen and the light source the video camera with high speed phantom miro m310 was used the maximum resolution of 1200 800 was used to record the micro bubbles phenomena the frame speed was taken at a frame rate of 3000 fps the picture resolution and the frame speed used in this work enabled the behavior of the micro bubbles to be examined in detail the setting of the lens aperture and the focal length were 2 8 mm and 85 mm respectively the distance from the lens to the viewing area was 350 mm the field of measurement was 40 3 mm 85 mm here it was discover that the 1 pixel camera represents 89 55 μm in general the implementation of this method can be divided into two parts image recording with a digital camera and image processing using a developed source code in a commercial matlab software the ranges of liquid flow rate ql and gas flow rate qg were 20 50 l min and 0 1 0 8 l min respectively in the next section the detailed of the image processing technique used in the present study will be discussed fig 3 a shows the initial stage whereas the data in the form of bubble stream video were extracted into a single image of a bubbling stream the single image from the bubble flow was processed by filtering tuning using image processing fig 3 b shows a subtracted background of single image to eliminate the noise fig 3 c is the image result of threshold setting through the filtering algorithm fig 3 d shows the gray scale image of the converted image into a binary image through threshold setting bubble elements in the binary images are grouped into single bubbles solitary bubbles and grouped bubbles clustered bubbles on the basis of the shape factor of the bubbles which is known as the roundness factor ro fig 3 e shows an image of a grouped bubble with a ro value 1 fig 3 f is an image of a single bubble with a ro value 1 the grouped bubble image was then processed using a water shading algorithm in order to detect the boundary or watershed of every single bubble based on the pixel value hence it can be separated from bubbles groups fig 3 g is the example of the separated grouped bubble using the water shedding algorithm the grouped bubbles images were recombined into one frame with the single bubbles previously obtained the process of the recombined image measurement was carried out to obtain the form of the area of the bubble the bubble diameter and the centroid of the bubble fig 3 h shows the final stage of the image processing technique used in the present experimental study in which the measured bubble diameter was validated by matching the accuracy of the raw image in the form of a yellow circle with the existing bubble as performed also by juwana et al 4 the final part h shows the yellow circles as bubbles from extraction process of f the number of bubbles can be counted by counting of the yellow circles the processes were commissioned by using matlab software 2019b the calculation steps have commissioned also by juwana et al 4 the dissolved oxygen in the water was measured using a dissolved oxygen meter during the injection of the microbubble into the water measurement of the coefficient of volumetric mass transfer or saturation rate of oxygen in the liquid kla was carried out in clean water it was carried out on the basis of the two film theories lewis and whitman 1924 30 here the rate of mass transfer of oxygen to water can be determined using eq 1 1 dc dt k l a c s c t where kla is the coefficient of volumetric mass transfer or saturation rate of the oxygen in liquid which is determined from the slope of the graph obtained from the relationship of ln c s c 0 c s c t with respect to time t to cs is the saturated mass concentration of oxygen under equilibrium with the partial pressure of oxygen pi in the gas phase ct is the concentration of oxygen in the liquid at a certain time c o is the concentration of oxygen at t 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observation of bubble breakup mechanism on swirl mbg the visual observations of the bubble breakup under the flow condition of ql 30 l min and qg 0 1 l min is shown in fig 4 here ℓ was kept constant at 5 mm the bubble breakup occurs as a result of the interaction between the external stresses of the liquid phase to destroy the bubble and the surface tension of the liquid phase as reported also by huang et al 31 and the external stresses are influenced by swirl flow as shown in the fig 4 when the fluid flows through a suddenly enlarged cross section a sudden change decrease of the flow velocity occurs therefore the ligaments at the mbg outlet a were formed initially the bubbles break up are concentrated near wall mbg chamber that was agree with wang et al 32 here it is broken down in order to form a small bubble b due to the change of the pressure difference and those were separated by rotating flow initially under high water flow rates the bubbles bulk flow in vortex oscillate periodically and have unimodal size distribution on the other hand under low water flow rates the bubbles bulk flow have bimodal size distribution and non vortex flow 33 34 c after the bubbles breakup small bubbles move away from the rotating axis and the larger bubbles move closer to the axis of rotation the larger bubbles in the center of the axis of rotation will break up into the smaller bubbles and move away from the rotating axis finally all bubbles will flow away from the outlet of mbg 3 2 the effect of the fundamental parameters on the bubble size the image processing technique described above provides the information on the microbubble size distribution in the present manuscript the bubble size data are plotted as a probability distribution function to show the proportionate frequency of each microbubble diameter in the population each set arrangement of air and water flow rates with different air nozzle gaps produce certain characteristics in the bubble size distribution pattern therefore it is important to analyse how qg and ql influence the characteristics of the bubble diameter distribution function under various ℓ fig 5 shows the effect of ql on the probability distribution function pdf of the bubble size in the present experimental study the ql were varied 3 from 0 to 50 l min whereas qg and ℓ were kept constant at 0 1 l min and 1 mm respectively close observation of fig 5 it is revealed that the larger the ql the smaller the average diameter of microbubbles and larger probability of peak microbubbles size greater kurtosis and smaller skewness fig 5 also shows that the greater ql the greater the microbubbles cumulative number diameter less than 1000 μm fig 6 shows the effect of qg on the pdf of the microbubble diameter here the qg were varied from 0 2 l min to 0 6 l min whereas ql and ℓ were kept constant at 40 l min and 1 mm respectively from fig 6 it is noticed that the smaller the qg slightly resulting in the smaller average microbubbles size diameter fig 6 also shows that the smaller the qg the greater the microbubbles cumulative number diameter less than 1000 μm fig 7 shows the effect of ℓ on the pdf of the microbubble diameter in the present experimental study the ℓ were varied 1 5 and 10 mm respectively moreover the ql and qg were kept constant at 50 l min and 0 1 l min respectively fig 7 shows that the smaller the ℓ the smaller the average microbubbles diameter next the smaller the ℓ the greater the microbubbles cumulative number after recognizing the previous characteristics of the swirl mbg then a benchmark investigation was examined in comparison with the orifice porous mbg type as reported by juwana et al 4 here the dimension of the section test the ql and qg are the same the results are shown in fig 8 close investigation of the figure reveals that the swirl mbg type produces the smaller micro bubbles size and a higher probability peak of a smaller bubble diameter all of those probabilities distribution function properties were represented by the parameter of kurtosis and skewness the swirl type mbg results slimmer and higher probability distribution function curve addressed higher kurtosis than that of the orifice porous type mbg and less skewness this means that fewer microbubbles size that away from central bubbles size measurement 3 3 the buckingham s pi theorem of dimensional analysis further investigations were examined on the parameters that affect the average bubble diameter through dimensional analysis based on the observed trend of the experimental observations the general function of the average bubble diameter db can be expressed as eq 2 2 d b f u g u l d o d g d a d ch ω μ l ρ l σ l ρ g ℓ l from the theorem of buckingham s pi there are eleven possible dimensionless pi parameters ℿ variables ul do and l were selected as repeating variables as shown in table 1 the empirical correlation of the non dimensional group for db can be arranged as eq 3 3 d b d o a u l 2 ρ l d l σ l b u g u l c ω d l v out d l l e d g d l f ρ g ρ l g d l d ch h d g d ch i d ch d o j d o d l k where a b c d e f g h i j and k are the coefficients it is noticed that the water flow rate ql air flow rate qg fluid flow velocity ratio γ and water weber number w e are formulated as eqs 4 7 4 q g 4 u g π d o 2 5 q l 4 u l π d l 2 6 w e l u l 2 ρ l d l σ l 7 γ ω d l v out by substituting eqs 4 7 in eq 3 yields 8 d b d o a w e l b q g q l c γ d l l e d g d l f ρ g ρ l g d l d ch h d g d ch i d ch d o j d o d l k in the present study the variables of dl dg ρl ρg dch and do were not varied therefore d g d l constant ρ g ρ l constant d l d ch constant d g d ch constant d ch d o constant and d o d l constant the eq 8 can be simplified as 9 d b d o a w e l b q g q l c γ d l l e the values of a b c d and e were calculated by adjusting the experimental observations to find an empirical correlation to predict the average bubble diameter finally the equation can be defined as eq 10 10 d b d o 0 031 w e l 0 015 q g q l 0 082 γ 0 015 ℓ l 0 014 the eq 10 is then compared to the experimental and the result is shown in fig 9 in the figure the thick straight line is calculated from eq 10 while the dots marks represent the experimental data the plot confirms that all the experimental data were below the 7 error around the calculated a similar plot was also commissioned in orifice type mbg 4 that has an error of less than 20 this lesser value means that the swirl type results in smaller bubbles size variations further quantitative analysis was carried out in the form of measuring the mean absolute percentage error mape as formulated in eq 11 11 mape 1 n i 1 n x corr i x exp i x exp i 100 where xcorr i is the ratio of db and bubble outlet diameter obtained from eq 10 xexp i is the ratio of the db and bubble outlet diameter found by image processing techniques and n represents the number of observations the mape calculation result of 2 16 means that the suggested equation can predict the average bubble diameter accurately the corresponding orifice type mape calculation results in 5 83 4 the physical explanation of eq 10 can be addressed as follows a from the value of the power equation it is noticed that the effect of weber s number representing the surface tension is weak b the most dominant factor is the ratio of qg and q whereas db has proportionality with qg but in opposite to the ql c in order to produce the microbubbles with smaller diameters it is necessary to decrease the axial flow velocity and increase the angular velocity ω this fact agrees well with that of the experiment conducted by tabei et al 1 they reported that the higher swirl flow intensity causes the increase of the liquid turbulence and surpasses the surface tension thus producing bubbles with a small diameter due to the breakup event d the gap ℓ affects db the bigger the gap the bigger the db and vice versa in some utilizations it is important to predict the microbubbles mean diameter along with their distribution the bubble diameter distribution is then correlated with the qg and ql of the mbg here a log normal distribution with two parameters defined in the following equation is chosen 12 p x 1 xs 2 π e lnx m 2 2 s 2 where p x is the density probability of x x is the bubble diameter s m are the parameters obtained from the experimental results moreover m and s are the functions of liquid flow rate ql gas flow rate qg fluid flow velocity ratio γ and liquid weber number wel furthermore the parameters m and s can be defined as follows 13 m s a w e l b q g q l c γ d ℓ l e from the dimensionless equation of the average bubble diameter the parameter correlation in the log normal distribution is determined from eq 14 and their results are tabulated in table 2 14 m s a w e l b q g q l c γ d ℓ l e eq 12 is identical to the equation by gordiychuk et al 24 with the coefficient values presented in table 2 fig 10 shows the approach of the log normal of the corresponding experimental data from the above discussion it was noticed that the dominant variable in this type of mbg is the fluid velocity ratio γ therefore it is important to emphasize here that to get the smaller bubble size in the swirl type mbg the angular velocity plays an important role from the obtained constant value it can be concluded that the main variable has a significant impact on the distribution of bubbles if γ increases then the bubble distribution tends to have a smaller diameter due to the negative value of the constant d the liquid flow rate is directly proportional to the possibility of the bubbles with smaller sizes due to the positive value of c 3 4 the effect of ql qg and ℓ on the kla of oxygen in the water the important indicator to evaluate the performance of mbg is the oxygen mass transfer rate the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen in mbg is represented by kla the calculation of kla is based on the time course of the dissolved oxygen do in water when the microbubble is injected into water mena et al 35 reported that the change of the dissolved oxygen in water as a function of time can be divided into three zones the first zone is the zone of the constant value of do the second zone is the zone where the do value changes rapidly the third zone is the constant do zone again whereas in this zone the do in water reaches the saturation condition in the present work the calculation of the mass transfer coefficient is carried out in the second zone where the relationship between cs ct and time is linear in general the kla value is affected by the temperature during the measurement for this reason a correction of the mass transfer coefficient value is taken at a temperature t 20 c using the following formula tchobanoglous et al 36 37 15 k l a 20 k l a 1 024 20 t c where t is the temperature at the time of measurement fig 11 a shows the relationship between kla with qg and ql under the conditions of the transmit distance of 120 cm from the mbg outlet at 1 mm fig 11 b present the relationship of kla at various with ℓ fig 11 a shows that the increases of ql will increase the kla it is possible due to the the smaller generated microbubble diameter as explained in fig 5 a the decrease of microbubble diameter under a constant qg increases the surface contact between the liquid and the bubble significantly moreover the increase of ql also increases the distance of bubble infiltration therefore the bubble contact life time also increases fig 11 b shows that under a constant of qg the increase of ℓ will decrease the kla it can be explained that the increase of ℓ will increase of the generated microbubbles diameter automatically will decrease the surface contact area between gas and liquid 3 5 dimensional analysis on volumetric mass transfer the variables that affect the mass transfer coefficient and the volumetric mass transfer coefficient can be seen in table 3 whereas the functional relationship between parameters can be expressed in eq 16 as follows 16 k l a 20 d o 2 d l a u l 2 ρ l d l σ l b u g u l c ω d l v out d ℓ l e d g d l f ρ g ρ l g d l d ch h d g d ch i d ch d o j d o d l k p d o l in the present experimental study the variables of do dch dl dg dch ρl and ρg were not varied therefore eq 16 can be simplified into 17 k l a 20 d o 2 d l a u l 2 ρ l d l σ l b u g u l c ω d l v out d ℓ l e p d o l by trial and error we obtained eq 18 to predict the coefficient of volumetric mass transfer 18 k l a 20 d o 2 d u 0 001 w e l 0 474 q g q l 0 223 γ 5 651 ℓ l 0 202 p d o 0 738 from eq 18 the influence of the involved parameters on the kla can be summarized as follows a the increase of the surface tension will decrease the kla slightly here kukizaki et al 38 and juwana et al 4 reported that the bubble diameter increases with the surface tension hence the contact area per unit volume between the bubbles and the liquid decreases in eq 10 it is found that surface tension has no significant effect on the davg therefore has also a relatively small effect on kla as can be deduced from eq 18 b the ratio of the flow velocity ratio has a positive correlation on the kla whereas the increase of the turbulence intensity and tangential velocity will increase the kla significantly as a consequence the turbulence intensity affects the kla park et al 39 and juwana et al 4 reported that the resistance to mass transfer at the interface decreases due to the increase of the turbulence and the smaller bubbles generated by the swirling flow increasing the contact area of air bubbles with water c the gap between the air nozzle and the outlet of the mbg ℓ has an effect on kla whereas the bigger the ℓ the bigger the average bubble diameter and vice versa d the kla increases with increase of the mass diffusivity of gas to liquid 40 and juwana et al 4 reported that the mass transfer coefficient of the liquid side kl has a positive correlation to the mass diffusivity it is reported that kl is proportional to diffusivity with strengths in the range of 0 5 for the penetration theory and 1 0 for the film model 41 those facts means that kla increases with diffusivity due to the increase of the kl fig 12 shows the comparison between the experimental data and eq 18 as seen in fig 12 the eq 18 estimates kla with the accuracy of 30 without clear systematic error moreover the present correlation improves the performance of the previous correlation available in open literatures 4 conclusion the characteristics of the generated microbubbles from the developed swirl type mbg was carried out experimentally by using the air and water as the working fluids it was observed that the qg and ql as well as geometric shape ℓ play an important role on the performance of the developed swirl type mbg the results are summarized as follows a the probability distribution of the resulting bubble size davg and kla are the main parameters demonstrating the performance of the swirl type bubble generator which is highly dependent on the flow conditions qg and ql and the gap of the air nozzle to the mbg outlet ℓ ql and ℓ are the two most important factors in producing the expected bubble size b increasing qg will increase davg and decrease the kla as well as the probability value of the bubble diameter distribution on the contrary the increase of the ql will decrease and increase the davg and kla respectively it will increase the probability value of the bubble diameter distribution moreover ℓ of 1 mm produces a smaller and more uniform size bubble diameters than the other ℓ c compared to the orifice porous tube type mbg the probability graph of the bubble distribution on the swirl type mbg is narrower skewed to the left towards a smaller bubbles diameter and higher peak probability d the essential mechanism of microbubbles formation in the swirl type mbg is resulted from a rotation movement and sudden enlargement of bubbling flow the smaller size of the breakup bubbles tends to move outside of the swirl flow and the bigger size tends to flow in the center it makes a coalescence while rotating and axially moving away moreover further investigation of the breakup and coalescence mechanism is required for more understanding improvement swirl

12894,the present experimental study aimed to investigate the performance and characteristics of the dissolved oxygen in water aeration under the variations of the gap between the air nozzle and the outlet of new developed swirl flow type of the microbubble generator mbg the present experimental investigation the flow rates of both of air qg and the water ql were determined in the range of 0 1 0 8 l min and 20 50 l min respectively the shadow photographic technique was used to extract the results of a high speed camera of microbubbles images to find the bubbles size and their distribution the dynamic physical absorption model was used to measure the coefficient of the oxygen volumetric mass transfer kla the results show that the microbubbles size diameter average davg and peak pdf curve produced by the swirl mbg type was smaller and more uniform than that of produced by orifice mbg type next the characteristics of the microbubbles were investigated by the combinations of qg ql and the gap between the air nozzle and the outlet of the microbubble generator here it is noticed that the higher the gas flow rate the higher the average diameter of the bubble the higher the liquid flow rate the lower the average diameter of the bubble furthermore the ql increases with kla finally the empirical correlations to predict the kla davg and the log normal distribution of the bubble diameter were proposed keywords microbubble generator swirl flow dimensional analysis mean absolute percentage error 1 introduction in general the researchers have various opinions on the size of the microbubble here tabei et al 1 and sadatomi et al 2 defined that the diameter of microbubble is less than 100 μm furthermore budhijanto et al 3 and juwana et al 4 described that diameter of the microbubble is less than 200 μm moreover liu e al 5 addressed that the diameter ranges of 50 200 μm while temesgen et al 6 proposed the range of 1 100 μm as the microbubble the applications of the microbubbles can be found in the wastewater treatment 1 4 7 12 in the flotation technology the microbubbles with a diameter of 100 μm or less can be used to remove the pollutants such as colloids metal ions micro organisms proteins oil emulsions fine and very fine particles in water treatment 8 the microbubbles with a relatively larger diameter of 500 2000 μm can be used to lift the large particles in mineral flotation 13 15 there are three types of microbubble generator mbg depending on the method to produce the microbubbles the first method uses the principle of pressurized liquid flow here a spherical body in a tube mbg is used to decrease the pressure inside the mbg as patented by sadatomi sadatomi et al 2 16 used a spherical body and a porous pipe orifice in the water flow of a pipe to produce a high turbulent flow hence the pressure inside the mbg decreases until below the atmospheric pressure automatically the air flow is sucked of into the inside of mbg and produces the bubbles into smaller ones the suction force capacity positively correlates with the nozzle negative pressure 11 in this type the spherical body can be also substituted using the ventury to decrease the pressure inside the mbg as reported by fujiwara et al 12 the second type of the mbg uses the principle of the rotary liquid flow as proposed by li et al 14 here the tangential pressurized water is utilized to the conical container inside the mbg in order to increase the intensity of the turbulence hence the air can be drawn automatically and break the bubbles size into smaller ones the characteristics and mixing process mechanism of gas and water in the mbg swirl type was simulated using cfd by alam et al 21 22 the simulation shows that the negative pressure in the center axial of nozzle effectively inhale the gas automatically due to water rotating flow levitsky et al 17 reported that the main part of swirl type mbg is the vortex chamber to feed the water tangentially while gas is feeded radially moreover xu et al 18 reported the relationship between the self suction force and the nozzle diameter several methods in this category are the porous membrane type mbg 19 the electrolysis type mbg 20 and the porous mullet ceramic technique type mbg 21 finally the third method is the low power generation technique several methods in this category are the microchannel technique type mbg 22 and the ultrasonic system type mbg 23 30 31 the essential characteristics of the microbubble are high gas dilution low rising velocity and high interfacial area the most important description in determining the microbubbles properties is the bubbles size distribution 24 the smaller bubbles size will increase the interfacial of the gas liquid area and automatically the gas holds up and the bubble rise velocity increases and decreases respectively the other important parameter should be considered is the oxygen mass transfer coefficient whereas the aeration system of mbg uses the combination of the specific design and fluids flow rate to attain a high oxygen mass transfer coefficient 25 the experimental and simulation investigation show that the increase of re number will increase the impact force upon the bubbles and will decrease the diameter of the bubble and finally will add the retention time of bubbles in the water 26 the swirl type mbg is the most effective microbubble generator to produce the smaller the diameter of the microbubbles as reported by tabei et al 1 terasaka et al 27 xu et al 18 and kogawa et al 28 who developed the swirl type mbg by using vane guide flow here the gas and liquid are mixed inside the cone shape chamber and break up into the microbubbles next tabei et al 1 and parmar et al 29 developed the inlet tangential flow to mix the swirl liquid flow and gas inside the mixing chamber the above investigations present only the results quantitatively in terms of the graphs and tables without considering the possible correlations among the performance the variables of design and the variation of the involved fluids flow conditions to fill those gaps the objective of the present work is to investigate the performance of the swirl type mbg in the form of the probability diameter function pdf the mass transfer rate and proposes the performance correlations of the involved parameter through dimensional analysis it presents two key performances such as the specific measure of air inlet distance to mixing channel and the flow rates conditions the comparison study with the porous orifice type mbg will be also presented 2 experimental apparatus and procedure the schematic diagram of the apparatus used in the present experimental study is shown in fig 1 here the water was used as tested liquid and air at atmospheric pressure as the gas the test section was a glass walled tub with a thickness of 13 mm a length of 280 cm a width of 60 cm and filled with water with a height of 40 cm the mbg was placed 20 cm below the water surface the water was in closed circulation by using a centrifugal pump whereas the discharged water flow rate was varied by adjusting the pump rotation using a variable speed drive measured using a water rotameter the physical mechanism of the microbubbles generation in a swirl type of mbg is shown in fig 2 it consists of an inlet water channel swirling chamber a and mixing channel b as follows 1 water enters the tangential inlet channel which is located on the swirling chamber wall in order to form a swirling flow under this condition the ratio of the angular momentum flux to the axial momentum flux swirl number increases hence the turbulence intensity also increases significantly automatically the pressure at the center of the vortex decreases 2 a sudden contraction in the mixing channel will decrease the water pressure below the atmospheric pressure hence the air is sucked in automatically the two phases of air and water are mixed in the mixing channel which then becomes a bubbly flow and will be broken down due to sudden enlargement at the mbg outlet in the present experimental study the images of the bubbles were recorded using the shadow image technique the recorded images were located between the camera the diffuser screen and the light source the video camera with high speed phantom miro m310 was used the maximum resolution of 1200 800 was used to record the micro bubbles phenomena the frame speed was taken at a frame rate of 3000 fps the picture resolution and the frame speed used in this work enabled the behavior of the micro bubbles to be examined in detail the setting of the lens aperture and the focal length were 2 8 mm and 85 mm respectively the distance from the lens to the viewing area was 350 mm the field of measurement was 40 3 mm 85 mm here it was discover that the 1 pixel camera represents 89 55 μm in general the implementation of this method can be divided into two parts image recording with a digital camera and image processing using a developed source code in a commercial matlab software the ranges of liquid flow rate ql and gas flow rate qg were 20 50 l min and 0 1 0 8 l min respectively in the next section the detailed of the image processing technique used in the present study will be discussed fig 3 a shows the initial stage whereas the data in the form of bubble stream video were extracted into a single image of a bubbling stream the single image from the bubble flow was processed by filtering tuning using image processing fig 3 b shows a subtracted background of single image to eliminate the noise fig 3 c is the image result of threshold setting through the filtering algorithm fig 3 d shows the gray scale image of the converted image into a binary image through threshold setting bubble elements in the binary images are grouped into single bubbles solitary bubbles and grouped bubbles clustered bubbles on the basis of the shape factor of the bubbles which is known as the roundness factor ro fig 3 e shows an image of a grouped bubble with a ro value 1 fig 3 f is an image of a single bubble with a ro value 1 the grouped bubble image was then processed using a water shading algorithm in order to detect the boundary or watershed of every single bubble based on the pixel value hence it can be separated from bubbles groups fig 3 g is the example of the separated grouped bubble using the water shedding algorithm the grouped bubbles images were recombined into one frame with the single bubbles previously obtained the process of the recombined image measurement was carried out to obtain the form of the area of the bubble the bubble diameter and the centroid of the bubble fig 3 h shows the final stage of the image processing technique used in the present experimental study in which the measured bubble diameter was validated by matching the accuracy of the raw image in the form of a yellow circle with the existing bubble as performed also by juwana et al 4 the final part h shows the yellow circles as bubbles from extraction process of f the number of bubbles can be counted by counting of the yellow circles the processes were commissioned by using matlab software 2019b the calculation steps have commissioned also by juwana et al 4 the dissolved oxygen in the water was measured using a dissolved oxygen meter during the injection of the microbubble into the water measurement of the coefficient of volumetric mass transfer or saturation rate of oxygen in the liquid kla was carried out in clean water it was carried out on the basis of the two film theories lewis and whitman 1924 30 here the rate of mass transfer of oxygen to water can be determined using eq 1 1 dc dt k l a c s c t where kla is the coefficient of volumetric mass transfer or saturation rate of the oxygen in liquid which is determined from the slope of the graph obtained from the relationship of ln c s c 0 c s c t with respect to time t to cs is the saturated mass concentration of oxygen under equilibrium with the partial pressure of oxygen pi in the gas phase ct is the concentration of oxygen in the liquid at a certain time c o is the concentration of oxygen at t 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observation of bubble breakup mechanism on swirl mbg the visual observations of the bubble breakup under the flow condition of ql 30 l min and qg 0 1 l min is shown in fig 4 here ℓ was kept constant at 5 mm the bubble breakup occurs as a result of the interaction between the external stresses of the liquid phase to destroy the bubble and the surface tension of the liquid phase as reported also by huang et al 31 and the external stresses are influenced by swirl flow as shown in the fig 4 when the fluid flows through a suddenly enlarged cross section a sudden change decrease of the flow velocity occurs therefore the ligaments at the mbg outlet a were formed initially the bubbles break up are concentrated near wall mbg chamber that was agree with wang et al 32 here it is broken down in order to form a small bubble b due to the change of the pressure difference and those were separated by rotating flow initially under high water flow rates the bubbles bulk flow in vortex oscillate periodically and have unimodal size distribution on the other hand under low water flow rates the bubbles bulk flow have bimodal size distribution and non vortex flow 33 34 c after the bubbles breakup small bubbles move away from the rotating axis and the larger bubbles move closer to the axis of rotation the larger bubbles in the center of the axis of rotation will break up into the smaller bubbles and move away from the rotating axis finally all bubbles will flow away from the outlet of mbg 3 2 the effect of the fundamental parameters on the bubble size the image processing technique described above provides the information on the microbubble size distribution in the present manuscript the bubble size data are plotted as a probability distribution function to show the proportionate frequency of each microbubble diameter in the population each set arrangement of air and water flow rates with different air nozzle gaps produce certain characteristics in the bubble size distribution pattern therefore it is important to analyse how qg and ql influence the characteristics of the bubble diameter distribution function under various ℓ fig 5 shows the effect of ql on the probability distribution function pdf of the bubble size in the present experimental study the ql were varied 3 from 0 to 50 l min whereas qg and ℓ were kept constant at 0 1 l min and 1 mm respectively close observation of fig 5 it is revealed that the larger the ql the smaller the average diameter of microbubbles and larger probability of peak microbubbles size greater kurtosis and smaller skewness fig 5 also shows that the greater ql the greater the microbubbles cumulative number diameter less than 1000 μm fig 6 shows the effect of qg on the pdf of the microbubble diameter here the qg were varied from 0 2 l min to 0 6 l min whereas ql and ℓ were kept constant at 40 l min and 1 mm respectively from fig 6 it is noticed that the smaller the qg slightly resulting in the smaller average microbubbles size diameter fig 6 also shows that the smaller the qg the greater the microbubbles cumulative number diameter less than 1000 μm fig 7 shows the effect of ℓ on the pdf of the microbubble diameter in the present experimental study the ℓ were varied 1 5 and 10 mm respectively moreover the ql and qg were kept constant at 50 l min and 0 1 l min respectively fig 7 shows that the smaller the ℓ the smaller the average microbubbles diameter next the smaller the ℓ the greater the microbubbles cumulative number after recognizing the previous characteristics of the swirl mbg then a benchmark investigation was examined in comparison with the orifice porous mbg type as reported by juwana et al 4 here the dimension of the section test the ql and qg are the same the results are shown in fig 8 close investigation of the figure reveals that the swirl mbg type produces the smaller micro bubbles size and a higher probability peak of a smaller bubble diameter all of those probabilities distribution function properties were represented by the parameter of kurtosis and skewness the swirl type mbg results slimmer and higher probability distribution function curve addressed higher kurtosis than that of the orifice porous type mbg and less skewness this means that fewer microbubbles size that away from central bubbles size measurement 3 3 the buckingham s pi theorem of dimensional analysis further investigations were examined on the parameters that affect the average bubble diameter through dimensional analysis based on the observed trend of the experimental observations the general function of the average bubble diameter db can be expressed as eq 2 2 d b f u g u l d o d g d a d ch ω μ l ρ l σ l ρ g ℓ l from the theorem of buckingham s pi there are eleven possible dimensionless pi parameters ℿ variables ul do and l were selected as repeating variables as shown in table 1 the empirical correlation of the non dimensional group for db can be arranged as eq 3 3 d b d o a u l 2 ρ l d l σ l b u g u l c ω d l v out d l l e d g d l f ρ g ρ l g d l d ch h d g d ch i d ch d o j d o d l k where a b c d e f g h i j and k are the coefficients it is noticed that the water flow rate ql air flow rate qg fluid flow velocity ratio γ and water weber number w e are formulated as eqs 4 7 4 q g 4 u g π d o 2 5 q l 4 u l π d l 2 6 w e l u l 2 ρ l d l σ l 7 γ ω d l v out by substituting eqs 4 7 in eq 3 yields 8 d b d o a w e l b q g q l c γ d l l e d g d l f ρ g ρ l g d l d ch h d g d ch i d ch d o j d o d l k in the present study the variables of dl dg ρl ρg dch and do were not varied therefore d g d l constant ρ g ρ l constant d l d ch constant d g d ch constant d ch d o constant and d o d l constant the eq 8 can be simplified as 9 d b d o a w e l b q g q l c γ d l l e the values of a b c d and e were calculated by adjusting the experimental observations to find an empirical correlation to predict the average bubble diameter finally the equation can be defined as eq 10 10 d b d o 0 031 w e l 0 015 q g q l 0 082 γ 0 015 ℓ l 0 014 the eq 10 is then compared to the experimental and the result is shown in fig 9 in the figure the thick straight line is calculated from eq 10 while the dots marks represent the experimental data the plot confirms that all the experimental data were below the 7 error around the calculated a similar plot was also commissioned in orifice type mbg 4 that has an error of less than 20 this lesser value means that the swirl type results in smaller bubbles size variations further quantitative analysis was carried out in the form of measuring the mean absolute percentage error mape as formulated in eq 11 11 mape 1 n i 1 n x corr i x exp i x exp i 100 where xcorr i is the ratio of db and bubble outlet diameter obtained from eq 10 xexp i is the ratio of the db and bubble outlet diameter found by image processing techniques and n represents the number of observations the mape calculation result of 2 16 means that the suggested equation can predict the average bubble diameter accurately the corresponding orifice type mape calculation results in 5 83 4 the physical explanation of eq 10 can be addressed as follows a from the value of the power equation it is noticed that the effect of weber s number representing the surface tension is weak b the most dominant factor is the ratio of qg and q whereas db has proportionality with qg but in opposite to the ql c in order to produce the microbubbles with smaller diameters it is necessary to decrease the axial flow velocity and increase the angular velocity ω this fact agrees well with that of the experiment conducted by tabei et al 1 they reported that the higher swirl flow intensity causes the increase of the liquid turbulence and surpasses the surface tension thus producing bubbles with a small diameter due to the breakup event d the gap ℓ affects db the bigger the gap the bigger the db and vice versa in some utilizations it is important to predict the microbubbles mean diameter along with their distribution the bubble diameter distribution is then correlated with the qg and ql of the mbg here a log normal distribution with two parameters defined in the following equation is chosen 12 p x 1 xs 2 π e lnx m 2 2 s 2 where p x is the density probability of x x is the bubble diameter s m are the parameters obtained from the experimental results moreover m and s are the functions of liquid flow rate ql gas flow rate qg fluid flow velocity ratio γ and liquid weber number wel furthermore the parameters m and s can be defined as follows 13 m s a w e l b q g q l c γ d ℓ l e from the dimensionless equation of the average bubble diameter the parameter correlation in the log normal distribution is determined from eq 14 and their results are tabulated in table 2 14 m s a w e l b q g q l c γ d ℓ l e eq 12 is identical to the equation by gordiychuk et al 24 with the coefficient values presented in table 2 fig 10 shows the approach of the log normal of the corresponding experimental data from the above discussion it was noticed that the dominant variable in this type of mbg is the fluid velocity ratio γ therefore it is important to emphasize here that to get the smaller bubble size in the swirl type mbg the angular velocity plays an important role from the obtained constant value it can be concluded that the main variable has a significant impact on the distribution of bubbles if γ increases then the bubble distribution tends to have a smaller diameter due to the negative value of the constant d the liquid flow rate is directly proportional to the possibility of the bubbles with smaller sizes due to the positive value of c 3 4 the effect of ql qg and ℓ on the kla of oxygen in the water the important indicator to evaluate the performance of mbg is the oxygen mass transfer rate the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen in mbg is represented by kla the calculation of kla is based on the time course of the dissolved oxygen do in water when the microbubble is injected into water mena et al 35 reported that the change of the dissolved oxygen in

where the relationship between cs ct and time is linear in general the kla value is affected by the temperature during the measurement for this reason a correction of the mass transfer coefficient value is taken at a temperature t 20 c using the following formula tchobanoglous et al 36 37 15 k l a 20 k l a 1 024 20 t c where t is the temperature at the time of measurement fig 11 a shows the relationship between kla with qg and ql under the conditions of the transmit distance of 120 cm from the mbg outlet at 1 mm fig 11 b present the relationship of kla at various with ℓ fig 11 a shows that the increases of ql will increase the kla it is possible due to the the smaller generated microbubble diameter as explained in fig 5 a the decrease of microbubble diameter under a constant qg increases the surface contact between the liquid and the bubble significantly moreover the increase of ql also increases the distance of bubble infiltration therefore the bubble contact life time also increases fig 11 b shows that under a constant of qg the increase of ℓ will decrease the kla it can be explained that the increase of ℓ will increase of the generated microbubbles diameter automatically will decrease the surface contact area between gas and liquid 3 5 dimensional analysis on volumetric mass transfer the variables that affect the mass transfer coefficient and the

mass transfer coefficient of the liquid side kl has a positive correlation to the mass diffusivity it is reported that kl is proportional to diffusivity with strengths in the range of 0 5 for the penetration theory and 1 0 for the film model 41 those facts means that kla increases with diffusivity due to the increase of the kl fig 12 shows the comparison between the experimental data and eq 18 as seen in fig 12 the eq 18 estimates kla with the accuracy of 30 without clear systematic error moreover the present correlation improves the performance of the previous correlation available in open literatures 4 conclusion the characteristics of the generated microbubbles from the developed swirl type mbg was carried out experimentally by using the air and water as the working fluids it was observed that the qg and ql as well as geometric shape ℓ play an important role on the performance of the developed swirl type mbg the results are summarized as follows a the probability distribution of the resulting bubble size davg and kla are the main parameters demonstrating the performance of the swirl type bubble generator which is highly dependent on the flow conditions qg and ql and the gap of the air nozzle to the mbg outlet ℓ ql and ℓ are the two most important factors in producing the expected bubble size b increasing qg will increase davg and decrease the kla as well as the probability value of the bubble diameter distribution on the contrary the increase of the ql will decrease and increase the davg and kla respectively it will increase the probability value of the bubble diameter distribution moreover ℓ of 1 mm produces a smaller and more uniform size bubble diameters than the other ℓ c compared to the orifice porous tube type mbg the probability graph of the bubble distribution on the swirl type mbg is narrower skewed to the left towards a smaller bubbles diameter and higher peak probability d the essential mechanism of microbubbles formation in the swirl type mbg is resulted from a rotation movement and sudden enlargement of bubbling flow the smaller size of the breakup bubbles tends to move outside of the swirl flow and the bigger size tends to flow in the center it makes a coalescence while rotating and axially moving away moreover further investigation of the breakup and coalescence mechanism is required for more understanding improvement swirl type mbg design declaration of competing interest the paper does not contain the conflict of interest with any other parties and it is purely academic research acknowledgments this work was carried
