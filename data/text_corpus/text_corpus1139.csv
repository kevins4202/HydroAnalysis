5695,in this study the possible changes in microbial communities after the occurrence of an earthquake were investigated to this end the effects of the 2016 gyeongju earthquake ml 5 8 on the microbial communities in nearby aquifers were analyzed together with associated hydrochemistry data fourteen water samples were collected from two types of wells alluvial and fractured rock formation hydrogeochemical parameters groundwater level radon concentration strontium isotopes and microbiological features were monitored the results obtained for microbial compositions and special bacteria were consistent with the hydrochemical results distinctive microbial communities in groundwater samples taken adjacent to the earthquake epicenter were also observed the predominant bacteria in most samples were pseudomonas and flavobacterium radon concentrations helium isotopes and the helium neon ratio showed anomalies in one well kw8 compared to microbial composition data strontium data indicated that the study site may have been affected by seawater intrusion this was corroborated by the microbiological features of archaea the results indicate that an earthquake can change the number of species or their abundance in groundwater ecosystems therefore microbial features might be a good additional indicator for analyzing the effects of earthquakes on groundwater together with major chemical parameters such as radon strontium and helium the microbiological features indicate that levels of bacteria such as pseudomonas and flavobacterium in the groundwater were highly correlated with the gyeongju earthquake and the associated hydrochemical data keywords earthquake microbiological features of aquifer bacteria archaea groundwater ecosystem 1 introduction recently hydrologists have been studying the mechanisms of hydrogeological changes induced by large scale earthquakes around the world cox et al 2012 kaown et al 2019 petitta et al 2018 rojstaczer et al 1995 sibson 1981 owing to the increasing importance of groundwater fluctuations caused by earthquakes many previous studies have analyzed the hydrogeological characteristics of these groundwater level fluctuations chia et al 2001 king et al 1999 lee and woo 2012 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2004 in general the groundwater level fluctuations caused by earthquakes are significantly affected by hydrogeological factors such as the distance between the epicenter and the monitoring well and the shapes of faults and the aquifer chia et al 2001 2008 king et al 2000 previous research on groundwater level fluctuations due to earthquakes includes many reports on coseismic and postseismic groundwater level fluctuations chia et al 2008 jeon et al 2011 ohno et al 2006 wang et al 2004 wang and chia 2008 there are also precedent studies on the changes in groundwater quality following earthquakes onda et al 2018 sato et al 1995 schuessler et al 2016 takamura and kono 1996 tsunogai and wakita 1995 analyzed the ion concentrations in a groundwater well near the epicenter of the kobe earthquake mjma 7 2 january 1995 according to their study the concentrations of chlorides and sulfates increased steadily for several months before the earthquake and became much higher after it galassi et al 2014 found a significant change in the hydrochemistry of the surrounding aquifer after the mw 6 3 earthquake in l aquila italy in april 2009 these two studies show that the groundwater quality reflects the pre and post earthquake conditions respectively as well as the necessity of continuous monitoring of groundwater quality in areas where earthquakes are forecast kaown et al 2019 used various environmental tracer data noble gas δ18o δd 3h and 13c to investigate the hydrochemical changes in aquifers attributable to a local magnitude ml 5 8 earthquake and associated earthquakes in gyeongju korea in 2016 cluster analysis was conducted using the chemical data and hydrochemical changes were observed in groundwater wells near the epicenter the study of hydrochemical changes in aquifers adjacent to earthquake epicenters is a recent development compared to traditional field based methods however research over the last 10 years has led to mature molecular biology techniques and standardized methods for evaluating the effect of earthquakes on the aquifer ecosystem using the environmental tracer data and the microbial data associated with earthquakes will allow these techniques to reach their full potential over the next decades complementing related research in seismology hydrochemistry and biology galassi et al 2014 evaluated the dominance of fauna copepods in the groundwater their results suggested that in addition to hydrochemical changes the earthquake also led to a reduction in the abundance and diversity of organisms in the groundwater in particular once the ecosystem in a groundwater aquifer is damaged its resilience becomes very low thus earthquakes can cause the extinction of a few species in the groundwater ecosystem although groundwater is known to act as a lubricant in underground rocks in the event of an earthquake kooi 2016 there have been relatively few studies on the changes to and responses of indigenous microorganisms induced by earthquakes similarly there are only a few reports on the changes of microbial diversity after an earthquake uprety et al 2017 confirmed changes in microbial diversity during dry and wet seasons in areas with severe earthquake induced diastrophism following the 2015 earthquake in nepal however that study assessed the microbial diversity of surface water rather than groundwater and analysis pertaining to groundwater was excluded similarly yang and lou 2011 studied surface water samples from the kezhou sinter china where seismic activity is frequent and also observed changes in the microbial diversity after the earthquake prior to the earthquake gamma proteobacteria were the dominant microorganisms in the area but alpha proteobacteria became dominant afterwards furthermore some strains of microorganisms could be used as earthquake indicators in the study area such as stenotrophomonas sp rb25 acinetobacter sp rb11 and rhizobium sp ra42 yang and lou 2011 kawagucci et al 2012 studied the tohoku pacific ocean earthquake in 2011 especially the effects of environmental disturbances from topography changing incidents such as earthquakes on the community structure of microorganisms using samples taken from the bottom of the trench however none of the aforementioned earthquake related studies of microbial ecosystems used samples from groundwater overall the composition of bacterial communities of groundwater ecosystems remains largely unknown despite the substantial roles many groundwater bacteria play in critical biogeochemical cycles and the potential utility of such bacteria for bioremediation and other biotechnological applications this lack of knowledge can be attributed directly to their low culturability by standard microbiological techniques as well as the reluctance of groundwater hydrologists to study these small organisms moreover recent research on bacteria from groundwater environments identified by 16s rrna gene sequences has presented a new challenge in researching the groundwater ecosystem this study analyzed the bacteria and archaea in groundwater samples in an earthquake affected area and investigated the changes that occurred in the microbial communities as a result of the earthquake hydrochemical and environmental tracer data were used to support the analysis of the microbial community changes by the earthquake these data included the microbiological features of an aquifer after an earthquake in conjunction with chemical data the microbiological features indicated that bacteria in the groundwater are highly correlated with the hydrochemical data sepehri and saarfzadeh 2018 2019 sepehri et al 2019 the hypothesis of this study is based on the tendency that seismic activity has a negative impact on the biodiversity of groundwater ecosystems continued study of the effects of earthquake activities on the groundwater ecosystem can reveal the appearance and dominance of bacterial species adapted to such extreme environments in addition in depth investigation of microorganisms inhabiting the groundwater in combination with environmental tracer data used in earthquake related hydrogeological research will be of practical help in understanding the impact of earthquakes on the hydrogeological environment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site gyeongju is located 300 km southeast of seoul the capital of republic of korea geologically the southeastern part of the korean peninsula mainly consists of the cretaceous gyeongsang supergroup upper cretaceous to paleogene granites and neogene sediments chough and sohn 2010 the gyeongsang supergroup is divided into three major lithological units the lower sindong the middle hayang and the upper yucheon groups lee 1999 the study area consisted of the yucheon group the paleogene namsan alkali granite and the neogene yeonil group kaown et al 2019 the yangsan fault system is the most prominent inter related fault system in the southeastern part of korean peninsula kim et al 2016a b the southeastern part of korea shows a distinctive nne directed geomorphological feature with several strike slip fault systems including the milyang moryang and yangsan faults the earthquake of ml 5 8 occurred along the n30 e directed hidden branch fault two of the studied groundwater monitoring wells kw8 and kw11 are located adjacent to the yangsan fault the kw5 and kw7 wells are located close to the ulsan fault fig 1 the ml 5 8 earthquake was the strongest ever on the korean peninsula since the korea meteorological administration kma began observing temblors in 1978 a week later another ml 4 5 earthquake struck 11 km west of gyeongju at 20 33 on september 19 on september 20 the number of recorded aftershocks exceeded 640 in total 640 aftershocks with ml 2 or higher were recorded with 21 being ml 3 in size in the 24 h following the gyeongju earthquake there were 13 aftershocks measuring ml 3 or higher the second day saw 20 aftershocks including an ml 3 earthquake and there was an ml 4 5 earthquake a week later two days after the quake the ministry of public safety and security reported that there were 23 injured people and 1118 property damages in gyeongju on september 15 the total number of properties damaged rose to 5120 with damage concentrated in gyeongju and ulsan they included damage to roofs fences and vehicles cracks in buildings and ruptures of water pipes these seismic activities made people realize that korea is not free from earthquakes we selected seven national groundwater monitoring stations located close to the epicenter labeled kw5 to kw11 the stations include two types of wells alluvial aquifer and bedrock aquifer wells fig 1 the alluvial aquifers denoted kw 1 are composed of sedimentary rocks such as gravel pebbles and sand while the bedrock aquifers kw 2 are composed of mudstone conglomerate and shale with the exception that the compositions at kw8 2 and kw11 2 are igneous rock kaown et al 2019 the wells were installed with different depths the shallow wells from 6 8 to 26 m are located in the alluvial aquifers and the deep wells from 60 to 100 m in the bedrock aquifers 2 2 chemical analysis during the period january 16 18 2017 a total of 14 water samples were collected from wells including groundwater of the alluvial layer and the underlying fractured rock formation for monitoring the hydrogeochemical parameters groundwater level radon concentration strontium isotopes and microbiological features the water samples 2 l for chemical analysis and 3 l for microbial analysis were collected in polyethylene bottles by using a grundfos mp 1 pump the samples were collected after the wells had been pumped continuously for at least 15 min or after all field parameters had stabilized whichever happened first the sampling was carried out in compliance with the principles of environmental sampling geochemical parameters such as the temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp total dissolved solids tds ph and salinity were measured in the field using a ysi prodss digital sampling system xylem usa and groundwater was sampled only after these parameters stabilized all water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm membranes on site analysis of the cations and anions na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 was conducted at the korea basic science institute kbsi the stable isotope values of δ18o and δd in groundwater were measured using a vg prism ii stable isotope mass spectrometer at the kbsi the data are reported as δ values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water the accuracy for δ18o and δd is 0 1 and 1 respectively kaown et al 2018 for strontium isotope analysis at the kbsi the 87sr 86sr ratios were obtained using a neptune mc icp ms thermo finnigan germany system upgraded with a large dry interface pump the yields were about 100 and the matrix concentration did not exceed 1 of the strontium concentrations the total procedural blanks were negligible with less than 1 ng of sr the 87sr 86sr ratios were normalized to 86sr 88sr 0 1194 faure 1986 and the mean 87sr 86sr ratio of nbs987 u s national bureau of standards was 0 710247 0 000017 2σ n 18 for radon concentrations an rtm1688 2 instrument sarad gmbh was used for each water sample the unit offers a high sensitivity better than 3 cpm kbq m3 from an internal volume of only 130 ml in each measurement an air bubbling flask of 500 ml was filled with the water sample and connected to the radon monitor to create a closed air loop the radon concentration was determined based on repeated measurements of the gas circulating inside the machine in each water sample all connection tubes were flushed with fresh air until equilibrium was reached afterwards the measurements were taken for an hour at 15 minute intervals the attained values were calibrated by adjusting for the short half life of radon groundwater samples for measuring the 3he 4he ratio 4he 20ne 40ar 83kr and 131xe were collected using copper tubes sealed at both ends with metal pinch clamps the concentrations of noble gas were analyzed at the noble gas laboratory at the university of utah the measurement errors were less than 1 for 3he 4he ratio and 4he 2 for 20ne and 40ar and 4 for 83kr and 131xe 2 3 molecular analysis 2 3 1 sample collection the water samples for bacteria analysis 3 l were filtered using a 0 2 µm pore filter dna in the groundwater was extracted using a fastdna spin kit qbiogene usa as specified by the manufacturer after quality checking by standard agarose gel electrophoresis the extracted dna was stored at 20 c the dna concentration was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer mechasys co ltd korea to analyze the taxonomic composition of the water bacterial community the v1 v3 region of the 16s rrna gene was chosen for amplification and subsequent pyrosequencing of polymerase chain reaction pcr products at chun laboratory seoul south korea kim et al 2015 pyrosequencing was conducted using a 454 gs junior sequencing system roche nj usa by chun laboratory according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna was also amplified by pcr for multiplexed pyrosequencing using barcoded primers a set of primers was designed for bacteria and archaea the 16s rrna genes were amplified using forward and inverse primers to distinguish each sample prior to sequencing at chun laboratory kim et al 2018 2 3 2 sequence data processing and statistical analysis the sequencing reads from the 14 samples were separated by unique barcodes the sequences of the barcodes pcr primers and linker were then removed from each side of the original sequencing reads bacterial community structures were analyzed using operational taxonomic units otus distance matrices were used to define otus for calculating the abundance based coverage estimator ace the chao 1 richness estimator shannon and simpson diversity indices and rarefaction curves each sequence was identified by comparing it with the sequences in the eztaxon extended database chun lab eztaxon e org using blastn searches and pairwise similarity comparisons furthermore the frequently used upgma tree is the most efficient at representing the similarity between the evaluated genotypes this method being known as the hierarchical method producing dendrograms with maximum cophenetic correlation lozupone and knight 2005 chimeras were identified using uchime edgar et al 2011 and then removed the relative abundances of bacteria and archaea were then calculated and collated the transformed data sets were computed for their bay curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution and vector analysis in a non metric multidimensional scaling mds plot using rstudio bar and mentch 2017 2 3 3 phylogenetic analysis for phylogenetic analysis of the dominant bacterial communities present in the groundwater samples we used 2172 otus present in at least 6 27 of 34 632 otus that appeared at the water sampling sites sequences of these 2172 dominant otus and their related neighbors were downloaded together with those of desulfurococcus fermentans z 1231 t ay264344 species that were used as outgroups we aligned these 2172dominant sequences with the reference sequences using bioedit version 7 0 9 0 kim et al 2018 phylogenetic trees were constructed from the aligned sequences using three methods 1 neighbor joining using the kimura two parameter distance model 2 maximum likelihood ml using the tamura nei distance model and 3 bayesian inference bi by the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method using the software packages molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega version 5 10 tamura et al 2011 and mrbayes version 3 1 2 holder and lewis 2003 the stability of branches and statistical tests was assessed using bootstrap analysis with 1 000 replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical characteristics the analysis results of major ions stable isotopes and noble gases in the water samples are listed in table 1 the concentrations of cl so4 2 na ca2 and hco3 were compared in groundwater samples from the bedrock and alluvial aquifers fig 2 the concentrations of ca2 na and hco3 were higher in groundwater from the bedrock aquifer compared to the alluvial aquifer higher concentrations of no3 and cl were observed in groundwater from the alluvial aquifer compared to those of the bedrock aquifer because no3 and cl mainly originated from anthropogenic sources 3 1 1 stable isotopes the values of δ18o and δd in groundwater from different aquifers are compared in fig 3 these values of δ18o and δd were elevated in groundwater in the alluvial aquifer and stream water while those from the fractured rock aquifer decreased changes in the δ18o and δd values of water after earthquake have been reported in many studies andrén et al 2016 skelton et al 2014 thus the lowest value of δ18o and δd observed in kw8 2 might be closely related to the impact of earthquake the radon concentrations after the earthquake were significantly higher at the three points around the epicenter kw5 1 kw5 2 and kw8 2 and low in the other four points near the east sea kw6 1 kw6 2 kw10 1 and kw10 2 the difference between the alluvial groundwater and rock formation groundwater was small for kw6 kw7 kw9 and kw10 these wells are either located around the epicenter kw5 and kw8 or significantly different from the other wells kw11 kw5 has significantly higher values for the alluvial groundwater and rock formation the radon concentration anomaly of kw11 was most likely due to the extension from the yangsan fault to the moryang fault with the strike nne 25 kim et al 2016a this result is also related to the post earthquake stability because the sampling was conducted after a relatively long time following the earthquake the significantly high radon concentrations for both alluvial well and the rock formation well of kw5 suggest that this point was especially influenced by the migration of shallow groundwater these results indicate that radon 222 can be used to analyze data of not only pre seismic anomaly but also post seismic anomaly 3 1 2 noble gas helium helium isotopes and the helium neon ratio in groundwater were measured around the epicenter in gyeongju area some samples kw6 kw7 and kw9 showed similar values of 3he 4he in the alluvial and fractured rock aquifers fig 4 a however for the fractured rock aquifer 3he 4he was elevated in kw5 2 and decreased in kw8 2 and kw11 2 indicating possible earthquake impact the higher values of 3he 4he and 4he ne in kw5 2 can be explained by the addition of primitive 3he from fluid flow through the fracture fig 4b sano et al 2015 2016 the lower value of 3he 4he and higher values of 4he ne in kw8 2 and kw11 2 after the earthquake were caused by an additional radiogenic helium source in the crust mixing with air originating from the mixing of shallow groundwater and air saturated groundwater produced by the earthquake fracture sano et al 2015 2016 3 2 microbiological features fig 5 shows that there are some variations in the composition at the phylum level among the samples proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples 50 4 97 5 except kw11 2 36 0 bacteriodetes which was the second most abundant phylum in kw11 2 53 7 was also distributed in the other samples actinobacteria was the other prevalent phylum in the groundwater samples of kw9 1 19 1 kw5 1 17 7 and kw9 2 13 4 kw8 2 kw6 1 kw5 2 kw7 1 and kw7 2 showed the highest proportions of proteobacteria 97 4 94 3 91 6 85 3 and 83 9 respectively the phylum compositions of kw5 2 and kw7 2 showed similarity because both wells are located close to the ulsan fault the wells of kw8 and kw11 are located adjacent to the yangsan fault but they still showed some difference in the phylum results these two wells are supposed to be composed of highly mixed alluvial layer and fractured rock aquifer because of the direct effluence of the earthquake in the yangsan fault furthermore kw8 2 and kw5 2 show anomalies in rn concentration 3he 4he and 4he ne in addition kw6 1 shows significantly low strontium concentrations which might be related to the deep groundwater mixing after the earthquake extreme environmental changes such as an earthquake in the groundwater environment could trigger the reduction of species or the abundance of special species galassi et al 2014 these microbial composition results are consistent with the hydrochemical results the compositions of phyla detected in the alluvial kw 1 and bedrock kw 2 aquifer groundwater wells are compared in fig 5 the phylum represented by each color is defined in the upper right the class level composition of proteobacteria detected in each sample was compared the corresponding legends appear on the lower right the nomenclatures of phylotypes are based on the eztaxone e database http eztaxon e ezbiocloud net and the unweighted pair group method with average linkage upgma cluster analysis based on the similarity between the otus of the sampled groundwater the upgma tree below the figure shows the relationships between samples according to the bacterial profile the upgma tree in fig 5 shows meaningful biodiversity patterns that unite many individual observations in the literature it reveals several striking features of microbial communities in the groundwater ecosystem effected by the earthquake kw5 2 and kw8 2 are considered to be directly affected by the earthquake the tree shows that kw9 1 is clustered with kw5 2 kw7 2 and kw8 2 although the hydrochemical properties of kw9 1 are not very similar to those of kw5 2 and kw8 2 they belong to the same group because they are located closest to the earthquake epicenter figs 1 and 6 we obtained high quality bacteria sequences with an average length of 396 bp from the 14 groundwater samples good coverage was defined as 0 98 0 99 for all samples with bacteria representing almost the whole range of bacterial diversity table 2 the chao1 shannon evenness and ace values all indicated that the α diversity of the bacterial community is higher in the alluvial aquifer shallow groundwater than in the fractured aquifer deep groundwater except for kw9 2 and kw11 2 moreover kw11 2 showed higher species richness chao1 7 0 and abundance ace 6453 5 than kw11 1 the hydrogeochemical and phylum composition data suggest that kw5 2 and kw8 2 are the samples most affected by the earthquake however when compared with the groundwater level data fig 6 the water signatures of kw11 1 and kw11 2 indicate that there may have been mixing of groundwater of the whole layer with the rock bottom water due to the earthquake in addition the groundwater levels of kw11 1 and kw11 2 remained similar to those of kw8 1 and kw8 2 in general the diversity and richness estimators of archaea are lower than those of bacteria however the kw9 1 and kw9 2 samples showed high otus moreover there is not much difference in the observed archaea otus between the alluvial aquifer and the fractured aquifer similar results were seen in kw11 and kw7 table 3 we also observed distinctive microbial communities in groundwater samples taken near the epicenter of gyeongju earthquake bac2 flavobacterium from kw5 1 shows the center of movement of chemical properties according to yang and lou 2011 flavobacterium emerged in post earthquake microbial clusters after the seismic activity moreover the genera lysobacter nocardiopsis stenotrophomonas and streptomyces were no longer present after the earthquake while aeromonas arthrobacter flavobacterium kocuria mycetocola pedobacter planomicrobium rothia and staphylococcus only appeared during the post earthquake stage the predominant genera in the gyeongju groundwater samples were flavobacterium arthrobacter and pseudomonas furthermore the majority of pre earthquake isolates belonged to the gamma proteobacteria and the predominant post earthquake isolates are alpha proteobacteria yang and lou 2011 similarly the flavobacterium is representative of the microbes that appear after the earthquake in gyeongju however the variations of proportions of alpha proteobacteria and gamma proteobacteria are not comparable in the gyeongju groundwater samples see fig 5 nevertheless flavobacterium is the major bacterium that is highly related to the post earthquake genera and the quality of groundwater at the study site the ratios of flavobacterium in kw5 1 22 12 kw5 2 3 23 kw6 1 42 54 kw6 2 29 49 kw8 1 24 44 kw8 2 6 56 kw9 2 10 21 kw10 2 6 23 and kw11 2 46 77 show that in most cases this ratio is higher in alluvial aquifer than in bedrock aquifer however the opposite trend was found in kw5 and kw8 because the corresponding aquifers are highly mixed between alluvial and bedrock types by the earthquake bac 1 pseudomonas a known pathogen was found in many patients following the earthquake yang and lou 2011 in particular they were found in most of the samples from gyeongju as the strongly dominating bacteria these results are important for public health authorities if people drink groundwater after the earthquake fig 7 in addition to causing diseases pseudomonas is also a sulfate reducing bacteria srb and denitrifying bacteria dnb xu et al 2010 arthrobacter was found in kw5 1 8 40 kw7 1 6 70 and kw10 2 4 37 furthermore pedobacter was found in kw7 1 1 06 and kw10 2 4 55 while planomicrobium was found in kw11 2 2 53 originally archaea were found in harsh environments such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms but improved detection tools led to their discovery in almost every habitat including soil oceans groundwater and marshlands the most predominant archaea group is euryarchaeota which is related to archaea living in the hydrothermal vents in the deep sea the archaea thaumarchaeota is also related to the marine group in particular arch 2 and arch 3 are related to seawater intrusion the archaea found in kw6 2 and kw8 2 consist of those from deep sea hydrothermal vents 2 12 and 1 53 respectively fig 8 thus kw6 2 and kw8 2 samples deep groundwater are thought to be affected by the penetration of sea water following the earthquake this is consistent with the strontium data which also indicate possible seawater intrusion in the case of kw6 2 we used 2172 otus that were present at a certain abundance and dominant species in the individual samples fig 9 the phylogenetic tree shows the dominant bacteria species at the study site the predominant bacteria are pseudomonas and flavobacterium in most of the samples these microbiological features of the groundwater in the study site indicate that bacteria genera such as pseudomonas and flavobacterium may be highly correlated with the earthquake of gyeongju 4 conclusions studying the microbial features of groundwater aquifer systems together with the chemical indicators therein after earthquakes is important in gyeongju korea a seismically active area that also depends on groundwater for agricultural uses and drinking water we found that the ml 5 8 gyeongju earthquake and its more than 640 aftershocks had strong impacts on the groundwater ecosystem the dominant bacterial species flavobacterium and pseudomonas and chemical values rn sr and he of sample groundwater after the earthquakes indicated that the subsurface water environment changed for the aquifer system the gyeongju earthquake disrupted the groundwater signature that distinguishes the shallow and deep aquifers this disruption is especially prominent in wells located adjacent to the epicenter there have been only a few reports on the microbial features in the groundwater after earthquakes in combination with the chemical data in this study we evaluated both the microbial community and hydrochemical changes in groundwater caused by the mainshock and aftershocks of the gyeongju earthquake the microbial data more clearly supported the interpretation of groundwater chemistry data influenced by the earthquake we found the archaea thaumarchaeota which is related to the marine group particularly arch 2 and arch 3 which are archaea from deep sea hydrothermal vents indicating seawater intrusion as suggested by the sr data moreover the relatively higher values of 3he 4he and 4he ne ratios in kw5 2 after the earthquake can be explained by the addition of primitive 3he from the fluid flow through the fracture moreover the lower value of 3he 4he and higher values of 4he ne in kw8 2 and kw11 2 after the earthquake were likely caused by the additional radiogenic helium source in the crust mixing with air derived from the mixing of shallow groundwater and air saturated groundwater produced by earthquake fracture these data about noble gas are highly correlated with the bacteria phylum compositions and upgma grouping in addition the phylogenetic relationship among the most abundant bacteria in the earthquake area are correlated to the microbial species that are said to emerge after earthquakes in the literature the 16s rrna sequencing and metagenomics will allow a more comprehensive understanding of microbial features of the aquifer and their effects at earthquake sites further studies will aim to increase the frequency of post earthquake sampling in order to better evaluate the hydro chemical anomalies of microbial community located in wells adjacent to the epicenter despite the limitations of sampling the results of this study provide useful information on how a large scale earthquake affects the

5695,in this study the possible changes in microbial communities after the occurrence of an earthquake were investigated to this end the effects of the 2016 gyeongju earthquake ml 5 8 on the microbial communities in nearby aquifers were analyzed together with associated hydrochemistry data fourteen water samples were collected from two types of wells alluvial and fractured rock formation hydrogeochemical parameters groundwater level radon concentration strontium isotopes and microbiological features were monitored the results obtained for microbial compositions and special bacteria were consistent with the hydrochemical results distinctive microbial communities in groundwater samples taken adjacent to the earthquake epicenter were also observed the predominant bacteria in most samples were pseudomonas and flavobacterium radon concentrations helium isotopes and the helium neon ratio showed anomalies in one well kw8 compared to microbial composition data strontium data indicated that the study site may have been affected by seawater intrusion this was corroborated by the microbiological features of archaea the results indicate that an earthquake can change the number of species or their abundance in groundwater ecosystems therefore microbial features might be a good additional indicator for analyzing the effects of earthquakes on groundwater together with major chemical parameters such as radon strontium and helium the microbiological features indicate that levels of bacteria such as pseudomonas and flavobacterium in the groundwater were highly correlated with the gyeongju earthquake and the associated hydrochemical data keywords earthquake microbiological features of aquifer bacteria archaea groundwater ecosystem 1 introduction recently hydrologists have been studying the mechanisms of hydrogeological changes induced by large scale earthquakes around the world cox et al 2012 kaown et al 2019 petitta et al 2018 rojstaczer et al 1995 sibson 1981 owing to the increasing importance of groundwater fluctuations caused by earthquakes many previous studies have analyzed the hydrogeological characteristics of these groundwater level fluctuations chia et al 2001 king et al 1999 lee and woo 2012 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2004 in general the groundwater level fluctuations caused by earthquakes are significantly affected by hydrogeological factors such as the distance between the epicenter and the monitoring well and the shapes of faults and the aquifer chia et al 2001 2008 king et al 2000 previous research on groundwater level fluctuations due to earthquakes includes many reports on coseismic and postseismic groundwater level fluctuations chia et al 2008 jeon et al 2011 ohno et al 2006 wang et al 2004 wang and chia 2008 there are also precedent studies on the changes in groundwater quality following earthquakes onda et al 2018 sato et al 1995 schuessler et al 2016 takamura and kono 1996 tsunogai and wakita 1995 analyzed the ion concentrations in a groundwater well near the epicenter of the kobe earthquake mjma 7 2 january 1995 according to their study the concentrations of chlorides and sulfates increased steadily for several months before the earthquake and became much higher after it galassi et al 2014 found a significant change in the hydrochemistry of the surrounding aquifer after the mw 6 3 earthquake in l aquila italy in april 2009 these two studies show that the groundwater quality reflects the pre and post earthquake conditions respectively as well as the necessity of continuous monitoring of groundwater quality in areas where earthquakes are forecast kaown et al 2019 used various environmental tracer data noble gas δ18o δd 3h and 13c to investigate the hydrochemical changes in aquifers attributable to a local magnitude ml 5 8 earthquake and associated earthquakes in gyeongju korea in 2016 cluster analysis was conducted using the chemical data and hydrochemical changes were observed in groundwater wells near the epicenter the study of hydrochemical changes in aquifers adjacent to earthquake epicenters is a recent development compared to traditional field based methods however research over the last 10 years has led to mature molecular biology techniques and standardized methods for evaluating the effect of earthquakes on the aquifer ecosystem using the environmental tracer data and the microbial data associated with earthquakes will allow these techniques to reach their full potential over the next decades complementing related research in seismology hydrochemistry and biology galassi et al 2014 evaluated the dominance of fauna copepods in the groundwater their results suggested that in addition to hydrochemical changes the earthquake also led to a reduction in the abundance and diversity of organisms in the groundwater in particular once the ecosystem in a groundwater aquifer is damaged its resilience becomes very low thus earthquakes can cause the extinction of a few species in the groundwater ecosystem although groundwater is known to act as a lubricant in underground rocks in the event of an earthquake kooi 2016 there have been relatively few studies on the changes to and responses of indigenous microorganisms induced by earthquakes similarly there are only a few reports on the changes of microbial diversity after an earthquake uprety et al 2017 confirmed changes in microbial diversity during dry and wet seasons in areas with severe earthquake induced diastrophism following the 2015 earthquake in nepal however that study assessed the microbial diversity of surface water rather than groundwater and analysis pertaining to groundwater was excluded similarly yang and lou 2011 studied surface water samples from the kezhou sinter china where seismic activity is frequent and also observed changes in the microbial diversity after the earthquake prior to the earthquake gamma proteobacteria were the dominant microorganisms in the area but alpha proteobacteria became dominant afterwards furthermore some strains of microorganisms could be used as earthquake indicators in the study area such as stenotrophomonas sp rb25 acinetobacter sp rb11 and rhizobium sp ra42 yang and lou 2011 kawagucci et al 2012 studied the tohoku pacific ocean earthquake in 2011 especially the effects of environmental disturbances from topography changing incidents such as earthquakes on the community structure of microorganisms using samples taken from the bottom of the trench however none of the aforementioned earthquake related studies of microbial ecosystems used samples from groundwater overall the composition of bacterial communities of groundwater ecosystems remains largely unknown despite the substantial roles many groundwater bacteria play in critical biogeochemical cycles and the potential utility of such bacteria for bioremediation and other biotechnological applications this lack of knowledge can be attributed directly to their low culturability by standard microbiological techniques as well as the reluctance of groundwater hydrologists to study these small organisms moreover recent research on bacteria from groundwater environments identified by 16s rrna gene sequences has presented a new challenge in researching the groundwater ecosystem this study analyzed the bacteria and archaea in groundwater samples in an earthquake affected area and investigated the changes that occurred in the microbial communities as a result of the earthquake hydrochemical and environmental tracer data were used to support the analysis of the microbial community changes by the earthquake these data included the microbiological features of an aquifer after an earthquake in conjunction with chemical data the microbiological features indicated that bacteria in the groundwater are highly correlated with the hydrochemical data sepehri and saarfzadeh 2018 2019 sepehri et al 2019 the hypothesis of this study is based on the tendency that seismic activity has a negative impact on the biodiversity of groundwater ecosystems continued study of the effects of earthquake activities on the groundwater ecosystem can reveal the appearance and dominance of bacterial species adapted to such extreme environments in addition in depth investigation of microorganisms inhabiting the groundwater in combination with environmental tracer data used in earthquake related hydrogeological research will be of practical help in understanding the impact of earthquakes on the hydrogeological environment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site gyeongju is located 300 km southeast of seoul the capital of republic of korea geologically the southeastern part of the korean peninsula mainly consists of the cretaceous gyeongsang supergroup upper cretaceous to paleogene granites and neogene sediments chough and sohn 2010 the gyeongsang supergroup is divided into three major lithological units the lower sindong the middle hayang and the upper yucheon groups lee 1999 the study area consisted of the yucheon group the paleogene namsan alkali granite and the neogene yeonil group kaown et al 2019 the yangsan fault system is the most prominent inter related fault system in the southeastern part of korean peninsula kim et al 2016a b the southeastern part of korea shows a distinctive nne directed geomorphological feature with several strike slip fault systems including the milyang moryang and yangsan faults the earthquake of ml 5 8 occurred along the n30 e directed hidden branch fault two of the studied groundwater monitoring wells kw8 and kw11 are located adjacent to the yangsan fault the kw5 and kw7 wells are located close to the ulsan fault fig 1 the ml 5 8 earthquake was the strongest ever on the korean peninsula since the korea meteorological administration kma began observing temblors in 1978 a week later another ml 4 5 earthquake struck 11 km west of gyeongju at 20 33 on september 19 on september 20 the number of recorded aftershocks exceeded 640 in total 640 aftershocks with ml 2 or higher were recorded with 21 being ml 3 in size in the 24 h following the gyeongju earthquake there were 13 aftershocks measuring ml 3 or higher the second day saw 20 aftershocks including an ml 3 earthquake and there was an ml 4 5 earthquake a week later two days after the quake the ministry of public safety and security reported that there were 23 injured people and 1118 property damages in gyeongju on september 15 the total number of properties damaged rose to 5120 with damage concentrated in gyeongju and ulsan they included damage to roofs fences and vehicles cracks in buildings and ruptures of water pipes these seismic activities made people realize that korea is not free from earthquakes we selected seven national groundwater monitoring stations located close to the epicenter labeled kw5 to kw11 the stations include two types of wells alluvial aquifer and bedrock aquifer wells fig 1 the alluvial aquifers denoted kw 1 are composed of sedimentary rocks such as gravel pebbles and sand while the bedrock aquifers kw 2 are composed of mudstone conglomerate and shale with the exception that the compositions at kw8 2 and kw11 2 are igneous rock kaown et al 2019 the wells were installed with different depths the shallow wells from 6 8 to 26 m are located in the alluvial aquifers and the deep wells from 60 to 100 m in the bedrock aquifers 2 2 chemical analysis during the period january 16 18 2017 a total of 14 water samples were collected from wells including groundwater of the alluvial layer and the underlying fractured rock formation for monitoring the hydrogeochemical parameters groundwater level radon concentration strontium isotopes and microbiological features the water samples 2 l for chemical analysis and 3 l for microbial analysis were collected in polyethylene bottles by using a grundfos mp 1 pump the samples were collected after the wells had been pumped continuously for at least 15 min or after all field parameters had stabilized whichever happened first the sampling was carried out in compliance with the principles of environmental sampling geochemical parameters such as the temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp total dissolved solids tds ph and salinity were measured in the field using a ysi prodss digital sampling system xylem usa and groundwater was sampled only after these parameters stabilized all water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm membranes on site analysis of the cations and anions na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 was conducted at the korea basic science institute kbsi the stable isotope values of δ18o and δd in groundwater were measured using a vg prism ii stable isotope mass spectrometer at the kbsi the data are reported as δ values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water the accuracy for δ18o and δd is 0 1 and 1 respectively kaown et al 2018 for strontium isotope analysis at the kbsi the 87sr 86sr ratios were obtained using a neptune mc icp ms thermo finnigan germany system upgraded with a large dry interface pump the yields were about 100 and the matrix concentration did not exceed 1 of the strontium concentrations the total procedural blanks were negligible with less than 1 ng of sr the 87sr 86sr ratios were normalized to 86sr 88sr 0 1194 faure 1986 and the mean 87sr 86sr ratio of nbs987 u s national bureau of standards was 0 710247 0 000017 2σ n 18 for radon concentrations an rtm1688 2 instrument sarad gmbh was used for each water sample the unit offers a high sensitivity better than 3 cpm kbq m3 from an internal volume of only 130 ml in each measurement an air bubbling flask of 500 ml was filled with the water sample and connected to the radon monitor to create a closed air loop the radon concentration was determined based on repeated measurements of the gas circulating inside the machine in each water sample all connection tubes were flushed with fresh air until equilibrium was reached afterwards the measurements were taken for an hour at 15 minute intervals the attained values were calibrated by adjusting for the short half life of radon groundwater samples for measuring the 3he 4he ratio 4he 20ne 40ar 83kr and 131xe were collected using copper tubes sealed at both ends with metal pinch clamps the concentrations of noble gas were analyzed at the noble gas laboratory at the university of utah the measurement errors were less than 1 for 3he 4he ratio and 4he 2 for 20ne and 40ar and 4 for 83kr and 131xe 2 3 molecular analysis 2 3 1 sample collection the water samples for bacteria analysis 3 l were filtered using a 0 2 µm pore filter dna in the groundwater was extracted using a fastdna spin kit qbiogene usa as specified by the manufacturer after quality checking by standard agarose gel electrophoresis the extracted dna was stored at 20 c the dna concentration was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer mechasys co ltd korea to analyze the taxonomic composition of the water bacterial community the v1 v3 region of the 16s rrna gene was chosen for amplification and subsequent pyrosequencing of polymerase chain reaction pcr products at chun laboratory seoul south korea kim et al 2015 pyrosequencing was conducted using a 454 gs junior sequencing system roche nj usa by chun laboratory according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna was also amplified by pcr for multiplexed pyrosequencing using barcoded primers a set of primers was designed for bacteria and archaea the 16s rrna genes were amplified using forward and inverse primers to distinguish each sample prior to sequencing at chun laboratory kim et al 2018 2 3 2 sequence data processing and statistical analysis the sequencing reads from the 14 samples were separated by unique barcodes the sequences of the barcodes pcr primers and linker were then removed from each side of the original sequencing reads bacterial community structures were analyzed using operational taxonomic units otus distance matrices were used to define otus for calculating the abundance based coverage estimator ace the chao 1 richness estimator shannon and simpson diversity indices and rarefaction curves each sequence was identified by comparing it with the sequences in the eztaxon extended database chun lab eztaxon e org using blastn searches and pairwise similarity comparisons furthermore the frequently used upgma tree is the most efficient at representing the similarity between the evaluated genotypes this method being known as the hierarchical method producing dendrograms with maximum cophenetic correlation lozupone and knight 2005 chimeras were identified using uchime edgar et al 2011 and then removed the relative abundances of bacteria and archaea were then calculated and collated the transformed data sets were computed for their bay curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution and vector analysis in a non metric multidimensional scaling mds plot using rstudio bar and mentch 2017 2 3 3 phylogenetic analysis for phylogenetic analysis of the dominant bacterial communities present in the groundwater samples we used 2172 otus present in at least 6 27 of 34 632 otus that appeared at the water sampling sites sequences of these 2172 dominant otus and their related neighbors were downloaded together with those of desulfurococcus fermentans z 1231 t ay264344 species that were used as outgroups we aligned these 2172dominant sequences with the reference sequences using bioedit version 7 0 9 0 kim et al 2018 phylogenetic trees were constructed from the aligned sequences using three methods 1 neighbor joining using the kimura two parameter distance model 2 maximum likelihood ml using the tamura nei distance model and 3 bayesian inference bi by the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method using the software packages molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega version 5 10 tamura et al 2011 and mrbayes version 3 1 2 holder and lewis 2003 the stability of branches and statistical tests was assessed using bootstrap analysis with 1 000 replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical characteristics the analysis results of major ions stable isotopes and noble gases in the water samples are listed in table 1 the concentrations of cl so4 2 na ca2 and hco3 were compared in groundwater samples from the bedrock and alluvial aquifers fig 2 the concentrations of ca2 na and hco3 were higher in groundwater from the bedrock aquifer compared to the alluvial aquifer higher concentrations of no3 and cl were observed in groundwater from the alluvial aquifer compared to those of the bedrock aquifer because no3 and cl mainly originated from anthropogenic sources 3 1 1 stable isotopes the values of δ18o and δd in groundwater from different aquifers are compared in fig 3 these values of δ18o and δd were elevated in groundwater in the alluvial aquifer and stream water while those from the fractured rock aquifer decreased changes in the δ18o and δd values of water after earthquake have been reported in many studies andrén et al 2016 skelton et al 2014 thus the lowest value of δ18o and δd observed in kw8 2 might be closely related to the impact of earthquake the radon concentrations after the earthquake were significantly higher at the three points around the epicenter kw5 1 kw5 2 and kw8 2 and low in the other four points near the east sea kw6 1 kw6 2 kw10 1 and kw10 2 the difference between the alluvial groundwater and rock formation groundwater was small for kw6 kw7 kw9 and kw10 these wells are either located around the epicenter kw5 and kw8 or significantly different from the other wells kw11 kw5 has significantly higher values for the alluvial groundwater and rock formation the radon concentration anomaly of kw11 was most likely due to the extension from the yangsan fault to the moryang fault with the strike nne 25 kim et al 2016a this result is also related to the post earthquake stability because the sampling was conducted after a relatively long time following the earthquake the significantly high radon concentrations for both alluvial well and the rock formation well of kw5 suggest that this point was especially influenced by the migration of shallow groundwater these results indicate that radon 222 can be used to analyze data of not only pre seismic anomaly but also post seismic anomaly 3 1 2 noble gas helium helium isotopes and the helium neon ratio in groundwater were measured around the epicenter in gyeongju area some samples kw6 kw7 and kw9 showed similar values of 3he 4he in the alluvial and fractured rock aquifers fig 4 a however for the fractured rock aquifer 3he 4he was elevated in kw5 2 and decreased in kw8 2 and kw11 2 indicating possible earthquake impact the higher values of 3he 4he and 4he ne in kw5 2 can be explained by the addition of primitive 3he from fluid flow through the fracture fig 4b sano et al 2015 2016 the lower value of 3he 4he and higher values of 4he ne in kw8 2 and kw11 2 after the earthquake were caused by an additional radiogenic helium source in the crust mixing with air originating from the mixing of shallow groundwater and air saturated groundwater produced by the earthquake fracture sano et al 2015 2016 3 2 microbiological features fig 5 shows that there are some variations in the composition at the phylum level among the samples proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples 50 4 97 5 except kw11 2 36 0 bacteriodetes which was the second most abundant phylum in kw11 2 53 7 was also distributed in the other samples actinobacteria was the other prevalent phylum in the groundwater samples of kw9 1 19 1 kw5 1 17 7 and kw9 2 13 4 kw8 2 kw6 1 kw5 2 kw7 1 and kw7 2 showed the highest proportions of proteobacteria 97 4 94 3 91 6 85 3 and 83 9 respectively the phylum compositions of kw5 2 and kw7 2 showed similarity because both wells are located close to the ulsan fault the wells of kw8 and kw11 are located adjacent to the yangsan fault but they still showed some difference in the phylum results these two wells are supposed to be composed of highly mixed alluvial layer and fractured rock aquifer because of the direct effluence of the earthquake in the yangsan fault furthermore kw8 2 and kw5 2 show anomalies in rn concentration 3he 4he and 4he ne in addition kw6 1 shows significantly low strontium concentrations which might be related to the deep groundwater mixing after the earthquake extreme environmental changes such as an earthquake in the groundwater environment could trigger the reduction of species or the abundance of special species galassi et al 2014 these microbial composition results are consistent with the hydrochemical results the compositions of phyla detected in the alluvial kw 1 and bedrock kw 2 aquifer groundwater wells are compared in fig 5 the phylum represented by each color is defined in the upper right the class level composition of proteobacteria detected in each sample was compared the corresponding legends appear on the lower right the nomenclatures of phylotypes are based on the eztaxone e database http eztaxon e ezbiocloud net and the unweighted pair group method with average linkage upgma cluster analysis based on the similarity between the otus of the sampled groundwater the upgma tree below the figure shows the relationships between samples according to the bacterial profile the upgma tree in fig 5 shows meaningful biodiversity patterns that unite many individual observations in the literature it reveals several striking features of microbial communities in the groundwater ecosystem effected by the earthquake kw5 2 and kw8 2 are considered to be directly affected by the earthquake the tree shows that kw9 1 is clustered with kw5 2 kw7 2 and kw8 2 although the hydrochemical properties of kw9 1 are not very similar to those of kw5 2 and kw8 2 they belong to the same group because they are located closest to the earthquake epicenter figs 1 and 6 we obtained high quality bacteria sequences with an average length of 396 bp from the 14 groundwater samples good coverage was defined as 0 98 0 99 for all samples with bacteria representing almost the whole range of bacterial diversity table 2 the chao1 shannon evenness and ace values all indicated that the α diversity of the bacterial community is higher in the alluvial aquifer shallow groundwater than in the fractured aquifer deep groundwater except for kw9 2 and kw11 2 moreover kw11 2 showed higher species richness chao1 7 0 and abundance ace 6453 5 than kw11 1 the hydrogeochemical and phylum composition data suggest that kw5 2 and kw8 2 are the samples most affected by the earthquake however when compared with the groundwater level data fig 6 the water signatures of kw11 1 and kw11 2 indicate that there may have been mixing of groundwater of the whole layer with the rock bottom water due to the earthquake in addition the groundwater levels of kw11 1 and kw11 2 remained similar to those of kw8 1 and kw8 2 in general the diversity and richness estimators of archaea are lower than those of bacteria however the kw9 1 and kw9 2 samples showed high otus moreover there is not much difference in the observed archaea otus between the alluvial aquifer and the fractured aquifer similar results were seen in kw11 and kw7 table 3 we also observed distinctive microbial communities in groundwater samples taken near the epicenter of gyeongju earthquake bac2 flavobacterium from kw5 1 shows the center of movement of chemical properties according to yang and lou 2011 flavobacterium emerged in post earthquake microbial clusters after the seismic activity moreover the genera lysobacter nocardiopsis stenotrophomonas and streptomyces were no longer present after the earthquake while aeromonas arthrobacter flavobacterium kocuria mycetocola pedobacter planomicrobium rothia and staphylococcus only appeared during the post earthquake stage the predominant genera in the gyeongju groundwater samples were flavobacterium arthrobacter and pseudomonas furthermore the majority of pre earthquake isolates belonged to the gamma proteobacteria and the predominant post earthquake isolates are alpha proteobacteria yang and lou 2011 similarly the flavobacterium is representative of the microbes that appear after the earthquake in gyeongju however the variations of proportions of alpha proteobacteria and gamma proteobacteria are not comparable in the gyeongju groundwater samples see fig 5 nevertheless flavobacterium is the major bacterium that is highly related to the post earthquake genera and the quality of groundwater at the study site the ratios of flavobacterium in kw5 1 22 12 kw5 2 3 23 kw6 1 42 54 kw6 2 29 49 kw8 1 24 44 kw8 2 6 56 kw9 2 10 21 kw10 2 6 23 and kw11 2 46 77 show that in most cases this ratio is higher in alluvial aquifer than in bedrock aquifer however the opposite trend was found in kw5 and kw8 because the corresponding aquifers are highly mixed between alluvial and bedrock types by the earthquake bac 1 pseudomonas a known pathogen was found in many patients following the earthquake yang and lou 2011 in particular they were found in most of the samples from gyeongju as the strongly dominating bacteria these results are important for public health authorities if people drink groundwater after the earthquake fig 7 in addition to causing diseases pseudomonas is also a sulfate reducing bacteria srb and denitrifying bacteria dnb xu et al 2010 arthrobacter was found in kw5 1 8 40 kw7 1 6 70 and kw10 2 4 37 furthermore pedobacter was found in kw7 1 1 06 and kw10 2 4 55 while planomicrobium was found in kw11 2 2 53 originally archaea were found in harsh environments such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms but improved detection tools led to their discovery in almost every habitat including soil oceans groundwater and marshlands the most predominant archaea group is euryarchaeota which is related to archaea living in the hydrothermal vents in the deep sea the archaea thaumarchaeota is also related to the marine group in particular arch 2 and arch 3 are related to seawater intrusion the archaea found in kw6 2 and kw8 2 consist of those from deep sea hydrothermal vents 2 12 and 1 53 respectively fig 8 thus kw6 2 and kw8 2 samples deep groundwater are thought to be affected by the penetration of sea water following the earthquake this is consistent with the strontium data which also indicate possible seawater intrusion in the case of kw6 2 we used 2172 otus that were present at a certain abundance and dominant species in the individual samples fig 9 the phylogenetic tree shows the dominant bacteria species at the study site the predominant bacteria are pseudomonas and flavobacterium in most of the samples these microbiological features of the groundwater in the study site indicate that bacteria genera such as pseudomonas and flavobacterium may be highly correlated with the earthquake of gyeongju 4 conclusions studying the microbial features of groundwater aquifer systems together with the chemical indicators therein after earthquakes is important in gyeongju korea a seismically active area that also depends on groundwater for agricultural uses and drinking water we found that the ml 5 8 gyeongju earthquake and its more than 640 aftershocks had strong impacts on the groundwater ecosystem the dominant bacterial species flavobacterium and pseudomonas and chemical values rn sr and he of sample groundwater after the earthquakes indicated that the subsurface water environment changed for the aquifer system the gyeongju earthquake disrupted the groundwater signature that distinguishes the shallow and deep aquifers this disruption is especially prominent in wells located adjacent to the epicenter there have been only a few reports on the microbial features in the groundwater after earthquakes in combination with the chemical data in this study we evaluated both the microbial community and hydrochemical changes in groundwater caused by the mainshock and aftershocks of the gyeongju earthquake the microbial data more clearly supported the interpretation of groundwater chemistry data influenced by the earthquake we found the archaea thaumarchaeota which is related to the marine group particularly arch 2 and arch 3 which are archaea from deep sea hydrothermal vents indicating seawater intrusion as suggested by the sr data moreover the relatively higher values of 3he 4he and 4he ne ratios in kw5 2 after the earthquake can be explained by the addition of primitive 3he from the fluid flow through the fracture moreover the lower value of 3he 4he and higher values of 4he ne in kw8 2 and kw11 2 after the earthquake were likely caused by the additional radiogenic helium source in the crust mixing with air derived from the mixing of shallow groundwater and air saturated groundwater produced by earthquake fracture these data about noble gas are highly correlated with the bacteria phylum compositions and upgma grouping in addition the phylogenetic relationship among the most abundant bacteria in the earthquake area are correlated to the microbial species that are said to emerge after earthquakes in the literature the 16s rrna sequencing and metagenomics will allow a more comprehensive understanding of microbial features of the aquifer and their effects at earthquake sites further studies will aim to increase the frequency of post earthquake sampling in order to better evaluate the hydro chemical anomalies of microbial community located in wells adjacent to the epicenter despite the limitations of sampling the results of this study provide useful information on how a large scale earthquake affects the

5696,dilution chemical precipitation biological uptake and inflow inputs are important processes regulating stream water chemistry but quantitative evaluations of their relative contributions are rare we examined stream water chemistry and discharge in two streams one heavily affected by volcanic activities one much less so and their confluence to evaluate the importance of these processes with special emphasis on dilution and precipitation on reducing solute concentrations in northern taiwan we found that differences in the relative importance of the four processes led to three scenarios of upstream downstream patterns of solute concentrations and fluxes in scenario i solute concentration was greater but flux was smaller in the upstream than the downstream likely due to dilution through the input of lateral inflows with low solute concentrations in scenario ii both solute concentration and flux were greater in the downstream likely because the inflow water contained high solute concentrations in scenario iii both solute concentration and flux were greater in the upstream likely because chemical precipitation dominated the upstream downstream pattern dilution accounts for 63 7 1 1 of the reduction of concentrations of all solutes in the confluence due to the input of relatively clean water from the less contaminated stream net precipitation effect was solute specific and was positive only for fe and po4 3 it reduced concentration of fe by 79 0 07 and po4 3 by 49 0 25 likely due to decreases of solubility with increases in ph frequent mild rainfall is more effective than more extreme rainfall on lowering solute concentrations because the dilution effects of even large rainfall are short lived the projected increases in drought events will reduce dilution effects when the need for diverting water from clean streams for anthropogenic uses is greater making water resource management more challenging keywords acidification chemical precipitation dilution effect stream water chemistry lateral inflow 1 introduction acidification is an environmental issue that has extensively affected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at the global scale he et al 1999 driscoll et al 2001 2003 in aquatic ecosystems high acidity not only impairs the physiological function of organisms but also increases the dissolution of many metal elements of bed rocks into the stream with the potential of threating aquatic biodiversity mcknight and feder 1984 baker et al 1996 dey et al 2009 acid precipitation exacerbated by anthropogenic activities has also been linked to rock weathering and drawdown of atmospheric co2 thus affecting long term carbon cycle and global climate kump et al 2000 stegen et al 2018 in addition to acidification resulting from combustion of fossil fuels acidification from acid mining drainage and natural sources such as volcanic emissions are also widely observed across the globe ezoe et al 2002 löhr et al 2005 da silva et al 2006 kim et al 2009 hogsden and harding 2011 effects of acidification caused by the combustion of fossil fuels can be and have been shown to recover via air pollution control measures such as the clean air act in the us and the convention on long range transboundary air pollution in europe likens et al 1996 stoddard et al 1999 keller et al 2003 kuklinska et al 2015 in contrast regulation of the negative effects of acidification resulting from natural sources largely relies on natural processes such as dilution chemical precipitation and biological uptake biological uptake could be an effective pollutant removal process and has been used to extract or remove metal pollutants from contaminated soil and water tangahu et al 2011 however the application of phytoremediation is typically limited to certain anthropogenically polluted soils and water bodies in most natural streams and lakes biological uptake may lead to biomagnification with the risk of adversely affecting organisms at the top of the food chain barbosa et al 2003 dilution and chemical precipitation are two important natural processes that contribute to reducing solute concentrations in stream water dilution reduces the acidity and solute concentrations by increasing the amount of solvent water while precipitation regulates solute concentrations because the solubility of many chemicals decreases with increasing ph as such some solutes precipitate to solid compounds e g carbonate precipitation brady et al 1986 munk and faure 2004 sarmiento et al 2012 representing a transfer of solutes from the water to soil sediment ions of iron fe and aluminum al tend to have high concentrations in acidified stream water however they will precipitate as hydroxides e g fe oh 3 sulfates or other compounds in solutions at high ph values mcknight and feder 1984 moreover some of the precipitated compounds can adsorb other metal elements e g arsenic and thereby reduce their concentrations in the stream lee et al 2002 munk et al 2002 asta et al 2010 in west java the ciwidey river is acidified by volcanogenic materials leading to stream water ph as low as 1 0 and high concentrations of metal elements sriwana et al 1998 the acidity and solute concentrations may gradually decrease downstream after it mixes with lateral inflow or merges with another stream that has much lower volcanic influences due to both dilutions from the clean water and precipitation caused by increases of ph during the mixing merging sriwana et al 1998 the inflows however may intensify the acidity or increase solute concentrations if these waters have higher acidity or higher solute contents the chemical mechanisms involved in the precipitation of metal ions have been widely studied nordstrom and ball 1986 neal 1988 tipping et al 2002 sheoran and sheoran 2006 chen and jiang 2012 many studies have examined the effects of rainfall control of heavy metal export in acid mine drainage johnson and thornton 1987 kimball et al 1994 davies et al 2011 however few studies have examined the chemical precipitation processes in relation to stream discharge or rainfall regimes under other conditions such as the volcanically acidified stream water high quality stream water is important for domestic and industrial water uses but directing clean water for such uses will reduce its dilution effects and may also lower precipitation effects if it has high ph quantifying the relative contributions of the different processes on regulating stream water chemistry along the river reaches is critical because the processes in different reaches could have very different effects on aquatic systems for example if much of the reduction of solute concentrations is due to dilution the same amount of the solute remains in the stream water and available to aquatic organisms in contrast if much of the reduction is due to precipitation the risk of bioaccumulation via direct uptake by aquatic plants and animals may be relatively low herrmann and frick 1995 denicola and stapleton 2002 battaglia et al 2005 in this study we monitored water quality and quantity of two streams one very acidic due to volcanic influences one much less acidic and

resources agency of taiwan at 4 7 km downstream of the confluence 2 2 water sampling stream water samples 500 ml each were taken weekly from an upstream site and a downstream site for the macao stream mu md and the lujiaokeng stream lu ld and from their confluence c fig 1 between december 2016 and december 2017 in june 2nd 2017 the sampling was only conducted in the macao stream for safety concerns due to high stream water level associated with torrential rain the distance between the upstream site and downstream site is approximately 400 m at the lujiaokeng stream and 700 m at the macao stream the differences in sampling distance between the upstream and downstream sites were due to the differences in accessibility of the two streams stream water samples were manually collected and poured into 500 ml polypropylene bottles for transportation to the laboratory 2 3 chemical analyses the ph and conductivity of the water samples were measured in the field immediately after each collection

limit of 0 01 μm 2 4 streamflow modeling and measurement stream discharge was estimated using the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model a lumped rainfall runoff model at catchment scale bergström and forsman 1973 the details of the hbv model and streamflow simulation are described in the supplementary material fig s1 s2 and table s1 s2 briefly the hbv model used rainfall temperature evapotranspiration estimated by temperature and humidity to simulate the streamflow daily rainfall and air temperature were obtained from five rainfall monitoring stations locations indicated in fig 1 these rainfall stations were deployed as part of the da tun rain gauge network dtrgn maintained by the department of atmospheric sciences national taiwan university the evapotranspiration was estimated by the linacre method linacre 1977 using the evapotranspiration package of r guo et al 2016 the modelling period was from december 1 2016 to december 30 2017 with the first 30 days used for modelling warmup the streamflow simulation was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the daily streamflow at the confluence was used to calibrate model parameters the best performed parameter combination was then applied for the daily streamflow estimation in the macao stream and the lujiaokeng stream 2 5 estimate of solute flux in streams variations of in stream solute concentrations and fluxes mainly result from biological and chemical reaction or hydrologic transport kimbal et al 1994 in this study instream solute concentrations and fluxes of the macao stream were affected by two sources of inflows lateral inflow and inflow from the lujiaokeng stream when it merges with the macao the solute flux was estimated for three reaches the lu ld reach i e between an upstream site and a downstream site of the lujiaokeng stream the mu md reach i e between an upstream site and a downstream site of the macao stream and the md c reach i e between the downstream site of the macao stream and the confluence of the lujiaokeng stream and the macao stream the reaches of lu ld and mu md were used to estimate the influences of lateral inflow along the reach of md c instream solute concentrations were affected mainly by the inflow from the lujiaokeng stream the flux f of each solute was estimated by multiplying solute concentration c by simulated streamflow qsim eq 1 as 1 f c q sim in md c reach the flux at site c fc is separated into the flux from ld fld md fmd lateral inflow fli chemical precipitation fcp and biological uptake fb 2 f c f ld f md f li f cp f b the fli fcp and fb are unknown fluxes and treated as one parameter the flux of net precipitation fnp see discussion for detail can be expressed as f np f cp f b f li thus a mass balance of fnp can be re expressed by rearrangement of the net precipitation effect as 4 f np f ld f md f c the precipitation effect expressed as a ratio of sum of flux from upstream sites to the md c reach i e fld fmd can calculated as 5 precipitation effect f np f md f ld the precipitation effect ranges from 1 to negative infinity a precipitation effect between 1 and 0 indicates that the net precipitation i e fnp accounts for 100 to 0 of upstream solute flux respectively a negative value on the other hand indicates a net solute addition from lateral inflow i e greater lateral inflow input than net instream precipitation we also introduced a dilution ratio defined as streamflow in lujiaokeng stream relative to the streamflow at confluence to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of the dilution effect we also evaluated the precipitation effect of the two reaches mu md and lu ld because there is no major branch merging with either of the two reaches the net precipitation effects of the two reaches can be used to contrast between an acidic stream and a relatively clean stream 2 6 statistical analyses paired t tests were used to examine the differences in solute concentrations and solute yields between the upstream and downstream sites in the lu ld reach he mu md reach and the md c reach by paired t test and repeated measures analysis of variance anova respectively 3 results the simulations of stream discharge are shown in the supplementary material the hbv models performed well for streamflow modeling fig s1 and s2 with the nse ranging from 0 74 to 0 98 table s3 supporting the reliability of the estimated solute fluxes the averages of daily streamflow rate were 0 59 0 54 0 44 0 56 and 1 17 1 25 m3 s 1 for the lujiaokeng stream the macao stream and the confluence respectively concentrations of all solutes except no3 negatively correlated with streamflow at all sites and the correlation was significant for all solutes except for fe at lu and ld and po4 3 at the confluence table 1 although no3 also negatively correlated with streamflow at md it positively correlated with streamflow at lu ld mu and c table 1 orp was also positively correlated with stream flow at lu and c but not significantly correlated with streamflow in other sites table 1 the correlation coefficients between solute concentration and streamflow of the upstream and downstream sites were consistently similar for most solutes with a few notable exceptions in which the differences were more than 0 20 table 1 the absolute values of correlation coefficients between streamflow and concentrations of cl and al at lu were considerably greater than at ld table 1 the absolute values of correlation coefficients of fe and po4 3 were considerably greater at md than c table 1 in contrast the absolute value of na was greater at c than md table 1 the relationship between streamflow and no3 concentration was unique first all the upstream downstream differences in the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 2 second in the lu ld reach the difference in the relationship was quantitative from more positive to less positive but the relationship changed qualitatively in the mu md reach from positive to negative and the md c reach from negative to positive table 1 the temporal patterns of h cl and fe concentrations of the three reaches were illustrated in fig 2 the three solutes were chosen because h concentration is related to stream acidification cl is a biologically and chemically conservative in streams and fe has the most pronounced chemical precipitation see discussion for h the temporal fluctuation was similar between the upstream and downstream sites in the lu ld reach with lower concentrations during the wet season especially at ld fig 2a along the mu md reach the downstream h concentration was considerably lower than but basically echoed the fluctuation of the upstream fig 2b at the md c reach h concentration was consistently much lower and with much smaller fluctuation at the c than md fig 2b the cl showed small temporal variation in the lu ld reach and high temporal fluctuation along the mu md and md c reaches fig 2c and d although all three reaches showed consistent temporal patterns of dilution from upstream to downstream the effects were more pronounced along the mu md and md c reaches than along the lu ld reach fig 2c and d the temporal upstream downstream pattern of fe concentration in lujiaokeng stream varied considerably in the first three months but then became very similar throughout the rest of the sampling year in the lu ld reach fig 2e in contrast the temporal pattern of fe concentration was very similar between mu and md with the concentration consistently lower at md than mu fig 2f in the md c reach the concentration of fe was consistently extremely low throughout the sampling year at the confluence fig 2f the upstream downstream patterns of solute concentrations and fluxes of the three reaches are shown in figs 3 and 4 in general the solute concentrations along the lu ld reach changed only slightly but much more along the mu md reach i e greater dilution fig 3 in lujiaokeng stream concentrations of all solutes were statistically different between lu and ld except no3 fig 3 the concentration of no3 remained relatively unchanged between 2 73 and 2 88 ppm along the reach of lu ld fig 3 like no3 orp also changed little between lu 25 4 5 2 mv and ld 24 9 1 6 mv concentrations of most other solutes at ld were significantly lower than that at lu in contrast concentrations of fe and po4 3 were higher at ld than lu fig 3a for the mu md reach concentrations of all solutes except no3 were lower at the md than mu while the concentration of no3 was significantly higher at md than mu fig 3b orp was also lower at md 223 2 0 mv than mu 239 1 6 mv and both are much greater than lu 25 4 5 2 mv and ld 24 9 1 6 mv similarly along the md c reach concentrations of all solutes except no3 were lower at the c than md while the concentration of no3 was significantly higher at c than md fig 3b orp was also lower at c 193 3 2 mv than md 223 2 0 mv notably the ph of md ranged from 2 6 to 3 9 while it ranged from 3 2 to 4 6 at the confluence site c with 36 out of 48 observations lower than 4 0 the upstream downstream patterns of solute fluxes were very different from the patterns of solute concentrations while most solutes showed higher concentrations at the upstream sites than the downstream sites the fluxes of most solutes showed the opposite higher in the downstream sites than the upstream sites fig 4a and b the only exceptions to the greater downstream than upstream fluxes are po4 3 and fe in the mu md and md c reaches which had smaller fluxes in the downstream sites than the upstream sites fig 4b however area weighted flux yield kg km2 d of most solutes show upstream downstream patterns fig 4c and d similar to that of solute concentrations higher at upstream than downstream sites for most solutes although some of the differences were not significant fig 4c and d the precipitation effect of all solutes along the reach of lu ld was negative showing a net addition in this reach particularly for fe and po4 3 fig 5 a by contrast a substantial precipitation effect was observed for fe and po4 3 in the mu md and md c reaches fig 5b and c the precipitation effect reduced 15 of fe flux and 35 po4 3 flux along the mu md reach greater precipitation effects 69 for fe and 44 for po4 3 were found along the md c reach unlike the precipitation effect which was solute specific dilution has a universal effect on all solutes with a dilution effect on reducing solute concentration 0 637 0 011 in the md c reach fig 5c proportional to amount of the input of relatively clean water from the lujiaokeng stream 4 discussions 4 1 upstream downstream patterns of solute concentration and flux the differences in the upstream downstream patterns of simple solute fluxes and area weighted fluxes indicates that much of the greater flux at the downstream sites for most solutes was due to greater water input associated with greater drainage area thus although solute concentrations was diluted by the much greater water input total flux not area weighted was greater at the downstream site for most solutes to explore the processes regulating solute concentrations and fluxes the upstream downstream patterns of solute concentration and total solute flux are grouped into three scenarios depending on the relative importance of four processes dilution chemical precipitation biological uptake and inputs from inflows from ground water or branch water table 2 in scenario i solute concentration is greater but solute flux is smaller in the upstream site than the downstream site i e cu cd but fu fd and is likely dominated by dilution from water of lateral inflows with lower solute concentrations than those in the upstream water in our study all solutes in the lu ld reach and all solutes except fe and po4 3 in both the mu md and md c reaches belonged to the dilution dominated scenario i figs 3 and 4 under such a scenario there was a net dilution of solute concentrations although input from lateral inflows increased the total amount of solutes chemical precipitation and biological uptake were either negligible or the effects were much smaller than the input from lateral inflows so that fd was greater than fu the pattern of h in the macao stream also fitted scenario i fig 2b and suggested that the inflow water was less acidic than the upstream water despite the overall dominance of dilution for all analyzed solutes other than fe and po4 3 positive precipitation effect values were occasionally observed for all solutes in the md c reach and some solutes in the other two reaches but with lower probability as evidenced by the inclusion of zero with one positive standard deviation fig 5 the solutes might be subjected to precipitation under certain chemical environments in the md c reach but unlike fe and p the amounts removed through this process were smaller than the inputs from lateral inflow leading to the overall increases of their flux downstream fig 4b in scenario ii both solute concentration and flux are smaller in the upstream site than downstream site i e cu cd and fu fd and likely occurs when the lateral inflow water contained higher concentration of solutes than that at the upstream water table 2 in this study scenario ii was found for no3 in the three reaches and for fe and po4 3 in the reach of lu ld figs 3 and 4 although biological demands for no3 fe and po4 3 could be substantial the greater flux in the downstream sites suggested that biological uptake should not be a dominant process comparing with input from inflow water possibly due to agriculture activities and domestic sewage in the cases of no3 and po4 3 similarly although the possibility of chemical precipitation cannot be ruled out it should not a dominant process determining the upstream downstream pattern of solute concentration and flux because if it was the dominant process the flux would be lower at the downstream site than the upstream site in scenario iii both solute concentration and flux are greater in the upstream site i e cu cd and fu fd than the downstream site illustrating that chemical precipitation dominates the upstream downstream pattern table 2 in this study scenario iii can be illustrated by the greater concentrations and fluxes of po4 3 and fe fluxes in the upstream site than downstream site in the reaches of mu md and md c figs 3 and 4 although biological uptake could also contribute to lower solute fluxes at the downstream site we do not think it was the dominant process although fe has been proposed as a limiting nutrient of phytoplankton chappell et al 2015 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 if it is in our case we should also see the same pattern in the lu ld reach in which the concentration of fe was the lowest among the three reaches and as such should be more limiting and subject to greater biological uptake a simple mass balance based box model could summarize solute inputs to the downstream site of the confluence from all tributaries two solutes are illustrated in the model cl as an example of non reactive solutes and fe as an example of reactive solutes fig 6 from the simple model it is clear that in addition to inflow groundwater is an important source for both cl and fe in addition fe shows substantial precipitation at the mu md reach and very high precipitation at the md c reach fig 6 likely due to the substantial increases in stream water ph i e decreases in acidity fig 2 the simple box model appears to be a concise way to show changes in solute transport in all reaches and illustrate important processes regulating solute transport along the flow paths stream water acidity likely plays a key role on the presence and magnitude of a precipitation effect it has been reported that iron precipitates when solution ph is around 3 5 4 0 wei et al 2005 stream water ph was 2 6 3 9 in the mu md reach and 3 2 4 6 in the confluence thus the acidity of stream water in the md c reach was more in favor of the precipitation reaction relative to that in the mu md reach leading to the greater precipitation effects for po4 3 0 44 and fe 0 69 in the md c reach than in the mu md 0 15 for po4 3 and 0 35 for fe the ph in the macao stream and the confluence was mostly below the reported critical ph of 4 5 for al precipitation neal 1988 thus there was limited precipitation of al the influence of ph on the fe precipitation effect between two reaches was further supported by the relationship of flux difference between upstream and downstream sites of the mu md and md c reaches for fe δfe and h δh fig 7 the linear relationship between δfe and δh illustrated the quantitative decreases in fe concentration by net precipitation with decreases in stream water acidity standardized by the values at the upstream site the greater standardized precipitation effect for fe in the md c reach than in the mu md reach as reflected by the steeper slope in the md c reach slope 0 069 than the mu md reach slope 0 024 fig 7 was in agreement with the greater precipitation effect in the md c reach than the mu md reach fig 5 to our knowledge this is the first report of the linear relationship between δfe and δh using empirical data the standardized precipitation effect described here could be applied to other heavy metals notably because stream discharge should gradually increase from the upstream to the downstream the fourth potential scenario in which solute concentration is greater in downstream than upstream but solute flux is greater in upstream i e cu cd but fu fd is theoretically unlikely we did not observe this pattern in our study if it happens it is quite likely that some of the stream water may have seeped into deep groundwater and was not measured in the downstream site to simplify the upstream downstream patterns we did not include scenarios of cu cd or fu fd because in the real world there are always some differences although they could be small the combination of the dilution and precipitation effects led to the decrease of fe concentration from 2 86 1 33 ppm at md to 0 26 0 13 ppm at c and the concentration of po4 3 from 0 10 0 04 ppm to 0 03 0 01 ppm dilution reduced the concentration of all solutes by 63 7 1 1 while precipitation further reduced the concentration of fe by 79 0 07 and po4 3 by 49 0 25 in the md c reach our results illustrated that chemical precipitation could be as important as dilution on the regulation of in stream concentrations for certain solutes 4 2 the role of rainfall on dilution and precipitation effects although precipitation in our study site is acidic with a mean ph 4 5 in both the lujiaokeng stream and the macao stream huang et al 2018 it did not contribute to acidify the macao stream because the ph of the macao stream 2 6 to 3 9 was much lower than that of rainfall instead it helped to raise the ph as was evident from the greater ph at the md 3 32 than mu 2 88 moreover the concentrations of most solutes in rainfall huang et al 2018 was much lower than that in the stream water fig 3 so that base flow and interflow were likely key to the greater solute concentrations in the macao stream relative to that in the lujiaokeng stream although the relatively less contaminated rainfall helped to dilute stream solute concentrations direct input from rain water to stream water is likely small due to the small stream surface thus the input of clean and higher ph water from the lujiaokeng stream should be much more important in the dilution and precipitation of solutes than input of solutes to the confluence according to the results of the hbv model the maximal soil moisture storage fc is 0 87 mm table s2 when rainfall exceeded the moisture storage capacity the excessive rain water would either infiltrate into underground reservoirs or convert into surface runoff which diluted solute concentrations in the water downstream thus even small rainfall events 1 mm falling on the near saturated riparian zone can dilute the chemicals in the macao stream the maximal duration of the flow bmax within the watershed was 0 52 day 1 table s2 indicating that all the rainfall input to the watershed would turn to discharge in the stream in approximately half a day thus the dilution effect associated with even large rainfall events is rapid but short lived for example the dilution effect of a 65 mm rainfall event in july 29 2017 lasted only 2 days fig s3 4 3 the potential impact of climate change water of the macao stream and the confluence had high concentrations of metal elements that could negatively affect aquatic organisms especially in the low flow periods because of the limited dilution effect climate change has been suggested to increase the fluctuation of rainfall with more frequent drought and flood events in various regions across the globe novotny and stefan 2007 trenberth 2011 zhang et al 2011 a study projected that the wet season will get wetter while the dry season will be drier in northern taiwan where our study site is located yu and wang 2009 if drought becomes more frequent and longer both the dilution and the precipitation effects may also be negatively affected due to the lack of input of clean water i e low solute concentrations with high ph from the less contaminated lujiaokeng stream the convectional rains and typhoon rains in summer may help to enhance the regulation function but as described above their effects on elevating stream discharge are short lived lasting only one to a few days and so will be the associated dilution effect and precipitation effect in the wet seasons the projected increases of rainfall can improve the dilution effect however if heavy rainfall becomes more violent it may lead to poor water quality due to high turbidity in addition to the flooding risk and the short lived dilution effect frequent but mild rainfall is ideal for the regulation of chemistry of streams with high solute concentrations the projected climate change with more frequent floods and prolong drought events will negatively affect both the dilution and precipitation effects and as a result impose greater challenges in water management 5 conclusions this study illustrated the effects of chemical precipitation and hydrologic transport on in stream solute chemistry in the acidic streams the proposed three scenarios of upstream downstream solute concentration and flux patterns can help to identify the four key processes hydrologic dilution and enrichment chemical precipitation and biological uptake that regulate stream water chemistry changes in concentrations of cl so4 2 na mg k ca and al from upstream to downstream were dominated by dilution and no3 was dominated by enrichment effect large amounts 15 to 70 of fe and po4 3 were removed by chemical precipitation because instream ph met a suitable ph range for chemical precipitation in the mu md and md c reaches in contrast in stream ph was lower than the ideal ph range for al precipitation our study quantitatively assessed the mechanisms determining stream water chemistry based on monitoring of solute concentrations and streamflow simulations using hydrological models in this case the hbv model this approach could be used as a first order assessment to determine the key processes along the river reaches and be applied to predict the impact of climate change on in stream solute transports by modeling potential scenarios under different projections of climate change

5696,dilution chemical precipitation biological uptake and inflow inputs are important processes regulating stream water chemistry but quantitative evaluations of their relative contributions are rare we examined stream water chemistry and discharge in two streams one heavily affected by volcanic activities one much less so and their confluence to evaluate the importance of these processes with special emphasis on dilution and precipitation on reducing solute concentrations in northern taiwan we found that differences in the relative importance of the four processes led to three scenarios of upstream downstream patterns of solute concentrations and fluxes in scenario i solute concentration was greater but flux was smaller in the upstream than the downstream likely due to dilution through the input of lateral inflows with low solute concentrations in scenario ii both solute concentration and flux were greater in the downstream likely because the inflow water contained high solute concentrations in scenario iii both solute concentration and flux were greater in the upstream likely because chemical precipitation dominated the upstream downstream pattern dilution accounts for 63 7 1 1 of the reduction of concentrations of all solutes in the confluence due to the input of relatively clean water from the less contaminated stream net precipitation effect was solute specific and was positive only for fe and po4 3 it reduced concentration of fe by 79 0 07 and po4 3 by 49 0 25 likely due to decreases of solubility with increases in ph frequent mild rainfall is more effective than more extreme rainfall on lowering solute concentrations because the dilution effects of even large rainfall are short lived the projected increases in drought events will reduce dilution effects when the need for diverting water from clean streams for anthropogenic uses is greater making water resource management more challenging keywords acidification chemical precipitation dilution effect stream water chemistry lateral inflow 1 introduction acidification is an environmental issue that has extensively affected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at the global scale he et al 1999 driscoll et al 2001 2003 in aquatic ecosystems high acidity not only impairs the physiological function of organisms but also increases the dissolution of many metal elements of bed rocks into the stream with the potential of threating aquatic biodiversity mcknight and feder 1984 baker et al 1996 dey et al 2009 acid precipitation exacerbated by anthropogenic activities has also been linked to rock weathering and drawdown of atmospheric co2 thus affecting long term carbon cycle and global climate kump et al 2000 stegen et al 2018 in addition to acidification resulting from combustion of fossil fuels acidification from acid mining drainage and natural sources such as volcanic emissions are also widely observed across the globe ezoe et al 2002 löhr et al 2005 da silva et al 2006 kim et al 2009 hogsden and harding 2011 effects of acidification caused by the combustion of fossil fuels can be and have been shown to recover via air pollution control measures such as the clean air act in the us and the convention on long range transboundary air pollution in europe likens et al 1996 stoddard et al 1999 keller et al 2003 kuklinska et al 2015 in contrast regulation of the negative effects of acidification resulting from natural sources largely relies on natural processes such as dilution chemical precipitation and biological uptake biological uptake could be an effective pollutant removal process and has been used to extract or remove metal pollutants from contaminated soil and water tangahu et al 2011 however the application of phytoremediation is typically limited to certain anthropogenically polluted soils and water bodies in most natural streams and lakes biological uptake may lead to biomagnification with the risk of adversely affecting organisms at the top of the food chain barbosa et al 2003 dilution and chemical precipitation are two important natural processes that contribute to reducing solute concentrations in stream water dilution reduces the acidity and solute concentrations by increasing the amount of solvent water while precipitation regulates solute concentrations because the solubility of many chemicals decreases with increasing ph as such some solutes precipitate to solid compounds e g carbonate precipitation brady et al 1986 munk and faure 2004 sarmiento et al 2012 representing a transfer of solutes from the water to soil sediment ions of iron fe and aluminum al tend to have high concentrations in acidified stream water however they will precipitate as hydroxides e g fe oh 3 sulfates or other compounds in solutions at high ph values mcknight and feder 1984 moreover some of the precipitated compounds can adsorb other metal elements e g arsenic and thereby reduce their concentrations in the stream lee et al 2002 munk et al 2002 asta et al 2010 in west java the ciwidey river is acidified by volcanogenic materials leading to stream water ph as low as 1 0 and high concentrations of metal elements sriwana et al 1998 the acidity and solute concentrations may gradually decrease downstream after it mixes with lateral inflow or merges with another stream that has much lower volcanic influences due to both dilutions from the clean water and precipitation caused by increases of ph during the mixing merging sriwana et al 1998 the inflows however may intensify the acidity or increase solute concentrations if these waters have higher acidity or higher solute contents the chemical mechanisms involved in the precipitation of metal ions have been widely studied nordstrom and ball 1986 neal 1988 tipping et al 2002 sheoran and sheoran 2006 chen and jiang 2012 many studies have examined the effects of rainfall control of heavy metal export in acid mine drainage johnson and thornton 1987 kimball et al 1994 davies et al 2011 however few studies have examined the chemical precipitation processes in relation to stream discharge or rainfall regimes under other conditions such as the volcanically acidified stream water high quality stream water is important for domestic and industrial water uses but directing clean water for such uses will reduce its dilution effects and may also lower precipitation effects if it has high ph quantifying the relative contributions of the different processes on regulating stream water chemistry along the river reaches is critical because the processes in different reaches could have very different effects on aquatic systems for example if much of the reduction of solute concentrations is due to dilution the same amount of the solute remains in the stream water and available to aquatic organisms in contrast if much of the reduction is due to precipitation the risk of bioaccumulation via direct uptake by aquatic plants and animals may be relatively low herrmann and frick 1995 denicola and stapleton 2002 battaglia et al 2005 in this study we monitored water quality and quantity of two streams one very acidic due to volcanic influences one much less acidic and

limit of 0 01 μm 2 4 streamflow modeling and measurement stream discharge was estimated using the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model a lumped rainfall runoff model at catchment scale bergström and forsman 1973 the details of the hbv model and streamflow simulation are described in the supplementary material fig s1 s2 and table s1 s2 briefly the hbv model used rainfall temperature evapotranspiration estimated by temperature and humidity to simulate the streamflow daily rainfall and air temperature were obtained from five rainfall monitoring stations locations indicated in fig 1 these rainfall stations were deployed as part of the da tun rain gauge network dtrgn maintained by the department of atmospheric sciences national taiwan university the evapotranspiration was estimated by the linacre method linacre 1977 using the evapotranspiration package of r guo et al 2016 the modelling period was from december 1 2016 to december 30 2017 with the first 30 days used for modelling warmup the streamflow simulation was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the daily streamflow at the confluence was used to calibrate model parameters the best performed parameter combination was then applied for the daily streamflow estimation in the macao stream and the lujiaokeng stream 2 5 estimate of solute flux in streams variations of in stream solute concentrations and fluxes mainly result from biological and chemical reaction or hydrologic transport kimbal et al 1994 in this study instream solute concentrations and fluxes of the macao stream were affected by two sources of inflows lateral inflow and inflow from the lujiaokeng stream when it merges with the macao the solute flux was estimated for three reaches the lu ld reach i e between an upstream site and a downstream site of the lujiaokeng stream the mu md reach i e between an upstream site and a downstream site of the macao stream and the md c reach i e between the downstream site of the macao stream and the confluence of the lujiaokeng stream and the macao stream the reaches of lu ld and mu md were used to estimate the influences of lateral inflow along the reach of md c instream solute concentrations were affected mainly by the inflow from the lujiaokeng stream the flux f of each solute was estimated by multiplying solute concentration c by simulated streamflow qsim eq 1 as 1 f c q sim in md c reach the flux at site c fc is separated into the flux from ld fld md fmd lateral inflow fli chemical precipitation fcp and biological uptake fb 2 f c f ld f md f li f cp f b the fli fcp and fb are unknown fluxes and treated as one parameter the flux of net precipitation fnp see discussion for detail can be expressed as f np f cp f b f li thus a mass balance of fnp can be re expressed by rearrangement of the net precipitation effect as 4 f np f ld f md f c the precipitation effect expressed as a ratio of sum of flux from upstream sites to the md c reach i e fld fmd can calculated as 5 precipitation effect f np f md f ld the precipitation effect ranges from 1 to negative infinity a precipitation effect between 1 and 0 indicates that the net precipitation i e fnp accounts for 100 to 0 of upstream solute flux respectively a negative value on the other hand indicates a net solute addition from lateral inflow i e greater lateral inflow input than net instream precipitation we also introduced a dilution ratio defined as streamflow in lujiaokeng stream relative to the streamflow at confluence to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of the dilution effect we also evaluated the precipitation effect of the two reaches mu md and lu ld because there is no major branch merging with either of the two reaches the net precipitation effects of the two reaches can be used to contrast between an acidic stream and a relatively clean stream 2 6 statistical analyses paired t tests were used to examine the differences in solute concentrations and solute yields between the upstream and downstream sites in the lu ld reach he mu md reach and the md c reach by paired t test and repeated measures analysis of variance anova respectively 3 results the simulations of stream discharge are shown in the supplementary material the hbv models performed well for streamflow modeling fig s1 and s2 with the nse ranging from 0 74 to 0 98 table s3 supporting the reliability of the estimated solute fluxes the averages of daily streamflow rate were 0 59 0 54 0 44 0 56 and 1 17 1 25 m3 s 1 for the lujiaokeng stream the macao stream and the confluence respectively concentrations of all solutes except no3 negatively correlated with streamflow at all sites and the correlation was significant for all solutes except for fe at lu and ld and po4 3 at the confluence table 1 although no3 also negatively correlated with streamflow at md it positively correlated with streamflow at lu ld mu and c table 1 orp was also positively correlated with stream flow at lu and c but not significantly correlated with streamflow in other sites table 1 the correlation coefficients between solute concentration and streamflow of the upstream and downstream sites were consistently similar for most solutes with a few notable exceptions in which the differences were more than 0 20 table 1 the absolute values of correlation coefficients between streamflow and concentrations of cl and al at lu were considerably greater than at ld table 1 the absolute values of correlation coefficients of fe and po4 3 were considerably greater at md than c table 1 in contrast the absolute value of na was greater at c than md table 1 the relationship between streamflow and no3 concentration was unique first all the upstream downstream differences in the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 2 second in the lu ld reach the difference in the relationship was quantitative from more positive to less positive but the relationship changed qualitatively in the mu md reach from positive to negative and the md c reach from negative to positive table 1 the temporal patterns of h cl and fe concentrations of the three reaches were illustrated in fig 2 the three solutes were chosen because h concentration is related to stream acidification cl is a biologically and chemically conservative in streams and fe has the most pronounced chemical precipitation see discussion for h the temporal fluctuation was similar between the upstream and downstream sites in the lu ld reach with lower concentrations during the wet season especially at ld fig 2a along the mu md reach the downstream h concentration was considerably lower than but basically echoed the fluctuation of the upstream fig 2b at the md c reach h concentration was consistently much lower and with much smaller fluctuation at the c than md fig 2b the cl showed small temporal variation in the lu ld reach and high temporal fluctuation along the mu md and md c reaches fig 2c and d although all three reaches showed consistent temporal patterns of dilution from upstream to downstream the effects were more pronounced along the mu md and md c reaches than along the lu ld reach fig 2c and d the temporal upstream downstream pattern of fe concentration in lujiaokeng stream varied considerably in the first three months but then became very similar throughout the rest of the sampling year in the lu ld reach fig 2e in contrast the temporal pattern of fe concentration was very similar between mu and md with the concentration consistently lower at md than mu fig 2f in the md c reach the concentration of fe was consistently extremely low throughout the sampling year at the confluence fig 2f the upstream downstream patterns of solute concentrations and fluxes of the three reaches are shown in figs 3 and 4 in general the solute concentrations along the lu ld reach changed only slightly but much more along the mu md reach i e greater dilution fig 3 in lujiaokeng stream concentrations of all solutes were statistically different between lu and ld except no3 fig 3 the concentration of no3 remained relatively unchanged between 2 73 and 2 88 ppm along the reach of lu ld fig 3 like no3 orp also changed little between lu 25 4 5 2 mv and ld 24 9 1 6 mv concentrations of most other solutes at ld were significantly lower than that at lu in contrast concentrations of fe and po4 3 were higher at ld than lu fig 3a for the mu md reach concentrations of all solutes except no3 were lower at the md than mu while the concentration of no3 was significantly higher at md than mu fig 3b orp was also lower at md 223 2 0 mv than mu 239 1 6 mv and both are much greater than lu 25 4 5 2 mv and ld 24 9 1 6 mv similarly along the md c reach concentrations of all solutes except no3 were lower at the c than md while the concentration of no3 was significantly higher at c than md fig 3b orp was also lower at c 193 3 2 mv than md 223 2 0 mv notably the ph of md ranged from 2 6 to 3 9 while it ranged from 3 2 to 4 6 at the confluence site c with 36 out of 48 observations lower than 4 0 the upstream downstream patterns of solute fluxes were very different from the patterns of solute concentrations while most solutes showed higher concentrations at the upstream sites than the downstream sites the fluxes of most solutes showed the opposite higher in the downstream sites than the upstream sites fig 4a and b the only exceptions to the greater downstream than upstream fluxes are po4 3 and fe in the mu md and md c reaches which had smaller fluxes in the downstream sites than the upstream sites fig 4b however area weighted flux yield kg km2 d of most solutes show upstream downstream patterns fig 4c and d similar to that of solute concentrations higher at upstream than downstream sites for most solutes although some of the differences were not significant fig 4c and d the precipitation effect of all solutes along the reach of lu ld was negative showing a net addition in this reach particularly for fe and po4 3 fig 5 a by contrast a substantial precipitation effect was observed for fe and po4 3 in the mu md and md c reaches fig 5b and c the precipitation effect reduced 15 of fe flux and 35 po4 3 flux along the mu md reach greater precipitation effects 69 for fe and 44 for po4 3 were found along the md c reach unlike the precipitation effect which was solute specific dilution has a universal effect on all solutes with a dilution effect on reducing solute concentration 0 637 0 011 in the md c reach fig 5c proportional to amount of the input of relatively clean water from the lujiaokeng stream 4 discussions 4 1 upstream downstream patterns of solute concentration and flux the differences in the upstream downstream patterns of simple solute fluxes and area weighted fluxes indicates that much of the greater flux at the downstream sites for most solutes was due to greater water input associated with greater drainage area thus although solute concentrations was diluted by the much greater water input total flux not area weighted was greater at the downstream site for most solutes to explore the processes regulating solute concentrations and fluxes the upstream downstream patterns of solute concentration and total solute flux are grouped into three scenarios depending on the relative importance of four processes dilution chemical precipitation biological uptake and inputs from inflows from ground water or branch water table 2 in scenario i solute concentration is greater but solute flux is smaller in the upstream site than the downstream site i e cu cd but fu fd and is likely dominated by dilution from water of lateral inflows with lower solute concentrations than those in the upstream water in our study all solutes in the lu ld reach and all solutes except fe and po4 3 in both the mu md and md c reaches belonged to the dilution dominated scenario i figs 3 and 4 under such a scenario there was a net dilution of solute concentrations although input from lateral inflows increased the total amount of solutes chemical precipitation and biological uptake were either negligible or the effects were much smaller than the input from lateral inflows so that fd was greater than fu the pattern of h in the macao stream also fitted scenario i fig 2b and suggested that the inflow water was less acidic than the upstream water despite the overall dominance of dilution for all analyzed solutes other than fe and po4 3 positive precipitation effect values were occasionally observed for all solutes in the md c reach and some solutes in the other two reaches but with lower probability as evidenced by the inclusion of zero with one positive standard deviation fig 5 the solutes might be subjected to precipitation under certain chemical environments in the md c reach but unlike fe and p the amounts removed through this process were smaller than the inputs from lateral inflow leading to the overall increases of their flux downstream fig 4b in scenario ii both solute concentration and flux are smaller in the upstream site than downstream site i e cu cd and fu fd and likely occurs when the lateral inflow water contained higher concentration of solutes than that at the upstream water table 2 in this study scenario ii was found for no3 in the three reaches and for fe and po4 3 in the reach of lu ld figs 3 and 4 although biological demands for no3 fe and po4 3 could be substantial the greater flux in the downstream sites suggested that biological uptake should not be a dominant process comparing with input from inflow water possibly due to agriculture activities and domestic sewage in the cases of no3 and po4 3 similarly although the possibility of chemical precipitation cannot be ruled out it should not a dominant process determining the upstream downstream pattern of solute concentration and flux because if it was the dominant process the flux would be lower at the downstream site than the upstream site in scenario iii both solute concentration and flux are greater in the upstream site i e cu cd and fu fd than the downstream site illustrating that chemical precipitation dominates the upstream downstream pattern table 2 in this study scenario iii can be illustrated by the greater concentrations and fluxes of po4 3 and fe fluxes in the upstream site than downstream site in the reaches of mu md and md c figs 3 and 4 although biological uptake could also contribute to lower solute fluxes at the downstream site we do not think it was the dominant process although fe has been proposed as a limiting nutrient of phytoplankton chappell et al 2015 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 if it is in our case we should also see the same pattern in the lu ld reach in which the concentration of fe was the lowest among the three reaches and as such should be more limiting and subject to greater biological uptake a simple mass balance based box model could summarize solute inputs to the downstream site of the confluence from all tributaries two solutes are illustrated in the model cl as an example of non reactive solutes and fe as an example of reactive solutes fig 6 from the simple model it is clear that in addition to inflow groundwater is an important source for both cl and fe in addition fe shows substantial precipitation at the mu md reach and very high precipitation at the md c reach fig 6 likely due to the substantial increases in stream water ph i e decreases in acidity fig 2 the simple box model appears to be a concise way to show changes in solute transport in all reaches and illustrate important processes regulating solute transport along the flow paths stream water acidity likely plays a key role on the presence and magnitude of a precipitation effect it has been reported that iron precipitates when solution ph is around 3 5 4 0 wei et al 2005 stream water ph was 2 6 3 9 in the mu md reach and 3 2 4 6 in the confluence thus the acidity of stream water in the md c reach was more in favor of the precipitation reaction relative to that in the mu md reach leading to the greater precipitation effects for po4 3 0 44 and fe 0 69 in the md c reach than in the mu md 0 15 for po4 3 and 0 35 for fe the ph in the macao stream and the confluence was mostly below the reported critical ph of 4 5 for al precipitation neal 1988 thus there was limited precipitation of al the influence of ph on the fe precipitation effect between two reaches was further supported by the relationship of flux difference between upstream and downstream sites of the mu md and md c reaches for fe δfe and h δh fig 7 the linear relationship between δfe and δh illustrated the quantitative decreases in fe concentration by net precipitation with decreases in stream water acidity standardized by the values at the upstream site the greater standardized precipitation effect for fe in the md c reach than in the mu md reach as reflected by the steeper slope in the md c reach slope 0 069 than the mu md reach slope 0 024 fig 7 was in agreement with the greater precipitation effect in the md c reach than the mu md reach fig 5 to our knowledge this is the first report of the linear relationship between δfe and δh using empirical data the standardized precipitation effect described here could be applied to other heavy metals notably because stream discharge should gradually increase from the upstream to the downstream the fourth potential scenario in which solute concentration is greater in downstream than upstream but solute flux is greater in upstream i e cu cd but fu fd is theoretically unlikely we did not observe this pattern in our study if it happens it is quite likely that some of the stream water may have seeped into deep groundwater and was not measured in the downstream site to simplify the upstream downstream patterns we did not include scenarios of cu cd or fu fd because in the real world there are always some differences although they could be small the combination of the dilution and precipitation effects led to the decrease of fe concentration from 2 86 1 33 ppm at md to 0 26 0 13 ppm at c and the concentration of po4 3 from 0 10 0 04 ppm to 0 03 0 01 ppm dilution reduced the concentration of all solutes by 63 7 1 1 while precipitation further reduced the concentration of fe by 79 0 07 and po4 3 by 49 0 25 in the md c reach our results illustrated that chemical precipitation could be as important as dilution on the regulation of in stream concentrations for certain solutes 4 2 the role of rainfall on dilution and precipitation effects although precipitation in our study site is acidic with a mean ph 4 5 in both the lujiaokeng stream and the macao stream huang et al 2018 it did not contribute to acidify the macao stream because the ph of the macao stream 2 6 to 3 9 was much lower than that of rainfall instead it helped to raise the ph as was evident from the greater ph at the md 3 32 than mu 2 88 moreover the concentrations of most solutes in rainfall huang et al 2018 was much lower than that in the stream water fig 3 so that base flow and interflow were likely key to the greater solute concentrations in the macao stream relative to that in the lujiaokeng stream although the relatively less contaminated rainfall helped to dilute stream solute concentrations direct input from rain water to stream water is likely small due to the small stream surface thus the input of clean and higher ph water from the lujiaokeng stream should be much more important in the dilution and precipitation of solutes than input of solutes to the confluence according to the results of the hbv model the maximal soil moisture storage fc is 0 87 mm table s2 when rainfall exceeded the moisture storage capacity the excessive rain water would either infiltrate into underground reservoirs or convert into surface runoff which diluted solute concentrations in the water downstream thus even small rainfall events 1 mm falling on the near saturated riparian zone can dilute the chemicals in the macao stream the maximal duration of the flow bmax within the watershed was 0 52 day 1 table s2 indicating that all the rainfall input to the watershed would turn to discharge in the stream in approximately half a day thus the dilution effect associated with even large rainfall events is rapid but short lived for example the dilution effect of a 65 mm rainfall event in july 29 2017 lasted only 2 days fig s3 4 3 the potential impact of climate change water of the macao stream and the confluence had high concentrations of metal elements that could negatively affect aquatic organisms especially in the low flow periods because of the limited dilution effect climate change has been suggested to increase the fluctuation of rainfall with more frequent drought and flood events in various regions across the globe novotny and stefan 2007 trenberth 2011 zhang et al 2011 a study projected that the wet season will get wetter while the dry season will be drier in northern taiwan where our study site is located yu and wang 2009 if drought becomes more frequent and longer both the dilution and the precipitation effects may also be negatively affected due to the lack of input of clean water i e low solute concentrations with high ph from the less contaminated lujiaokeng stream the convectional rains and typhoon rains in summer may help to enhance the regulation function but as described above their effects on elevating stream discharge are short lived lasting only one to a few days and so will be the associated dilution effect and precipitation effect in the wet seasons the projected increases of rainfall can improve the dilution effect however if heavy rainfall becomes more violent it may lead to poor water quality due to high turbidity in addition to the flooding risk and the short lived dilution effect frequent but mild rainfall is ideal for the regulation of chemistry of streams with high solute concentrations the projected climate change with more frequent floods and prolong drought events will negatively affect both the dilution and precipitation effects and as a result impose greater challenges in water management 5 conclusions this study illustrated the effects of chemical precipitation and hydrologic transport on in stream solute chemistry in the acidic streams the proposed three scenarios of upstream downstream solute concentration and flux patterns can help to identify the four key processes hydrologic dilution and enrichment chemical precipitation and biological uptake that regulate stream water chemistry changes in concentrations of cl so4 2 na mg k ca and al from upstream to downstream were dominated by dilution and no3 was dominated by enrichment effect large amounts 15 to 70 of fe and po4 3 were removed by chemical precipitation because instream ph met a suitable ph range for chemical precipitation in the mu md and md c reaches in contrast in stream ph was lower than the ideal ph range for al precipitation our study quantitatively assessed the mechanisms determining stream water chemistry based on monitoring of solute concentrations and streamflow simulations using hydrological models in this case the hbv model this approach could be used as a first order assessment to determine the key processes along the river reaches and be applied to predict the impact of climate change on in stream solute transports by modeling potential scenarios under different projections of climate change

5697,an isosceles triangle in a vertical cross section of a trench is considered as a boundary from which free water in the trench seeps into a porous bed a finite initially impounded water volume vanishes from the channel and soil moisture moves in conjugation with surface water in a transient 2 d saturated unsaturated regime if capillarity is ignored and the subjacent soil is assumed to be dry before filling the channel then a wetting front propagates as a sharp interface mated with drawdown of the channel free water a lembke method of consecutive steady states is used to model the

hinge point of the interface demarcates a zone of imbibition from a zone of drainage of this saturated triangle mathematically a green ampt type nonlinear first order ode is obtained and explicitly integrated by separation of variables and the drawdown time t is explicitly expressed through the water depth h in the trench in a sandbox with a dune sand an experimental h t is measured in a trench

and use a small soil sample yet in situ determination of ks is more reliable as it is done in undisturbed and relatively large soil volumes muñoz carpena et al 2002 variable head permeameters vhp are useful tools to determine hydraulic properties in the field because these instruments are easy to use require small volumes of water in deserts available in limited quantities and the tests are short angulo jaramillo et al 2016 several types of vhp are utilized in soil physics geotechnical engineering and other applications involving seepage in porous media among these types are vertical tubes backfilled with a collected soil in situ casings with permeable disk shaped contacts between falling free water and wetted soil double or single ring infiltrometers and an inverse auger hole also known as the porchet method gwenzi et al 2011 gribb et al 2004 kacimov 2000 kacimov and lapin 1993 kirkham and powers 1972 reynolds 2013 2015 van beers 1983 most of these methods however require physical efforts to auger a hole stable against slumping in cohesive soils only insert a ring or tube into the soil or take a sample for determination of water content prior to experiments bagarello et al 2014 therefore simple alternative techniques for in situ determination of ks that involve less physical efforts measurements and instruments are of need in areas with limited research and water resources the aim of this paper is three fold develop an analytical and a numerical model for seepage from a triangular trench channel furrow filled once with water the level of which falls due to free seepage into a porous bed validate the model in sandbox experiments propose a new technique to determine ks from observation measurement of water extinction in these v shaped trenches 2 analytical solutions a vertical cross section of an isosceles triangular trench of a bank slope ωπ 0 ω 1 2 is shown in fig 1 a where due to symmetry we deal with the right half of the flow domain the abscissa axis of a cartesian coordinate system oxz coincides with the ground surface the oy axis is perpendicular to the plane in fig 1a at time instance t 0 the trench is instantaneously filled with water up to the depth h0 and half width w0 the wetted area of the triangle aob in fig 1a is h0w0 2 in this section we assume that water seeps into an initially dry soil such that at time 0 t te the trench water occupies a shrinking triangle age te is extinction time the instance when the trench becomes empty and all surface water transforms into pore water a wetting front fne propagates into the soil we assume that the porous skeleton and water are incompressible we neglect capillarity of the soil e g consider a coarse e g dune sand also we use the lembke method of consecutive steady states see polubarinova kochina 1977 hereafter abbreviated as pk 77 and assume that the phreatic surface fne generally a curve see section 4 below is a straight line which makes a slope βπ 0 ω β t 1 2 with the ox axis this assumption is analogous to the first simplification in the model of reynolds 2015 and philip 1993 who posited that their 3 d or axisymmetric wetting from a source cylinder propagates as a sharp spheroidal front green ampt s sharp interface in fig 1a between ae and fne the soil is saturated and at positive pressure everywhere else the soil is dry even in this model ignoring capillarity the real phreatic surface is not a straight line but a curve which can be found numerically by solving laplace s equation with a nonlinear boundary condition on a moving free surface see e g liggett and liu 1983 analytical solutions to 2 d darcian flow problems with phreatic surfaces moving as straight lines date back to barenblatt see pk 77 and kalashnikov 1987 due to their simplicity and elegancy these solutions have been used in applications to phreatic surface sharp interface flows in soil dams and confined aquifers kacimov 2002 kacimov et al 2019 kacimov and brown 2015 kacimov and yakimov 2001 at each time instance t a saturated positive pressure seepage domain is a triangle aef fig 1a where f is a descending apex of the wet bulb which propagates with simultaneous imbibition and drainage of the soil see blunt 2017 for terminology description of these processes only one vertex of this triangle a is fixed the other two f and e move down vertically and along the trench bank correspondingly capillarity swells the bulb as compared with what is shown in fig 1a 2 1 one dimensional flow in a transforming wet bulb triangle in this subsection we adopt a simple 1 d approximation of seepage from a positive pressure segment ae of the bed of the trench to the phreatic surface fne we assume that all streamlines in the saturated triangle aef fig 1b are straight vertical segments one of them mn is shown in fig 1b obviously this approximation is poor for large ω we introduce cartesian coordinate systems which descend with time at t 0 the coordinates oxz have the ox axis coinciding with the land surface and initial water level in the channel segment ob as time t the water level drops to ge in fig 1a correspondingly the origin of cartesian coordinates and the abscissa axis also drop the corresponding cartesian coordinates become gxtzt fig 1a at any time t the piezometric total head h is defined see pk 62 77 as 1 h x t z t p z t where p xt zt is the instantaneous pressure head generally both p xt zt and h xt zt depend on two instantaneous cartesian coordinates the case of 2 d flow in the next subsection streamline mn1 fig 1b in this subsection we assume that in a capillarity free seepage flow is 1 d i e the pore water moves at each t vertically the instantaneous pressure head at point n on the phreatic surface is pm 0 and therefore from eq 1 the piezometric head is 2 h n z tn d m mn now we put 2 into eq 1 and taking into account that hm 0 we use the darcy law 3 v mn k s h m h n m n k s h n m n where ks is the saturated hydraulic

rectangles in fig 1a 5 d m x te x tm tan ω π and 6 m n z tm z tn x te x tn tan β π tan ω π now we put eqs 5 and 6 into eq 4 the factors x te x tm in the numerator and denominator cancel each other and we get 7 v mn k s tan ω π tan β π tan ω π 1 due to seepage losses the surface triangle age has a shrinking dyad of depth and half width h t w t the free board of the trench expands correspondingly we assumed that point e in fig 1a is fiducial and water in the trench although dropping exerts a hydrostatic pressure on ae consequently we neglect surface water waves sloshes deformations of the porous medium and other dynamic effects counted for instance in pk 77 next we use the principle of conservation of mass the initial surface water volume in the trench w0h0 at any time t is shared between the surface water triangle age and pore water triangle fae 8 w 0 h 0 2 h 2 t 2 tan ω π n h 2 t 2 tan 2 ω π tan β t π tan ω π the mass balance eq 8 yields 9 tan β t π tan ω π h 0 2 h 2 t n h 2 t tan ω π w

et al 2016 like in the green ampt model of imbibition and drainage kacimov and obnosov 2013 we assume an instantaneous wetting emptying of the soil as the phreatic line fne evolves this corresponds to the second simplification of the philip reynolds model reynolds 2015 at any t t1 the kinematics of the phreatic surface fne in fig 1a b is the following a certain point ht1 on fne is a trace of an instantaneous hinge line perpendicular to the plane of fig 1c see also kacimov 1997a for a similar analysis of decaying groundwater mounds i e the part ht1e rotates counter clockwise such that soil above ht1 dries out drainage blunt 2017 the part fht1 of fne rotates also clockwise such that the adjacent initially dry soil below ht1 wets imbibition blunt 2017 the dotted curve bu to be found later in fig 1a is an envelope of all phreatic surfaces at all values of t i e at each instance t the corresponding phreatic line is tangent to bu next we put eq 9 into eq 8 and get 10 v mn k s n w 2 t w 0 2 w 2 t 1 instead of w0 and w t in eq 9 we can use h0 and h t eq 10 shows that the darcian velocity is spatially constant along the trench bed ae but of course velocity there varies with time therefore the instantaneous seepage flow rate is 11 q i t ae v mn t d x k s w t n w 2 t w 0 2 t w 2 t 1 k s h t tan ω π n h 2 t h 0 2 t h 2 t 1 the rate at which the surface water storage area of age

the bouwer rice method which we recall conjugates the wellbore storage of a pumped well with seepage from the wellbore into the adjacent rock then q t qi t and eqs 11 and 12 yield 13 i t dh t dt k s n h 2 t h 0 2 t h 2 t 1 eq 13 is a nonlinear 1 st order ode we introduce dimensionless quantities h w z x h w z x h 0 t t k s h 0 i i k s in these variables eq 13 separates as 14 d t dh 1 h 2 1 1 n h 2 similarly to the green ampt case of a vertically descending horizontal front pk 77 we integrate eq 14 15 t 1 h du 1 u 2 1 1 n u 2 0 h 1 where t is correspondingly bounded as t e t 0 where t e is dimensionless extinction time the integral in eq 15 is explicitly evaluated 2 we used the integrate routine of mathematica a wolfram s mathematica program falling head response nb is attached as a separate file 2 as 16 t h n 1 h 1 n n 1 n 3 2 arctan h 1 n arctan 1 n as in the green ampt equation from eq 16 we cannot express explicitly h h t in elementary functions we used the parametricplot routine of wolfram s mathematica and in fig 2 curve 1 shows the corresponding h t from eq 16 at h 0 we get the extinction time t e which is plotted in fig 3 as a function of n we re write the expression for t e in the following form 17 t e u 1 u 1 u arctan u u 3 2 u 1 n we expand the rhs in eq 17 into a taylor series in the vicinity of u 0 or n 1 retaining the first 4 terms in the expansion 18 t e u 2 3 2 15 u 2 35 u 2 2 63 u 3 o u 5 obviously from eq 18 we get a mathematical limit 19 lim u 0 t e u 2 3 which assumes that h0 and ks are fixed see the definition of dimensionless quantities above physically at n 1 the porous medium of course degenerates i e the darcy law is not valid this is reflected in the corresponding blow up of hydraulic conductivity i e lim n 1 k s that is evident from say the kozeny carman formula where ks depends on n we emphasize that our analysis in eqs 17 19 is purely mathematical and is based on the introduced normalization of dimensionless time to ks in order to find the envelope bu in fig 1a i e the continuum of hinge points h t1 h t2 we follow a standard procedure see e g bronshtein and semendyayev 2007 section 3 1 6 7 we fix t and rewrite the second eq 2 in the form 20 f z x h x tan ω π h n h 2 h 2 1 n h h 0 we differentiate eq 20 with respect to h and get the equation 21 df z x h d h 0 eq 21 is reduced to 22 h 3 h 2 x tan ω π 0 i e to a cubic equation with respect to h we solved eq 22 by the del ferro cardano formula and the real root is 23 h 3 2 3 3 1 3 9 x t a 3 81 x 2 t a 2 2 3 3 9 x t a 3 81 t a 2 x 2 1 3 where ta tan ωπ we put eq 23 back into eq 20 and obtain the envelope z e x fig 4 shows fne at h 0 5 line 1 which is plotted for a trench having ω 1 4 the trench bed is shown as line 2 and soil having n 0 2 the envelope bu is plotted as curve 3 the envelope may be of interest if water infiltrating from the trench has toxic solutes the soil above bu in figs 1 4 is definitely contaminated by at least a short contact with water seeped from the trench below bu soil is definitely dry capillarity modeled in sections 4 and 5 obviously spreads contamination beyond bu in figs 1 4 2 2 determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity if soil porosity is known our solution the type curve 1 in fig 2 can be used for determination of ks indeed eq 16 can be re written as 24 k s h 0 t t h n for example let for an experiment in a trench see section 3 below having initially h0 21 cm water drains to h 10 5 cm h 0 5 in 5 7 min assume that n 0 385 that is a reasonable constant for sands then from eq 16 t 0 5 0 385 0 3 and from eq 24 ks 0 91 cm min this example illustrates how this trench can be used as a simple field permeameter 2 3 two dimensional flow in triangular saturated bulb generally if no capillarity the piezometric head h t x z in the triangle fae obeys a 2 d laplace equation see liggett and liu 1983 pk 77 varchenko and etingof 1992 for details of the corresponding moving boundary value problem in domains bounded by phreatic surfaces of arbitrary shapes then the phreatic surface and streamlines are not straight as assumed in subsection 2 2 but curved that becomes more important at large ω see maliva s 2020 taxonomy of trenches and ditches furrows in mar applications we retain the assumption that fne is a straight line swinging with time but the streamlines in faef are not one of these streamlines mn1 is sketched in fig 1b these curves are perpendicular to ame and cross a zero pressure isobar fne along which a seepage face condition holds see pk 77 or strack 2017 for details we have a 2 d potential flow in a positive pressure triangle faef of fig 1b this triangle is bounded by the only straight streamline af a constant potential segment ae and zero pressure isobar fe this boundary value problem has been analytically solved by the hodograph method see kacimov 1997b fig 6 there we use this solution viz the expression for qi ksh t taken from eq 3 of kacimov 1997b we put this equation in the right hand side of eq 12 in 2 d flow the darcian velocity is not constant inside fae and qi depends on ω and β t the mass balance ode 12 unfortunately does not separate as in the simplified model of section 2 2 and an analytical solution to eq 22 with a new qi is not available so we solved eq 12 numerically by the ndsolve routine of mathematica as a cauchy problem i e with the boundary conditions h 0 1 0 t te h te 0 3 a computer program falling head 2d flow in colmation cake nb in wolfram s mathematica which solves this cauchy problem is attached 3 the results are plotted for the same bank slope considered in fig 2 as curve 3 it shows that at an early stage of drainage the 1 d and 2 d h t are close to each other the dimensionless extinction times in 2 d and 1 d seepage for this slope and soil are t e 0 74 and t e 0 85 respectively 3 sandbox experiments 3 1 preliminary experiment in this subsection we present an experiment conducted in a sandbox in the field in february 2019 the ambient air and infiltrated water temperature was 26 c and 20 c respectively the plexiglas sandbox was 100 cm long 15 cm wide and 78 cm deep fig 5 a fine sand from buwshar dunes having ks 0 91 cm min measured in darcy s permeameter al shukaili et al 2019 was used as a box filling by sieving analysis we got the particle size distribution curve of our sand in particular d10 d17 d50 and d60 we also used the theoretical equations for ks reported by alyamani and şen 1993 harleman 1963 beyer 1964 chapuis et al 2005 hazen 1892 kozeny carman kozeny 1927 and navfac dm7 1974 from chesnaux et al 2011 the corresponding values for our sand are ks 0 71 0 3 1 72 0 89 0 67 0 46 and 0 43 cm min therefore the chapuis et al 2005 formula gives ks closest to one measured in darcy s permeameter a trench has been excavated in the sandbox and tooled in such a manner to avoid slumping of the wet soil slopes of the trench the depth and width of the trench were 21 cm and 20 cm respectively i e ω 1 4 the bottom of the sandbox was equipped with valves which were kept open throughout the experiment in order to allow a free drainage of the percolated water prior to the experiment the sandbox was saturated with water in order to start the experiment with a saturated initial condition next the bottom of the trench was covered by a plastic sheet to prevent infiltration at t 0 during a gradual hose filling of the trench at t 0 the excavation was filled with water without a free board then the plastic sheet was smoothly but rapidly removed in the same manner as in standard double ring infiltrometers water seeped from the trench into the soil until emptying of the trench at t tex a falling water level in the trench and wetting front were monitored through transparent front and back walls of the sandbox see figs p1 p3 in the photogallery file in the supplementary files after that the time corresponding to the aliquots of dropping h for each cm was measured until tex as in section 2 due to the symmetry of the original isosceles triangle the experimental trench also had the left wall of the sandbox as a confining no flow boundary i e age in fig 1a was a right isosceles triangle the vertical wall ag corresponded to the plane yzo in fig 1a the falling depth h t of water in the trench is shown in fig 8a as a dotted line the initial water level h0 in the trench was 21 cm the experimental extinction time was tex 12 3 min the ks of this type curve can be determined in the way described in section 2 3 if we select n 0 4 h0 21 cm h t 2 04 min 16 cm then h 0 76 and from eq 16 t 0 76 0 4 0 093 then from eq 24 ks 0 96 cm min which is close to ks 0 91 cm min measured by a standard permeameter al shukaili et al 2019 curve 4 in fig 2 shows experimental results expressed in the same dimensionless quantities as in section 2 if we compare curves 1 3 and 4 in fig 2 the trend is physically reasonable the 1 d analytical model predicts the slowest fall of h in 2 d model without capillarity and under the assumption that the wetting front is a straight rotating line h t drops faster in real soils even coarse capillarity increases the flow rate from a channel see pk 77 and philip 1990 for comparisons of seepage from channels of zero depth with and without capillarity such that curve 4 in fig 2 manifests the fastest drawdown in our triangular trench 3 2 laboratory experiments another set of sandbox experiments was conducted in the laboratory july 2019 where the ambient air and infiltrated water temperatures were 19 2 c and 19 0 c respectively the sandbox was 99 cm long 42 cm deep and 3 cm wide see the photogallery in the supplementary files the sandbox was filled with the same sand used in the preliminary sandbox experiment see subsection 3 1 the sandbox was saturated three times for vacating the entrapped air next a trench with a mild slope 17 5 i e ω 0 097 h0 9 cm and w0 28 6 cm was excavated at the right corner of the sandbox the trench ditch was filled with water and the entire soil in the sandbox was saturated four times before taking the final measurements of the drawdown this ensured stabilization of the bank slope and running the experiments with saturated initial conditions the experiment was repeated three times the same procedure was also conducted for a trench with a steep slope 45 i e ω 1 4 h0 16 cm and w0 17 cm that was excavated at the left corner of the sandbox see figs p4 p8 in the photogallery in the supplementary files descriptive statistics and anova one way were used to analyze and compare the means of the replicated experiments for each trench we used the ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss software for windows version 20 0 the results shown in table 1 illustrate no significant differences in the replicated readings for both trenches p value 0 05 the falling depth h t of trenches water in the laboratory experiments is shown in fig 8 b c the initial water levels h0 in the mild and steep trenches were 9 cm and 16 cm respectively however a slight slumping of soil was observed as water infiltrated in the trench with a steep slope due to instability of the soil see video in the supplementary files attached the average experimental extinction times were tex 7 69 min and 8 53 min for the mild and steep slope respectively similar to the preliminary experiment the graphs h t in both trenches are steep for the first minute of the experiment after that the rates of drop stabilized at average values of 0 95 cm min and 1 9 cm min an interesting peculiarity of all experiments is that the rate of drop increased rapidly at the late stage of drawdown t close to tex viz in the range of 0 h 2 cm just prior to the complete vanishing of water from both trenches we calculated the average rates between h 2 and 1 cm and the corresponding values were 4 7 cm min and 8 4 cm min for the mild and steep slopes respectively the ks values for these two slopes can be again calculated using eqs 16 and 24 if n 0 4 and h0 9 cm h t 5 36 min 4 cm for the mild slope while h0 16 cm h t 3 4 min 11 cm for the steep slope then ks is equal to 0 59 and 0 70 cm min respectively both values albeit 25 30 less than the darcy column measured ks 0 91 cm min are of certain interest the experimental results were summarized in table 2 4 shallow channel with capillarity our experiments in section 3 showed an interesting peculiarity of the h t curves at t approaching the extinction time the drawdown rate dh dt increases this is caused by a well known fact pk 77 that with the decrease of the size of the channel a relative effect of capillarity on qi increases in this section we take into account capillarity and develop an analytical solution in terms of the vedernikov bouwer vb kacimov et al 2019 model we consider a shallow channel of a small h for channels of zero h an explicit analytical solution for a steady state 2 d flow has been obtained by riesenkampf pk 77 kacimov 2006 who assumed that the channel bed or fig 1d depicts the right half of the flow domain is a constant zero piezometric head segment of a fixed width w along which the pressure head p 0 the curve r1r2 is a free boundary capillary fringe along which p pc where pc is a positive constant this constant quantifies the vb capillary properties of the soil table 5 p 37 in pk 77 gives pc for main soils the fringe is also a streamline along which a stream function is ψ qr provided y 0 along the ray of symmetry or3 fig 1d a horizontal segment rr1 of a width wr is also a streamline ψ qr with a stronger capillarity higher pc the dyad wr qr increases as compared with the no capillarity limit 0 ksw riesenkampf found the following implicit relation for qr as a series expansion see eqs 4 9 p 179 in pk 77 25 w q r π 2 8 j 1 exp 2 j 1 π p c k s 2 q r 2 j 1 2 we introduce dimensionless quantities q r q r k s p c w w p c t t k s p c a a p c we also convert the series 25 and get 26 w q r π 2 8 exp π 2 q r hypergometricpfq 1 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 exp π 2 q r where hypergometricpfq is the mathematica routine for a generalized hypergeometric function pfq a b z wolfram 1991 we solve eq 26 with respect to q r using the findroot routine of mathematica the obtained root q r w we put into the rhs of the equation of mass conservation 27 da t dt w t dw t d t tan ω π q r w t w 0 w r explicit integration of the nonlinear ode 27 like in subsection 2 1 is not possible consequently we solved the cauchy problem 27 using the ndsolve routine of mathematica the results are shown in fig 6 for ω 0 1 0 186 and 0 3 curves 1 3 correspondingly the curves in fig 6 indicate the experimentally observed increase of dh dt and hence of dw dt when h and w approach zero instead of the riesenkampf s solution 25 a triangular channel of an arbitrary slope angle can be considered recently samal and mishra 2017 applied the vb model to steady 2d flows from such channels unfortunately their analytical solution is presented in a semi inverse mode viz qi is evaluated for a given set of affixes of conformal mappings rather than as a function of the channel sizes and pc the results of this section can be also used for determination of pc from the trench experiment provided ks of the soil is known we recall pk 77 that commonly pc is found from experiments in vertical columns where a horizontal capillary fringe is equilibrated with time at a counter gravity imbibition from a horizontal zero pressure isobar at the bottom of the column even for a sandy soil this requires a couple of days an alternative method involves the vg or other water retention curve see e g smagin 2012 i e lengthy lab experiments with a pressure plate apparatus the curves in fig 6 are express alternatives for an undisturbed soil indeed for a constructed trench ω one can monitor infiltration and measure t e for example curve 2 has t e 0 25 and the sand box experiments section 4 give te 7 7 min assume that ks 1 16 cm min then pc ks te t e 35 cm 5 hydrus simulations the above sandbox experiments and analytical solutions were simulated numerically by hydrus2d šimůnek et al 1999 bagarello et al 2019 i e using a fem code to solve richards equation in this model we avoid determination of free boundaries like in section 2 see also pk 77 philip 1990 the geometry of the hydrus2d models is a right half of a triangular furrow in figs 1a and 7 the modeled flow domains are rectangles of sizes x z 100 170 cm the left upper corner of these triangles are sliced by a half channel fig 7 a grid resolution analysis was performed in order to ensure accuracy and stability of modelling by varying the mesh size by one increment from a coarse mesh of 5 cm to a fine mesh of 1 cm the mesh size was refined to 0 5 cm near the trench bed the inlet segment ab fig 7 in order to reduce the computational error the maximum number of hydrus iterations was 10 and the water content tolerance was 0 001 we used the rosetta package of hydrus to predict and retrieve the van genuchten vg parameters of the sandbox soil we used the laboratory analysis of the soil texture and bulk density of sand from al shukaili et al 2019 the soil capillarity vg parameters were α 0 145 1 cm and n 2 68 found by al shukaili et al 2019 using a pressure plate apparatus the predicted ks rosetta package was modified to the measured value ks 0 91 cm min while the remaining four vg parameters were kept the same initially at t 0 the soil moisture content in the three experiments was relatively high θv 0 1 therefore we selected an initial pressure head in hydrus2d p0 10 cm everywhere in the domain this p0 was retrieved from a retc curve at t 0 the whole channel of the numerical model is filled with surface water and 2d seepage commences from segment ab fig 7 a hydrus free drainage condition was imposed along the outlet segment dj fig 7 the sides bc cd and aj in fig 7 were no flux boundaries hydrus2d version 3 offers a new reservoir boundary condition the user can consider a reservoir well wetland or furrow with a falling drawdown level such that a part of ab in fig 7 is submersed under trench water segment ae in fig 1a and another part eb in fig 1a is where moist soil is in contact with the air in the free board of the channel eb may consist of two parts along es compare with the seepage face ef in fig 1a pore water pressure is higher than atmospheric and water seeps off along sb pressure is sub atmospheric and this segment is impermeable slope streamline in terms of an analytical vedernikov bower model of capillarity see e g pk 77 kacimov et al 2019 more information about this new hydrus boundary condition can be found in šimůnek et al 2018 and sasidharan et al 2018 2019 we used the furrow reservoir boundary condition along ab the initial half width w0 2 and initial water level h0 were set as the experimental settings the performance of hydrus2d was evaluated following brunetti et al 2016 and phogat et al 2013 by comparing the measured m and hydrus simulated s values of h t using the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency e and t test given by 28 rmse 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 29 mae 1 n i 1 n m i s i 30 e 1 i 1 n m i s i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where n is the total number of observations mi is the i th measured values si is the i th simulated values m is the mean value for the measured data a perfect match between measured and simulated values is attained when a rmse mae 0 b the results of t test indicate insignificant differences between the mean measured and simulated values at a 5 confidence interval and c when the values of r 2 and e are equal to one however a value of e in the range 0 e 1 is considered as an acceptable performance of the model moriasi et al 2007 the results of evaluating the performance of the numerical model are shown in table 3 the values of rmse mae r 2 and e indicated a good agreement between the measured and hydrus simulated values of the drawdown time for the water level in the three trenches see fig 8a c solid line further the results of the t test between the measured and simulated drawdown time showed insignificant differences at a 5 confidence interval for all the trenches p 0 05 hydrus visualizes the velocity vectors as arrows with a snapshot indication of the flow direction and speeds at various points within the flow domain in fig 9 we focused on velocities near the trench slope ab for the mild slope this segment of the pentagon is most vulnerable to seepage induced soil erosion specifically if the velocity vectors along ab are oriented from the soil to the air and the hydraulic gradients are above a certain threshold limit then the slope may become unstable due to heaving suffusion piping and other deleterious phenomena pk 77 the hydrus colored map in fig 9 shows isotachs at t 7 min when all ponded water has vanished from the trench the upper left panel in fig 9 illustrates that at t 2 14 min and earlier along bc see fig 1a the motion of water was towards the lower segment jd later at t 4 31 min the upper right panel of fig 9 water got deflected along bc downward the stagnation point st is shown in the lower left panel in fig 9 when t 5 36 min and h 2 7 cm at this point a capillarity dominated upward oriented flow from the ponded segment ab of the trench collides with the gravity prevailed downward flow along bc at an even later time t 6 27 min the lower right panel in fig 9 the stagnation point slipped down as water level in the trench dropped at t te the darcian velocity at points a and b is infinite in the analytical model of seepage from a soil channel with capillarity counted by the vedernikov bouwer model see kacimov et al 2019 pk 77 similarly in hydrus at t te velocity is very high at points a and b a minimum velocity magnitude along ab is attained at a certain point between a and b this is evident from the graphs of velocity as a function of the arc coordinate along ab not shown here for the sake of brevity at a certain time instance t te i e after extinction of surface water point a became a stagnation point at this late stage not shown in fig 9 the saturated bubble descended deep enough and all soil moisture above point a moved down fig 10 a shows hydrus generated isobars for t 3 min it is noteworthy that a phreatic line which bounds the red subdomain of the positive pore pressure in fig 10a is a curve with an inflection point compare with a straight analytical phreatic line fe in section 2 sophocleous 2002 his fig 4 pointed out that this inverted water table under stream beds is separated from a regular regional water table see also warrick and zhang 1987 their figs 2 3 and 5 7 fig 10b illustrates the distribution of the moisture content at t 8 min when the trench was already empty here the wet bubble has descended deep under point a and the positive pressure zone vanished i e flow is unsaturated everywhere in the pentagon pressure computed by hydrus along aj in fig 10b increased from about 6 6 cm at point a to a maximum of about 2 7 cm inside the red subdomain and then decreased to almost 10 cm at the depth of about 47 cm beneath point a the flow kinematics in figs 9 10 manifests a complex interaction of gravity darcian resistance and capillarity at different stages of seepage the corresponding dynamics kinematics qualitatively agrees with the vedernikov bouwer analytical solutions for steady state regimes of 2 d seepage with a tension saturated zone and with the philip 1990 theory of quasilinear flows without free boundaries 6 concluding remarks in this paper we illustrate how to use a drawdown curve h t for determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air entrance pressure in the vedernikov bouwer model our analysis started with a simple analytical model of a falling head permeameter as a triangular unlined trench dug in a coarse textured permeable bed once upon water filling the trench a visible surface water volume gradually transforms into an invisible volume of pore water in the analytical model capillarity was ignored and only gravity and darcian resistance trumped a transient seepage with a rotating phreatic surface a triangular wet bulb is subtended by a finite length segment of a phreatic line and its mass balance and pressure continuity conjugated with a superjacent declining triangle of vanishing surface water consequently this rotating segment invades a dry subjacent soil and recedes from the wet part emerged earlier under the trench bed these dynamics of pore water redistribution represent a paradoxical case of an instantaneous and concurrent imbibition and drainage blunt 2017 the analytical solutions with free moving boundaries can serve back of envelope calculations optimization in design of mar infiltration entities or furrow irrigation al shukaili et al 2020 as well as in situations when a soil hydrologist or civil engineer does not have access to a commercial computer package our sandbox experiments with constructed triangular trenches of mild and steep slopes filled with water allowed to measure the drawdown of the surface water level and monitoring of the wet front propagating into the box filling the monitored drawdown curves h t matched reasonably well the analytical solutions from which ks can be easily evaluated indeed soil properties can be estimated from simple experiments with filling a trench ditch recording extinction of its storage depth of water and using eq 24 and type curve 2 in fig 2 calculation of ks then can be done for an arbitrary wall angle of the trench and specified porosity therefore such a primitive trench can be used as a falling head permeameter the trench experiments were modelled in hydrus2d using a new reservoir boundary condition furrow šimůnek et al 2018 hydrus solves richards equation and counts for capillarity of the soil where flows are not bounded by sharp interfaces e g mathematical phreatic surfaces see philip 1990 hydrus simulated values of drawdown time for water level in the trenches agreed well with the measured once based on root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency e results of t test between the measured and simulated drawdown time showed insignificant differences at a 5 confidence interval for all the trenches p 0 05 the results of hydrus simulations helped us to predict fields of flow characteristics that evolve in time and the corresponding kinematic descriptors also it visualized the transiency of a saturated unsaturated flow in hydrus pentagon imposed by the dropping water level in the trench upon extinction of the surface water there a wet bubble propagates downward and gets quickly sucked by capillarity of an ambient unsaturated soil a complex pattern of velocity vectors streamlines isobars and isohumes is also reproduced by hydrus in particular it is shown that for a selected trench with a bank slope of 1 1 and selected sand the falling water level does not generate darcian gradients oriented from the soil to the air i e seepage induced suffusion of soil near the slope ab in fig 1a is unlikely credit authorship contribution statement a al shukaili methodology writing original draft software a al

5697,an isosceles triangle in a vertical cross section of a trench is considered as a boundary from which free water in the trench seeps into a porous bed a finite initially impounded water volume vanishes from the channel and soil moisture moves in conjugation with surface water in a transient 2 d saturated unsaturated regime if capillarity is ignored and the subjacent soil is assumed to be dry before filling the channel then a wetting front propagates as a sharp interface mated with drawdown of the channel free water a lembke method of consecutive steady states is used to model the interface as a rotating straight line a zone of darcian seepage is a triangle three sides of which at each time instance are a streamline a constant piezometric head line and isobar the instantaneous

integrated by separation of variables and the drawdown time t is explicitly expressed through the water depth h in the trench in a sandbox with a dune sand an experimental h t is measured in a trench having mild and steep bank slopes when h t 0 the drawdown rate increases that is attributed to an increase of the effect of capillarity for this stage riesenkampf s analytical solution for steady 2d

and use a small soil sample yet in situ determination of ks is more reliable as it is done in undisturbed and relatively large soil volumes muñoz carpena et al 2002 variable head permeameters vhp are useful tools to determine hydraulic properties in the field because these instruments are easy to use require small volumes of water in deserts available in limited quantities and the tests are short angulo jaramillo et al 2016 several types of vhp are utilized in soil physics geotechnical engineering and other applications involving seepage in porous media among these types are vertical tubes backfilled with a collected soil in situ casings with permeable disk shaped contacts between falling free water and wetted soil double or single ring infiltrometers and an inverse auger hole also known as the porchet method gwenzi et al 2011 gribb et al 2004 kacimov 2000 kacimov and lapin 1993 kirkham and powers 1972 reynolds 2013 2015 van beers 1983 most of these methods however require physical efforts to auger a hole stable against slumping in cohesive soils only insert a ring or tube into the soil or take a sample for determination of water content prior to experiments bagarello et al 2014 therefore simple alternative techniques for in situ determination of ks that involve less physical efforts measurements and instruments are of need in areas with limited research and water resources the aim of this paper is three fold develop an analytical and a numerical model for seepage from a triangular trench channel furrow filled once with water the level of which falls due to free seepage into a porous bed validate the model in sandbox experiments propose a new technique to determine ks from observation measurement of water extinction in these v shaped trenches 2 analytical solutions a vertical cross section of an isosceles triangular trench of a bank slope ωπ 0 ω 1 2 is shown in fig 1 a where due to symmetry we deal with the right half of the flow domain the abscissa axis of a cartesian coordinate system oxz coincides with the ground surface the oy axis is perpendicular to the plane in fig 1a at time instance t 0 the trench is instantaneously filled with water up to the depth h0 and half width w0 the wetted area of the triangle aob in fig 1a is h0w0 2 in this section we assume that water seeps into an initially dry soil such that at time 0 t te the trench water occupies a shrinking triangle age te is extinction time the instance when the trench becomes empty and all surface water transforms into pore water a wetting front fne propagates into the soil we assume that the porous skeleton and water are incompressible we neglect capillarity of the soil e g consider a coarse e g dune sand also we use the lembke method of consecutive steady states see polubarinova kochina 1977 hereafter abbreviated as pk 77 and assume that the phreatic surface fne generally a curve see section 4 below is a straight line which makes a slope βπ 0 ω β t 1 2 with the ox axis this assumption is analogous to the first simplification in the model of reynolds 2015 and philip 1993 who posited that their 3 d or axisymmetric wetting from a source cylinder propagates as a sharp spheroidal front green ampt s sharp interface in fig 1a between ae and fne the soil is saturated and at positive pressure everywhere else the soil is dry even in this model ignoring capillarity the real phreatic surface is not a straight line but a curve which can be found numerically by solving laplace s equation with a nonlinear boundary condition on a moving free surface see e g liggett and liu 1983 analytical solutions to 2 d darcian flow problems with phreatic surfaces moving as straight lines date back to barenblatt see pk 77 and kalashnikov 1987 due to their simplicity and elegancy these solutions have been used in applications to phreatic surface sharp interface flows in soil dams and confined aquifers kacimov 2002 kacimov et al 2019 kacimov and brown 2015 kacimov and yakimov 2001 at each time instance t a saturated positive pressure seepage domain is a triangle aef fig 1a where f is a descending apex of the wet bulb which propagates with simultaneous imbibition and drainage of the soil see blunt 2017 for terminology description of these processes only one vertex of this triangle a is fixed the other two f and e move down vertically and along the trench bank correspondingly capillarity swells the bulb as compared with what is shown in fig 1a 2 1 one dimensional flow in a transforming wet bulb triangle in this subsection we adopt a simple 1 d approximation of seepage from a positive pressure segment ae of the bed of the trench to the phreatic surface fne we assume that all streamlines in the saturated triangle aef fig 1b are straight vertical segments one of them mn is shown in fig 1b obviously this approximation is poor for large ω we introduce cartesian coordinate systems which descend with time at t 0 the coordinates oxz have the ox axis coinciding with the land surface and initial water level in the channel segment ob as time t the water level drops to ge in fig 1a correspondingly the origin of cartesian coordinates and the abscissa axis also drop the corresponding cartesian coordinates become gxtzt fig 1a at any time t the piezometric total head h is defined see pk 62 77 as 1 h x t z t p z t where p xt zt is the instantaneous pressure head generally both p xt zt and h xt zt depend on two instantaneous cartesian coordinates the case of 2 d flow in the next subsection streamline mn1 fig 1b in this subsection we assume that in a capillarity free seepage flow is 1 d i e the pore water moves at each t vertically the instantaneous pressure head at point n on the phreatic surface is pm 0 and therefore from eq 1 the piezometric head is 2 h n z tn d m mn now we put 2 into eq 1 and taking into account that hm 0 we use the darcy law 3 v mn k s h m h n m n k s h n m n where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity obviously vmn in eq 3 is negative the depth of water in the channel above point m dm is positive the absolute value of vmn in eq 3 is 4 v mn k s d m m n 1 from basic trigonometry of the rectangles in fig 1a 5 d m x te x tm tan ω π and 6 m n z tm z tn x te x tn tan β π tan ω π now we put eqs 5 and 6 into eq 4 the factors x te x tm in the numerator and denominator cancel each other and we get 7 v mn k s tan ω π tan β π tan ω π 1 due to seepage losses the surface triangle age has a shrinking dyad of depth and half width h t w t the free board of the trench expands correspondingly we assumed that point e in fig 1a is fiducial and water in the trench although dropping exerts a hydrostatic pressure on ae consequently we neglect surface water waves sloshes deformations of the porous medium and other dynamic effects counted for instance in pk 77 next we use the principle of conservation of mass the initial surface water volume in the trench w0h0 at any time t is shared between the surface water triangle age and pore water triangle fae 8 w 0 h 0 2 h 2 t 2 tan ω π n h 2 t 2 tan 2 ω π tan β t π tan ω π the mass balance eq 8 yields 9 tan β t π tan ω π h 0 2 h 2 t n h 2 t tan ω π w

et al 2016 like in the green ampt model of imbibition and drainage kacimov and obnosov 2013 we assume an instantaneous wetting emptying of the soil as the phreatic line fne evolves this corresponds to the second simplification of the philip reynolds model reynolds 2015 at any t t1 the kinematics of the phreatic surface fne in fig 1a b is the following a certain point ht1 on fne is a trace of an instantaneous hinge line perpendicular to the plane of fig 1c see also kacimov 1997a for a similar analysis of decaying groundwater mounds i e the part ht1e rotates counter clockwise such that soil above ht1 dries out drainage blunt 2017 the part fht1 of fne rotates also clockwise such that the adjacent initially dry soil below ht1 wets imbibition blunt 2017 the dotted curve bu to be found later in fig 1a is an envelope of all phreatic surfaces at all values of t i e at each instance t the corresponding phreatic line is tangent to bu next we put eq 9 into eq 8 and get 10 v mn k s n w 2 t w 0 2 w 2 t 1 instead of w0 and w t in eq 9 we can use h0 and h t eq 10 shows that the darcian velocity is spatially constant along the trench bed ae but of course velocity there varies with time therefore the instantaneous seepage flow rate is 11 q i t ae v mn t d x k s w t n w 2 t w 0 2 t w 2 t 1 k s h t tan ω π n h 2 t h 0 2 t h 2 t 1 the rate at which the surface water storage area of age

the bouwer rice method which we recall conjugates the wellbore storage of a pumped well with seepage from the wellbore into the adjacent rock then q t qi t and eqs 11 and 12 yield 13 i t dh t dt k s n h 2 t h 0 2 t h 2 t 1 eq 13 is a nonlinear 1 st order ode we introduce dimensionless quantities h w z x h w z x h 0 t t k s h 0 i i k s in these variables eq 13 separates as 14 d t dh 1 h 2 1 1 n h 2 similarly to the green ampt case of a vertically descending horizontal front pk 77 we integrate eq 14 15 t 1 h du 1 u 2 1 1 n u 2 0 h 1 where t is correspondingly bounded as t e t 0 where t e is dimensionless extinction time the integral in eq 15 is explicitly evaluated 2 we used the integrate routine of mathematica a wolfram s mathematica program falling head response nb is attached as a separate file 2 as 16 t h n 1 h 1 n n 1 n 3 2 arctan h 1 n arctan 1 n as in the green ampt equation from eq 16 we cannot express explicitly h h t in elementary functions we used the parametricplot routine of wolfram s mathematica and in fig 2 curve 1 shows the corresponding h t from eq 16 at h 0 we get the extinction time t e which is plotted in fig 3 as a function of n we re write the expression for t e in the following form 17 t e u 1 u 1 u arctan u u 3 2 u 1 n we expand the rhs in eq 17 into a taylor series in the vicinity of u 0 or n 1 retaining the first 4 terms in the expansion 18 t e u 2 3 2 15 u 2 35 u 2 2 63 u 3 o u 5 obviously from eq 18 we get a mathematical limit 19 lim u 0 t e u 2 3 which assumes that h0 and ks are fixed see the definition of dimensionless quantities above physically at n 1 the porous medium of course degenerates i e the darcy law is not valid this is reflected in the corresponding blow up of hydraulic conductivity i e lim n 1 k s that is evident from say the kozeny carman formula where ks depends on n we emphasize that our analysis in eqs 17 19 is purely mathematical and is based on the introduced normalization of dimensionless time to ks in order to find the envelope bu in fig 1a i e the continuum of hinge points h t1 h t2 we follow a standard procedure see e g bronshtein and semendyayev 2007 section 3 1 6 7 we fix t and rewrite the second eq 2 in the form 20 f z x h x tan ω π h n h 2 h 2 1 n h h 0 we differentiate eq 20 with respect to h and get the equation 21 df z x h d h 0 eq 21 is reduced to 22 h 3 h 2 x tan ω π 0 i e to a cubic equation with respect to h we solved eq 22 by the del ferro cardano formula and the real root is 23 h 3 2 3 3 1 3 9 x t a 3 81 x 2 t a 2 2 3 3 9 x t a 3 81 t a 2 x 2 1 3 where ta tan ωπ we put eq 23 back into eq 20 and obtain the envelope z e x fig 4 shows fne at h 0 5 line 1 which is plotted for a trench having ω 1 4 the trench bed is shown as line 2 and soil having n 0 2 the envelope bu is plotted as curve 3 the envelope may be of interest if water infiltrating from the trench has toxic solutes the soil above bu in figs 1 4 is definitely contaminated by at least a short contact with water seeped from the trench below bu soil is definitely dry capillarity modeled in sections 4 and 5 obviously spreads contamination beyond bu in figs 1 4 2 2 determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity if soil porosity is known our solution the type curve 1 in fig 2 can be used for determination of ks indeed eq 16 can be re written as 24 k s h 0 t t h n for example let for an experiment in a trench see section 3 below having initially h0 21 cm water drains to h 10 5 cm h 0 5 in 5 7 min assume that n 0 385 that is a reasonable constant for sands then from eq 16 t 0 5 0 385 0 3 and from eq 24 ks 0 91 cm min this example illustrates how this trench can be used as a simple field permeameter 2 3 two dimensional flow in triangular saturated bulb generally if no capillarity the piezometric head h t x z in the triangle fae obeys a 2 d laplace equation see liggett and liu 1983 pk 77 varchenko and etingof 1992 for details of the corresponding moving boundary value problem in domains bounded by phreatic surfaces of arbitrary shapes then the phreatic surface and streamlines are not straight as assumed in subsection 2 2 but curved that becomes more important at large ω see maliva s 2020 taxonomy of trenches and ditches furrows in mar applications we retain the assumption that fne is a straight line swinging with time but the streamlines in faef are not one of these streamlines mn1 is sketched in fig 1b these curves are perpendicular to ame and cross a zero pressure isobar fne along which a seepage face condition holds see pk 77 or strack 2017 for details we have a 2 d potential flow in a positive pressure triangle faef of fig 1b this triangle is bounded by the only straight streamline af a constant potential segment ae and zero pressure isobar fe this boundary value problem has been analytically solved by the hodograph method see kacimov 1997b fig 6 there we use this solution viz the expression for qi ksh t taken from eq 3 of kacimov 1997b we put this equation in the right hand side of eq 12 in 2 d flow the darcian velocity is not constant inside fae and qi depends on ω and β t the mass balance ode 12 unfortunately does not separate as in the simplified model of section 2 2 and an analytical solution to eq 22 with a new qi is not available so we solved eq 12 numerically by the ndsolve routine of mathematica as a cauchy problem i e with the boundary conditions h 0 1 0 t te h te 0 3 a computer program falling head 2d flow in colmation cake nb in wolfram s mathematica which solves this cauchy problem is attached 3 the results are plotted for the same bank slope considered in fig 2 as curve 3 it shows that at an early stage of drainage the 1 d and 2 d h t are close to each other the dimensionless extinction times in 2 d and 1 d seepage for this slope and soil are t e 0 74 and t e 0 85 respectively 3 sandbox experiments 3 1 preliminary experiment in this subsection we present an experiment conducted in a sandbox in the field in february 2019 the ambient air and infiltrated water temperature was 26 c and 20 c respectively the plexiglas sandbox was 100 cm long 15 cm wide and 78 cm deep fig 5 a fine sand from buwshar dunes having ks 0 91 cm min measured in darcy s permeameter al shukaili et al 2019 was used as a box filling by sieving analysis we got the particle size distribution curve of our sand in particular d10 d17 d50 and d60 we also used the theoretical equations for ks reported by alyamani and şen 1993 harleman 1963 beyer 1964 chapuis et al 2005 hazen 1892 kozeny carman kozeny 1927 and navfac dm7 1974 from chesnaux et al 2011 the corresponding values for our sand are ks 0 71 0 3 1 72 0 89 0 67 0 46 and 0 43 cm min therefore the chapuis et al 2005 formula gives ks closest to one measured in darcy s permeameter a trench has been excavated in the sandbox and tooled in such a manner to avoid slumping of the wet soil slopes of the trench the depth and width of the trench were 21 cm and 20 cm respectively i e ω 1 4 the bottom of the sandbox was equipped with valves which were kept open throughout the experiment in order to allow a free drainage of the percolated water prior to the experiment the sandbox was saturated with water in order to start the experiment with a saturated initial condition next the bottom of the trench was covered by a plastic sheet to prevent infiltration at t 0 during a gradual hose filling of the trench at t 0 the excavation was filled with water without a free board then the plastic sheet was smoothly but rapidly removed in the same manner as in standard double ring infiltrometers water seeped from the trench into the soil until emptying of the trench at t tex a falling water level in the trench and wetting front were monitored through transparent front and back walls of the sandbox see figs p1 p3 in the photogallery file in the supplementary files after that the time corresponding to the aliquots of dropping h for each cm was measured until tex as in section 2 due to the symmetry of the original isosceles triangle the experimental trench also had the left wall of the sandbox as a confining no flow boundary i e age in fig 1a was a right isosceles triangle the vertical wall ag corresponded to the plane yzo in fig 1a the falling depth h t of water in the trench is shown in fig 8a as a dotted line the initial water level h0 in the trench was 21 cm the experimental extinction time was tex 12 3 min the ks of this type curve can be determined in the way described in section 2 3 if we select n 0 4 h0 21 cm h t 2 04 min 16 cm then h 0 76 and from eq 16 t 0 76 0 4 0 093 then from eq 24 ks 0 96 cm min which is close to ks 0 91 cm min measured by a standard permeameter al shukaili et al 2019 curve 4 in fig 2 shows experimental results expressed in the same dimensionless quantities as in section 2 if we compare curves 1 3 and 4 in fig 2 the trend is physically reasonable the 1 d analytical model predicts the slowest fall of h in 2 d model without capillarity and under the assumption that the wetting front is a straight rotating line h t drops faster in real soils even coarse capillarity increases the flow rate from a channel see pk 77 and philip 1990 for comparisons of seepage from channels of zero depth with and without capillarity such that curve 4 in fig 2 manifests the fastest drawdown in our triangular trench 3 2 laboratory experiments another set of sandbox experiments was conducted in the laboratory july 2019 where the ambient air and infiltrated water temperatures were 19 2 c and 19 0 c respectively the sandbox was 99 cm long 42 cm deep and 3 cm wide see the photogallery in the supplementary files the sandbox was filled with the same sand used in the preliminary sandbox experiment see subsection 3 1 the sandbox was saturated three times for vacating the entrapped air next a trench with a mild slope 17 5 i e ω 0 097 h0 9 cm and w0 28 6 cm was excavated at the right corner of the sandbox the trench ditch was filled with water and the entire soil in the sandbox was saturated four times before taking the final measurements of the drawdown this ensured stabilization of the bank slope and running the experiments with saturated initial conditions the experiment was repeated three times the same procedure was also conducted for a trench with a steep slope 45 i e ω 1 4 h0 16 cm and w0 17 cm that was excavated at the left corner of the sandbox see figs p4 p8 in the photogallery in the supplementary files descriptive statistics and anova one way were used to analyze and compare the means of the replicated experiments for each trench we used the ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss software for windows version 20 0 the results shown in table 1 illustrate no significant differences in the replicated readings for both trenches p value 0 05 the falling depth h t of trenches water in the laboratory experiments is shown in fig 8 b c the initial water levels h0 in the mild and steep trenches were 9 cm and 16 cm respectively however a slight slumping of soil was observed as water infiltrated in the trench with a steep slope due to instability of the soil see video in the supplementary files attached the average experimental extinction times were tex 7 69 min and 8 53 min for the mild and steep slope respectively similar to the preliminary experiment the graphs h t in both trenches are steep for the first minute of the experiment after that the rates of drop stabilized at average values of 0 95 cm min and 1 9 cm min an interesting peculiarity of all experiments is that the rate of drop increased rapidly at the late stage of drawdown t close to tex viz in the range of 0 h 2 cm just prior to the complete vanishing of water from both trenches we calculated the average rates between h 2 and 1 cm and the corresponding values were 4 7 cm min and 8 4 cm min for the mild and steep slopes respectively the ks values for these two slopes can be again calculated using eqs 16 and 24 if n 0 4 and h0 9 cm h t 5 36 min 4 cm for the mild slope while h0 16 cm h t 3 4 min 11 cm for the steep slope then ks is equal to 0 59 and 0 70 cm min respectively both values albeit 25 30 less than the darcy column measured ks 0 91 cm min are of certain interest the experimental results were summarized in table 2 4 shallow channel with capillarity our experiments in section 3 showed an interesting peculiarity of the h t curves at t approaching the extinction time the drawdown rate dh dt increases this is caused by a well known fact pk 77 that with the decrease of the size of the channel a relative effect of capillarity on qi increases in this section we take into account capillarity and develop an analytical solution in terms of the vedernikov bouwer vb kacimov et al 2019 model we consider a shallow channel of a small h for channels of zero h an explicit analytical solution for a steady state 2 d flow has been obtained by riesenkampf pk 77 kacimov 2006 who assumed that the channel bed or fig 1d depicts the right half of the flow domain is a constant zero piezometric head segment of a fixed width w along which the pressure head p 0 the curve r1r2 is a free boundary capillary fringe along which p pc where pc is a positive constant this constant quantifies the vb capillary properties of the soil table 5 p 37 in pk 77 gives pc for main soils the fringe is also a streamline along which a stream function is ψ qr provided y 0 along the ray of symmetry or3 fig 1d a horizontal segment rr1 of a width wr is also a streamline ψ qr with a stronger capillarity higher pc the dyad wr qr increases as compared with the no capillarity limit 0 ksw riesenkampf found the following implicit relation for qr as a series expansion see eqs 4 9 p 179 in pk 77 25 w q r π 2 8 j 1 exp 2 j 1 π p c k s 2 q r 2 j 1 2 we introduce dimensionless quantities q r q r k s p c w w p c t t k s p c a a p c we also convert the series 25 and get 26 w q r π 2 8 exp π 2 q r hypergometricpfq 1 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 exp π 2 q r where hypergometricpfq is the mathematica routine for a generalized hypergeometric function pfq a b z wolfram 1991 we solve eq 26 with respect to q r using the findroot routine of mathematica the obtained root q r w we put into the rhs of the equation of mass conservation 27 da t dt w t dw t d t tan ω π q r w t w 0 w r explicit integration of the nonlinear ode 27 like in subsection 2 1 is not possible consequently we solved the cauchy problem 27 using the ndsolve routine of mathematica the results are shown in fig 6 for ω 0 1 0 186 and 0 3 curves 1 3 correspondingly the curves in fig 6 indicate the experimentally observed increase of dh dt and hence of dw dt when h and w approach zero instead of the riesenkampf s solution 25 a triangular channel of an arbitrary slope angle can be considered recently samal and mishra 2017 applied the vb model to steady 2d flows from such channels unfortunately their analytical solution is presented in a semi inverse mode viz qi is evaluated for a given set of affixes of conformal mappings rather than as a function of the channel sizes and pc the results of this section can be also used for determination of pc from the trench experiment provided ks of the soil is known we recall pk 77 that commonly pc is found from experiments in vertical columns where a horizontal capillary fringe is equilibrated with time at a counter gravity imbibition from a horizontal zero pressure isobar at the bottom of the column even for a sandy soil this requires a couple of days an alternative method involves the vg or other water retention curve see e g smagin 2012 i e lengthy lab experiments with a pressure plate apparatus the curves in fig 6 are express alternatives for an undisturbed soil indeed for a constructed trench ω one can monitor infiltration and measure t e for example curve 2 has t e 0 25 and the sand box experiments section 4 give te 7 7 min assume that ks 1 16 cm min then pc ks te t e 35 cm 5 hydrus simulations the above sandbox experiments and analytical solutions were simulated numerically by hydrus2d šimůnek et al 1999 bagarello et al 2019 i e using a fem code to solve richards equation in this model we avoid determination of free boundaries like in section 2 see also pk 77 philip 1990 the geometry of the hydrus2d models is a right half of a triangular furrow in figs 1a and 7 the modeled flow domains are rectangles of sizes x z 100 170 cm the left upper corner of these triangles are sliced by a half channel fig 7 a grid resolution analysis was performed in order to ensure accuracy and stability of modelling by varying the mesh size by one increment from a coarse mesh of 5 cm to a fine mesh of 1 cm the mesh size was refined to 0 5 cm near the trench bed the inlet segment ab fig 7 in order to reduce the computational error the maximum number of hydrus iterations was 10 and the water content tolerance was 0 001 we used the rosetta package of hydrus to predict and retrieve the van genuchten vg parameters of the sandbox soil we used the laboratory analysis of the soil texture and bulk density of sand from al shukaili et al 2019 the soil capillarity vg parameters were α 0 145 1 cm and n 2 68 found by al shukaili et al 2019 using a pressure plate apparatus the predicted ks rosetta package was modified to the measured value ks 0 91 cm min while the remaining four vg parameters were kept the same initially at t 0 the soil moisture content in the three experiments was relatively high θv 0 1 therefore we selected an initial pressure head in hydrus2d p0 10 cm everywhere in the domain this p0 was retrieved from a retc curve at t 0 the whole channel of the numerical model is filled with surface water and 2d seepage commences from segment ab fig 7 a hydrus free drainage condition was imposed along the outlet segment dj fig 7 the sides bc cd and aj in fig 7 were no flux boundaries hydrus2d version 3 offers a new reservoir boundary condition the user can consider a reservoir well wetland or furrow with a falling drawdown level such that a part of ab in fig 7 is submersed under trench water segment ae in fig 1a

boundary condition along ab the initial half width w0 2 and initial water level h0 were set as the experimental settings the performance of hydrus2d was evaluated following brunetti et al 2016 and

a good agreement between the measured and hydrus simulated values of the drawdown time for the water level in the three trenches see fig 8a c solid line further the results of the t test between the measured and simulated drawdown time showed insignificant differences at a 5 confidence interval for all the trenches p 0 05 hydrus visualizes the velocity vectors as arrows with a snapshot indication of the flow direction and speeds at various points within the flow domain in fig 9 we focused on velocities near the trench slope ab for the mild slope this segment of the pentagon is most vulnerable to seepage induced soil erosion specifically if the velocity vectors along ab are oriented from the soil to the air and the hydraulic gradients are above a certain threshold limit then the slope may become unstable due to heaving suffusion piping and other deleterious phenomena pk 77 the hydrus colored map in fig 9 shows isotachs at t 7 min when all ponded water has vanished from the trench the upper left panel in fig 9 illustrates that at t 2 14 min and earlier along bc see fig 1a the motion of water was towards the lower segment jd later at t 4 31 min the upper right panel of fig 9 water got deflected along bc downward the stagnation point st is shown in the lower left panel in fig 9 when t 5 36 min and h 2 7 cm at this point a capillarity dominated upward oriented flow from the ponded segment ab of the trench collides with the gravity prevailed downward flow along bc at an even later time t 6 27 min the lower right panel in fig 9 the stagnation point slipped down as water level in the trench dropped at t te the darcian velocity at points a and b is infinite in the analytical model of seepage from a soil channel with capillarity counted by the vedernikov bouwer model see kacimov et al 2019 pk 77 similarly in hydrus at t te velocity is very high at points a and b a minimum velocity magnitude along ab is attained at a certain point between a and b this is evident from the graphs of velocity as a function of the arc coordinate along ab not shown here for the sake of brevity at a certain time instance t te i e after extinction of surface water point a became a stagnation point at this late stage not shown in fig 9 the saturated bubble descended deep enough and all soil moisture above point a moved down fig 10 a shows hydrus generated isobars for t 3 min it is noteworthy that a phreatic line which bounds the red subdomain of the positive pore pressure in fig 10a is a curve with an inflection point compare with a straight analytical phreatic line fe in section 2 sophocleous 2002 his fig 4 pointed out that this inverted water table under stream beds is separated from a regular regional water table see also warrick and zhang 1987 their figs 2 3 and 5 7 fig 10b illustrates the distribution of the moisture content at t 8 min when the trench was already empty here the wet bubble has descended deep under point a and the positive pressure zone vanished i e flow is unsaturated everywhere in the pentagon pressure computed by hydrus along aj in fig 10b increased from about 6 6 cm at point a to a maximum of about 2 7 cm inside the red subdomain and then decreased to almost 10 cm at the depth of about 47 cm beneath point a the flow kinematics in figs 9 10 manifests a complex interaction of gravity darcian resistance and capillarity at different stages of seepage the corresponding dynamics kinematics qualitatively agrees with the vedernikov bouwer analytical solutions for steady state regimes of 2 d seepage with a tension saturated zone and with the philip 1990 theory of quasilinear flows without free boundaries 6 concluding remarks in this paper we illustrate how to use a drawdown curve h t for determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air entrance pressure in the vedernikov bouwer model our analysis started with a simple analytical model of a falling head permeameter as a triangular unlined trench dug in a coarse textured permeable bed once upon water filling the trench a visible surface water volume gradually transforms into an invisible volume of pore water in the analytical model capillarity was ignored and only gravity and darcian resistance trumped a transient seepage with a rotating phreatic surface a triangular wet bulb is subtended by a finite length segment of a phreatic line and its mass balance and pressure continuity conjugated with a superjacent declining triangle of vanishing surface water consequently this rotating segment invades a dry subjacent soil and recedes from the wet part emerged earlier under the trench bed these dynamics of pore water redistribution represent a paradoxical case of an instantaneous and concurrent imbibition and drainage blunt 2017 the analytical solutions with free moving boundaries can serve back of envelope calculations optimization in design of mar infiltration entities or furrow irrigation al shukaili et al 2020 as well as in situations when a soil hydrologist or civil engineer does not have access to a commercial computer package our sandbox experiments with constructed triangular trenches of mild and steep slopes filled with water allowed to measure the drawdown of the surface water level and monitoring of the wet front propagating into the box filling the monitored drawdown curves h t matched reasonably well the analytical solutions from which ks can be easily evaluated indeed soil properties can be estimated from simple experiments with filling a trench ditch recording extinction of its storage depth of water and using eq 24 and type curve 2 in fig 2 calculation of ks then can be done for an arbitrary wall angle of the trench and specified porosity therefore such a primitive trench can be used as a falling head permeameter the trench experiments were modelled in hydrus2d using a new reservoir boundary condition furrow šimůnek et al 2018 hydrus solves richards equation and counts for capillarity of the soil where flows are not bounded by sharp interfaces e g mathematical phreatic surfaces see philip 1990 hydrus simulated values of drawdown time for water level in the trenches agreed well with the measured once based on root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency e results of t test between the measured and simulated drawdown time showed insignificant differences at a 5 confidence interval for all the trenches p 0 05 the results of hydrus simulations helped us to predict fields of flow characteristics that evolve in time and the corresponding kinematic descriptors also it visualized the transiency of a saturated unsaturated flow in hydrus pentagon imposed by the dropping water level in the trench upon extinction of the surface water there a wet bubble propagates downward and gets quickly sucked by capillarity of an ambient unsaturated soil a complex pattern of velocity vectors streamlines isobars and isohumes is also reproduced by hydrus in particular it is shown that for a selected trench with a bank slope of 1 1 and selected sand the falling water level does not generate darcian gradients oriented from the soil to the air i e seepage induced suffusion of soil near the slope ab in fig 1a is unlikely credit authorship contribution statement a al shukaili methodology writing original draft software a al

5698,the objective of this study was the estimation of the effect of droplet structure of diurnal precipitation totals measured with thies clima disdrometer on the value of surface runoff from three kinds of surface used in urban areas i e a roof surface covered with small grain roofing paper a car park surface of openwork concrete slabs and a tarmac surface and the resultant reduction of infiltration from atmospheric precipitation the detailed comparative analysis of diurnal precipitation totals in the aspect of droplet structure structure of increasing influx of precipitation water to the surface and changes of air temperature humidity conditions allowed preliminary elucidation of the effect of those factors on the values of the runoff indices for the different hardened surfaces the analysis of reduction of infiltration presents the level of supply losses resulting from the use of surface covering systems with various degrees of permeability to precipitation water a solution that can minimise the indicated losses can be an approach to precipitation water management assuming interception of possibly the largest amounts of non productive surface runoff waters and then using

the structure of surface cover the share of surfaces impermeable to water increases water falling onto an impermeable substrate has no possibility of infiltration at the point of precipitation occurrence or that possibility is significantly limited the consequence is an increase in the volume of surface runoff of precipitation waters in given areas arnold and gibbons 1996 geiger and dreiseitl 1999 szewrański et al 2018 reduced water infiltration down the soil profile is reflected in a lowering of the ground water table piskorek et al 2011 and a decrease of moisture in upper layers of soil the amount of water available for plants decreases with consequent deterioration of the condition of vegetation in towns and cities sand et al 2018 the current approach to rainwater management as a solution of the problem of management of the formed volumes of surface runoff assumes the fastest possible discharge of rainwater to sewerage systems and then to a receiver in the form of a water course that solution even though it ensures rapid disposal of considerable amounts of precipitation water and has been in common use for many years has a number of shortcomings the supreme one is the lack of adaptation of the capacity of sewerage systems to increased volumes of precipitation waters resulting from extreme rainstorms with high intensity or long lasting rains with a high precipitation total the effect of overloading of sewerage systems is water jets from manholes and flooding of streets pavements squares another negative aspect with comparable importance is the loss of great amounts of water which is discharged from the area of catchment basins into sewerage systems research projects concerning the relation atmospheric precipitation surface runoff differ among other thing in the following a the size of the area on which the research is conducted b the factors affecting the volume of surface runoff and the values of the surface runoff index the first group refers to macro studies on the scale of a housing estate or a fragment of a town or city and the object studied is the volumes of surface runoff formed within a smaller area barron et al 2011 burns et al 2005 bzymek and jarosińska 2012 dietz and clausen 2008 ferguson and suckling 1989 melanen and laukkanen 1980 metsäranta et al 2005 pauleit et al 2005 sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 valtanen et al 2014 the other group comprises studies conducted on the micro scale i e within specific types of surface those are most frequently existing or created for the needs of the study car park sites garage driveways or internal roads inside housing estates brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 they can also be solely specially designed research sites created within the area of research institutions romaniak 2017 atmospheric precipitation is characterised by its duration amount and intensity those factors are parameters that significantly affect the value of surface runoff of rain waters existing measurement methods in the form of the classic hellmann rain gauge or the float pluviograph and modern automatic weighing precipitation gauges and tipping bucket rain gauges allow the measurement of those characteristics with varying levels of precision różdżyński 2014 tapiador et al 2012 however the interpretation requirements concerning atmospheric precipitation as well as the technological progress enforced the search for new innovative indirect methods of their measurement such instruments include disdrometers in the case of which the object of measurement is not the volume of precipitation as is the case with the classic methods but its structure i e the size of droplets and their velocity these instruments can also identify various kinds of hydrometeors i e drizzle rain hail snow or mixed precipitation there are two main kinds of disdrometers impact type and optical until the present day the impact type joss waldvogel disdrometer is often used in research harikumar et al 2010 joss and waldvogel 1967 kumar et al 2003 tokay et al 1996 over the period of the eighties and nineties of the 20th century there took place an evolution of optical disdrometers fernandez raga et al 2011 characterised by a greater precision than the impact type instruments these include the ott parsivell disdrometer used in studies by e g tapiador et al 2010 jaffrain and berne 2012 burszta adamiak 2012 and the thies clima disdrometer used by szewrański et al 2009 de moraes frasson et al 2011 biniak pieróg et al 2015 biniak pieróg 2017 the most modern device is the two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd used in the studies by diederich et al 2004 beard et al 2010 or raupach and berne 2015 the rainfall information acquisition possibilities offered by disdrometers and primarily on the structure of droplet sizes allow the innovative aspect of including that element in analyses of the volume of runoff from various surfaces used in urbanised areas the literature review by fernandez raga et al 2011 concerning studies conducted with the use of disdrometers indicates a very dynamic increase in the number of publications on this subject matter since the nineteen seventies as reported by those authors studies with the use of disdrometers are the most frequently conducted in the usa followed by the mediterranean countries such as france italy spain greece or israel and the least frequently in central european countries germany holland switzerland austria and poland however as opposed to classic rain gauges or various types of automatic pluviometers disdrometers are still fairly expensive equipment in recent years nevertheless an increase is observed in the use of such instruments in research guyot et al 2019 liu et al 2019 ramon et al 2017 serio et al 2019 yang et al 2019 so far the most frequently analysed factor with an impact on the relation atmospheric precipitation surface runoff is rainfall intensity barron et al 2011 burns et al 2005 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 valtanen et al 2014 in many research reports the authors analyse the rainfall runoff relation with respect to rainfall totals and its effect on the values of the surface runoff indices brattebo and booth 2003 bzymek and jarosińska 2012 ferguson and suckling 1989 gomez ullate et al 2011 melanen and laukkanen 1980 romaniak 2017 in a small number of papers the rainfall surface runoff relation is analysed in greater detail for example estimating the rainfall structure during the course of a rainfall event through the assessment of the maximum rainfall amount within a chosen time interval gnecco et al 2018 also analysed is the effect of droplet size distribution on soil erosion and the formation of surface runoff of rainfall water meshesha et al 2019 however in a majority of research reports droplet size is a factor whose effect is analysed in relation to soil erosion and not as a factor that can have an impact on the volume of runoff water from hardened surfaces the consequence of occurrence of various types of surface cover with varying degrees of permeability are limitations in infiltration from atmospheric precipitations a solution that can minimise the indicated losses can be an approach to enhance precipitation water management maximising the volume of water intercepted by the surface and then using that water that approach relates to the concept of sustainable water management according to which water should be treated as a resource and not as a useless element of urban space precipitation water in the form of runoff from impermeable surfaces can be directed to such landscape elements as rain gardens or infiltration basins in which it is temporarily stored on the surface and then used for economic purposes excess amounts of stored water can also be infiltrated gradually into the substrate in addition the accumulated volumes can be used as water resource for irrigation of green areas in this way the losses of soil profile supply demonstrated in the study can be compensated for through its supply with accumulated water from surface runoff the approach to precipitation water management outlined here consists in water retention in the place where the precipitation has occurred i e within the catchment basin this is one of the key assumptions of present directions in precipitation water management directive no 6541 17 of the president of the city of wrocław of 17 march 2017 on precipitation water management in wrocław 2017 framework water directive 2000 60 we of 23rd october 2000 2000 regulation of the minister of the environment of 18th november 2014 2014 study on the conditions and directions of spatial development of the city of wrocław 2018 the new approach to precipitation water management finds an application in created strategies of spatial management and in development plans of urbanised areas fryd et al 2013 romaniak et al 2014 stahre 2008 the conditions presented above allow to formulate the objective of the study as estimation of the effect of droplet size structure of diurnal rainfall totals on the volume of runoff from three types of surface used in urban areas and the resultant reduction of infiltration from atmospheric precipitations the estimation of the reduction of soil profile supply presents the levels of potential supply losses resulting from the use of surface cover with varying degree of permeability to rainfall water 2 materials and methods the study concerning the relations between diurnal precipitation totals and diurnal volumes of surface runoff was conducted on three experimental surfaces constructed in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology wrocław wrocław swojec the experimental surfaces were a roof surface p1 covered with small grain roofing paper a car park surface apb of openwork concrete slabs and a tarmac surface as fig 1 the roof surface p1 was covered with small grain heat sealing roofing paper extradach top 5 2 szybki profil sbs made by icopal for surface p1 a 2 roof slope was applied commonly used in houses in poland the car park surface apb was built of openwork slabs with single slab dimensions of 60x40x10 cm the material filling the open spaces of the slabs was a sand gravel mixture with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 16 mm that surface had a slope of 2 typical for road surfaces and car park areas the tarmac surface as was constructed of a cold setting mineral asphalt mixture tar can 2001 the slope of that surface was 2 conforming to the slope value used for road surfaces in poland the experimental surfaces were constructed in the same way as those used in urban space both in regard to the materials used and the slope angles on each of the experimental surfaces a water tight framing was constructed so that the enclosed surface area was 1 m2 that area is the specific surface area from which precipitation water is collected in the form of surface runoff at the lower part of each of the experimental surfaces formed due to the slope applied a gap was left in the framing allowing the water to be discharged into troughs each trough was connected by a system of profiles to an opening in the top cover of a container for the accumulation of rain waters the study period covered the months april october in the years 2014 2015 and 2017 measurements of the volume of rainwater surface runoff from the experimental surfaces were taken daily at 7 a m the volume of the runoff was measured using a 1 l laboratory flask the measured volume of rainwater was the total diurnal volume of surface runoff of precipitation water from the preceding day the limitation of the surface area from which water was collected to 1 m2 allowed the representation of the amount of runoff from the experimental surfaces in mm which allowed those values to be compared with atmospheric precipitation amounts measured in the same units the study was based on the results of diurnal measurements of atmospheric precipitation with the use of two methods the classic hellman rain gauge and the contactless laser rain gauge the thies clima disdrometer both instruments were installed so that the measurement of precipitation was taken at the height of exactly 1 m guide to meteorological instruments and methods and observations 2010 instructions for meteorological stations 2014 in poland only a few research centres conduct measurements of that meteorological element with the use of such modern instruments as disdrometers one of those is the wrocław university of environmental and life sciences the principle of operation of the optical disdrometer used in the study consists in the measurement of reduction in laser beam intensity by hydrometeor particles passing through a plane of infrared light with surface area of 45 6 cm2 fig 2 a photo diode with an optical system installed on the receiver side continuously measures the intensity of laser light beam converting it into an electric impulse the moment a particle passes through the light plane the received signal weakens based on which the particle diameter is calculated while its fall velocity is calculated on the basis of the duration of the reduction the instrument allows to acquire information on e g the intensity amount and type of precipitations and which is an important novelty on the structure of its droplets in the 22 classes of droplet size provided by the manufacturer the information acquired is saved at a 1 miute time step and transferred via a serial interface to the data base the enormous amount of data 541 data generated in the 1 minute reports by the manufacturer s software was systematised by means of the original software dispre biniak pieróg et al 2015 szulczewski et al 2013 which allowed to conduct analyses as per the requirements of this study the 1 minute data were the basis for the distribution of diurnal precipitation totals and their droplet size structure in the 22 classes of droplet sizes proposed by the manufacturer in the next phase the contribution of the individual classes of droplet size in each selected diurnal rainfall total was calculated it was assumed that a droplet is spherical in shape for each of the droplet diameter classes a mean diameter value was adopted within a given range and on its basis the volume of individual droplets v within the classes was calculated in accordance with the sphere volume formula next the volumes determined in that manner were divided by the surface area of the light plane amounting to 4560 mm2 within which the measurement of rainfall amount took place based on the information on the volume of an individual droplet in the 22 droplet size classes proposed by the manufacturer converted into precipitation totals in mm and on the number of droplets identified in each of the classes their contribution in the overall rainfall totals was calculated for the purposes of the present study the 22 classes were reduced through aggregation to 9 classes of droplet diameters biniak pieróg 2017 presented in table 1 the developed droplet size structure allowed to estimate the percentage share of each of the adopted classes in the total number of droplets in selected diurnal precipitation totals analogous analyses conducted by biniak pieróg 2017 for 300 rainfall episodes identified during the 5 year period of 2009 2013 demonstrated that totals calculated by means of the manufacturer s algorithm and those calculated on the basis of droplet sizes did not differ statistically significantly and the calculated coefficients of correlation rk assumed values above 0 9900 initially 58 cases from the years 2014 2015 and 2017 from the period from april till october were selected for the analyses that number did not cover all days with precipitation that occurred in the period adopted for analysis already at the start of distribution of the data measured with the disdrometer the fundamental cause of elimination of days with precipitation was the high failure rate of the instrument resulting from interruptions in power supply determining the functioning of the instrument another eliminating factor was contamination of the measuring diodes of the instrument e g with spider webs or mowed grass resides observable as fake precipitation in a situation of no precipitation indication on the classic hellmann rain gauge the precipitation amounts measured by means of the standard rain gauge in the months from april till october in the years 2014 2015 and 2017 were grouped in a four step classification 0 5 5 0 mm 5 1 10 0 mm 10 1 20 0 mm 20 0 mm the measurement of the diurnal precipitation totals with the classic rain gauge was used as a control for the interpretation of results obtained by means of the disdrometer the maximum allowable absolute difference of diurnal precipitation totals was adopted at the level of 10 irrespective of the kind of measuring instrument the factors affecting the differentiation of results include e g wind velocity droplet size distribution and the design of the rain gauge taking this into account in the case of the use of the disdrometer is the absence of any possibility of precipitation being blown out of the inlet section of e g the hellmann rain gauge as the measurement proceeds in the continuous mode with no shields in the disdrometer there is no surface that would significantly deform the air flow hence those instruments allow the development of the most credible corrections for the wind factor and this allows to relate wind velocity with information on droplet size nešpor et al 2000 sieck et al 2007 as testik and pei 2017 point out an increase of wind velocity has a significant impact in terms of increase of the number of small droplets and a decrease of the number of larger droplets in the next stage only the precipitation totals obtained by means of the disdrometer were used at that stage the next elimination was performed for further analysis only those cases were chosen for which the absolute difference between the diurnal precipitation totals calculated on the basis of droplet size and with the use of the disdrometer manufacturer s algorithm did not exceed 10 as in the case of the first stage of the analysis the analyses demonstrated that the adopted threshold is a safe one as its value is slightly above the median of residual values for the individual differences calculated at each of the stages of data elimination with the assumption of spherical droplet shape adopted in the study at the stage of calculation of water volume contributed by the adopted droplet size classes to the precipitation total the obtained differences of precipitation totals could have resulted from variation of wind velocity causing various degrees of their deformation beard et al 2010 also such events were eliminated from the data base for which the runoff volumes obtained raised reservations even though it would relate to only one of the surfaces under analysis that procedure left for the final analysis 23 cases from among which the most interesting ones in each of the above classes of diurnal precipitation totals are discussed in detail on the basis of the diurnal precipitation totals acquired from disdrometer measurements pd and the corresponding measured values of surface runoff odos the values of the so called surface runoff indices ψd were calculated using the formula 1 ψ d o dos p d where ψd surface runoff index of precipitation waters from the experimental surfaces diurnal value odos diurnal volume of surface runoff from an experimental surface mm pd diurnal total of atmospheric precipitation mm the first step of the analyses was the estimation of the effect of the diurnal precipitation total and of its droplet structure on the value of the index of surface runoff from the roof surface i e from the roofing paper from the car park surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs and from the tarmac surface the analyses also took into account the air temperature humidity conditions for each of the cases the next step of the analyses was the estimation of the limiting role of the three experimental surfaces on the value of infiltration under two standard surfaces bare and grass covered taking into account the variation of precipitation amounts and droplet structure in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology where in parallel to the experiment described here measurements of soil moisture were conducted under both standard surfaces the surface soil layers are composed of small grained loamy sands and weakly loamy and loose sands in deeper layers with interlayers of mainly loamy sands and sandy loams typologically they are proper fluvisols in the international classification fao wrb iuss 2006 they are cultured soils with preserved features of alluvial sediments and most often belong to the group of phaeozems fluvic gleyic phaeozems anthric arenic bulk density of the soil is 1 4 g cm3 in the surface horizon and increases with depth below the humus horizon to 1 58 g cm3 while in the layer of underlying loam it attains the value of 1 55 g cm3 total porosity varies in the range of 40 45 and attains its maximum values in the humus horizon water permeability in the sandy surface layers attains values from 2 9 10 3 to 4 6 10 3 cm s the lowest value of the coefficient of infiltration is found in the sandy loam at the depth of 120 150 cm and amounts to 1 9 10 4 cm s żyromski et al 2016 a soil profile with depth of up to 30 cm was adopted for the analyses in the conditions of the presented experiment that soil layer was not supplied with water from capillary rise this allowed to assume that the observed increase of water resources in that soil layer resulted from its effective supply with precipitation water alone the basis for the analyses were diurnal measurements of soil moisture by means of the tdr technique time domain reflectometry during the morning observations conducted in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology since 2002 this is one of the most modern measurement techniques consisting in the forcing of an electromagnetic wave impulse which entering the analysed medium soil is reflected and in the measurement of the moment of return of the attenuated reflected impulse the value of the attenuation of the reflected return wave depends primarily on the content of water in the soil and also on the concentration of electrolytes and of clay particles topp et al 1980 the system used in this study was composed of the modern tdr mux mp gauges with midl gprs data acquisition loggers for field installation the sole producer of which in poland is the institute of agrophysics pas lublin the instruments allow continuous measurement of soil moisture temperature and salinity at the same point the instruments work with a set of tdr probes installed at depths of 10 20 30 cm under bare and grass covered soil surface the diurnal information on soil moisture was the basis for the calculation of water resources in the three soil layers adopted for the analyses with depths of 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 cm according to the formula r h 0 w 0 10 where r water resources in soil layer mm h0 soil layer thickness cm w0 soil moisture tdr cm 3 cm 3 on the basis of diurnal changes of water resources in the adopted soil layers for selected days with rainfall the possible limitation of soil infiltration was estimated for the analysed hardened surfaces the analyses took into account the rainfall volume and its droplet size structure 3 results and discussion for the purposes of this study detailed analysis was performed for 5 pairs of cases selected as an example with similar precipitation totals within the various ranges of diurnal rainfall amounts table 2 presents their corresponding values of precipitation measured with both methods the values of differences and the calculated indices of surface runoff ψd for each of the experimental surfaces table 3 presents the precipitation droplet structure for the 9 classes of droplet diameters adopted for the needs of this study showing the percentage share of the number of droplets in each of the classes in the total number of droplets identified in the diurnal precipitation total and the amount of water in mm that the individual droplet classes contributed to the diurnal precipitation total as can be seen from table 2 in most of the analysed cases the highest values of the runoff indices were obtained for the roof surface constructed of small grain roofing paper in the range from 0 52 to 1 00 followed by the tarmac surface from 0 47 to 0 93 it was observed that with increase in the diurnal precipitation totals table 2 cases 7 10 the differences in the values of the runoff indices between the two surfaces disappeared a distinct character was noted for the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs characterised by permeability to precipitation water that permeability resulted from the high porosity of the material filling the internal spaces of the concrete elements used compared to the two analysed impermeable surfaces the calculated runoff indices assumed distinctly lower values characterised by a broader range of variation from 0 02 to 0 85 for the extent of runoff reduction and its variation the degree of saturation with water of the material constituting the filler of the slabs was surely also not insignificant the analysis of droplet structure of the precipitation totals indicated the highest share of the smallest droplets with diameters up to 0 5 mm irrespective of the precipitation total the second ranking was the share of droplets with diameters of 0 5 1 0 mm however the high percentage share of the smallest droplets was not reflected in the volume of water that this droplet class contributed to the overall precipitation total it was found that most frequently the largest amounts of water in mm were contributed to the total by droplets from the class of 0 5 1 5 mm and only in three cases the largest contribution was that of droplets twice as large with diameters of 2 0 3 0 mm fig 3 presents the relations between the amount of water in mm contributed to the total by the dominant droplet class pl k d and the value of runoff in mm for each of the analysed surfaces odos the values of the calculated coefficients of determination r2 assigned to the increasing linear trends varied from 0 5736 for surface apb to 0 8651 for p1 and were statistically significant significance level for n 2 is 0 3994 the lowest value of r2 obtained for the surface covered with openwork concrete slabs is in support of earlier observations concerning the sensitivity of filling of the slabs of that surface to changes in water saturation figs 4 8 present the structures of precipitations with the corresponding diurnal weather conditions including increasing 10 minute precipitation totals and the values of air temperature and humidity for each of the analysed cases the detailed comparative analysis of pairs of diurnal precipitation totals in the aspect of the droplet structure structure of increasing influx of precipitation water to the surface and changes of air temperature humidity conditions in a given 24 hour period allowed preliminary elucidation of the effect of those factors on the values of the runoff indices for the different hardened surfaces precipitations 5 0 mm the two cases from may and june selected for the analysis fig 4 with diurnal precipitation at the level of 4 3 mm differed in respect of the class of droplets that contributed the most water to the diurnal total in the case of the precipitation of 24th may 2014 the greatest contribution was that of droplets with diameters from 1 0 mm to 3 0 mm 3 4 mm of precipitation while on the 3rd of june 2014 the greatest share in mm in the diurnal precipitation total was that of droplets with diameters of 0 5 1 0 mm at the level of 1 7 mm basically that differentiation did not have any significance for the values of the runoff index for the impermeable surfaces i e roofing paper and tarmac as indicated by the comparable values of the runoff index fig 4 table 2 similarly to the varied temperature humidity conditions and the structure of the increasing influx of precipitation in time however there are distinct differences in the values of ψd for the semi permeable surface apb 0 02 and 0 65 the higher value of runoff index for the 3rd of june 2014 resulted from the occurrence of precipitation on the preceding day in the amount of 6 2 mm which caused partial saturation of the material filling the spaces in the concrete elements and that was reflected in a reduction of the water absorption capacity of that surface no such situation was noted in the case from may precipitations in the range of 5 1 10 0 mm the compared pair of cases of the 21st of september 2014 and the 12th of july 2015 with greater diurnal precipitation totals at the level of 8 8 and 8 6 mm respectively is characterised by greater differentiation fig 5 in the first case the major part of the diurnal total 8 0 mm was contributed by droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm while in the second case smaller droplets dominated with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 1 5 mm which resulted in their share in the precipitation total at the level of 4 8 mm distinctly higher values of the runoff index were obtained for the 21st of september 2014 they varied from 0 56 for surface apb to 0 92 for p1 in this case the observed share of larger droplets could have been the cause of increased values of surface runoff irrespective of the kind of surface larger droplets formed greater runoff volumes and the occurrence of the precipitation during night hours reduced the possibility of water evaporation as did also the intensive accumulation of precipitation in time there was also precipitation on the preceding day with a diurnal amount of 15 7 mm which had a primary importance for the reduction of permeability of surface apb the distinctly smaller runoff in the case of the 12th of july 2015 was surely caused by the thermal conditions with temperature values approaching as much as 28 c fig 5 that caused strong heating of the analysed surfaces during the day the effect of that was faster evaporation of smaller droplets arriving at the heated surfaces which in combination with the uniform distribution of the precipitation in time contributed to an increased reduction of the amount of water constituting surface runoff precipitations in the range of 10 1 20 0 mm the two cases from that range selected for analysis were those from the 14th of july 2015 and the 24th of july 2014 with comparable diurnal precipitation totals of 11 9 and 11 5 mm respectively fig 6 like the pair described above they were characterised by distinct differences with regard to the droplet classes that contributed the biggest amounts of water to the precipitation volume in the first case the principal contribution at the level of 9 0 mm was that of droplets with diameters in the range from 1 0 to 3 0 mm comparable values of the runoff index were obtained for the two impermeable surfaces at the level of 0 80 while in the case of surface apb the value of ψd was distinctly lower at 0 27 although the occurrence of precipitation was noted on the preceding day the indices for surfaces p1 and apb were lower than those obtained for the second case that situation could have been caused by the air temperature humidity conditions at the time of precipitation occurrence air temperature was around 22 0 c relative humidity approximately 70 causing heating up of the surfaces and accumulation of precipitation from its first phase on the one hand the higher air temperature caused heating of the surfaces and evaporation of larger droplets and at the same time the accumulation of precipitation in short time intervals and the related increase of its intensity could have caused the breaking of larger droplets into smaller ones that could undergo evaporation which in effect resulted in a reduction of runoff volume in the case from the 24th of july 2014 a comparable amount of water at the level of 8 7 mm originated from smaller droplets in the range of 0 5 1 5 mm in that case a greater differentiation was observed in the values of the surface runoff index 1 0 for p1 0 33 for abp and 0 51 for as on that day the air temperature humidity conditions were uniform with a lower temperature than in the first case from the pair in question in the range of 16 0 17 0 c and a distinctly higher humidity at the level of 90 the lower possibility of evaporation of droplets even in spite of their smaller diameters and the small grained structure of surface p1 resulting in a low degree of rainwater retention could have had an effect on the value of the index the value of the runoff index obtained for the tarmac surface was notably lower in this case and amounted to 0 51 it can be assumed that in that specific case it was dependent on the droplet structure of the precipitation the porosity of that surface could facilitate under the existing atmospheric conditions the accumulation and retention of smaller droplets precipitations 20 0 mm the days selected for the analysis in this range of precipitations were the 9th of july 2014 and the 1st of september 2017 with similar diurnal precipitation totals at the level of 24 7 and 21 0 mm respectively fig 7 as the pair compared above also in this case they were different in terms of the droplet sizes that contributed the most water to the precipitation volume the highest contribution in mm in the precipitation total of 9th july 2014 was that of droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm accounting for nearly the whole of the precipitation total 21 9 mm comparable values of ψd were obtained for surfaces p1 and as at the level of 0 90 while the value for surface apb was 0 44 the major part of the precipitation reached the surfaces in 4 phases 3 accumulated in time and 1 uniformly distributed in the night hours in the second case there was a notable contribution of two classes including smaller droplets with diameters from 0 5 to 1 5 mm that contributed a little over one half of the precipitation total 13 3 mm the obtained values of ψd were distinctly lower as compared to the first case for each of the analysed surfaces and amounted to 0 61 and 0 67 for surfaces p1 and as respectively and 0 25 for surface apb on that day the air temperature humidity conditions were very stable air temperature oscillated around 14 0 c while relative humidity was about 90 and a highly uniform influx of precipitation in time was observed the lower intensity of the precipitation and the smaller droplet diameters could have contributed to easier accumulation of rainwater on the analysed surfaces which resulted in increased values of surface runoff as expressed in the values of index ψd extreme events an interesting example presented in the study is two different events with exceptionally high diurnal precipitation totals relating to the days 22nd october 2014 and 24th july 2017 amounting to 31 2 and 49 6 mm respectively fig 8 in the first case nearly the entire precipitation total originated from droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm the precipitation lasted for nearly 19 h and the influx of water was almost linear at very stable weather conditions with air temperature oscillating around 8 0 c and air humidity in the range from 86 to above 90 the obtained values of the runoff index were highly uniform from 0 85 for the openwork concrete surface apb to 0 93 for the tarmac surface as one could therefore infer that with the long lasting and uniformly distributed precipitation the gravel material filling the spaces of surface apb gradually attained saturation which resulted in a change of the character of that surface from permeable to impermeable at a level similar to the hardened surfaces in this case an additional factor could be the precipitation of the preceding day causing an increase of moisture of the filler material of that surface the case from the 24th of july 2017 differs from the above in terms of the precipitation influx and the air temperature humidity conditions at the start of the precipitation and during its initial phase air temperature was at the level of about 20 0 c and decreased to about 16 0 c in the course of the precipitation in its main phase the relative humidity displayed an increasing trend from about 70 to over 90 the structure of droplet classes in mm in the precipitation total was very similar to that identified for the first case as more than 40 0 mm of the precipitation volume originated from droplets with diameters from 0 5 to 3 0 mm however the obtained values of the runoff index were notably lower and amounted to from 0 25 for surface apb to 0 52 and 0 57 for surfaces p1 and as respectively in the case of that pair of events the main cause of the large differences in the values of the surface runoff index should not be sought in the droplet structure itself the overriding cause could have been the high intensity of the precipitation larger droplets falling at high velocity on a hot surface could be broken into smaller ones and evaporate which was reflected in the reduced amount of surface runoff the second stage of the study consisted in the estimation of the contribution of the analysed diurnal precipitation sums with individual droplet size structures to the infiltration δr of the surface soil layers with thickness of 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 cm under the two standard surfaces bare and grass covered table 4 presents the values of diurnal precipitation totals values of water reserves in the analysed soil layers on the day of precipitation occurrence and diurnal change of soil water resources resulting from direct influx of precipitation water as follows from table 4 irrespective of droplet size structure precipitations with low totals up to 4 0 mm did not cause any significant increase of soil water resources in any of the analysed soil layers under both surfaces in the case of the second analysed pair of events with higher precipitation totals in the range of 5 1 10 0 mm such a differentiation is observable the precipitation of september 2014 with a total of 8 8 mm in which the major part originated from droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm caused an increase of soil water resources observable for both surfaces with notably higher values of δr being obtained for the grass covered surface in the range from 5 9 mm in the layer with 10 cm thickness to 6 8 for the 30 cm thick soil layer whereas the precipitation of july 2015 with a dominant contribution of smaller droplets in the range from 0 5 to 1 5 mm caused a slight increase of water resources in the analysed soil layers under the bare surface in the case of the lawn practically no changes in soil moisture were observed which can be attributed to the fact that smaller droplets could evaporate on being deposited on the hot surface of plants analysis of another pair of days with precipitation in the range of 10 1 20 0 mm allowed somewhat different observations the precipitation of the 24th of july 2014 characterised by a distinct share of smaller droplets in the range of 0 5 1 5 mm in its total amount of 11 5 mm caused a comparable increase of water resources in the analysed soil layers irrespective of the kind of surface compared to the event discussed above the character of precipitation influx in time was similar but the observed values of air temperature were notably lower the different droplet structure of the precipitation of the 14th of july 2015 where the main contribution to the total was that of droplets with diameters from 1 0 to 3 0 mm caused a notable increase of water resources in each of the analysed soil layers under the grass covered surface and δr assumed values in the range from 4 5 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 11 7 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm that precipitation was not effective in the case of the bare surface especially down to the depth of 20 cm on the one hand the precipitation influx in time characterised by two phases with higher intensity could cause increased surface runoff from the bare soil surface and on the other larger droplets breaking into smaller ones could cause their lower effectiveness in the case of the lawn the kind of surface cover could minimise both of those phenomena analysis of the pair of events with high precipitation totals of above 20 0 mm taking into account their droplet structure and precipitation influx in time showed that those elements could have been important in the supply of soil layers with water under the bare surface irrespective of the thickness of the soil layers a distinct increase of soil water resources was observed in the situation of the precipitation of july 2014 characterised by a notable contribution of droplets from the range of 0 5 3 0 mm in the precipitation total in mm the value of δr varied from 2 8 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 7 8 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm in the case of the grass covered surface precipitation effectiveness was comparable both in the case of the event of the 1st of september 2017 and of the 9th of july 2014 irrespective of the analysed soil layer compared to the bare surface distinctly higher values of δr were noted in the range from 6 1 mm and 8 8 mm for the layer of 0 10 mm to 10 3 and 11 5 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm respectively for the days of 01 09 2017 and 09 07 2014 in the case of the last pair of events with exceptionally high precipitation totals but similar contributions of similar ranges of droplet diameters from 0 5 to 3 0 mm in mm in the precipitation totals it was observed that a notably higher effectiveness was characteristic of the precipitation of the 24th of july 2014 especially in the case of the grass covered surface the values of δr varied from 11 6 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 23 6 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm in this case the cause should be sought in the different values of soil water resources on the day of the precipitation occurrence that were decidedly lower in that case as compared to the state of the 22nd of october 2014 table 4 at that stage of the study also a multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify those variables that were significant for the value of water retention increase in the analysed soil layers under both types of surfaces the dependent variable was the change of soil water resources day to day as a result of precipitation influx δr while the independent variables were the level of water resources in a given soil layer on the day of precipitation occurrence rp and the contribution in mm of the dominant class of droplets pl k d in the final precipitation total the analyses conducted with the use of the software package statistica ver 12 5 statsoft 2012 showed in each case that pl k d was the variable that significantly affected the value of δr the obtained values of corrected coefficients of determination for the derived regression equations table 5 were statistically significant every time for a number of events n 2 at α 0 05 r2 statistically significant minimum is 0 3994 correlation of the value of increase of soil water resources with the value of runoff from the hardened surfaces i e covered with roofing paper and tarmac and the permeable surface of openwork concrete slabs allows the estimation of reduction of soil profile supply with precipitation water as an example fig 9 presents the relation of the value of reduction δr odos δr for soil layer with thickness of 30 cm under the bare and grass covered surfaces and the contribution in mm of the dominant droplet size class in the overall precipitation total pl k d for the bare surface those relations irrespective of the analysed variant were described the best by polynomial functions of the second and third degree while for the grass covered surface a linear function for p1 and apb as for as a polynomial function of the second degree for the obtained regression models the akaike criterion aic calculated additionally attained the minimum values fig 9 in the case of each of the surfaces higher values of the coefficient of determination r2 were obtained for the bare surface however irrespective of the kind of cover they were the highest for the variant with apb and the lowest for that with p1 0 7189 and 0 6686 for the bare surface and 0 6473 and 0 5289 for the grass covered surface respectively the set of events subjected to the analysis should be considered as a small one but the models obtained are optimally fitted to the analysed sample accumulation of water running off from 1 m2 of the analysed surfaces p1 apb and as and then using the water to supply 1 m2 of bare soil surface and grass covered soil would cause a proportional reduction of increase in their water resources relative to that observed in the conditions of actual influx of precipitation water to soil surface the cases of days with rainfall selected for the analysis and the values of surface runoff from 3 hardened surfaces used in urbanised areas obtained for them display a high similarity to the results obtained by other authors dealing with a similar subject matter brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 in this study on the basis of selected examples the values of reduction varied within the range from 0 to 48 for the roof surface from 15 to 98 for the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs and from 7 to 53 for the tarmac surface collins et al 2008 in their study at car park sites obtained the average value of reduction of the initial volume of rainfall water of 34 65 for a tarmac surface for three surfaces constructed of concrete blocks laid out with expansion gaps they obtained the following values 99 86 99 33 98 17 and 99 51 in our study the average value of reduction of the initial volume of rainfall water was 27 5 in the case of the tarmac surface and in the case of the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs apb 62 4 however those authors used in their study a greater number of events in the form of diurnal precipitations from 40 to 44 compared to our study 10 events gilbert and clausen 2006 obtained the following sequence of the volume of surface runoff in relation to the material used for surface cover tarmac paved surface gravel surface in a study conducted on six garage driveways those authors observed that surface runoff from paved surfaces amounted to on average 40 of atmospheric precipitation in our study in the case of the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs surface runoff of rainwater amounted to on average 37 5 of atmospheric precipitation shafique et al 2018 in turn conducted a study on one of eight fragments of an internal road in a housing settlement each of the fragments being constructed of a different type of permeable surface the selected section of the road was constructed of concrete paving blocks leaving expansion gaps between the individual elements of the surface on the basis of analysis of rainfall events with various levels of intensity the authors determined that for this type of surface the value of reduction of the initial volume of rainwater varied in the range of 30 65 the droplet size structure presented in this study on the example of selected rainfall totals is similar to those obtained by other researchers of the subject in most of the analysed cases droplets with diameters up to 2 9 mm marked their contribution in the droplet size structure as reported by uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 in a vast majority droplets have diameters smaller than 3 0 mm biniak pieróg 2017 demonstrated that in the structure of rainfalls up to 8 0 mm droplets with diameters up to 2 0 mm dominate and only at greater precipitation totals the share of larger droplets attaining as much as 5 0 mm in diameter becomes numerically pronounced according to szewrański et al 2009 in the culmination phase of a rainfall the most numerous small droplets contribute as little as 3 of the rainfall volume while larger droplets whose share in the structure does not exceed 2 contribute the most to the rainfall volume it is obvious that droplet size distribution changes dynamically in time and space jameson and kostinski 2001 which raises the question how representative are the result of measurements obtained with the use of the disdrometer with measurement surface area of only 45 6 cm2 however as jaffrain and berne 2012 point out on the basis of measurements of precipitation structure by means of 16 disdrometers distributed over an area of 1 km 1 km the fields of droplet size distribution are not random bur characterised by a certain structure convection type precipitations being characterised by a greater variation than that of front type precipitations the sampling frequency of the instruments is also important increase on the frequency of measurements causes a decrease of spatial differentiation of dsd the results obtained are comparable with results presented in other reports on studies in this subject matter lee et al 2009 2007 miriovsky et al 2004 tapiador et al 2010 tokay and bashor 2010 and divergences are usually attributed to the use of different types of instruments their accuracy and spatial distribution distances between instruments the effect of precipitation on the amount of soil profile supply with water is observable mainly in the surface horizon support for the correctness of the choice of soil layer with thickness of 30 cm for the analyses can be found in the results of a study by zhang et al 2010 on the response of moisture of a bare soil to an influx of precipitation water indicating that it took place in a soil layer with that thickness an earlier study by biniak pieróg et al 2012 for the same soil revealed that diurnal precipitation totals up to the level of 10 0 mm did not cause any observable increase in water retention in soil layers with thickness up to 40 cm the analyses performed in the scope of the presented study provided further support these arguments indicate that the choice of soil layer for the analysis appears also to be justified from the viewpoint of soil conditions prevailing in the research object where soil moisture measurements were conducted in the surface layers of the soil fine grained loamy sands dominate to be replaced deeper with weakly loamy and loose sands with thinner interlayers of loamy sands and sandy loams less frequently gravelly sands the sandy layer has a total thickness from 80 to 90 cm at the depth of 100 120 cm for several months in a year the soils are completely saturated with water and as a result of capillary rise the saturation can extend up to the layer of 50 70 cm though such a situation does not last long therefore to eliminate this problem in the interpretation of results the authors limited themselves to the soil layer with thickness of 30 cm at the same time monitoring the level of the ground water table for the days selected for the analysis it varied from 107 to 158 cm below ground surface the presented results of analysis of the value of surface runoff from selected hardened surfaces in relation to the droplet size structure in the precipitation are hard to confront with other authors addressing similar subject matter due to the lack of studies and analyses in this area it is also difficult to compare the results concerning the relationship between the droplet structure of a rainfall and the dynamics of rainwater movement in the soil profile with results obtained by other authors the available studies in this area were most often conducted in laboratory conditions with the use of rainfall simulators which may differ significantly from the natural conditions in which this study was conducted as indicated by the results of a study by assouline et al 1997 a simulated rainfall represents relatively well the kinetic energy of a natural rainfall but it is a problem to achieve droplet size distributions comparable to those obtained in natural conditions due to the random character of atmospheric precipitations their totals and intensities occurring in natural conditions recreation of that process in laboratories is a difficult task according to biniak pieróg 2017 the effectiveness of a rainfall in the supply of the soil profile with water will differ depending on the dominant size of droplets in a precipitation in relation to the temperature of the active surface and the degree of its crusting for instance small droplets will evaporate in contact with heated soil surface while in the case of intensive rainfalls especially in typically summer months in contact with crusted soil the droplets will be broken into smaller ones and in effect flow away over its surface 4 summary the analyses conducted on the range of data presented in the study constitute a new approach to the interpretation of relations between atmospheric precipitations surface runoff and the values of reduction of soil infiltration taking into account the structure of droplet sizes and their contribution in the rainfall volume reaching the surface the analyses presented in the paper have a preliminary character due to the fact that they are based on a small number of selected rainfall events but that set was selected from a considerable number of measurements as pointed out at the beginning of the paper the subject matter presented here coincides with the world wide trend of sustainable management of rain waters studies conducted so far are focused mainly on identifying the level of the rainfall runoff relation taking into account two easily available nowadays rainfall characteristics i e the total and the intensity the increasing accessibility to modern apparatus in the form of disdrometers stimulates the interest in studies on the kind size and structure of droplets in atmospheric precipitations however the scope of analyses presented in this study is not a generally accepted standard and hence it is even difficult to conduct a discussion of results in this area the inclusion of one more element in the research i e the droplet structure of rainfalls and the attempt at relating that characteristic with the volume of rainwater runoff taking into account various types of surfaces used in urbanised areas may allow a comprehensive evaluation of this relationship the contemporary trend of development of urbanised areas causes the sealing of the ground surface which interferes with the natural water cycle in which soil retention plays a significant role the kind of hardened surface used is not without importance the proposed relation of the level of increase of soil water resources with the volume of runoff from hardened surfaces covered with small grain roofing paper and tarmac and permeable openwork concrete slabs allows to estimate the degree of reduction of soil profile supply with rain water in this aspect a solution that allows to largely counteract the effects of ground surface sealing can be an approach to rainwater management that assumes the interception of the greatest possible amounts of water running off to no effect from the surface and then using that water the acquired knowledge in this area will allow to add one more index to the models used for the estimation of the rainfall runoff relationship and to models of water balance in addition referring to a larger scale the results obtained in this study can be used as useful data in systems of spatial information of towns and cities in the range of precipitation waters management possibilities these data can also have a bearing on planning decisions in the aspect of sustainable management of precipitation waters in urbanised areas and constitute significant support for the design process the results obtained and the subject matter of the study are in line with contemporary strategies of integrated planning of urban areas in which the aspect of sustainable management of precipitation waters is related with the planning of green infrastructure a model example of a space in which the issues of integrated planning can be easily implemented is the space of a housing estate due to its potential related with the presence of permeable surfaces this creates the possibility of introducing elements of green blue infrastructure at the same time referring to the spatial development policy of towns and cities the results obtained from research can constitute a key factor affecting legislative changes in

5698,the objective of this study was the estimation of the effect of droplet structure of diurnal precipitation totals measured with thies clima disdrometer on the value of surface runoff from three kinds of surface used in urban areas i e a roof surface covered with small grain roofing paper a car park surface of openwork concrete slabs and a tarmac surface and the resultant reduction of infiltration from atmospheric precipitation the detailed comparative analysis of diurnal precipitation totals in the aspect of droplet structure structure of increasing influx of precipitation water to the surface and changes of air temperature humidity conditions allowed preliminary elucidation of the effect of those factors on the values of the runoff indices for the different hardened surfaces the analysis of reduction of infiltration presents the level of supply losses resulting from the use of surface covering systems with various degrees of permeability to precipitation water a solution that can minimise the indicated losses can be an approach to precipitation water management assuming interception of possibly the largest amounts of non productive surface runoff waters and then using

the structure of surface cover the share of surfaces impermeable to water increases water falling onto an impermeable substrate has no possibility of infiltration at the point of precipitation occurrence or that possibility is significantly limited the consequence is an increase in the volume of surface runoff of precipitation waters in given areas arnold and gibbons 1996 geiger and dreiseitl 1999 szewrański et al 2018 reduced water infiltration down the soil profile is reflected in a lowering of the ground water table piskorek et al 2011 and a decrease of moisture in upper layers of soil the amount of water available for plants decreases with consequent deterioration of the condition of vegetation in towns and cities sand et al 2018 the current approach to rainwater management as a solution of the problem of management of the formed volumes of surface runoff assumes the fastest possible discharge of rainwater to sewerage systems and then to a receiver in the form of a water course that solution even though it ensures rapid disposal of considerable amounts of precipitation water and has been in common use for many years has a number of shortcomings the supreme one is the lack of adaptation of the capacity of sewerage systems to increased volumes of precipitation waters resulting from extreme rainstorms with high intensity or long lasting rains with a high precipitation total the effect of overloading of sewerage systems is water jets from manholes and flooding of streets pavements squares another negative aspect with comparable importance is the loss of great amounts of water which is discharged from the area of catchment basins into sewerage systems research projects concerning the relation atmospheric precipitation surface runoff differ among other thing in the following a the size of the area on which the research is conducted b the factors affecting the volume of surface runoff and the values of the surface runoff index the first group refers to macro studies on the scale of a housing estate or a fragment of a town or city and the object studied is the volumes of surface runoff formed within a smaller area barron et al 2011 burns et

2014 the other group comprises studies conducted on the micro scale i e within specific types of surface those are most frequently existing or created for the needs of the study car park sites garage driveways or internal roads inside housing estates brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 they can also be solely specially designed research sites created within the area of research institutions romaniak 2017 atmospheric precipitation is characterised by its duration amount and intensity those factors are parameters that significantly affect the value of surface runoff of rain waters existing measurement methods in the form of the classic hellmann rain gauge or the float pluviograph and modern automatic weighing precipitation gauges and tipping bucket rain gauges allow the measurement of those characteristics with varying levels of precision różdżyński 2014 tapiador et al 2012 however the interpretation requirements concerning atmospheric precipitation as well as the technological progress enforced the search for new innovative indirect methods of their measurement such instruments include disdrometers in the case of which the object of measurement is not the volume of precipitation as is the case with the classic methods but its structure i e the size of droplets and their velocity these instruments can also identify various kinds of hydrometeors i e drizzle rain hail snow or mixed precipitation there are two main kinds of disdrometers impact type and optical until the present day the impact type joss waldvogel disdrometer is often used in research harikumar et al 2010 joss and waldvogel 1967 kumar et al 2003 tokay et al 1996 over the period of the eighties and nineties of the 20th century there took place an evolution of optical disdrometers fernandez raga et al 2011 characterised by a greater precision than the impact type instruments these include the ott parsivell disdrometer used in studies by e g tapiador et al 2010 jaffrain and berne 2012 burszta adamiak 2012 and the thies clima disdrometer used by szewrański et al 2009 de moraes frasson et al 2011 biniak pieróg et al 2015 biniak pieróg 2017 the most modern device is the two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd used in the studies by diederich et al 2004 beard et al 2010 or raupach and berne 2015 the rainfall information acquisition possibilities offered by disdrometers and primarily on the structure of droplet sizes allow the innovative aspect of including that element in analyses of the volume of runoff from various surfaces used in urbanised areas the literature review by fernandez raga et al 2011 concerning studies conducted with the use of disdrometers indicates a very dynamic increase in the number of publications on this subject matter since the nineteen seventies as reported by those authors studies with the use of disdrometers are the most frequently conducted in the usa followed by the mediterranean countries such as france italy spain greece or israel and the least frequently in central european countries germany holland switzerland austria and poland however as opposed to classic rain gauges or various types of automatic pluviometers disdrometers are still fairly expensive equipment in recent years nevertheless an increase is observed in the use of such instruments in research guyot et al 2019 liu et al 2019 ramon et al 2017 serio et al 2019 yang et al 2019 so far the most frequently analysed factor with an impact on the relation atmospheric precipitation surface runoff is rainfall intensity barron et al 2011 burns et al 2005 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 valtanen et al 2014 in many research reports the authors analyse the rainfall runoff relation with respect to rainfall totals and its effect on the values of the surface runoff indices brattebo and booth 2003 bzymek and jarosińska 2012 ferguson and suckling 1989 gomez ullate et al 2011 melanen and laukkanen 1980 romaniak 2017 in a small number of papers the rainfall surface runoff relation is analysed in greater detail for example estimating the rainfall structure during the course of a rainfall event through the assessment of the maximum rainfall amount within a chosen time interval gnecco et al 2018 also analysed is the effect of droplet size distribution on soil erosion and the formation of surface runoff of rainfall water meshesha et al 2019 however in a majority of research reports droplet size is a factor whose effect is analysed in relation to soil erosion and not as a factor that can have an impact on the volume of runoff water from hardened surfaces the consequence of occurrence of various types of surface cover with varying degrees of permeability are limitations in infiltration from atmospheric precipitations a solution that can minimise the indicated losses can be an approach to enhance precipitation water management maximising the volume of water intercepted by the surface and then using that water that approach relates to the concept of sustainable water management according to which water should be treated as a resource and not as a useless element of urban space precipitation water in the form of runoff from impermeable surfaces can be directed to such landscape elements as rain gardens or infiltration basins in which it is temporarily stored on the surface and then used for economic purposes excess amounts of stored water can also be infiltrated gradually into the substrate in addition the accumulated volumes can be used as water resource for irrigation of green areas in this way the losses of soil profile supply demonstrated in the study can be compensated for through its supply with accumulated water from surface runoff the approach to precipitation water management outlined here consists in water retention in the place where the precipitation has occurred i e within the catchment basin this is one of the key assumptions of present directions in precipitation water management directive no 6541 17 of the president of the city of wrocław of 17 march 2017 on precipitation water management in wrocław 2017 framework water directive 2000 60 we of 23rd october 2000 2000 regulation of the minister of the environment of 18th november 2014 2014 study on the conditions and directions of spatial development of the city of wrocław 2018 the new approach to precipitation water management finds an application in created strategies of spatial management and in development plans of urbanised areas fryd et al 2013 romaniak et al 2014 stahre 2008 the conditions presented above allow to formulate the objective of the study as estimation of the effect of droplet size structure of diurnal rainfall totals on the volume of runoff from three types of surface used in urban areas and the resultant reduction of infiltration from atmospheric precipitations the estimation of the reduction of soil profile supply presents the levels of potential supply losses resulting from the use of surface cover with varying degree of permeability to rainfall water 2 materials and methods the study concerning the relations between diurnal precipitation totals and diurnal volumes of surface runoff was conducted on three experimental surfaces constructed in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology wrocław wrocław swojec the experimental surfaces were a roof surface p1 covered with small grain roofing paper a car park surface apb of openwork concrete slabs and a tarmac surface as fig 1 the roof surface p1 was covered with small grain heat sealing roofing paper extradach top 5 2 szybki profil sbs made by icopal for surface p1 a 2 roof slope was applied commonly used in houses in poland the car park surface apb was built of openwork slabs with single slab dimensions of 60x40x10 cm the material filling the open spaces of the slabs was a sand gravel mixture with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 16 mm that surface had a slope of 2 typical for road surfaces and car park areas the tarmac surface as was constructed of a cold setting mineral asphalt mixture tar can 2001 the slope of that surface was 2 conforming to the slope value used for road surfaces in poland the experimental surfaces were constructed in the same way as those used in urban space both in regard to the materials used and the slope angles on each of the experimental surfaces a water tight framing was constructed so that the enclosed surface area was 1 m2 that area is the specific surface area from which precipitation water is collected in the form of surface runoff at the lower part of each of the experimental surfaces formed due to the slope applied a gap was left in the framing allowing the water to be discharged into troughs each trough was connected by a system of profiles to an opening in the top cover of a container for the accumulation of rain waters the study period covered the months april october in the years 2014 2015 and 2017 measurements of the volume of rainwater surface runoff from the experimental surfaces were taken daily at 7 a m the volume of the runoff was measured using a 1 l laboratory flask the measured volume of rainwater was the total diurnal volume of surface runoff of precipitation water from the preceding day the limitation of the surface area from which water was collected to 1 m2 allowed the representation of the amount of runoff from the experimental surfaces in mm which allowed those values to be compared with atmospheric precipitation amounts measured in the same units the study was based on the results of diurnal measurements of atmospheric precipitation with the use of two methods the classic hellman rain gauge and the contactless laser rain gauge the thies clima disdrometer both instruments were installed so that the measurement of precipitation was taken at the height of exactly 1 m guide to meteorological instruments and methods and observations 2010 instructions for meteorological stations 2014 in poland only a few research centres conduct measurements of that meteorological element with the use of such modern instruments as disdrometers one of those is the wrocław university of environmental and life sciences the principle of operation of the optical disdrometer used in the study consists in the measurement of reduction in laser beam intensity by hydrometeor particles passing through a plane of infrared light with surface area of 45 6 cm2 fig 2 a photo diode with an optical system installed on the receiver side continuously measures the intensity of laser light beam converting it into an electric impulse the moment a particle passes through the light plane the received signal weakens based on which the particle diameter is calculated while its fall velocity is calculated on the basis of the duration of the reduction the instrument allows to acquire information on e g the intensity amount and type of precipitations and which is an important novelty on the structure of its droplets in the 22 classes of droplet size provided by the manufacturer the information acquired is saved at a 1 miute time step and transferred via a serial interface to the data base the enormous amount of data 541 data generated in the 1 minute reports by the manufacturer s software was systematised by means of the original software dispre biniak pieróg et al 2015 szulczewski et al 2013 which allowed to conduct analyses as per the requirements of this study the 1 minute data were the basis for the distribution of diurnal precipitation totals and their droplet size structure in the 22 classes of droplet sizes proposed by the manufacturer in the next phase the contribution of the individual classes of droplet size in each selected diurnal rainfall total was calculated it was assumed that a droplet is spherical in shape for each of the droplet diameter classes a mean diameter value was adopted within a given range and on its basis the volume of individual droplets v within the classes was calculated in accordance with the sphere volume formula next the volumes determined in that manner were divided by the surface area of the light plane amounting to 4560 mm2 within which the measurement of rainfall amount took place based on the information on the volume of an individual droplet in the 22 droplet size classes proposed by the manufacturer converted into precipitation totals in mm and on the number of droplets identified in each of the classes their contribution in the overall rainfall totals was calculated for the purposes of the present study the 22 classes were reduced through aggregation to 9 classes of droplet diameters biniak pieróg 2017 presented in table 1 the developed droplet size structure allowed to estimate the percentage share of each of the adopted classes in the total number of droplets in selected diurnal precipitation totals analogous analyses conducted by biniak pieróg 2017 for 300 rainfall episodes identified during the 5 year period of 2009 2013 demonstrated that totals calculated by means of the manufacturer s algorithm and those calculated on the basis of droplet sizes did not differ statistically significantly and the calculated coefficients of correlation rk assumed values above 0 9900 initially 58 cases from the years 2014 2015 and 2017 from the period from april till october were selected for the analyses that number did not cover all days with precipitation that occurred in the period adopted for analysis already at the start of distribution of the data measured with the disdrometer the fundamental cause of elimination of days with precipitation was the high failure rate of the instrument resulting from interruptions in power supply determining the functioning of the instrument another eliminating factor was contamination of the measuring diodes of the instrument e g with spider webs or mowed grass resides observable as fake precipitation in a situation of no precipitation indication on the classic hellmann rain gauge the precipitation amounts measured by means of the standard rain gauge in the months from april till october in the years 2014 2015 and 2017 were grouped in a four step classification 0 5 5 0 mm 5 1 10 0 mm 10 1 20 0 mm 20 0 mm the measurement of the diurnal precipitation totals with the classic rain gauge was used as a control for the interpretation of results obtained by means of the disdrometer the maximum allowable absolute difference of diurnal precipitation totals was adopted at the level of 10 irrespective of the kind of measuring instrument the factors affecting the differentiation of results include e g wind velocity droplet size distribution and the design of the rain gauge taking this into account in the case of the use of the disdrometer is the absence of any possibility of precipitation being blown out of the inlet section of e g the hellmann rain gauge as the measurement proceeds in the continuous mode with no shields in the disdrometer there is no surface that would significantly deform the air flow hence those instruments allow the development of the most credible corrections for the wind factor and this allows to relate wind velocity with information on droplet size nešpor et al 2000 sieck et al 2007 as testik and pei 2017 point out an increase of wind velocity has a significant impact in terms of increase of the number of small droplets and a decrease of the number of larger droplets in the next stage only the precipitation totals obtained by means of the disdrometer were used at that stage the next elimination was performed for further analysis only those cases were chosen for which the absolute difference between the diurnal precipitation totals calculated on the basis of droplet size and with the use of the disdrometer manufacturer s algorithm did not exceed 10 as in the case of the first stage of the analysis the analyses demonstrated that the adopted threshold is a safe one as its value is slightly above the median of residual values for the individual differences calculated at each of the stages of data elimination with the assumption of spherical droplet shape adopted in the study at the stage of calculation of water volume contributed by the adopted droplet size classes to the precipitation total the obtained differences of precipitation totals could have resulted from variation of wind velocity causing various degrees of their deformation beard et al 2010 also such events were eliminated from the data base for which the runoff volumes obtained raised reservations even though it would relate to only one of the surfaces under analysis that procedure left for the final analysis 23 cases from among which the most interesting ones in each of the above classes of diurnal precipitation totals are discussed in detail on the basis of the diurnal precipitation totals acquired from disdrometer measurements pd and the corresponding measured values of surface runoff odos the values of the so called surface runoff indices ψd were calculated using the formula 1 ψ d o dos p d where ψd surface runoff index of precipitation waters from the experimental surfaces diurnal value odos diurnal volume of surface runoff from an experimental surface mm pd diurnal total of atmospheric precipitation mm the first step of the analyses was the estimation of the effect of the diurnal precipitation total and of its droplet structure on the value of the index of surface runoff from the roof surface i e from the roofing paper from the car park surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs and from the tarmac surface the analyses also took into account the air temperature humidity conditions for each of the cases the next step of the analyses was the estimation of the limiting role of the three experimental surfaces on the value of infiltration under two standard surfaces bare and grass covered taking into account the variation of precipitation amounts and droplet structure in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology where in parallel to the experiment described here measurements of soil moisture were conducted under both standard surfaces the surface soil layers are composed of small grained loamy sands and weakly loamy and loose sands in deeper layers with interlayers of mainly loamy sands and sandy loams typologically they are proper fluvisols in the international classification fao wrb iuss 2006 they are cultured soils with preserved features of alluvial sediments and most often belong to the group of phaeozems fluvic gleyic phaeozems anthric arenic bulk density of the soil is 1 4 g cm3 in the surface horizon and increases with depth below the humus horizon to 1 58 g cm3 while in the layer of underlying loam it attains the value of 1 55 g cm3 total porosity varies in the range of 40 45 and attains its maximum values in the humus horizon water permeability in the sandy surface layers attains values from 2 9 10 3 to 4 6 10 3 cm s the lowest value of the coefficient of infiltration is found in the sandy loam at the depth of 120 150 cm and amounts to 1 9 10 4 cm s żyromski et al 2016 a soil profile with depth of up to 30 cm was adopted for the analyses in the conditions of the presented experiment that soil layer was not supplied with water from capillary rise this allowed to assume that the observed increase of water resources in that soil layer resulted from its effective supply with precipitation water alone the basis for the analyses were diurnal measurements of soil moisture by means of the tdr technique time domain reflectometry during the morning observations conducted in the area of the faculty observatory of agro and hydrometeorology since 2002 this is one of the most modern measurement techniques consisting in the forcing of an electromagnetic wave impulse which entering the analysed medium soil is reflected and in the measurement of the moment of return of the attenuated reflected impulse the value of the attenuation of the reflected return wave depends primarily on the content of water in the soil and also on the concentration of electrolytes and of clay particles topp et al 1980 the system used in this study was composed of the modern tdr mux mp gauges with midl gprs data acquisition loggers for field installation the sole producer of which in poland is the institute of agrophysics pas lublin the instruments allow continuous measurement of soil moisture temperature and salinity at the same point the instruments work with a set of tdr probes installed at depths of 10 20 30 cm under bare and grass covered soil surface the diurnal information on soil moisture was the basis for the calculation of water resources in the three soil layers adopted for the analyses with depths of 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 cm according to the formula r h 0 w 0 10 where r water resources in soil layer mm h0 soil layer thickness cm w0 soil moisture tdr cm 3 cm 3 on the basis of diurnal changes of water resources in the adopted soil layers for selected days with rainfall the possible limitation of soil infiltration was estimated for the analysed hardened surfaces the analyses took into account the rainfall volume and its droplet size structure 3 results and discussion for the purposes of this study detailed analysis was performed for 5 pairs of cases selected as an example with similar precipitation totals within the various ranges of diurnal rainfall amounts table 2 presents their corresponding values of precipitation measured with both methods the values of differences and the calculated indices of surface runoff ψd for each of the experimental surfaces table 3 presents the precipitation droplet structure for the 9 classes of droplet diameters adopted for the needs of this study showing the percentage share of the number of droplets in each of the classes in the total number of droplets identified in the diurnal precipitation total and the amount of water in mm that the individual droplet classes contributed to the diurnal precipitation total as can be seen from table 2 in most of the analysed cases the highest values of the runoff indices were obtained for the roof surface constructed of small grain roofing paper in the range from 0 52 to 1 00 followed by the tarmac surface from 0 47 to 0 93 it was observed that with increase in the diurnal precipitation totals table 2 cases 7 10 the differences in the values of the runoff indices between the two surfaces disappeared a distinct character was noted for the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs characterised by permeability to precipitation water that permeability resulted from the high porosity of the material filling the internal spaces of the concrete elements used compared to the two analysed impermeable surfaces the calculated runoff indices assumed distinctly lower values characterised by a broader range of variation from 0 02 to 0 85 for the extent of runoff reduction and its variation the degree of saturation with water of the material constituting the filler of the slabs was surely also not insignificant the analysis of droplet structure of the precipitation totals indicated the highest share of the smallest droplets with diameters up to 0 5 mm irrespective of the precipitation total the second ranking was the share of droplets with diameters of 0 5 1 0 mm however the high percentage share of the smallest droplets was not reflected in the volume of water that this droplet class contributed to the overall precipitation total it was found that most frequently the largest amounts of water in mm were contributed to the total by droplets from the class of 0 5 1 5 mm and only in three cases the largest contribution was that of droplets twice as large with diameters of 2 0 3 0 mm fig 3 presents the relations between the amount of water in mm contributed to the total by the dominant droplet class pl k d and the value of runoff in mm for each of the analysed surfaces odos the values of the calculated coefficients of determination r2 assigned to the increasing linear trends varied from 0 5736 for surface apb to 0 8651 for p1 and were statistically significant significance level for n 2 is 0 3994 the lowest value of r2 obtained for the surface covered with openwork concrete slabs is in support of earlier observations concerning the sensitivity of filling of the slabs of that surface to changes in water saturation figs 4 8 present the structures of precipitations with the corresponding diurnal weather conditions including increasing 10 minute precipitation totals and the values of air temperature and humidity for each of the analysed cases the detailed comparative analysis of pairs of diurnal precipitation totals in the aspect of the droplet structure structure of increasing influx of precipitation water to the surface and changes of air temperature humidity conditions in a given 24 hour period allowed preliminary elucidation of the effect of those factors on the values of the runoff indices for the different hardened surfaces precipitations 5 0 mm the two cases from may and june selected for the analysis fig 4 with diurnal precipitation at the level of 4 3 mm differed in respect of the class of droplets that contributed the most water to the diurnal total in the case of the precipitation of 24th may 2014 the greatest contribution was that of droplets with diameters from 1 0 mm to 3 0 mm 3 4 mm of precipitation while on the 3rd of june 2014 the greatest share in mm in the diurnal precipitation total was that of droplets with diameters of 0 5 1 0 mm at the level of 1 7 mm basically that differentiation did not have any significance for the values of the runoff index for the impermeable surfaces i e roofing paper and tarmac as indicated by the comparable values of the runoff index fig 4 table 2 similarly to the varied temperature humidity conditions and the structure of the increasing influx of precipitation in time however there are distinct differences in the values of ψd for the semi permeable surface apb 0 02 and 0 65 the higher value of runoff index for the 3rd of june 2014 resulted from the occurrence of precipitation on the preceding day in the amount of 6 2 mm which caused partial saturation of the material filling the spaces in the concrete elements and that was reflected in a reduction of the water absorption capacity of that surface no such situation was noted in the case from may precipitations in the range of 5 1 10 0 mm the compared pair of cases of the 21st of september 2014 and the 12th of july 2015 with greater diurnal precipitation totals at the level of 8 8 and 8 6 mm respectively is characterised by greater differentiation fig 5 in the first case the major part of the diurnal total 8 0 mm was contributed by droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm while in the second case smaller droplets dominated with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 1 5 mm which resulted in their share in the precipitation total at the level of 4 8 mm distinctly higher values of the runoff index were obtained for the 21st of september 2014 they varied from 0 56 for surface apb to 0 92 for p1 in this case the observed share of larger droplets could have been the cause of increased values of surface runoff irrespective of the kind of surface larger droplets formed greater runoff volumes and the occurrence of the precipitation during night hours reduced the possibility of water evaporation as did also the intensive accumulation of precipitation in time there was also precipitation on the preceding day with a diurnal amount of 15 7 mm which had a primary importance for the reduction of permeability of surface apb the distinctly smaller runoff in the case of the 12th of july 2015 was surely caused by the thermal conditions with temperature values approaching as much as 28 c fig 5 that caused strong heating of the analysed surfaces during the day the effect of that was faster evaporation of smaller droplets arriving at the heated surfaces which in combination with the uniform distribution of the precipitation in time contributed to an increased reduction of the amount of water constituting surface runoff precipitations in the range of 10 1 20 0 mm the two cases from that range selected for analysis were those from the 14th of july 2015 and the 24th of july 2014 with comparable diurnal precipitation totals of 11 9 and 11 5 mm respectively fig 6 like the pair described above they were characterised by distinct differences with regard to the droplet classes that contributed the biggest amounts of water to the precipitation volume in the first case the principal contribution at the level of 9 0 mm was that of droplets with diameters in the range from 1 0 to 3 0 mm comparable values of the runoff index were obtained for the two impermeable surfaces at the level of 0 80 while in the case of surface apb the value of ψd was distinctly lower at 0 27 although the occurrence of precipitation was noted on the preceding day the indices for surfaces p1 and apb were lower than those obtained for the second case that situation could have been caused by the air temperature humidity conditions at the time of precipitation occurrence air temperature was around 22 0 c relative humidity approximately 70 causing heating up of the surfaces and accumulation of precipitation from its first phase on the one hand the higher air temperature caused heating of the surfaces and evaporation of larger droplets and at the same time the accumulation of precipitation in short time intervals and the related increase of its intensity could have caused the breaking of larger droplets into smaller ones that could undergo evaporation which in effect resulted in a reduction of runoff volume in the case from the 24th of july 2014 a comparable amount of water at the level of 8 7 mm originated from smaller droplets in the range of 0 5 1 5 mm in that case a greater differentiation was observed in the values of the surface runoff index 1 0 for p1 0 33 for abp and 0 51 for as on that day the air temperature humidity conditions were uniform with a lower temperature than in the first case from the pair in question in the range of 16 0 17 0 c and a distinctly higher humidity at the level of 90 the lower possibility of evaporation of droplets even in spite of their smaller diameters and the small grained structure of surface p1 resulting in a low degree of rainwater retention could have had an effect on the value of the index the value of the runoff index obtained for the tarmac surface was notably lower in this case and amounted to 0 51 it can be assumed that in that specific case it was dependent on the droplet structure of the precipitation the porosity of that surface could facilitate under the existing atmospheric conditions the accumulation and retention of smaller droplets precipitations 20 0 mm the days selected for the analysis in this range of precipitations were the 9th of july 2014 and the 1st of september 2017 with similar diurnal precipitation totals at the level of 24 7 and 21 0 mm respectively fig 7 as the pair compared above also in this case they were different in terms of the droplet sizes that contributed the most water to the precipitation volume the highest contribution in mm in the precipitation total of 9th july 2014 was that of droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm accounting for nearly the whole of the precipitation total 21 9 mm comparable values of ψd were obtained for surfaces p1 and as at the level of 0 90 while the value for surface apb was 0 44 the major part of the precipitation reached the surfaces in 4 phases 3 accumulated in time and 1 uniformly distributed in the night hours in the second case there was a notable contribution of two classes including smaller droplets with diameters from 0 5 to 1 5 mm that contributed a little over one half of the precipitation total 13 3 mm the obtained values of ψd were distinctly lower as compared to the first case for each of the analysed surfaces and amounted to 0 61 and 0 67 for surfaces p1 and as respectively and 0 25 for surface apb on that day the air temperature humidity conditions were very stable air temperature oscillated around 14 0 c while relative humidity was about 90 and a highly uniform influx of precipitation in time was observed the lower intensity of the precipitation and the smaller droplet diameters could have contributed to easier accumulation of rainwater on the analysed surfaces which resulted in increased values of surface runoff as expressed in the values of index ψd extreme events an interesting example presented in the study is two different events with exceptionally high diurnal precipitation totals relating to the days 22nd october 2014 and 24th july 2017 amounting to 31 2 and 49 6 mm respectively fig 8 in the first case nearly the entire precipitation total originated from droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm the precipitation lasted for nearly 19 h and the influx of water was almost linear at very stable weather conditions with air temperature oscillating around 8 0 c and air humidity in the range from 86 to above 90 the obtained values of the runoff index were highly uniform from 0 85 for the openwork concrete surface apb to 0 93 for the tarmac surface as one could therefore infer that with the long lasting and uniformly distributed precipitation the gravel material filling the spaces of surface apb gradually attained saturation which resulted in a change of the character of that surface from permeable to impermeable at a level similar to the hardened surfaces in this case an additional factor could be the precipitation of the preceding day causing an increase of moisture of the filler material of that surface the case from the 24th of july 2017 differs from the above in terms of the precipitation influx and the air temperature humidity conditions at the start of the precipitation and during its initial phase air temperature was at the level of about 20 0 c and decreased to about 16 0 c in the course of the precipitation in its main phase the relative humidity displayed an increasing trend from about 70 to over 90 the structure of droplet classes in mm in the precipitation total was very similar to that identified for the first case as more than 40 0 mm of the precipitation volume originated from droplets with diameters from 0 5 to 3 0 mm however the obtained values of the runoff index were notably lower and amounted to from 0 25 for surface apb to 0 52 and 0 57 for surfaces p1 and as respectively in the case of that pair of events the main cause of the large differences in the values of the surface runoff index should not be sought in the droplet structure itself the overriding cause could have been the high intensity of the precipitation larger droplets falling at high velocity on a hot surface could be broken into smaller ones and evaporate which was reflected in the reduced amount of surface runoff the second stage of the study consisted in the estimation of the contribution of the analysed diurnal precipitation sums with individual droplet size structures to the infiltration δr of the surface soil layers with thickness of 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 cm under the two standard surfaces bare and grass covered table 4 presents the values of diurnal precipitation totals values of water reserves in the analysed soil layers on the day of precipitation occurrence and diurnal change of soil water resources resulting from direct influx of precipitation water as follows from table 4 irrespective of droplet size structure precipitations with low totals up to 4 0 mm did not cause any significant increase of soil water resources in any of the analysed soil layers under both surfaces in the case of the second analysed pair of events with higher precipitation totals in the range of 5 1 10 0 mm such a differentiation is observable the precipitation of september 2014 with a total of 8 8 mm in which the major part originated from droplets with diameters in the range from 0 5 to 3 0 mm caused an increase of soil water resources observable for both surfaces with notably higher values of δr being obtained for the grass covered surface in the range from 5 9 mm in the layer with 10 cm thickness to 6 8 for the 30 cm thick soil layer whereas the precipitation of july 2015 with a dominant contribution of smaller droplets in the range from 0 5 to 1 5 mm caused a slight increase of water resources in the analysed soil layers under the bare surface in the case of the lawn practically no changes in soil moisture were observed which can be attributed to the fact that smaller droplets could evaporate on being deposited on the hot surface of plants analysis of another pair of days with precipitation in the range of 10 1 20 0 mm allowed somewhat different observations the precipitation of the 24th of july 2014 characterised by a distinct share of smaller droplets in the range of 0 5 1 5 mm in its total amount of 11 5 mm caused a comparable increase of water resources in the analysed soil layers irrespective of the kind of surface compared to the event discussed above the character of precipitation influx in time was similar but the observed values of air temperature were notably lower the different droplet structure of the precipitation of the 14th of july 2015 where the main contribution to the total was that of droplets with diameters from 1 0 to 3 0 mm caused a notable increase of water resources in each of the analysed soil layers under the grass covered surface and δr assumed values in the range from 4 5 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 11 7 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm that precipitation was not effective in the case of the bare surface especially down to the depth of 20 cm on the one hand the precipitation influx in time characterised by two phases with higher intensity could cause increased surface runoff from the bare soil surface and on the other larger droplets breaking into smaller ones could cause their lower effectiveness in the case of the lawn the kind of surface cover could minimise both of those phenomena analysis of the pair of events with high precipitation totals of above 20 0 mm taking into account their droplet structure and precipitation influx in time showed that those elements could have been important in the supply of soil layers with water under the bare surface irrespective of the thickness of the soil layers a distinct increase of soil water resources was observed in the situation of the precipitation of july 2014 characterised by a notable contribution of droplets from the range of 0 5 3 0 mm in the precipitation total in mm the value of δr varied from 2 8 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 7 8 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm in the case of the grass covered surface precipitation effectiveness was comparable both in the case of the event of the 1st of september 2017 and of the 9th of july 2014 irrespective of the analysed soil layer compared to the bare surface distinctly higher values of δr were noted in the range from 6 1 mm and 8 8 mm for the layer of 0 10 mm to 10 3 and 11 5 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm respectively for the days of 01 09 2017 and 09 07 2014 in the case of the last pair of events with exceptionally high precipitation totals but similar contributions of similar ranges of droplet diameters from 0 5 to 3 0 mm in mm in the precipitation totals it was observed that a notably higher effectiveness was characteristic of the precipitation of the 24th of july 2014 especially in the case of the grass covered surface the values of δr varied from 11 6 mm for the layer of 0 10 cm to 23 6 mm for the layer of 0 30 cm in this case the cause should be sought in the different values of soil water resources on the day of the precipitation occurrence that were decidedly lower in that case as compared to the state of the 22nd of october 2014 table 4 at that stage of the study also a multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify those variables that were significant for the value of water retention increase in the analysed soil layers under both types of surfaces the dependent variable was the change of soil water resources day to day as a result of precipitation influx δr while the independent variables were the level of water resources in a given soil layer on the day of precipitation occurrence rp and the contribution in mm of the dominant class of droplets pl k d in the final precipitation total the analyses conducted with the use of the software package statistica ver 12 5 statsoft 2012 showed in each case that pl k d was the variable that significantly affected the value of δr the obtained values of corrected coefficients of determination for the derived regression equations table 5 were statistically significant every time for a number of events n 2 at α 0 05 r2 statistically significant minimum is 0 3994 correlation of the value of increase of soil water resources with the value of runoff from the hardened surfaces i e covered with roofing paper and tarmac and the permeable surface of openwork concrete slabs allows the estimation of reduction of soil profile supply with precipitation water as an example fig 9 presents the relation of the value of reduction δr odos δr for soil layer with thickness of 30 cm under the bare and grass covered surfaces and the contribution in mm of the dominant droplet size class in the overall precipitation total pl k d for the bare surface those relations irrespective of the analysed variant were described the best by polynomial functions of the second and third degree while for the grass covered surface a linear function for p1 and apb as for as a polynomial function of the second degree for the obtained regression models the akaike criterion aic calculated additionally attained the minimum values fig 9 in the case of each of the surfaces higher values of the coefficient of determination r2 were obtained for the bare surface however irrespective of the kind of cover they were the highest for the variant with apb and the lowest for that with p1 0 7189 and 0 6686 for the bare surface and 0 6473 and 0 5289 for the grass covered surface respectively the set of events subjected to the analysis should be considered as a small one but the models obtained are optimally fitted to the analysed sample accumulation of water running off from 1 m2 of the analysed surfaces p1 apb and as and then using the water to supply 1 m2 of bare soil surface and grass covered soil would cause a proportional reduction of increase in their water resources relative to that observed in the conditions of actual influx of precipitation water to soil surface the cases of days with rainfall selected for the analysis and the values of surface runoff from 3 hardened surfaces used in urbanised areas obtained for them display a high similarity to the results obtained by other authors dealing with a similar subject matter brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 gilbert and clausen 2006 shafique et al 2018 in this study on the basis of selected examples the values of reduction varied within the range from 0 to 48 for the roof surface from 15 to 98 for the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs and from 7 to 53 for the tarmac surface collins et al 2008 in their study at car park sites obtained the average value of reduction of the initial volume of rainfall water of 34 65 for a tarmac surface for three surfaces constructed of concrete blocks laid out with expansion gaps they obtained the following values 99 86 99 33 98 17 and 99 51 in our study the average value of reduction of the initial volume of rainfall water was 27 5 in the case of the tarmac surface and in the case of the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs apb 62 4 however those authors used in their study a greater number of events in the form of diurnal precipitations from 40 to 44 compared to our study 10 events gilbert and clausen 2006 obtained the following sequence of the volume of surface runoff in relation to the material used for surface cover tarmac paved surface gravel surface in a study conducted on six garage driveways those authors observed that surface runoff from paved surfaces amounted to on average 40 of atmospheric precipitation in our study in the case of the surface constructed of openwork concrete slabs surface runoff of rainwater amounted to on average 37 5 of atmospheric precipitation shafique et al 2018 in turn conducted a study on one of eight fragments of an internal road in a housing settlement each of the fragments being constructed of a different type of permeable surface the selected section of the road was constructed of concrete paving blocks leaving expansion gaps between the individual elements of the surface on the basis of analysis of rainfall events with various levels of intensity the authors determined that for this type of surface the value of reduction of the initial volume of rainwater varied in the range of 30 65 the droplet size structure presented in this study on the example of selected rainfall totals is similar to those obtained by other researchers of the subject in most of the analysed cases droplets with diameters up to 2 9 mm marked their contribution in the droplet size structure as reported by uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 in a vast majority droplets have diameters smaller than 3 0 mm biniak pieróg 2017 demonstrated that in the structure of rainfalls up to 8 0 mm droplets with diameters up to 2 0 mm dominate and only at greater precipitation totals the share of larger droplets attaining as much as 5 0 mm in diameter becomes numerically pronounced according to szewrański et al 2009 in the culmination phase of a rainfall the most numerous small droplets contribute as little as 3 of the rainfall volume while larger droplets whose share in the structure does not exceed 2 contribute the most to the rainfall volume it is obvious that droplet size distribution changes dynamically in time and space jameson and kostinski 2001 which raises the question how representative are the result of measurements obtained with the use of the disdrometer with measurement surface area of only 45 6 cm2 however as jaffrain and berne 2012 point out on the basis of measurements of precipitation structure by means of 16 disdrometers distributed over an area of 1 km 1 km the fields of droplet size distribution are not random bur characterised by a certain structure convection type precipitations being characterised by a greater variation than that of front type precipitations the sampling frequency of the instruments is also important increase on the frequency of measurements causes a decrease of spatial differentiation of dsd the results obtained are comparable with results presented in other reports on studies in this subject matter lee et al 2009 2007 miriovsky et al 2004 tapiador et al 2010 tokay and bashor 2010 and divergences are usually attributed to the use of different types of instruments their accuracy and spatial distribution distances between instruments the effect of precipitation on the amount of soil profile supply with water is observable mainly in the surface horizon support for the correctness of the choice of soil layer with thickness of 30 cm for the analyses can be found in the results of a study by zhang et al 2010 on the response of moisture of a bare soil to an influx of precipitation water indicating that it took place in a soil layer with that thickness an earlier study by biniak pieróg et al 2012 for the same soil revealed that diurnal precipitation totals up to the level of 10 0 mm did not cause any observable increase in water retention in soil layers with thickness up to 40 cm the analyses performed in the scope of the presented study provided further support these arguments indicate that the choice of soil layer for the analysis appears also to be justified from the viewpoint of soil conditions prevailing in the research object where soil moisture measurements were conducted in the surface layers of the soil fine grained loamy sands dominate to be replaced deeper with weakly loamy and loose sands with thinner interlayers of loamy sands and sandy loams less frequently gravelly sands the sandy layer has a total thickness from 80 to 90 cm at the depth of 100 120 cm for several months in a year the soils are completely saturated with water and as a result of capillary rise the saturation can extend up to the layer of 50 70 cm though such a situation does not last long therefore to eliminate this problem in the interpretation of results the authors limited themselves to the soil layer with thickness of 30 cm at the same time monitoring the level of the ground water table for the days selected for the analysis it varied from 107 to 158 cm below ground surface the presented results of analysis of the value of surface runoff from selected hardened surfaces in relation to the droplet size structure in the precipitation are hard to confront with other authors addressing similar subject matter due to the lack of studies and analyses in this area it is also difficult to compare the results concerning the relationship between the droplet structure of a rainfall and the dynamics of rainwater movement in the soil profile with results obtained by other authors the available studies in this area were most often conducted in laboratory conditions with the use of rainfall simulators which may differ significantly from the natural conditions in which this study was conducted as indicated by the results of a study by assouline et al 1997 a simulated rainfall represents relatively well the kinetic energy of a natural rainfall but it is a problem to achieve droplet size distributions comparable to those obtained in natural conditions due to the random character of atmospheric precipitations their totals and intensities occurring in natural conditions recreation of that process in laboratories is a difficult task according to biniak pieróg 2017 the effectiveness of a rainfall in the supply of the soil profile with water will differ depending on the dominant size of droplets in a precipitation in relation to the temperature of the active surface and the degree of its crusting for instance small droplets will evaporate in contact with heated soil surface while in the case of intensive rainfalls especially in typically summer months in contact with crusted soil the droplets will be broken into smaller ones and in effect flow away over its surface 4 summary the analyses conducted on the range of data presented in the study constitute a new approach to the interpretation of relations between atmospheric precipitations surface runoff and the values of reduction of soil infiltration taking into account the structure of droplet sizes and their contribution in the rainfall volume reaching the surface the analyses presented in the paper have a preliminary character due to the fact that they are based on a small number of selected rainfall events but that set was selected from a considerable number of measurements as pointed out at the beginning of the paper the subject matter presented here coincides with the world wide trend of sustainable management of rain waters studies conducted so far are focused mainly on identifying the level of the rainfall runoff relation taking into account two easily available nowadays rainfall characteristics i e the total and the intensity the increasing accessibility to modern apparatus in the form of disdrometers stimulates the interest in studies on the kind size and structure of droplets in atmospheric precipitations however the scope of analyses presented in this study is not a generally accepted standard and hence it is even difficult to conduct a discussion of results in this area the inclusion of one more element in the research i e the droplet structure of rainfalls and the attempt at relating that characteristic with the volume of rainwater runoff taking into account various types of surfaces used in urbanised areas may allow a comprehensive evaluation of this relationship the contemporary trend of development of urbanised areas causes the sealing of the ground surface which interferes with the natural water cycle in which soil retention plays a significant role the kind of hardened surface used is not without importance the proposed relation of the level of increase of soil water resources with the volume of runoff from hardened surfaces covered with small grain roofing paper and tarmac and permeable openwork concrete slabs allows to estimate the degree of reduction of soil profile supply with rain water in this aspect a solution that allows to largely counteract the effects of ground surface sealing can be an approach to rainwater management that assumes the interception of the greatest possible amounts of water running off to no effect from the surface and then using that water the acquired knowledge in this area will allow to add one more index to the models used for the estimation of the rainfall runoff relationship and to models of water balance in addition referring to a larger scale the results obtained in this study can be used as useful data in systems of spatial information of towns and cities in the range of precipitation waters management possibilities these data can also have a bearing on planning decisions in the aspect of sustainable management of precipitation waters in urbanised areas and constitute significant support for the design process the results obtained and the subject matter of the study are in line with contemporary strategies of integrated planning of urban areas in which the aspect of sustainable management of precipitation waters is related with the planning of green infrastructure a model example of a space in which the issues of integrated planning can be easily implemented is the space of a housing estate due to its potential related with the presence of permeable surfaces this creates the possibility of introducing elements of green blue infrastructure at the same time referring to the spatial development policy of towns and cities the results obtained from research can constitute a key factor affecting legislative changes in

5699,numerous studies have estimated surface heat fluxes by assimilating land surface temperature lst observations as the state variable of land surface a number of other studies have focused on the estimation of surface energy balance components by assimilating air temperature and specific humidity as the state variables of atmosphere into an atmospheric boundary layer model this study advances these existing data assimilation approaches by the synergistic assimilation of lst air temperature and specific humidity into a coupled land surface atmospheric boundary layer model the unknown parameters are the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn and evaporative fraction ef chn scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes and ef represents their partitioning the developed approach is tested at the first international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in the summer of 1987 and 1988 the results indicate that the new approach performs well in both wet and dry periods because it uses the implicit information in both the land surface and atmospheric state variables i e lst air temperature and specific humidity the root mean square errors rmses of estimated daily sensible and latent heat fluxes are 21 80 wm 2 22 10 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 36 89 wm 2 for fife 87 88 the corresponding mean absolute percentage errors mapes are 22 16 18 64 and 13 98 13 44 for fife 87 88 the new variational data assimilation vda system outperforms the previous studies that assimilated either lst or air temperature specific humidity for fife 87 this study decreases the rmses of daily sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates by 12 5 and 24 4 compared to assimilating only lst and by 15 2 and 26 7 compared to assimilating only air temperature and specific humidity a similar improvement is obtained for fife 88 the atmospheric boundary layer height potential temperature and specific humidity estimates from the vda approach are also in good agreement with the corresponding radiosonde observations and can capture their variations during the course of the day keywords surface heat fluxes variational data assimilation model air temperature specific humidity land surface temperature 1 introduction estimation of surface heat fluxes sensible latent and ground heat fluxes has been the subject of many studies holtslag and van ulden 1983 bastiaanssen et al

lu et al 2016 brenner et al 2017 abdolghafoorian and farhadi 2019 the sensible h and latent le heat fluxes characterize the exchange of heat and moisture between the land surface and its overlying atmosphere therefore their accurate estimation is of crucial importance for a better understanding of land atmosphere exchange processes and to constrain the land surface heat and moisture budgets laird and kristovich 2002 the ground heat flux g is an integral part of the surface energy budget that affects many belowground ecosystem processes purdy et al 2016 surface heat fluxes can be obtained via in situ measurements which are expensive and labor intensive aubinet et al 2000 baldocchi 2003 liu et al 2011 2013 thus various methods namely triangle margulis et al 2005 carlson 2007 stisen et

2019 he et al 2018 lu et al 2019 have been developed to estimate surface heat fluxes all of these methods used lst measurements as their key input the existing vda methods e g caparrini et al 2004a b

surface heat fluxes by assimilating the land surface temperature lst measurements into the force restore or heat diffusion equations i e land surface models without coupling to the overlying

gentine 2013 rigden and salvucci 2015 gentine et al 2013 2016 mccoll et al 2019 recently tajfar et al 2019 assimilated the sequences of reference level air temperature and specific humidity into an atmospheric boundary layer abl model within a vda framework to estimate surface heat fluxes they showed that sequences of air temperature and specific humidity measurements contain implicit information on the partitioning of the available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes but cannot easily constrain the ground heat flux this work builds on bateni et al 2013a b that assimilated lst into the soil heat diffusion equation and tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated air temperature and specific humidity into an abl model but it advances those studies by the synergistic assimilation of lst air temperature and specific humidity into a coupled land surface abl model within a new vda system the main goal of this study is to estimate surface heat fluxes h le and g h and le are obtained by estimating the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn that scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes and evaporative fraction ef that scales the partitioning between the turbulent heat fluxes finally g is obtained as the residual of the surface energy balance equation the advantages of the developed vda approach are 1 it performs better than the previous studies that assimilated only lst bateni et al 2013a b or only air temperature humidity observations tajfar et al 2019 2 it performs well in both wet and dry periods due to the synergic assimilation of sequences of lst air temperature and specific humidity tajfar 2019 3 it can generate turbulent heat fluxes for instances in which lst air temperature and humidity are unavailable or there are data gaps because the vda approach can provide estimates of lst air temperature and humidity and 4 it does not need ground heat flux specification this study is structured as follows the heat diffusion equation surface energy balance seb

is presumed to be constant the cost function j is given by 19 j t θ q λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 r e f i 1 n t o t 1 t i t t obs i t t r t 1 t i t t obs i t d t i 1 n t o t 1 θ i t θ sl i t t r θ 1 θ i t θ sl i t d

between the lst estimates from the heat diffusion equation t and its corresponding measurements t obs the second term represents the square of the misfit between the abl potential temperature θ estimate from eq 8a and the top of the surface layer potential temperature θ sl similarly the third term represents the square of the misfit between the abl specific humidity q estimate from eq 8b and the top of the surface layer specific humidity q sl θ sl and q sl are obtained respectively from the reference level air temperature t a and specific humidity q a via the most see appendix b the fourth and fifth terms are the squared errors of the unknown parameters i e r and ef with respect to their prior values r and ef the last three terms are physical constraints which are adjoined to the model by the lagrange multipliers λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 l is the depth of lower boundary condition in the soil column herein taken 0 5 m alternatively the objective function could be formulated such that the second and third terms represent the square of misfits between the estimated and observed reference level air temperature and specific humidity respectively in this case the objective function becomes more complex and it becomes more difficult to derive the euler lagrange equations because eqs 8a and 8b provide the abl potential temperature θ and specific humidity q estimates and not the reference level air temperature and specific humidity estimates 2 4 2 error covariance r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are the inverse error covariance matrices of t θ and q respectively b r 1 and b ef 1 are the inverse background error covariance matrices of r and ef respectively the values of r t 1 r θ 1 r q 1 b r 1 and b ef 1 can be found from the inverse covariance functions of states i e t θ and q and parameters i e r and ef if their statistical structures are known bennett 1992 because of the lack of detailed information on the statistical structure of the states and parameters r t 1 r θ 1 r q 1 b r 1 and b ef 1 are here considered as diagonal matrices of numerically constant values whose relative magnitudes affect the weight given to the observations and model parameters and how the fit to the observations is partitioned between the unknown model parameters ultimately controlling the rate of convergence stability and solution of the vda system bennett 1992 castelli et al 1999 θ i t θ sl i t and t i t t obs i t both have the order of magnitude of 5 k i e θ i t θ sl i t o 5 and t i t t obs i t o 5 and thus θ i t θ sl i t t θ i t θ sl i t o 25 k2 and t i t t obs i t t t i t t obs i t o 25 k2 q i t q sl i t has an order of magnitude of 5 10 3 kg kg 1 i e q i t q sl i t o 5 10 3 kg kg 1 consequently q t q sl t t q t q sl t o 25 10 6 kg kg 1 setting the diagonal elements of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 to 10 1 k 2 10 1 k 2 and 105 kg kg 1 causes the first second and third terms in the cost function to have the order of magnitude of 2 5 if the magnitudes of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are chosen such that the first term in the cost function i e t i t t obs i t t r t 1 t i t t obs i t becomes much larger than the other two terms i e θ i t θ sl i t t r θ 1 θ i t θ sl i t and q i t q sl i t t r q 1 q i t q sl i t the estimation of c hn ef and surface heat fluxes will be mainly dependent on the implicit information in the sequences of lst observations and the vda approach cannot use the information content of air temperature and specific humidity measurements in contrast if the magnitudes of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are selected such that the first term in the cost function becomes much smaller than the two other terms the estimation of the unknown parameters and surface heat fluxes will be mainly controlled by the implicit information in the sequences of air temperature and specific humidity observations and the vda approach cannot utilize the information content of lst hence r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 should be chosen such that the first three terms in the cost function have the same order of magnitude this allows the vda approach to take advantage of information in both the lst as the land surface state variable and air temperature and specific humidity as the atmospheric state variables measurements b r 1 and b ef 1 are found by trial and error daley 1991 the magnitude of the objective function j is computed for different values of b r 1 and b ef 1 and the values that lead to a minimum objective function are chosen in the first test the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 are considered to be equal and are varied from 101 to 1015 the vda model is unstable when the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 are varied from 101 to 106 for b r 1 and b ef 1 of 107 to 1015 the cost function is stable and converges table 1 top panel in the second test unequal values of b r 1 and b ef 1 are used in the objective function table 1 bottom panel it is observed that the objective function reaches its minimum value of 1 677 106 by setting the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 to 109 and 108 respectively a similar approach was used in castelli et al 1999 caparrini et al 2004a b bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 as shown in table 1 choosing other values for b r 1 and b ef 1 leads to a higher value for j a higher j value implies larger misfits between t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl which stem from less accurate c hn and ef estimates 2 4 3 euler lagrange equations to obtain the optimal values of r and ef the cost function j should be minimized for this purpose the first variation of j δj with respect to the independent variables θ q t λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 r and ef need to be set to zero this results in eight equations the so called euler lagrange equations which should be solved simultaneously to obtain the optimal values of r and ef the euler lagrange equations are listed in appendix c 3 fife site the vda approach is tested at the first islscp international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in central kansas

measured using 0 8 launches on particular days during the ifcs with 90 minute intervals and during the growth phase of the boundary layer the radiosonde measurements of abl potential temperature humidity and height in several cloud free days during each ifc june 4 6 in ifc1 jun 26 july 6 and july 11 in ifc 2 aug 15 17 in ifc 3 are used to verify the corresponding vda retrievals the initial condition for the abl height h t o 9 a m is required to integrate eq 14a forward in time the initial conditions for δ θ i e δ θ t o 9 a m and γ θ are needed to solve eq 15 similarly the initial

site can be calculated from c c s θ v c w de vries 1963 campbell 1985 where c s and c w are the volumetric heat capacity of dry soil and water and θ v is the volumetric soil moisture the magnitudes of c s and c w are 1 48 106 j m 3 k 1 and 4 106 j m 3 k 1 respectively hillel 1998 abu hamdeh 2003 bateni et al 2013a the volumetric soil moisture θ v also varies over the range of 0 15 0 3 at the fife site during the modeling period betts and ball 1998 hence an average θ v value of 0 22 is utilized in this study based on the abovementioned values of c s c w and θ v a value of 2 35 106 j m 3 k 1 is obtained for c also on the basis of the soil type at fife clay and silt and its mean water content of 0 22 the soil heat conductivity p is set to 0 65 j m 1 k 1 s 1 hillel 1998 abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 bateni et al 2013a assuming constant values for p and c during the modeling period and throughout the soil column decreases the accuracy of soil temperature estimates from the heat diffusion equation and consequently the results of the vda approach however it is shown in this study that the results of the data assimilation approach are reliable as long as the chosen values for p and c are reasonable and fall within a physically accepted range future studies should be directed to evaluate the impact of changes in the soil thermal properties on the performance of the developed vda approach following betts and ball 1998 bateni and liang 2012 bateni and entekhabi 2012a b and bateni et al 2013a albedo is set to 0 2 a large number of studies indicated that albedo slightly reduces with increasing soil moisture idso et al 1975 eltahir 1998 wang et al 2005 liu et al 2008a b sugathan et al 2014 eltahir 1998 examined the effect of soil moisture on surface albedo at the fife site he showed that even extreme changes in soil moisture result in a change of about 2 in albedo which is associated with about 5 w m 2 in energy fluxes using grey body emissivity ɛ s 0 98 and lst estimates the upward longwave flux rgu is calculated sini et al 2008 bateni et al 2013a b bateni and entekhabi 2012a b tajfar et al 2019 several studies showed that the surface emissivity ɛ s slightly increases with soil moisture ogawa et al 2008 wang et al 2015 the upwelling longwave radiation and lst measurements at the fife site are used to compute ɛ s it is found that ɛ s varies less than 3 due to changes in soil moisture all of the parameters with fixed values are listed in table 2 4 results the vda approach is run for a number of reasonable r values to evaluate their effect on the ef θ q and lst estimates in these tests r chn is changed from 7 5 to 3 5 0 0005 to 0 0302 with increments of 0 5 the increment is not a fixed value in terms of chn for each utilized r value in the vda approach the rmses of corresponding ef θ q and lst estimates are calculated fig 2 as shown the rmses of ef θ q and lst retrievals reach their minimum at the r chn value of 4 5 0 0111 5 0 0 0067 and 5 5 0 0041 for the first julian days 148 177 second julian days 178 207 and third julian days 208 243 assimilation periods in fife 87 respectively similarly the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates find their minimum at the r chn of 6 0 0 0025 for the first julian days 160 189 and 5 0 0 0067 for the second julian days 190 219 and third julian days 220 243 assimilation periods in fife 88 the results show that there is an r value in each assimilation period for which the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates reach their minimum the presence of well defined minima in the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates indicate that a solution exists and that solution is unique the vda approach iteratively improves the initial guess for r and finally finds its optimum value see appendix c table 3 shows chn estimates from the vda approach and corresponding lai values the lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi relationship suggested by aparicio et al 2000 is used to obtain lai from ndvi ndvi data were obtained from landsat and spot satellites by hall et al 1992 the estimated chn values fall within a physically acceptable range stull 1994 caparrini et al 2004a bateni et al 2013b for fife 87 lai has its maximum value of 1 7 in the first assimilation period i e julian days 148 178 and decreases during the course of the summer due to reduction in precipitation in contrast lai increases during the summer of 1988 as indicated in both years chn variations are consistent with those of lai although no information on vegetation phenology is used in the vda approach the second unknown of the vda approach is ef fig 3 shows time series of ef estimates for fife 87 and 88 ef values from measured h and le are also indicated by open circles on the same figure as shown ef estimates capture both the magnitude and day to day variability in the observations although no information on the soil moisture or precipitation was used in the vda system for example the decreasing and increasing trends in the ef observations respectively during the dry down julian days 190 214 in fife 87 and wetting julian days 195 199 and 226 231 in fife88 periods are captured by the ef estimates table 4 shows the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of ef estimates from bateni et al 2013a that assimilated only lst tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated only ta and qa and this study that assimilated lst ta and qa for fife 87 tajfar et al 2019 generates slightly more accurate ef estimates than bateni et al 2013a in contrast bateni et al 2013a outperforms tajfar et al 2019 in fife 88 this is due to the fact that on average summer 88 was slightly drier than summer 87 the soil moisture at the depth of 2 5 cm was on average 0 26 for fife 87 and 0 18 for fife 88 the drier land surface leads to a stronger coupling between ef and lst because evaporation is mainly controlled by land surface processes rather than atmospheric variables in water limited evaporative regimes bateni et al 2013b shokri et al 2008a b hence retrieval of ef from sequences of lst measurements becomes more robust in drier conditions fife 88 in contrast in wetter conditions fife 87 the coupling between ef and the atmospheric state variables i e air temperature and specific humidity becomes more robust because evaporation is more influenced by the atmospheric variables in energy limited evaporative regimes these findings indicate that both the state variables of the land surface i e lst and atmosphere i e air temperature and humidity control ef and thus it is beneficial to take advantage of information in both of them for fife 87 88 the rmse of estimated ef values from this study is 0 061 0 053 which is a reduction of 11 6 26 4 compared to the rmse of 0 069 0 072 from tajfar et al 2019 compared to bateni et al 2013a the improvement in the rmse of ef estimates is 18 7 and 10 2 for fife 87 and 88 respectively similarly the mae of ef estimates from this study is lower than those of bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 the half hourly estimated h le and g values are indicated versus measurements in fig 4 for fife 87 and 88 as shown there is a good agreement between the estimations and measurements and they mostly fall around the 1 1 line for fife 1987 1988 the rmse of half hourly h le and g estimates is 33 33 wm 2 43 43 wm 2 67 19 wm 2 72 02 wm 2 and 60 03 wm 2 80 93 wm 2 respectively in fife 87 88 the mae is 27 17 wm 2 33 65 wm 2 55 57 wm 2 54 22 wm 2 and 46 37 wm 2 60 29 wm 2 for half hourly sensible latent and ground heat fluxes respectively the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates from bateni et al 2013a tajfar et al 2019 and this study are compared in table 5 for fife 87 and 88 as can be seen the rmses of turbulent heat fluxes estimates from this study are smaller than those of bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 the new vda system decreases the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates for year 1987 1988 by 10 1 10 6 and 17 2 16 2 compared to bateni et al 2013a and 13 7 10 3 and 20 9 16 9 compared to tajfar et al 2019 the rmse of half hourly g estimates from this study is 60 03 wm 2 and 80 93 wm 2 for fife 87 and 88 which is 50 9 and 28 6 lower than the rmse of 122 14 wm 2 and 113 29 wm 2 from tajfar et al 2019 this happens because g is directly related to the gradient of lst via g p dt dz z 0 therefore assimilating sequences of lst observations into the heat diffusion equation can constrain the ground heat flux leading to a significant improvement in the g estimates the results show that the vda approach can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of lst measurements to significantly improve the ground heat flux estimates compared to tajfar et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 the mae and rmse of le retrievals are higher than those of h estimates this is due to the fact that the uncertainty in h estimates results from errors in the estimated chn and lst values equation 5 whereas the uncertainty of le retrievals is due to errors in the chn lst and ef estimates eq 7b more sources of errors increase the uncertainty of le estimates moreover g retrievals are not as good as h and le estimates this happens because g is calculated as the residual of the seb equation i e g r n h l e thus uncertainties in the h and le estimates propagate into g retrievals which lead to more errors in g estimations figs 5 and 6 show time series of daily h and le estimates for fife 87 and 88 respectively as indicated both the magnitude and day to day fluctuations of measured sensible and latent heat fluxes are captured well by the estimations from the vda approach for example in fife 87 the estimated h le can capture the rising falling pattern of h le measurements during the dry down period i e julian days 190 214 moreover sharp jumps and drops in observations are reflected well in estimations in both fife 87 and 88 for fife 87 the rmse of daytime average h and le estimates from the vda approach are 21 80 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 respectively corresponding rmse values for fife 88 are 22 10 wm 2 and 36 89 wm 2 for fife 87 88 daily h and le estimates from this study are improved by 12 5 17 8 and 24 4 22 0 compared to bateni et al 2013a and 15 2 20 4 and 26 7 23 5 compared to tajfar et al 2019 time series of half hourly estimated and observed sensible and latent heat fluxes for julian days 178 207 fife 87 are compared in fig 7 as shown in this figure the magnitude and phase of retrieved and observed h and le agree well for all days implying that the vda approach can estimate turbulent heat fluxes accurately the vda approach retrieves chn and ef by minimizing the difference between the lst estimates from eq 1 and observations i e t and t obs as well as the misfit between the estimated potential temperature and specific humidity from eqs 8a and 8b i e θ and q and the corresponding values i e θ sl and q sl obtained from the measured reference level air temperature and specific humidity via the most see appendix b fig 8 shows that there is a good agreement between the half hourly t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl for fife 87 and 88 implying that the vda framework is able to efficiently optimize the two key unknown parameters of the vda approach chn and ef by minimizing the misfit terms in the objective function for fife 87 the rmses of lst θ and q estimates are respectively 1 19 k 2 23 k and 0 0017 kg kg corresponding values for fife 88 are 1 32 k 2 06 k and 0 0014 kg kg the uncertainty of lst θ and q estimates is mostly because of the measurement errors and simplistic assumptions e g constant daily ef and monthly chn insignificant advection and convectively well mixed boundary layer which results in constant profiles of potential temperature and specific humidity with height the rmse and mae of estimated θ and q values from this study are compared with those of tajfar et al 2019 for fife 87 and 88 table 6 similarly table 7 compares the rmse and mae of t estimates from this study with those of bateni et al 2013a it should be noted that bateni et al 2013a assimilated only lst observations into the heat diffusion equation and thus it provided the rmse and mae of lst estimates also tajfar et al 2019 assimilated only air temperature and specific humidity into an abl model and therefore it generated the rmse and mae of θ and q estimates only the rmse and mae of θ and q estimates from this study are lower than those of tajfar et al 2019 the rmse of θ and q are reduced respectively by 16 8 12 5 and 11 6 10 8 for fife 87 88 the rmse of estimated lst values from this study is also smaller than that of bateni et al 2013a resulting in an improvement of 30 0 37 4 for fife 87 88 similarly for fife 87 88 the mae of t estimates is 0 89 k 1 02 k which is 31 5 36 7 lower than the mae of 1 30 k 1 61 k from bateni et al 2013a these outcomes indicate that the new vda approach can provide more accurate chn and ef estimates as the model finds optimum values of chn and ef by minimizing the misfits between t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl the mean diurnal cycles of observed and estimated sensible latent and ground heat fluxes as well as net radiation from this study and tajfar et al 2019 are shown in fig 9 for fife 87 and 88 as can be seen there is a remarkable difference between the diurnal cycles of observed and estimated ground heat flux from tajfar et al 2019 g is directly related to the lst via g p dt dz tajfar et al 2019 did not assimilate the sequences of lst observations and consequently could not capture the diurnal cycle of ground heat flux by assimilating lst measurements into the heat diffusion equation in this study the diurnal cycle of predicted ground heat flux is improved significantly assimilating sequences of lst observations into the heat diffusion equation also improves the diurnal cycles of latent heat flux for fife 87 and net radiation for fife 88 as explained in section 3 the h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values that lead to a minimum objective function are used in this study on the other hand the radiosonde measurements of the abovementioned variables are available at the fife site 1987 for julian days 155 156 176 177 178 187 227 228 and 229 the turbulent heat fluxes estimates by using the optimized and measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values in the vda approach are compared in fig 10 as shown the h and le estimates from the aforementioned measured variables are slightly closer to the observations according to table 8 by utilizing the measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values in the vda approach the rmse of daily h le estimates decreases from 27 66 w m 2 to 25 03 w m 2 31 15 w m 2 to 28 48 w m 2 leading to an improvement of 9 5 8 6 the results show that utilizing the measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values rather than the calibrated ones only slightly improve the turbulent heat fluxes estimates therefore the vda approach can provide accurate estimates of h and le by using the optimized h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values radiosonde measurements of mixed layer potential temperature θ specific humidity q and height h over the fife site during summer 87 are used to validate the corresponding estimations from the vda approach fig 11 a i compare the estimated mixed layer height specific humidity and potential temperature from the vda approach with those obtained from the radiosonde for 15 17 august 1987 the error bars show the error in defining the depth averaged mixed layer values from the radiosondes margulis and entekhabi 2001 on august 15 fig 11a c the abl height potential temperature and specific humidity grow throughout the day the model estimates capture the increasing trend of the radiosonde data and agree well with them on august 16 fig 11d f the measured abl height and potential temperature increase but abl specific humidity does not show a clear trend during the course of the day the abl height and potential temperature estimates rise during the day and are consistent with the radiosonde data in terms of magnitude and daily variation the model estimations can also capture the daily variations in the abl specific humidity measurements on august 17 fig 11g i the estimations capture the rising patterns in θ q and h the small discrepancies between model estimates and radiosonde data can be because of the fact that the radiosonde point observations might not be representative of a spatial average over for the fife site margulis 2002 the simplistic assumptions of daily constant ef and monthly constant chn and noise in the input data these sources of errors make the comparison between the model estimates and measurements difficult margulis and entekhabi 2001 similar results are obtained for other cloud free days in june 1987 where the radiosonde measurements are available not shown herein overall the results of this study show that the developed vda approach can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of both land surface and atmosphere state variables i e lst ta and qa to retrieve the signature of relative partitioning of available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes as well as the abl potential temperature humidity and height the findings also indicate that the magnitude and phase of retrieved and observed h and le agree well for all days implying that the vda approach can accurately estimate turbulent heat fluxes the outcomes illustrate that the synergistic assimilation of lst ta and qa into the vda approach improves sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates compared to the previous studies in which either lst or ta and qa were assimilated several sensitivity tests are conducted at fife 87 to evaluate the effect of uncertainties in lst air temperature and specific humidity measurements on the turbulent fluxes estimates in the first set of numerical experiments lst measurements are changed by 1 2 3 and 4 k from their nominal values and are assimilated in the vda approach to predict turbulent heat fluxes fig 12 shows the sensitivity of h and le estimates to uncertainties in lst observations increasing lst by 1 2 3 and 4 k results in a 9 53 15 33 22 87 and 27 43 increase in h and a 13 62 18 4 25 43 and 29 03 decrease in le on the other hand decreasing lst by 1 2 3 and 4 k leads to a 8 91 13 78 20 56 and 25 78 reduction in h and a 12 69 17 34 22 17 and 28 56 rise in le in the second set of numerical experiments air temperature measurements are varied by 1 2 3 and 4 k from their nominal values as shown in fig 13 increasing air temperature observations by 1 2 3 and 4 k causes a 6 43 10 16 21 69 and 25 52 reduction in h and a 9 46 16 76 22 21 and 26 56 increase in le however decreasing air temperature observations by 1 2 3 and 4 k leads to a 4 68 12 93 21 89 and 27 71 increase in h and a 7 01 20 56 27 73 and 29 22 reduction in le finally in the third set of tests specific humidity observations are changed by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 according to fig 14 increasing specific humidity by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 yields a 3 02 5 91 8 75 and 11 54 increase in the h estimates and a 3 42 6 69 9 90 and 13 05 decrease in the le estimates on the other hand decreasing specific humidity observations by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 causes a 2 94 5 99 9 12 and 12 32 reduction in the h estimates and a 3 35 6 84 10 41 and 14 08 growth in the le estimates to examine the effect of noise in the initial condition of soil temperature on the turbulent heat fluxes estimates four synthetic screening tests are conducted in these tests specified errors with normal distribution are added to the initial condition of soil temperature in the first and second tests positive noises with the mean μ of 2 k and standard deviations σ of 1 k and 2 k are added to the initial condition in the third and fourth tests negative noises with the mean of 2 k and standard deviation of 1 k and 2 k are added to the initial condition the rmses of turbulent heat fluxes estimates from the synthetic tests positively and negatively noised initial condition are compared with those of the original case non noisy initial condition for fife 87 in table 9 as can be seen the added noise to the initial condition of soil temperature only slightly degrades performance of the vda approach for example the positive noise with μ 2 k and σ 1 k increases the rmse of half hourly h and le estimates by 1 27 and 2 92 respectively similarly the negative noise with μ 2 k and σ 1 k increases the corresponding rmses by 4 39 and 2 78 respectively this happens because the vda approach can map the lst estimates onto the observations even if there is a bias in the initial condition of soil temperature 5 conclusion the sequences of land surface temperature as the state variable of land surface and reference level air temperature and specific humidity as the state variables of atmosphere measurements are assimilated into a coupled land surface atmospheric boundary layer abl model within a variational data assimilation vda approach to estimate surface heat fluxes the main unknown parameters of the vda system are neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn and evaporative fraction ef the vda approach is tested at the first islscp international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in summer 1987 and 1988 the results show that the developed vda scheme can accurately estimate the sensible h and latent le heat fluxes the root mean square errors rmses of half hourly h and le estimates are 33 33 wm 2 43 43 wm 2 and 67 19 wm 2 72 02 wm 2 for fife 87 88 these rmses are compared to those of bateni et al 2013a that assimilated only lst and tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated only reference level air temperature and specific humidity the results indicate that there is an improvement in the turbulent heat fluxes estimates due to the synergistic assimilation of sequences of lst air temperature and specific humidity for fife 87 88 the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates are decreased respectively by 13 7 10 3 and 24 6 16 9 compared to tajfar et al 2019 and 10 1 10 6 and 17 2 16 2 compared to bateni et al 2013a time series of half hourly and daily h and le estimates from the vda approach agree well with the observations both in terms of magnitude and day to day fluctuations for fife 87 88 the rmses of daily h and le estimates from this study are 21 80 wm 2 22 10 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 36 89 wm 2 which are improved by 15 2 20 4 and 26 7 23 5 compared to tajfar et al 2019 and 12 5 17 8 and 24 4 22 0 compared to bateni et al 2013a for fife 87 88 the rmses of estimated land surface temperature and abl specific humidity q and potential temperature θ are respectively 1 19 k 1 32 k 0 0017 kg kg 0 0014 kg kg and 2 23 k 2 06 k compared to tajfar et al 2019 this study reduces the rmses of θ and q estimates by 16 8 12 5 and 11 6 10 8 for fife 87 88 also compared to bateni et al 2013a the rmse of lst estimates is reduced by 30 0 37 4 for fife 87 88 these findings indicate that the new vda scheme can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of both land surface and atmosphere state variables i e land surface temperature and reference level air temperature and specific humidity to retrieve the signature of relative partitioning of available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes the abl height potential temperature and specific humidity estimates from the vda approach are reasonably close to the radiosonde observations and can capture their diurnal variations future studies should be directed towards 1 testing the developed vda over large scale domains using remote sensing data 2 developing a weak constraint vda approach that can capture uncertainties in the turbulent heat fluxes due to advection as well as measurements and structural model errors and 3 incorporating the

5699,numerous studies have estimated surface heat fluxes by assimilating land surface temperature lst observations as the state variable of land surface a number of other studies have focused on the estimation of surface energy balance components by assimilating air temperature and specific humidity as the state variables of atmosphere into an atmospheric boundary layer model this study advances these existing data assimilation approaches by the synergistic assimilation of lst air temperature and specific humidity into a coupled land surface atmospheric boundary layer model the unknown parameters are the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn and evaporative fraction ef chn scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes and ef represents their partitioning the developed approach is tested at the first international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in the summer of 1987 and 1988 the results indicate that the new approach performs well in both wet and dry periods because it uses the implicit information in both the land surface and atmospheric state variables i e lst air temperature and specific humidity the root mean square errors rmses of estimated daily sensible and latent heat fluxes are 21 80 wm 2 22 10 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 36 89 wm 2 for fife 87 88 the corresponding mean absolute percentage errors mapes are 22 16 18 64 and 13 98 13 44 for fife 87 88 the new variational data assimilation vda system outperforms the previous studies that assimilated either lst or air temperature specific humidity for fife 87 this study decreases the rmses of daily sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates by 12 5 and 24 4 compared to assimilating only lst and by 15 2 and 26 7 compared to assimilating only air temperature and specific humidity a similar improvement is obtained for fife 88 the atmospheric boundary layer height potential temperature and specific humidity estimates from the vda approach are also in good agreement with the corresponding radiosonde observations and can capture their variations during the course of the day keywords surface heat fluxes variational data assimilation model air temperature specific humidity land surface temperature 1 introduction estimation of surface heat fluxes sensible latent and ground heat fluxes has been the subject of many studies holtslag and van ulden 1983 bastiaanssen et al

lu et al 2016 brenner et al 2017 abdolghafoorian and farhadi 2019 the sensible h and latent le heat fluxes characterize the exchange of heat and moisture between the land surface and its overlying atmosphere therefore their accurate estimation is of crucial importance for a better understanding of land atmosphere exchange processes and to constrain the land surface heat and moisture budgets laird and kristovich 2002 the ground heat flux g is an integral part of the surface energy budget that affects many belowground ecosystem processes purdy et al 2016 surface heat fluxes can be obtained via in situ measurements which are expensive and labor intensive aubinet et al 2000 baldocchi 2003 liu et al 2011 2013 thus various methods namely triangle margulis et al 2005 carlson 2007 stisen et

2019 he et al 2018 lu et al 2019 have been developed to estimate surface heat fluxes all of these methods used lst measurements as their key input the existing vda methods e g caparrini et al 2004a b

surface heat fluxes by assimilating the land surface temperature lst measurements into the force restore or heat diffusion equations i e land surface models without coupling to the overlying atmosphere their main shortcoming is that they do not perform well in wet and or heavily vegetated sites because they assimilate only the state variable of the land surface i e lst and neglect the implicit information in the state variables of atmosphere i e reference level air temperature and humidity ignoring the implicit information in the reference level air temperature and humidity may cause errors in the retrieval of turbulent heat fluxes i e h and le especially if they are controlled by atmospheric conditions rather than the land surface conditions crow and kustas 2005 bateni et al 2013a xu et al 2014 2016 2019 several studies showed that the reference level air temperature and specific humidity contain information about soil moisture mahfouf 1991 bouttier et al 1993a b

gentine 2013 rigden and salvucci 2015 gentine et al 2013 2016 mccoll et al 2019 recently tajfar et al 2019 assimilated the sequences of reference level air temperature and specific humidity into an atmospheric boundary layer abl model within a vda framework to estimate surface heat fluxes they showed that sequences of air temperature and specific humidity measurements contain implicit information on the partitioning of the available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes but cannot easily constrain the ground heat flux this work builds on bateni et al 2013a b that assimilated lst into the soil heat diffusion equation and tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated air temperature and specific humidity into an abl model but it advances those studies by the synergistic assimilation of lst air temperature and specific humidity into a coupled land surface abl model within a new vda system the main goal of this study is to estimate surface heat fluxes h le and g h and le are obtained by estimating the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn that scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes and evaporative fraction ef that scales the partitioning between the turbulent heat fluxes finally g is obtained as the residual of the surface energy balance equation the advantages of the developed vda approach are 1 it performs better than the previous studies that assimilated only lst bateni et al 2013a b or only air temperature humidity observations tajfar et al 2019 2 it performs well in both wet and dry periods due to the synergic assimilation of sequences of lst air temperature and specific humidity tajfar 2019 3 it can generate turbulent heat fluxes for instances in which lst air temperature and humidity are unavailable or there are data gaps because the vda approach can provide estimates of lst air temperature and humidity and 4 it does not need ground heat flux specification this study is structured as follows the heat diffusion equation surface energy balance seb

cannot distinct them and thus becomes ill posed to make the estimation problem well posed and realizing that c hn and ef vary on different time scales monthly c hn and daily ef are estimated by the vda approach crow and kustas 2005 bateni et al 2013a b tajfar et al 2019 therefore two different integral time scales are used in the objective function j the first one covers the entire assimilation period n 30 days in which chn is assumed to be constant to ensure chn is always positive we solve for its logarithmic value r the second one spans the assimilation window t0 9 a m t1 4 p m in which ef is presumed to be constant the cost function j is given by 19 j t θ q λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 r e f i 1 n t o t 1 t i t t obs i t t r t 1 t i t t obs i t d t i 1 n t o t 1 θ i t θ sl i t t r θ 1 θ i t θ sl i t d

between the lst estimates from the heat diffusion equation t and its corresponding measurements t obs the second term represents the square of the misfit between the abl potential temperature θ estimate from eq 8a and the top of the surface layer potential temperature θ sl similarly the third term represents the square of the misfit between the abl specific humidity q estimate from eq 8b and the top of the surface layer specific humidity q sl θ sl and q sl are obtained respectively from the reference level air temperature t a and specific humidity q a via the most see appendix b the fourth and fifth terms are the squared errors of the unknown parameters i e r and ef with respect to their prior values r and ef the last three terms are physical constraints which are adjoined to the model by the lagrange multipliers λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 l is the depth of lower boundary condition in the soil column herein taken 0 5 m alternatively the objective function could be formulated such that the second and third terms represent the square of misfits between the estimated and observed reference level air temperature and specific humidity respectively in this case the objective function becomes more complex and it becomes more difficult to derive the euler lagrange equations because eqs 8a and 8b provide the abl potential temperature θ and specific humidity q estimates and not the reference level air temperature and specific humidity estimates 2 4 2 error covariance r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are the inverse error covariance matrices of t θ and q respectively b r 1 and b ef 1 are the inverse background error covariance matrices of r and ef respectively the values of r t 1 r θ 1 r q 1 b r 1 and b ef 1 can be found from the inverse covariance functions of states i e t θ and q and parameters i e r and ef if their statistical structures are known bennett 1992 because of the lack of detailed information on the statistical structure of the states and parameters r t 1 r θ 1 r q 1 b r 1 and b ef 1 are here considered as diagonal matrices of numerically constant values whose relative magnitudes affect the weight given to the observations and model parameters and how the fit to the observations is partitioned between the unknown model parameters ultimately controlling the rate of convergence stability and solution of the vda system bennett 1992 castelli et al 1999 θ i t θ sl i t and t i t t obs i t both have the order of magnitude of 5 k i e θ i t θ sl i t o 5 and t i t t obs i t o 5 and thus θ i t θ sl i t t θ i t θ sl i t o 25 k2 and t i t t obs i t t t i t t obs i t o 25 k2 q i t q sl i t has an order of magnitude of 5 10 3 kg kg 1 i e q i t q sl i t o 5 10 3 kg kg 1 consequently q t q sl t t q t q sl t o 25 10 6 kg kg 1 setting the diagonal elements of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 to 10 1 k 2 10 1 k 2 and 105 kg kg 1 causes the first second and third terms in the cost function to have the order of magnitude of 2 5 if the magnitudes of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are chosen such that the first term in the cost function i e t i t t obs i t t r t 1 t i t t obs i t becomes much larger than the other two terms i e θ i t θ sl i t t r θ 1 θ i t θ sl i t and q i t q sl i t t r q 1 q i t q sl i t the estimation of c hn ef and surface heat fluxes will be mainly dependent on the implicit information in the sequences of lst observations and the vda approach cannot use the information content of air temperature and specific humidity measurements in contrast if the magnitudes of r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 are selected such that the first term in the cost function becomes much smaller than the two other terms the estimation of the unknown parameters and surface heat fluxes will be mainly controlled by the implicit information in the sequences of air temperature and specific humidity observations and the vda approach cannot utilize the information content of lst hence r t 1 r θ 1 and r q 1 should be chosen such that the first three terms in the cost function have the same order of magnitude this allows the vda approach to take advantage of information in both the lst as the land surface state variable and air temperature and specific humidity as the atmospheric state variables measurements b r 1 and b ef 1 are found by trial and error daley 1991 the magnitude of the objective function j is computed for different values of b r 1 and b ef 1 and the values that lead to a minimum objective function are chosen in the first test the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 are considered to be equal and are varied from 101 to 1015 the vda model is unstable when the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 are varied from 101 to 106 for b r 1 and b ef 1 of 107 to 1015 the cost function is stable and converges table 1 top panel in the second test unequal values of b r 1 and b ef 1 are used in the objective function table 1 bottom panel it is observed that the objective function reaches its minimum value of 1 677 106 by setting the diagonal elements of b r 1 and b ef 1 to 109 and 108 respectively a similar approach was used in castelli et al 1999 caparrini et al 2004a b bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 as shown in table 1 choosing other values for b r 1 and b ef 1 leads to a higher value for j a higher j value implies larger misfits between t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl which stem from less accurate c hn and ef estimates 2 4 3 euler lagrange equations to obtain the optimal values of r and ef the cost function j should be minimized for this purpose the first variation of j δj with respect to the independent variables θ q t λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 r and ef need to be set to zero this results in eight equations the so called euler lagrange equations which should be solved simultaneously to obtain the optimal values of r and ef the euler lagrange equations are listed in appendix c 3 fife site the vda approach is tested at the first islscp international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in central kansas

humidity and height in several cloud free days during each ifc june 4 6 in ifc1 jun 26 july 6 and july 11 in ifc 2 aug 15 17 in ifc 3 are used to verify the corresponding vda retrievals the initial condition for the abl height h t o 9 a m is required to integrate eq 14a forward in time the initial conditions for δ θ i e δ θ t o 9 a m and γ θ are needed to solve eq 15 similarly the initial

site can be calculated from c c s θ v c w de vries 1963 campbell 1985 where c s and c w are the volumetric heat capacity of dry soil and water and θ v is the volumetric soil moisture the magnitudes of c s and c w are 1 48 106 j m 3 k 1 and 4 106 j m 3 k 1 respectively hillel 1998 abu hamdeh 2003 bateni et al 2013a the volumetric soil moisture θ v also varies over the range of 0 15 0 3 at the fife site during the modeling period betts and ball 1998 hence an average θ v value of 0 22 is utilized in this study based on the abovementioned values of c s c w and θ v a value of 2 35 106 j m 3 k 1 is obtained for c also on the basis of the soil type at fife clay and silt and its mean water content of 0 22 the soil heat conductivity p is set to 0 65 j m 1 k 1 s 1 hillel 1998 abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 bateni et al 2013a assuming constant values for p and c during the modeling period and throughout the soil column decreases the accuracy of soil temperature estimates from the heat diffusion equation and consequently the results of the vda approach however it is shown in this study that the results of the data assimilation approach are reliable as long as the chosen values for p and c are reasonable and fall within a physically accepted range future studies should be directed to evaluate the impact of changes in the soil thermal properties on the performance of the developed vda approach following betts and ball 1998 bateni and liang 2012 bateni and entekhabi 2012a b and bateni et al 2013a albedo is set to 0 2 a large number of studies indicated that albedo slightly reduces with increasing soil moisture idso et al 1975 eltahir 1998 wang et al 2005 liu et al 2008a b sugathan et al 2014 eltahir 1998 examined the effect of soil moisture on surface albedo at the fife site he showed that even extreme changes in soil moisture result in a change of about 2 in albedo which is associated with about 5 w m 2 in energy fluxes using grey body emissivity ɛ s 0 98 and lst estimates the upward longwave flux rgu is calculated sini et al 2008 bateni et al 2013a b bateni and entekhabi 2012a b tajfar et al 2019 several studies showed that the surface emissivity ɛ s slightly increases with soil moisture ogawa et al 2008 wang et al 2015 the upwelling longwave radiation and lst measurements at the fife site are used to compute ɛ s it is found that ɛ s varies less than 3 due to changes in soil moisture all of the parameters with fixed values are listed in table 2 4 results the vda approach is run for a number of reasonable r values to evaluate their effect on the ef θ q and lst estimates in these tests r chn is changed from 7 5 to 3 5 0 0005 to 0 0302 with increments of 0 5 the increment is not a fixed value in terms of chn for each utilized r value in the vda approach the rmses of corresponding ef θ q and lst estimates are calculated fig 2 as shown the rmses of ef θ q and lst retrievals reach their minimum at the r chn value of 4 5 0 0111 5 0 0 0067 and 5 5 0 0041 for the first julian days 148 177 second julian days 178 207 and third julian days 208 243 assimilation periods in fife 87 respectively similarly the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates find their minimum at the r chn of 6 0 0 0025 for the first julian days 160 189 and 5 0 0 0067 for the second julian days 190 219 and third julian days 220 243 assimilation periods in fife 88 the results show that there is an r value in each assimilation period for which the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates reach their minimum the presence of well defined minima in the rmses of ef θ q and lst estimates indicate that a solution exists and that solution is unique the vda approach iteratively improves the initial guess for r and finally finds its optimum value see appendix c table 3 shows chn estimates from the vda approach and corresponding lai values the lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi relationship suggested by aparicio et al 2000 is used to obtain lai from ndvi ndvi data were obtained from landsat and spot satellites by hall et al 1992 the estimated chn values fall within a physically acceptable range stull 1994 caparrini et al 2004a bateni et al 2013b for fife 87 lai has its maximum value of 1 7 in the first assimilation period i e julian days 148 178 and decreases during the course of the summer due to reduction in precipitation in contrast lai increases during the summer of 1988 as indicated in both years chn variations are consistent with those of lai although no information on vegetation phenology is used in the vda approach the second unknown of the vda approach is ef fig 3 shows time series of ef estimates for fife 87 and 88 ef values from measured h and le are also indicated by open circles on the same figure as shown ef estimates capture both the magnitude and day to day variability in the observations although no information on the soil moisture or precipitation was used in the vda system for example the decreasing and increasing trends in the ef observations respectively during the dry down julian days 190 214 in fife 87 and wetting julian days 195 199 and 226 231 in fife88 periods are captured by the ef estimates table 4 shows the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of ef estimates from bateni et al 2013a that assimilated only lst tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated only ta and qa and this study that assimilated lst ta and qa for fife 87 tajfar et al 2019 generates slightly more accurate ef estimates than bateni et al 2013a in contrast bateni et al 2013a outperforms tajfar et al 2019 in fife 88 this is due to the fact that on average summer 88 was slightly drier than summer 87 the soil moisture at the depth of 2 5 cm was on average 0 26 for fife 87 and 0 18 for fife 88 the drier land surface leads to a stronger coupling between ef and lst because evaporation is mainly controlled by land surface processes rather than atmospheric variables in water limited evaporative regimes bateni et al 2013b shokri et al 2008a b hence retrieval of ef from sequences of lst measurements becomes more robust in drier conditions fife 88 in contrast in wetter conditions fife 87 the coupling between ef and the atmospheric state variables i e air temperature and specific humidity becomes more robust because evaporation is more influenced by the atmospheric variables in energy limited evaporative regimes these findings indicate that both the state variables of the land surface i e lst and atmosphere i e air temperature and humidity control ef and thus it is beneficial to take advantage of information in both of them for fife 87 88 the rmse of estimated ef values from this study is 0 061 0 053 which is a reduction of 11 6 26 4 compared to the rmse of 0 069 0 072 from tajfar et al 2019 compared to bateni et al 2013a the improvement in the rmse of ef estimates is 18 7 and 10 2 for fife 87 and 88 respectively similarly the mae of ef estimates from this study is lower than those of bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 the half hourly estimated h le and g values are indicated versus measurements in fig 4 for fife 87 and 88 as shown there is a good agreement between the estimations and measurements and they mostly fall around the 1 1 line for fife 1987 1988 the rmse of half hourly h le and g estimates is 33 33 wm 2 43 43 wm 2 67 19 wm 2 72 02 wm 2 and 60 03 wm 2 80 93 wm 2 respectively in fife 87 88 the mae is 27 17 wm 2 33 65 wm 2 55 57 wm 2 54 22 wm 2 and 46 37 wm 2 60 29 wm 2 for half hourly sensible latent and ground heat fluxes respectively the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates from bateni et al 2013a tajfar et al 2019 and this study are compared in table 5 for fife 87 and 88 as can be seen the rmses of turbulent heat fluxes estimates from this study are smaller than those of bateni et al 2013a and tajfar et al 2019 the new vda system decreases the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates for year 1987 1988 by 10 1 10 6 and 17 2 16 2 compared to bateni et al 2013a and 13 7 10 3 and 20 9 16 9 compared to tajfar et al 2019 the rmse of half hourly g estimates from this study is 60 03 wm 2 and 80 93 wm 2 for fife 87 and 88 which is 50 9 and 28 6 lower than the rmse of 122 14 wm 2 and 113 29 wm 2 from tajfar et al 2019 this happens because g is directly related to the gradient of lst via g p dt dz z 0 therefore assimilating sequences of lst observations into the heat diffusion equation can constrain the ground heat flux leading to a significant improvement in the g estimates the results show that the vda approach can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of lst measurements to significantly improve the ground heat flux estimates compared to tajfar et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 the mae and rmse of le retrievals are higher than those of h estimates this is due to the fact that the uncertainty in h estimates results from errors in the estimated chn and lst values equation 5 whereas the uncertainty of le retrievals is due to errors in the chn lst and ef estimates eq 7b more sources of errors increase the uncertainty of le estimates moreover g retrievals are not as good as h and le estimates this happens because g is calculated as the residual of the seb equation i e g r n h l e thus uncertainties in the h and le estimates propagate into g retrievals which lead to more errors in g estimations figs 5 and 6 show time series of daily h and le estimates for fife 87 and 88 respectively as indicated both the magnitude and day to day fluctuations of measured sensible and latent heat fluxes are captured well by the estimations from the vda approach for example in fife 87 the estimated h le can capture the rising falling pattern of h le measurements during the dry down period i e julian days 190 214 moreover sharp jumps and drops in observations are reflected well in estimations in both fife 87 and 88 for fife 87 the rmse of daytime average h and le estimates from the vda approach are 21 80 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 respectively corresponding rmse values for fife 88 are 22 10 wm 2 and 36 89 wm 2 for fife 87 88 daily h and le estimates from this study are improved by 12 5 17 8 and 24 4 22 0 compared to bateni et al 2013a and 15 2 20 4 and 26 7 23 5 compared to tajfar et al 2019 time series of half hourly estimated and observed sensible and latent heat fluxes for julian days 178 207 fife 87 are compared in fig 7 as shown in this figure the magnitude and phase of retrieved and observed h and le agree well for all days implying that the vda approach can estimate turbulent heat fluxes accurately the vda approach retrieves chn and ef by minimizing the difference between the lst estimates from eq 1 and observations i e t and t obs as well as the misfit between the estimated potential temperature and specific humidity from eqs 8a and 8b i e θ and q and the corresponding values i e θ sl and q sl obtained from the measured reference level air temperature and specific humidity via the most see appendix b fig 8 shows that there is a good agreement between the half hourly t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl for fife 87 and 88 implying that the vda framework is able to efficiently optimize the two key unknown parameters of the vda approach chn and ef by minimizing the misfit terms in the objective function for fife 87 the rmses of lst θ and q estimates are respectively 1 19 k 2 23 k and 0 0017 kg kg corresponding values for fife 88 are 1 32 k 2 06 k and 0 0014 kg kg the uncertainty of lst θ and q estimates is mostly because of the measurement errors and simplistic assumptions e g constant daily ef and monthly chn insignificant advection and convectively well mixed boundary layer which results in constant profiles of potential temperature and specific humidity with height the rmse and mae of estimated θ and q values from this study are compared with those of tajfar et al 2019 for fife 87 and 88 table 6 similarly table 7 compares the rmse and mae of t estimates from this study with those of bateni et al 2013a it should be noted that bateni et al 2013a assimilated only lst observations into the heat diffusion equation and thus it provided the rmse and mae of lst estimates also tajfar et al 2019 assimilated only air temperature and specific humidity into an abl model and therefore it generated the rmse and mae of θ and q estimates only the rmse and mae of θ and q estimates from this study are lower than those of tajfar et al 2019 the rmse of θ and q are reduced respectively by 16 8 12 5 and 11 6 10 8 for fife 87 88 the rmse of estimated lst values from this study is also smaller than that of bateni et al 2013a resulting in an improvement of 30 0 37 4 for fife 87 88 similarly for fife 87 88 the mae of t estimates is 0 89 k 1 02 k which is 31 5 36 7 lower than the mae of 1 30 k 1 61 k from bateni et al 2013a these outcomes indicate that the new vda approach can provide more accurate chn and ef estimates as the model finds optimum values of chn and ef by minimizing the misfits between t and t obs θ and θ sl and q and q sl the mean diurnal cycles of observed and estimated sensible latent and ground heat fluxes as well as net radiation from this study and tajfar et al 2019 are shown in fig 9 for fife 87 and 88 as can be seen there is a remarkable difference between the diurnal cycles of observed and estimated ground heat flux from tajfar et al 2019 g is directly related to the lst via g p dt dz tajfar et al 2019 did not assimilate the sequences of lst observations and consequently could not capture the diurnal cycle of ground heat flux by assimilating lst measurements into the heat diffusion equation in this study the diurnal cycle of predicted ground heat flux is improved significantly assimilating sequences of lst observations into the heat diffusion equation also improves the diurnal cycles of latent heat flux for fife 87 and net radiation for fife 88 as explained in section 3 the h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values that lead to a minimum objective function are used in this study on the other hand the radiosonde measurements of the abovementioned variables are available at the fife site 1987 for julian days 155 156 176 177 178 187 227 228 and 229 the turbulent heat fluxes estimates by using the optimized and measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values in the vda approach are compared in fig 10 as shown the h and le estimates from the aforementioned measured variables are slightly closer to the observations according to table 8 by utilizing the measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values in the vda approach the rmse of daily h le estimates decreases from 27 66 w m 2 to 25 03 w m 2 31 15 w m 2 to 28 48 w m 2 leading to an improvement of 9 5 8 6 the results show that utilizing the measured h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values rather than the calibrated ones only slightly improve the turbulent heat fluxes estimates therefore the vda approach can provide accurate estimates of h and le by using the optimized h t o γ θ γ q δ θ t o and δ q t o values radiosonde measurements of mixed layer potential temperature θ specific humidity q and height h over the fife site during summer 87 are used to validate the corresponding estimations from the vda approach fig 11 a i compare the estimated mixed layer height specific humidity and potential temperature from the vda approach with those obtained from the radiosonde for 15 17 august 1987 the error bars show the error in defining the depth averaged mixed layer values from the radiosondes margulis and entekhabi 2001 on august 15 fig 11a c the abl height potential temperature and specific humidity grow throughout the day the model estimates capture the increasing trend of the radiosonde data and agree well with them on august 16 fig 11d f the measured abl height and potential temperature increase but abl specific humidity does not show a clear trend during the course of the day the abl height and potential temperature estimates rise during the day and are consistent with the radiosonde data in terms of magnitude and daily variation the model estimations can also capture the daily variations in the abl specific humidity measurements on august 17 fig 11g i the estimations capture the rising patterns in θ q and h the small discrepancies between model estimates and radiosonde data can be because of the fact that the radiosonde point observations might not be representative of a spatial average over for the fife site margulis 2002 the simplistic assumptions of daily constant ef and monthly constant chn and noise in the input data these sources of errors make the comparison between the model estimates and measurements difficult margulis and entekhabi 2001 similar results are obtained for other cloud free days in june 1987 where the radiosonde measurements are available not shown herein overall the results of this study show that the developed vda approach can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of both land surface and atmosphere state variables i e lst ta and qa to retrieve the signature of relative partitioning of available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes as well as the abl potential temperature humidity and height the findings also indicate that the magnitude and phase of retrieved and observed h and le agree well for all days implying that the vda approach can accurately estimate turbulent heat fluxes the outcomes illustrate that the synergistic assimilation of lst ta and qa into the vda approach improves sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates compared to the previous studies in which either lst or ta and qa were assimilated several sensitivity tests are conducted at fife 87 to evaluate the effect of uncertainties in lst air temperature and specific humidity measurements on the turbulent fluxes estimates in the first set of numerical experiments lst measurements are changed by 1 2 3 and 4 k from their nominal values and are assimilated in the vda approach to predict turbulent heat fluxes fig 12 shows the sensitivity of h and le estimates to uncertainties in lst observations increasing lst by 1 2 3 and 4 k results in a 9 53 15 33 22 87 and 27 43 increase in h and a 13 62 18 4 25 43 and 29 03 decrease in le on the other hand decreasing lst by 1 2 3 and 4 k leads to a 8 91 13 78 20 56 and 25 78 reduction in h and a 12 69 17 34 22 17 and 28 56 rise in le in the second set of numerical experiments air temperature measurements are varied by 1 2 3 and 4 k from their nominal values as shown in fig 13 increasing air temperature observations by 1 2 3 and 4 k causes a 6 43 10 16 21 69 and 25 52 reduction in h and a 9 46 16 76 22 21 and 26 56 increase in le however decreasing air temperature observations by 1 2 3 and 4 k leads to a 4 68 12 93 21 89 and 27 71 increase in h and a 7 01 20 56 27 73 and 29 22 reduction in le finally in the third set of tests specific humidity observations are changed by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 according to fig 14 increasing specific humidity by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 yields a 3 02 5 91 8 75 and 11 54 increase in the h estimates and a 3 42 6 69 9 90 and 13 05 decrease in the le estimates on the other hand decreasing specific humidity observations by 0 5 10 3 1 10 3 1 5 10 3 and 2 10 3 kg kg 1 causes a 2 94 5 99 9 12 and 12 32 reduction in the h estimates and a 3 35 6 84 10 41 and 14 08 growth in the le estimates to examine the effect of noise in the initial condition of soil temperature on the turbulent heat fluxes estimates four synthetic screening tests are conducted in these tests specified errors with normal distribution are added to the initial condition of soil temperature in the first and second tests positive noises with the mean μ of 2 k and standard deviations σ of 1 k and 2 k are added to the initial condition in the third and fourth tests negative noises with the mean of 2 k and standard deviation of 1 k and 2 k are added to the initial condition the rmses of turbulent heat fluxes estimates from the synthetic tests positively and negatively noised initial condition are compared with those of the original case non noisy initial condition for fife 87 in table 9 as can be seen the added noise to the initial condition of soil temperature only slightly degrades performance of the vda approach for example the positive noise with μ 2 k and σ 1 k increases the rmse of half hourly h and le estimates by 1 27 and 2 92 respectively similarly the negative noise with μ 2 k and σ 1 k increases the corresponding rmses by 4 39 and 2 78 respectively this happens because the vda approach can map the lst estimates onto the observations even if there is a bias in the initial condition of soil temperature 5 conclusion the sequences of land surface temperature as the state variable of land surface and reference level air temperature and specific humidity as the state variables of atmosphere measurements are assimilated into a coupled land surface atmospheric boundary layer abl model within a variational data assimilation vda approach to estimate surface heat fluxes the main unknown parameters of the vda system are neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient chn and evaporative fraction ef the vda approach is tested at the first islscp international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife site in summer 1987 and 1988 the results show that the developed vda scheme can accurately estimate the sensible h and latent le heat fluxes the root mean square errors rmses of half hourly h and le estimates are 33 33 wm 2 43 43 wm 2 and 67 19 wm 2 72 02 wm 2 for fife 87 88 these rmses are compared to those of bateni et al 2013a that assimilated only lst and tajfar et al 2019 that assimilated only reference level air temperature and specific humidity the results indicate that there is an improvement in the turbulent heat fluxes estimates due to the synergistic assimilation of sequences of lst air temperature and specific humidity for fife 87 88 the rmses of half hourly h and le estimates are decreased respectively by 13 7 10 3 and 24 6 16 9 compared to tajfar et al 2019 and 10 1 10 6 and 17 2 16 2 compared to bateni et al 2013a time series of half hourly and daily h and le estimates from the vda approach agree well with the observations both in terms of magnitude and day to day fluctuations for fife 87 88 the rmses of daily h and le estimates from this study are 21 80 wm 2 22 10 wm 2 and 39 32 wm 2 36 89 wm 2 which are improved by 15 2 20 4 and 26 7 23 5 compared to tajfar et al 2019 and 12 5 17 8 and 24 4 22 0 compared to bateni et al 2013a for fife 87 88 the rmses of estimated land surface temperature and abl specific humidity q and potential temperature θ are respectively 1 19 k 1 32 k 0 0017 kg kg 0 0014 kg kg and 2 23 k 2 06 k compared to tajfar et al 2019 this study reduces the rmses of θ and q estimates by 16 8 12 5 and 11 6 10 8 for fife 87 88 also compared to bateni et al 2013a the rmse of lst estimates is reduced by 30 0 37 4 for fife 87 88 these findings indicate that the new vda scheme can take advantage of the implicit information in the sequences of both land surface and atmosphere state variables i e land surface temperature and reference level air temperature and specific humidity to retrieve the signature of relative partitioning of available energy between the turbulent heat fluxes the abl height potential temperature and specific humidity estimates from the vda approach are reasonably close to the radiosonde observations and can capture their diurnal variations future studies should be directed towards 1 testing the developed vda over large scale domains using remote sensing data 2
