17915,it has been difficult in satellite remote sensing to derive accurate water optical biological and biogeochemical products over high altitude inland waters due to issues in satellite data processing i e atmospheric correction in this study we demonstrate that accurate normalized water leaving radiance spectra nl w λ can be derived for a high altitude lake lake tahoe using improved rayleigh radiance computations wang m opt express 24 12414 12429 2016 which accurately account for water surface altitude effects in the multi sensor level 1 to level 2 msl12 ocean color data processing system satellite observations from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs onboard the suomi national polar orbiting partnership snpp between 2012 and 2018 are used to evaluate and validate satellite derived nl w λ spectra and to quantitatively characterize water properties in the lake results show that viirs derived nl w λ spectra are quite comparable with those from the in situ measurements subsequent retrievals of water biological and biogeochemical products show that chlorophyll a chl a concentration and secchi depth sd are reasonably well estimated and captured normal seasonal variations in the lake e g the annual highest chl a and sd normally occur in the winter while the lowest occur in the summer which is consistent with in situ measurements interannual variability of these water quality parameters is also observed in particular lake tahoe experienced a significant environmental anomaly associated with an extreme weather condition event in 2017 showing considerably decreased nl w λ at the spectral bands of 410 443 and 486 nm and significantly reduced sd values in the entire lake the low sd measurements from viirs are consistent with in situ

optical properties 1 introduction located at an altitude of 1897 m between california and nevada in the u s lake tahoe fig 1 is a large fresh water lake and is renowned for its water clarity it is the second deepest lake after crater lake in southern oregon in the u s with a length of 35 km width of 19 km average depth of 333 m surface area of about 490 km2 and total volume of approximately 156 km3 there are 63 tributaries that provide half of the water supply to lake tahoe which has a drainage area of about the same size as the lake the evaporation in the region accounts for about two thirds of the total water mass leaving the lake and the other one third is through the lake s only outlet the truckee river in the lake tahoe region the climate is characterized by warm dry summers and chilly winters with an average daily maximum temperature of 25 5 c in july and an average daily minimum temperature of 4 6 c in december the lake serves as an important resource for the regional economy by attracting tourists from all over the world throughout the year with its winter sports summer recreations and other activities and events thus the conservation of lake water quality and the surrounding environment has drawn major political scientific and public interest in the region lake tahoe has a long history of water clarity monitoring using secchi depth sd measurements back to the 1960s goldman 2000 jassby et al 1999 in the last five decades according to the 2018 tahoe environmental research center report terc 2018 the water clarity in terms of the sd declined consistently from 30 m in the mid 1960s to 20 m in recent years terc 2018 the sd decline can be attributed to increased phytoplankton concentration and the amount of fine sediment particles in the lake jassby et al 1999 2003 seasonally one of the sd minimums occurs in june due to increased suspended sediment discharges with the melting of snowpack and another sd minimum occurs in december primarily as a result of mixed layer deepening jassby et al 1999 the long term sd model also shows that the interannual variability of sd in the lake can be driven by weather changes such as precipitation anomalies in the region jassby et al 2003 in addition lake tahoe shows a long term warming trend due to the upward trend of air temperature and incoming longwave radiation in the region coats et al 2006 indeed the volume weighted mean temperature increased about 0 015 c year between 1970 and 2002 the thermal structure of the lake also shows changes e g the decreasing depth of the thermocline and the increase of resistance of the water in the lake to vertical layer mixing and stratification coats et al 2006 sahoo et al 2016 in lake tahoe both upwelling and surface circulation are observed and characterized with satellite remote sensing from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster hook et al 2007 tonooka and palluconi 2005 tonooka et al 2005 the landsat enhanced thematic mapper etm barsi et al 2007 hook et al 2004 and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis hook et al 2007 the upwelling of the intermediate depth water was observed to occur frequently in the spring and summer seasons it brings the water from the depth of 10 30 m to the surface and leads to enhanced phytoplankton growth and decreased water clarity in lake tahoe steissberg et al 2005 as one of the main drivers of the water clarity trend in lake tahoe the rate of phytoplankton growth has been steadily increasing over the past 50 years indeed primary productivity increased from 50 g c m 2 year 1 in 1959 to 200 g c m 2 year 1 in recent years terc 2018 in addition the aerosol deposition provides most of the nutrients in the dissolved inorganic particles and total nitrogen as well as a significant amount of the total phosphorus loading in lake tahoe jassby et al 1994 in fact the annual nitrogen n phosphorous p and particular matter pm from the aerosol deposition in the lake are estimated to be about 185 3 and 755 metric tons dolislager et al 2012 respectively indeed these nutrients from the aerosol deposition contributed to the long term increase of chl a concentration water primary productivity and biomass in lake tahoe mackey et al 2013 specifically it has been found that the phytoplankton amount in lake tahoe is becoming phosphorus limited from the nitrogen limited because the deposited aerosols in the lake contain nutrients with high n p ratios chang et al 1992 mackey et al 2013 however it is noted that in addition to the phosphorous limitation phytoplankton growth in lake tahoe is also iron limited chang et al 1992 in situ water optics measurements have long been conducted to characterize and quantify optical and bio optical properties in lake tahoe the spectral irradiance and beam transmittance were measured as a function of water depth in the lake smith et al 1973 a blue color index was also developed using the remote sensing reflectance r rs λ measurements to quantitatively analyze the spatial and seasonal variations watanabe et al 2016 it is noted that the remote sensing reflectance r rs λ as a function of the wavelength λ is defined as r rs λ nl w λ f 0 λ where nl w λ and f 0 λ are the normalized water leaving radiance gordon 2005 morel and gentili 1996 wang 2006 and the mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance thuillier et al 2003 respectively as an oligotrophic subalpine lake the role of ultraviolet uv radiation and the patterns of spatial and temporal variability of uv transparency were investigated rose et al 2009 it was found that uv transparency differs from the photosynthetically available radiation par in fact the combination of the uv and visible water transparency can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem changes and the biological and biogeochemical processes in lake tahoe rose et al 2009 satellite observations over global inland waters can provide an effective tool to monitor the lake environmental changes such as algae bloom and water clarity using the shortwave infrared swir based atmospheric correction algorithm wang 2007 wang and shi 2005 2007 wang et al 2009b it has been demonstrated that modis derived water optical property data e g nl w λ spectra can be used to monitor and assess water property quality in turbid lake taihu in china wang et al 2011 the spatial and temporal water turbidity variations in lake okeechobee are also characterized using modis measurements wang et al 2012a furthermore the cyanobacteria blooms in lake taihu are quantitatively assessed and evaluated from modis observations hu et al 2010 in addition to water optical parameters such as nl w λ spectra lake surface temperature and many other water quality parameters such as the water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm k d 490 lee et al 2005 wang et al 2009a chl a concentrations hu et al 2012 o reilly et al 1998 o reilly and werdell 2019 wang and son 2016 total suspended matter tsm or suspended particulate matter spm concentrations knaeps et al 2015 nechad et al 2010 shi et al 2018 yu et al 2019 sd binding et al 2015 lee et al 2016 float algae index hu 2009 and inherent optical properties iops lee et al 2002 shi et al 2019 werdell et al 2013 can also be routinely and reliably derived from satellite remote sensing observations these satellite water quality property data can be further used to study global lakes to characterize and quantify the long term water physical optical biological and biogeochemical variability bolgrien and brooks 1992 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2018 son and wang 2019 in all of these studies however satellite reflective solar radiance data water color are applied almost all to global around sea level inland waters lake tahoe has long been used as one of the sites for validation of the absolute radiometric calibration and surface geophysical products derived from various satellite sensors mostly for thermal bands and their corresponding applications such as aster modis landsat 5 and etm barsi et al 2007 hook et al 2007 steissberg et al 2005 tonooka and palluconi 2005 tonooka et al 2005 as well as for the sensor preflight and inflight calibration parada et al 1997 thome et al 1998 however few satellite reflective solar radiance observations have ever been used to characterize and quantify the lake ecosystem and monitor water optical biological and biogeochemical changes this is mainly due to issues in the satellite data processing i e atmospheric correction gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 to accurately account for the effect of lake surface altitude wang 2016 specifically the top of atmosphere toa rayleigh scattering radiance computations were incorrect for high altitude lakes wang 2016 leading to over subtraction of the toa rayleigh scattering radiance contributions and thereby deriving biased low nl w λ spectra often negative values depending on the lake surface altitude gordon and wang 1994 wang 2016 consequently satellite derived optical biological and biogeochemical products e g chl a k d 490 sd iops or any other products that use the inputs of satellite measured nl w λ spectra for global high altitude lakes were in error and generally cannot be used this includes satellite derived water quality products over global high altitude lakes from the sea viewing wide field view sensor seawifs modis and the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs etc it is noted that for global ocean color data processing the required ancillary data such as sea level atmospheric pressure total column ozone amount sea surface wind speed and total column water vapor amount are routinely obtained from the national center for environmental prediction ncep ramachandran and wang 2011 following a recent effort for improving the toa rayleigh radiance computations for satellite ocean water color remote sensing in particular for accounting for the water surface altitude effect wang 2016 the global viirs observations on both the suomi national polar orbiting partnership snpp and noaa 20 satellites are processed using the improved rayleigh radiance computations in the multi sensor level 1 to level 2 msl12 ocean color data processing system wang et al 2013 in this study we use lake tahoe as an example to demonstrate that high quality nl w λ spectra can now be derived from viirs measurements for global high altitude lakes to characterize and quantify the lake ecosystem as well as monitor environmental changes specifically viirs snpp derived nl w λ spectra are compared with those from the in situ measurements and shown to have good results furthermore based on the in situ sd measurements in the lake a regional empirical sd algorithm has been developed using the viirs derived nl w λ at the wavelength of 551 nm therefore the seasonal and interannual variabilities of nl w λ chl a and sd in lake tahoe are characterized and quantified in particular we show that when using viirs derived water property data the anomalous water property in lake tahoe during the 2017 2018 abnormal event can be quantitatively investigated and analyzed finally the potential to use lake tahoe as an ocean color validation site for evaluation and validation of satellite ocean color products as well as routine sensor performance monitoring wang et al 2015 is discussed 2 satellite derived and in situ measured water properties in lake tahoe 2 1 viirs measured nlw λ spectra and other water color products successfully launched in october 2011 viirs snpp provides continuous observations of the earth s atmosphere land cryosphere and ocean properties with the 14 reflective solar bands rsbs covering a spectral range of 410 2257 nm goldberg et al 2013 for the satellite ocean and inland water color remote sensing the viirs snpp five visible bands m1 m5 at the nominal central wavelengths of 410 443 486 551 and 671 nm two imaging i bands i1 and i2 at 638 and 862 nm two near infrared nir bands m6 and m7 at 745 and 862 nm and three swir bands m8 m10 and m11 at 1238 1601 and 2257 nm are used to derive viirs nl w λ spectra over the global ocean and coastal inland waters wang and jiang 2018b wang et al 2013 it is noted that viirs measurements have spatial resolutions of 750 m and 375 m for the m bands and i bands respectively thus viirs derived nl w λ spectra at the spatial resolution of 750 m are applicable for global open oceans wang et al 2016a while nl w λ at the image bands e g nl w 638 data with the spatial resolution of 375 m are useful for various coastal and inland water applications wang and jiang 2018b viirs global ocean and inland water color products have been routinely generated since 2012 using msl12 which was originally developed for producing consistent global ocean color data sets from multiple satellite sensors using a common data processing software wang 1999 wang et al 2002 it should be noted that for deriving accurate global ocean color products the on orbit vicarious calibration has been carried out for viirs using the in situ moby measurements clark et al 1997 in the waters off hawaii wang et al 2016b during the viirs period msl12 has been significantly modified and improved including an atmospheric correction algorithm jiang and wang 2014 wang and jiang 2018a wang et al 2012b cloud masking using the swir bands wang and shi 2006 straylight and cloud shadowing detection including the adjacency effect bulgarelli et al 2017 hu et al 2020 jiang and wang 2013 as well as improved satellite algorithms for various ocean water color products e g chl a wang and son 2016 k d 490 wang et al 2009a iops shi and wang 2019 data quality assurance qa wei et al 2016 etc in particular improved toa rayleigh radiance computations for accurately accounting for the effects of high altitude inland waters have been developed and implemented in msl12 wang 2016 it should be noted that in the msl12 ocean water color data processing the atmospheric diffuse transmittance ioccg 2010 yang and gordon 1997 has also been modified to account for the high altitude lake surface atmospheric pressure changes i e accounting for the rayleigh optical thickness variations for both the solar and viewing directions this is also an important fact impacted directly by the rayleigh optical thickness variation due to significant atmospheric pressure changes over high altitude lakes ioccg 2010 however it is assumed that there is negligible change in the rayleigh aerosol interaction radiance term gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 in the viirs data processing for a high altitude lake it should also be noted that viirs derived ocean color products have been well evaluated and validated over various ocean regions and some sea level inland waters through presentations in various conferences meetings and workshops as well as publications barnes et al 2019 hlaing et al 2013 mikelsons et al 2020 wang et al 2016a however viirs derived inland water quality products have not been evaluated over any high altitude lakes such as lake tahoe one of the important issues for deriving accurate water property data over high altitude inland waters from remote sensing is to accurately account for the water surface altitude effect in the toa rayleigh radiance computations wang 2016 in addition to various other challenges related to the data processing over global sea level waters this problem existed in previous satellite ocean color data processing which assumed the sea level water surface property i e atmospheric pressure measured and used at the sea level gordon et al 1988a wang 2002 2005 for high altitude lakes such as lake tahoe this leads to an over estimation of the toa spectral rayleigh radiance contributions therefore over subtractions of rayleigh radiance values in atmospheric correction thereby deriving biased low nl w λ spectra or even negative values gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 for example the ratio of the surface atmospheric pressure at 2 km altitude to that at sea level is about 0 78 i e the toa rayleigh scattering radiance values over a 2 km altitude lake have an approximately similar factor smaller than those over the sea level lakes wang 2016 in fact for high altitude inland waters the accurate calculation of the toa spectral rayleigh scattering radiances is really important particularly for the short visible bands because the toa radiances contributed from aerosols are usually less important because aerosols are mostly located close to sea level e g within 2 km with the improved toa rayleigh radiance computation in msl12 wang 2016 the effects of high altitude lakes i e significantly low atmospheric pressure and therefore reduced spectral rayleigh optical thicknesses are accurately accounted for therefore water property data can be derived accurately over global high altitude waters including lake tahoe 2 2 in situ measured nlw λ spectra as nasa s calibration site four permanent moored buoys located at different locations in lake tahoe routinely make in situ measurements such as longwave and shortwave radiations wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure aerosol optical depth aod and water skin temperature https laketahoe jpl nasa gov measurements specifically the moored buoy at the tb3 station as noted in fig 1 is located at 39 06 37 n 120 04 31 w hyperspectral radiance measurements in the wavelength range of 360 nm 875 nm were taken with the hyperspectral radiometers installed at above water surface 0 m 2 m and 9 m depths on the tb3 buoy each radiometer measured the downward spectral irradiance e d λ z and upward spectral radiance l u λ z as a function of water depth z measurements were made hourly from local time 6 00 to 19 00 the water attenuation coefficient for l u λ z was then calculated and consequently l u λ 0 calculated from l u λ 0 was estimated finally the remote sensing reflectance spectra r rs λ were calculated with l u λ 0 and e d λ 0 watanabe et al 2016 during 2013 in situ in water radiometric profile data were also taken at the tb3 station and mid lake stations with another vertical profiling hyperspectral radiometer system within 2 h of the local solar noon on march 1 april 28 july 25 september 9 october 25 and december 16 remote sensing reflectance spectra r rs λ were then calculated from the measurements of the subsurface upward spectral radiance l u λ 0 and the downward spectral irradiance e d λ 0 watanabe et al 2016 a total of 14 in situ r rs λ spectra measurements as described above at the station tb3 in the lake were shown in watanabe et al 2016 specifically these in situ r rs λ spectra covered a time period from december 16 2013 to april 15 2015 in this study these 14 in situ r rs λ spectra acquired at the tb3 station in lake tahoe fig 1 were converted to in situ nl w λ spectra to further compare evaluate and validate viirs derived nl w λ spectra in addition to the in situ radiometric measurements at the tb3 station continuous water quality monitoring has been routinely conducted since 1968 the sd and chl a at the depths of 0 10 50 100 m have been sampled routinely approximately every 34 days at the mid lake tahoe productivity mltp station located at 39 8 30 n 120 00 55 5 w noted in fig 1 the in situ sd measurements and coincident viirs derived nl w λ at the green band 551 nm can be used to develop an empirical algorithm to derive sd binding et al 2008 the temporal variations of viirs derived chl a and sd data at the mltp station are compared with those from the in situ measurements to evaluate satellite algorithms performance for these two important water property products 3 results 3 1 viirs derived nlw λ spectra compared with those from in situ measurements there are 10 out of 14 radiance matchups for viirs snpp derived and in situ measured nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station on the same date in lake tahoe to compare the viirs snpp derived and in situ measured nl w λ a box of 7 7 pixels remapped with a box about 1 1 km2 centered at the tb3 station in the remapped nl w λ image was set and the median of nl w λ values in the box was calculated as the viirs derived nl w λ value in order to compare with the in situ nl w λ spectra there were four cases with the cloud cover when viirs snpp passed over the tb3 station preventing the production of valid viirs nl w λ spectra fig 2 provides examples of comparative results between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station on june 15 2013 fig 2a july 15 2013 fig 2b august 15 2013 fig 2c and september 15 2013 fig 2d the comparisons in fig 2 show that viirs derived nl w λ spectra match quite well with those from the in situ measurements and the two data sets are generally consistent fig 2 however there are some minor differences in the matchups in nl w λ as viirs derived nl w 410 and nl w 443 are slightly biased low on june 15 2013 relative to those from the in situ measurements overall results in fig 2 demonstrate that viirs derived nl w λ spectra using the improved new rayleigh radiance computation in msl12 are generally accurate showing significant improvements compared to those with incorrect rayleigh radiance computations for global high altitude lakes i e significantly biased low nl w λ values and even negative at the blue bands the overall accuracy of viirs derived nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station is further evaluated fig 3 since lake tahoe has high water clarity values of nl w 638 and nl w 671 are generally very small close to zero differences in matchups for nl w 638 and nl w 671 are significantly amplified in the logarithmic scale as shown in fig 3 although the differences are actually trivial for nl w λ at the blue and green bands wavelengths at 410 443 486 and 551 nm viirs derived nl w λ data agree quite well with the in situ measurements with the mean nl w λ ratio value between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ of 0 999 and the coefficient of determination r 2 between the two data sets in linear scale of 0 857 specifically the mean nl w λ ratio values between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ at the viirs wavelengths of 410 443 486 551 638 and 671 nm are 1 019 0 936 1 076 0 967 1 297 and 1 286 respectively while the mean nl w λ absolute difference values between the two for the corresponding six viirs bands are 0 124 0 109 0 078 0 037 0 023 and 0 024 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 respectively it should be noted again that for small values such as nl w λ at the viirs red bands 638 and 671 nm the mean absolute difference is a better and more meaningful measure for describing the uncertainty in fact it shows the smallest mean absolute difference values for nl w λ at the red bands although the nl w λ ratios at these bands are the largest due to very small values results in figs 2 and 3 confirm that high quality nl w λ spectra can be derived from viirs snpp observations over lake tahoe therefore the lake water optical biological and biogeochemical property data e g chl a and sd can be derived from viirs snpp measured nl w λ spectra and these data can be used to study the lake water property dynamics characterize and quantify the long term ecosystem variability monitor environmental change and detect hazardous events over the global high altitude lakes these possibilities and potentials are evaluated and discussed below 3 2 viirs derived sd and chl a compared with the in situ data in lake tahoe the sd variations are correlated to the amount of fine sediment in the water column jassby et al 1999 2003 loading and settling rates of such fine inorganic particles 16 μm in diameter were found to have the largest impact on the lake clarity sahoo et al 2010 considering the fact that nl w λ at the red end of the spectrum 638 and 671 nm are usually close to zero for the lake nl w 551 can be a sensitive indicator for the inorganic particle concentrations and correlate with water clarity indeed binding et al 2015 showed that the sd in the great lakes can be well correlated to satellite derived nl w 551 values at the mltp station in lake tahoe fig 1 there are total of 57 valid viirs nl w λ retrievals coincident with the in situ sd measurements in the period between 2012 and 2018 using these 57 sets of data an empirical sd model for the lake can then be developed and described as following 1 s d 10 a 0 a 1 n l w 551 where coefficients a 0 1 484 and a 1 0 551 mw 1 cm2 μm sr which were derived from the best fit to the in situ sd data to viirs derived nl w 551 fig 4 shows a comparison between the viirs derived using eq 1 and in situ measured sd at the mltp station the mean and median ratios of the viirs derived sd and in situ values are 1 0649 and 1 0365 with the standard deviation std of 0 1969 the comparison results fig 4 show that viirs derived sd data are quite reasonable and can be used to estimate water clarity in the lake from satellite observations fig 5 further provides the performance evaluation of viirs derived chl a fig 5a and sd fig 5b with the corresponding in situ measurements at the mltp station during the period of 2012 2018 viirs derived chl a data show the same seasonal trend as that from the in situ chl a measurements i e high chl a in the winter and low chl a in the summer it should be noted that in situ chl a data were derived as mean values from measured chl a data at the surface and at 10 m water depth considering sd values are normally between 20 and 30 m therefore excluding in situ chl a data at 50 and 100 m results show that viirs derived low chl a values in the mltp station are 0 2 mg m 3 and consistent with those from in situ data however some discrepancies between viirs derived and in situ measured chl a can be found for high chl a values in the winter season for example viirs derived chl a had the same peaks as the in situ measurements in the winters of 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2017 2018 viirs derived chl a was particularly different from the in situ data in the winter of 2016 2017 fig 5a viirs derived sd data in the mltp station show the same seasonal and interannual variations as those from the in situ sd measurements fig 5b in the period between 2012 and 2016 viirs derived sd data were consistent with the in situ measurements in terms of both the magnitude and seasonal variation however relatively large sd discrepancies between them were found with anomalously low in situ sd measurements in mid 2016 and late 2017 although the sd seasonal variation from the two sd data sets was still the same although there are some disagreements in the magnitude for viirs and in situ measured sd figs 4 and 5b and chl a fig 5a results are generally consistent in terms of magnitude values and particularly in their variations it should be noted that the in situ sd and chl a measurements also have their own uncertainties due to the instrument limitations and the operation differences e g human factors for the sd estimation these uncertainties also contribute to the differences between viirs and in situ measured chl a and sd data therefore we can conclude that viirs derived chl a and sd data have reasonably good accuracy and these data products along with viirs derived nl w λ spectra can be used to study water properties in lake tahoe 3 3 viirs measured climatology of nlw λ chl a and sd noticeably there are some significant differences in viirs derived water property data in 2017 and early 2018 compared with those in the other years indeed an anomalous event happened in the period of 2017 to early 2018 in the region and significantly impacted water properties in lake tahoe staff report 2018 therefore for the calculations of climatology water properties in the lake viirs measurements from 2012 to 2016 excluding years 2017 and 2018 are used fig 6 provides the climatology images of nl w 410 fig 6a nl w 443 fig 6b nl w 486 fig 6c nl w 551 fig 6d nl w 638 fig 6e nl w 671 fig 6f chl a fig 6g and sd fig 6h which were calculated as the median of all valid retrievals from viirs snpp measurements between 2012 and 2016 providing the normal water optical biological and biogeochemical conditions of the lake results from viirs observations show that lake tahoe features include spatial uniformity in water properties and enhanced nl w λ at the blue bands except for small areas in the southern and northwestern parts of the lake where water depth is less than 20 m fig 6 shows that spatial distributions of chl a sd and nl w λ in the lake are quite uniform and there is little spatial difference with normal chl a 0 25 mg m 3 and sd 22 m for the entire lake the changes of nl w λ spectra are also small across the lake for nl w λ at the all viirs bands in fact there is no specific spatial pattern for all climatology nl w λ spectra in the lake spectrally viirs derived nl w λ spectra show the typical feature of clear blue waters gordon et al 1988b morel and maritorena 2001 showing nl w 443 fig 6b 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 while nl w 410 fig 6a and nl w 486 fig 6c are a little bit less than nl w 443 in comparison the climatology nl w 551 fig 6d in the lake is 0 3 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 both nl w 638 fig 6e and nl w 671 fig 6f are less than 0 05 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 a transect line from the north to south across the lake is defined to further characterize the uniformity of the lake spatial distributions in nl w λ spectra chl a and sd fig 6a fig 7 provides quantitative results of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd as a function of distance from the north to south along the transect line noted in fig 6a fig 7a shows that climatology nl w 443 is generally stable at 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 from the north of the transect line to 20 km in the lake and it trends a little lower to 0 6 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 from 20 km to 30 km however climatology nl w 551 value 0 3 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 is quite stable and does not show any noticeable change along the transect line fig 7a in the southern end of the transect line the water type changes from a typical clear blue water to a typical shallow bottom affected water with significantly enhanced nl w λ in the visible bands fig 7a the variations of climatology chl a and sd along the transect line are shown in fig 7b chl a shows little variation with a value of 0 25 mg m 3 for the majority of the lake even though it increases slightly to 0 3 mg m 3 in the northern end region and spikes to over 1 0 mg m 3 in the southern end region figs 6g and 7b similarly sd is quite stable at 22 m for the majority of the transect line typical oligotrophic waters although decreased sd can be found in the coastal region of southern lake tahoe figs 6h and 7b it is noted that significantly enhanced chl a and nl w λ and reduced sd are observed in the southern coast of the lake fig 6 as well as in the southern end of the transect line fig 7 in fact viirs derived nl w λ spectra in the southern coastal region show effects like typical bottom affected water with significantly enhanced nl w λ spectra fig 6 although viirs derived nl w λ spectra in the region might still be valid with the nir swir combined atmospheric algorithm wang and shi 2007 the lake bottom reflectance contributions to the enhancements of the derived nl w λ spectra in the visible bands especially in the blue bands can indeed lead to large errors in viirs derived chl a and sd data in the southern end of the region thus viirs derived chl a and sd in the bottom impacted region may have significant errors and should not be considered valid 3 4 characterization of seasonal and interannual variability in water property seasonal variations of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd in lake tahoe are shown in fig 8 for nl w 443 fig 8a f k and p it reaches its peak value in the summer season fig 8f and the minimum occurs in the winter season fig 8p the seasonal change of nl w 551 fig 8b g l and q is relatively small but quite noticeable with highs in the summer and lows in the winter corresponding well to the seasonal variation in sd fig 8e j o and t as expected similarly the seasonal variation of nl w 671 in the lake is also very small fig 8c h m and r similar to the climatology results spatial variations of chl a in the lake for each season are generally small fig 8d i n and s the highest chl a value can be found in the winter fig 8s while the lowest chl a occurs in the summer fig 8i the seasonal change of sd is also noticeable with the lowest sd in the summer fig 8j and the highest sd in the winter fig 8t in addition fig 9 shows the interannual variations of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd from 2012 to 2018 viirs derived nl w 443 in 2017 fig 9z decreased remarkably as compared to the other years for the entire lake fig 9a f k p u and ee particularly in the southern region of the lake nl w 443 dropped to below 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 this indicates that there were increased amounts of absorbing components in the water column it is noted that the statistical results in fig 9 should be quite reliable although there may be errors in the viirs derived nl w λ spectra although nl w 443 increased in 2018 fig 9ee the values were still lower than those in the period of 2012 2016 unlike nl w 443 fig 9a f k p u z and ee the interannual variations of nl w 551 fig 9b g i q v aa and ff and nl w 671 fig 9c h m r w bb and gg were not significant not noticeable it is noted that viirs derived chl a values in 2017 and 2018 may be over estimated due to the chl a algorithm issue in dealing with the increased amount of inorganic suspended particles from high river runoff in that year thus viirs derived chl a values in 2017 and 2018 might be biased and therefore are not shown in fig 9 except for the years 2017 and 2018 the spatial distributions of chl a in the other six years fig 9d i n s and x are similar on the other hand different from the chl a interannual variation sd showed notable decreases in 2016 and 2017 fig 9y and dd in comparison to normal climatology sd values fig 6h and to those in the other years fig 9e j o t and ii in addition the seasonal and interannual variation in nl w λ spectra for the entire lake tahoe are quantitatively evaluated fig 10 fig 10a shows the clear seasonal change in nl w λ spectra specifically nl w 410 nl w 443 and nl w 486 values are the highest in the summer and the lowest in the winter in the spring season nl w λ spectrum is similar to the climatology fig 10a the seasonal differences in nl w 551 are smaller than those of the shorter wavebands but are still obvious with highs in the summer and lows in the winter reflecting the sd seasonal variation in the lake fig 5b it is noted again that nl w 638 and nl w 671 are both close to 0 for all four seasons the interannual variability of nl w λ spectra for lake tahoe is also significant fig 10b in particular the nl w λ spectrum in 2017 was abnormal and outlying showing significantly low values for nl w 410 nl w 443 and nl w 486 for example nl w 410 in 2017 was 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 compared to the normal value of 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 in the other years in 2018 the depression of nl w 410 was alleviated but still lower than those in the other normal years fig 10b shows that nl w λ spectra in 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 were all similar although some slight interannual variations did exist all of these seasonal and interannual variations in viirs derived nl w λ spectra are consistent with nl w λ spectral images as shown in figs 8 and 9 3 5 the 2017 2018 anomaly event in lake tahoe the interannual variability of water properties in lake tahoe in figs 9 and 10 shows that anomalous nl w λ spectra and sd occurred in 2017 and this abnormal event extended to 2018 specifically the median values of sd for the entire lake tahoe in each month between 2012 and 2018 were calculated to characterize and quantify the long term temporal variations and the environmental anomaly in 2017 the sd variation in lake tahoe between 2012 and 2018 is shown in fig 11 a the seasonal variation of sd was more pronounced in comparison to the interannual sd variation with sd ranging between 18 19 m and 23 24 m the lowest sd values were in the summers of 2013 2016 and 2017 after removing the seasonal sd variation fig 11b shows that sd anomaly dropped below 2 m in the spring of 2017 and kept negative sd anomaly values for the entire 2017 year consistent with the local media report staff report 2018 in comparison the negative sd anomaly values in 2013 and 2016 were mild and lasted only a couple of months the temporal variation of the sd anomaly in fig 11b clearly shows that 2017 is the year with the least water clarity in the studying period between 2012 and 2018 fig 12 provides the quantitative spatial image details of the temporal evolvements of nl w λ spectra and sd in the period from early 2017 to spring 2018 in the period between december 2016 and february 2017 all lake water properties fig 12a d were similar to those of climatology for the winter season fig 8p q r and t starting in the spring of 2017 march 2017 may 2017 the decreased nl w 443 fig 12e was found comparable to the typical nl w 443 in the same season fig 8a in the summer of 2017 june 2017 august 2017 nl w 443 fig 12i was significantly lower than the same season climatology nl w 443 fig 8f in the autumn of 2017 nl w 443 reached the lowest fig 12m it is also noted that sd in this season fig 12p was also lower than the sd climatology in the autumn fig 8o starting in the 2017 2018 winter season nl w λ and sd went back to normal fig 12q t although anomalous nl w 443 and sd were still remarkable in comparison to their typical values fig 8p q r and t in the spring of 2018 march 2018 may 2018 viirs snpp measured nl w λ and sd fig 12u x in the lake were fully recovered from the abnormal environmental event in 2017 indeed the lake s nl w λ and sd images in this period were similar to their typical ones fig 8a b c and e the water property anomaly in 2017 was observed also by the in situ water quality monitoring system and reported elsewhere terc 2018 the annual average of sd 18 2 m terc 2018 was the lowest value ever recorded since lake tahoe long term monitoring started in 1968 while the average sd in 2014 2015 and 2016 in the lake were 23 7 22 3 and 21 1 m respectively this anomalous environmental variation was attributed to the extreme weather and hydrologic events all related to climatic change in the region the total precipitation in the region was 175 cm in 2017 in comparison to amounts below 50 cm in 2014 and 2015 this high precipitation event led to high inflow carrying unusually high amount of sediments from surrounding tributaries as a result the concentrations of inorganic particles in the lake were elevated throughout the year causing observed low water clarity which is consistent with viirs snpp measurements the in situ chl a measurements did not show anomalous values in 2017 although the in situ chl a data exhibited relatively higher values in the winter however anomalous high chl a values were derived from viirs snpp measurements in 2017 which were associated with low nl w λ in the shorter wavebands 410 443 and 486 nm figs 9z and 10b and may be heavily affected by absorption of high concentrations of inorganic sediments brought by high inflow as discussed above this discrepancy likely due to the satellite chl a algorithm issue despite the reasonably good agreement of satellite derived and in situ measurements in normal years suggested the importance of improving the understanding of detailed properties of optically significant components in the water column and optical process of the lake for future biogeochemical monitoring with higher accuracy 4 discussions and conclusion in the last three decades satellite ocean color remote sensing e g seawifs modis viirs etc has been widely used in user communities for scientific researches and applications mcclain 2009 to understand global and regional water optical biological and biogeochemical properties and to evaluate their impact on climatic change natural hazards and various other environmental variations in fact satellite ocean color data have been playing a critical role to monitor and understand water quality over the global open ocean coastal and inland waters ioccg 2008 ioccg 2018 the toa rayleigh scattering radiance computations however exhibited a significant error in satellite measured global high altitude water property data due to an issue in atmospheric correction to accurately account for the effects of the high altitude water surface property i e surface atmospheric pressure the error resulted in considerably biased low nl w λ spectra which are often unusable for water property monitoring indeed there are few satellite water color remote sensing studies over high altitude lakes it was shown that with new improved rayleigh radiance computations wang 2016 satellite remote sensing can now routinely produce accurate and reliable water optical properties over high altitude lake tahoe similar to the well established remote sensing capability over global sea level inland bodies of water the present results demonstrated that the new computation method can derive accurate nl w λ spectra from high altitude inland waters it also showed that chl a and sd values estimated from nl w λ spectra were reasonable therefore satellite measured nl w λ spectra chl a sd and potentially other related products can be effectively used to characterize spatial and temporal variations of the lake water properties this is indeed an important development for future satellite based water quality monitoring of global inland waters based on the in situ sd measurements we developed a regional sd retrieval algorithm from viirs observations for lake tahoe chl a and sd from viirs observations were generally consistent with the in situ measurements even though the algorithms are not perfect and some discrepancies indeed exist it is also noted that nl w 671 is higher in the center of the lake as in figs 6 8 and 9 while sd in the central lake is similar to sd in the coastal region although the differences are minor e g nl w 671 values of 0 031 0 036 and 0 031 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 for the transection line points of 5 15 and 25 km in fig 7 respectively it suggests that other water iop components such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom particularly suspended inorganic and organic particles may also contribute to the water property in the coastal region reflected particularly in the sd measurements viirs snpp observations over lake tahoe between 2012 and 2018 are used to quantify water optical nl w λ spectra biological chl a and water quality sd properties in the lake climatology nl w λ chl a and sd show that the spatial variation of the lake is quite small with chl a usually around 0 25 mg m 3 and enhanced nl w λ at the blue bands the present results also showed that there was seasonal variability in the measured variables the highest chl a and sd normally occur in the winter season and the lowest values in the summer season significant seasonal nl w λ variations can also be found at the viirs spectral bands of 410 443 and 486 nm in the summer viirs derived nl w λ at these three bands are generally above 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 while they are normally below 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 in the winter the seasonal variation for viirs derived nl w 551 is also obvious with highs in the summer and lows in the winter in addition there is significant interannual variability of water properties in lake tahoe observed from viirs measurements from 2012 to 2018 in particular 2017 was an abnormal year with reduced sd and nl w λ at the blue bands the anomaly started in the spring of 2017 reached the minimum for sd and nl w 443 in the 2017 summer autumn season during the 2017 2018 winter sd started recovering and went back to the normal in the spring of 2018 anomalously low viirs measured sd values were consistent with in situ measurements following the anomalous climate condition in the region during the 2017 2018 period the increased suspended particles would probably be the cause of the low nl w λ in the blue end of the spectrum fig 10b which ultimately led to the overestimation of chl a in the season this result suggests that a better understanding of optical processes of the lake with detailed information about optically active components in the water column is desired to account for such extreme conditions as well as future changes in environmental conditions still the general trend of water clarity and chl a in a normal year were well estimated by viirs snpp observations with the current method the anomalous water properties observed from viirs snpp between 2017 and 2018 can be attributed to the interannual climate variability in the region as an element of the tributary watershed drainage within the truckee river basin system the tahoe watershed covers more than 1000 km2 thus the ecosystem can be significantly impacted by the precipitation variation in the region in early 2017 the western u s including california and nevada experienced a heavy precipitation period during the winter season following a multiyear drought period which impacted the region significantly https www ncdc noaa gov sotc national 201713 indeed the total precipitation in the region was 175 cm in 2017 in comparison to below 50 cm in 2014 and 2015 terc 2018 the anomalous precipitation amount and river runoff could transport more inorganic and organic suspended matters cdom and nutrients to the lake leading to the depressed sd in the 2017 2018 period the present research is the first study to derive validate and apply satellite measured nl w λ spectra from high altitude lakes using new rayleigh radiance computations and results shown here have important environmental and societal implications the study demonstrates that satellite ocean color remote sensing can provide long term monitoring with high frequency observations not only for the global ocean coastal and sea level inland waters but also for global high altitude inland waters for example lakes in the tibetan plateau which can be considerably affected by the glacier melting due to global climate change are rarely investigated because they are remotely scattered around in a vast area and usually have an inclement environment and weather conditions satellite remote sensing as demonstrated in this study can provide an effective and efficient tool to evaluate the long term environmental variability of these systems in response to climate change finally it has been clearly shown that lake tahoe is generally a clear oligotrophic water body with high spatial uniformity over almost the entire lake these characteristics make it ideal to be used as evaluation validation and a monitoring site for satellite ocean color remote sensing in fact lake tahoe has been used for calibration and validation of thermal bands for various satellite sensors barsi et al 2007 hook et al 2007 steissberg et al 2005 tonooka and palluconi 2005 tonooka et al 2005 advantages of lake tahoe as an additional calibration and validation site for satellite ocean color sensors include 1 logistically easy to access for maintaining the site as the site has already been established and used for calibration and validation for thermal bands 2 located at high altitude 2 km with less atmospheric effects i e less toa radiance contributions from molecules and aerosols and 3 weather conditions are generally cooperative e g no hurricanes and instruments at the location are more

17915,it has been difficult in satellite remote sensing to derive accurate water optical biological and biogeochemical products over high altitude inland waters due to issues in satellite data

processing system satellite observations from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs onboard the suomi national polar orbiting partnership snpp between 2012 and 2018 are used to evaluate and validate satellite derived nl w λ spectra and to quantitatively characterize water properties in the lake results show that viirs derived nl w λ spectra are quite comparable with those from the in situ measurements subsequent retrievals of water biological and biogeochemical products show that chlorophyll a chl a concentration and secchi depth sd are reasonably well estimated and captured normal seasonal variations in the lake e g the annual highest chl a and sd normally occur in the winter while the lowest occur in the summer which is consistent with in situ measurements interannual variability of these water quality parameters is also observed in particular lake tahoe experienced a significant environmental anomaly associated with an extreme weather condition event in 2017 showing considerably decreased nl w λ at the spectral bands of 410 443 and 486 nm and significantly reduced sd values in the entire lake the low sd measurements from viirs are consistent with in situ

optical properties 1 introduction located at an altitude of 1897 m between california and nevada in the u s lake tahoe fig 1 is a large fresh water lake and is renowned for its water clarity it is the second deepest lake after crater lake in southern oregon in the u s with a length of 35 km width of 19 km average depth of 333 m surface area of about 490 km2 and total volume of approximately 156 km3 there are 63 tributaries that provide half of the water supply to lake tahoe which has a drainage area of about the same size as the lake the evaporation in the region accounts for about two thirds of the total water mass leaving the lake and the other one third is through the lake s only outlet the truckee river in the lake tahoe region the climate is characterized by warm dry summers and chilly winters with an average daily maximum temperature of 25 5 c in july and an average daily minimum temperature of 4 6 c in december the lake serves as an important resource for the regional economy by attracting tourists from all over the world throughout the year with its winter sports summer recreations and other activities and events thus the conservation of lake water quality and the surrounding environment has drawn major political scientific and public interest in the region lake tahoe has a long history of water clarity monitoring using secchi depth sd measurements back to the 1960s goldman 2000 jassby et al 1999 in the last five decades according to the 2018 tahoe environmental research center report terc 2018 the water clarity in terms of the sd declined consistently from 30 m in the mid 1960s to 20 m in recent years terc 2018 the sd decline can be attributed to increased phytoplankton concentration and the amount of fine sediment particles in the lake jassby et al 1999 2003 seasonally one of the sd minimums occurs in june due to increased suspended sediment discharges with the melting of snowpack and another sd minimum occurs in december primarily as a result of mixed layer deepening jassby et al 1999 the long term sd model also shows that the interannual variability of sd in the lake can be driven by weather changes such as precipitation anomalies in the region jassby et al 2003 in addition lake tahoe shows a long term warming trend due to the upward trend of air temperature and incoming longwave radiation in the region coats et al 2006 indeed the volume weighted mean temperature increased about 0 015 c year between 1970 and 2002 the thermal structure of the lake also shows changes e g the decreasing depth of the thermocline and the increase of resistance of the water in the lake to vertical layer mixing and stratification coats et al 2006 sahoo et al 2016 in lake tahoe both upwelling and surface circulation are observed and characterized with satellite remote sensing from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster hook et al 2007 tonooka and palluconi 2005 tonooka et al 2005 the landsat enhanced thematic mapper etm barsi et al 2007 hook et al 2004 and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis hook et al 2007 the upwelling of the intermediate depth water was observed to occur frequently in the spring and summer seasons it brings the water from the depth of 10 30 m to the surface and leads to enhanced phytoplankton growth and decreased water clarity in lake tahoe steissberg et al 2005 as one of the main drivers of the water clarity trend in lake tahoe the rate of phytoplankton growth has been steadily increasing over the past 50 years indeed primary productivity increased from 50 g c m 2 year 1 in 1959 to 200 g c m 2 year 1 in recent years terc 2018 in addition the aerosol deposition provides most of the nutrients in the dissolved inorganic particles and total nitrogen as well as a significant amount of the total phosphorus loading in lake tahoe jassby et al 1994 in fact the annual nitrogen n phosphorous p and particular matter pm from the aerosol deposition in the lake are estimated to be about 185 3 and 755 metric tons dolislager et al 2012 respectively indeed these nutrients from the aerosol deposition contributed to the long term increase of chl a concentration water primary productivity and biomass in lake tahoe mackey et al 2013 specifically it has been found that the phytoplankton amount in lake tahoe is becoming phosphorus limited from the nitrogen limited because the deposited aerosols in the lake contain nutrients with high n p ratios chang et al 1992 mackey et al 2013 however it is noted that in addition to the phosphorous limitation phytoplankton growth in lake tahoe is also iron limited chang et al 1992 in situ water optics measurements have long been conducted to characterize and quantify optical and bio optical properties in lake tahoe the spectral irradiance and beam transmittance were measured as a function of water depth in the lake smith et al 1973 a blue color index was also developed using the remote sensing reflectance r rs λ measurements to quantitatively analyze the spatial and seasonal variations watanabe et al 2016 it is noted that the remote sensing reflectance r rs λ as a function of the wavelength λ is defined as r rs λ nl w λ f 0 λ where nl w λ and f 0 λ are the normalized water leaving radiance gordon 2005 morel and gentili 1996 wang 2006 and the mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance thuillier et al 2003 respectively as an oligotrophic subalpine lake the role of ultraviolet uv radiation and the patterns of spatial and temporal variability of uv transparency were investigated rose et al 2009 it was found that uv transparency differs from the photosynthetically available radiation par in fact the combination of the uv and visible water transparency can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem changes and the biological and biogeochemical processes in lake tahoe rose et al 2009 satellite observations over global inland waters can provide an effective tool to monitor the lake environmental changes such as algae bloom and water clarity using the shortwave infrared swir based atmospheric correction algorithm wang 2007 wang and shi 2005 2007 wang et al 2009b it has been demonstrated that modis derived water optical property data e g nl w λ spectra can be used to monitor and assess water property quality in turbid lake taihu in china wang et al 2011 the spatial and temporal water turbidity variations in lake okeechobee are also characterized using modis measurements wang et al 2012a furthermore the cyanobacteria blooms in lake taihu are quantitatively assessed and evaluated from modis observations hu et al 2010 in addition to water optical parameters such as nl w λ spectra lake surface temperature and many other water quality parameters such as the water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm k d 490 lee et al 2005 wang et al 2009a chl a concentrations hu et al 2012 o reilly et al 1998 o reilly and werdell 2019 wang and son 2016 total suspended

inherent optical properties iops lee et al 2002 shi et al 2019 werdell et al 2013 can also be routinely and reliably derived from satellite remote sensing observations these satellite water quality property data can be further used to study global lakes to characterize and quantify the long term water physical optical biological and biogeochemical variability bolgrien and brooks 1992 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2018 son and wang 2019 in all of these studies however satellite reflective solar radiance data water color are applied almost all to global around sea level inland waters lake tahoe has long been used as one of the sites for validation of the absolute radiometric calibration and surface geophysical products derived from various satellite sensors mostly for thermal bands and their corresponding applications such as aster modis landsat 5 and etm barsi et al 2007 hook et al 2007 steissberg et al 2005 tonooka and palluconi 2005 tonooka et al 2005 as well as for the sensor preflight and inflight calibration parada et al 1997 thome et al 1998 however few satellite reflective solar radiance observations have ever been used to characterize and quantify the lake ecosystem and monitor water optical biological and biogeochemical changes this is mainly due to issues in the satellite data processing i e atmospheric correction gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 to accurately account for the effect of lake surface altitude wang 2016 specifically the top of atmosphere toa rayleigh scattering radiance computations were incorrect for high altitude lakes wang 2016 leading to over subtraction of the toa rayleigh scattering radiance contributions and thereby deriving biased low nl w λ spectra often negative values depending on the lake surface altitude gordon and wang 1994 wang 2016 consequently satellite derived optical biological and biogeochemical products e g chl a k d 490 sd iops or any other products that use the inputs of satellite measured nl w λ spectra for global high altitude lakes were in error and generally cannot be used this includes satellite derived water quality products over global high altitude lakes from the sea viewing wide field view sensor seawifs modis and the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs etc it is noted that for global ocean color data processing the required ancillary data such as sea level atmospheric pressure total column ozone amount sea surface wind speed and total column water vapor amount are routinely obtained from the national center for environmental prediction ncep ramachandran and wang 2011 following a recent effort for improving the toa rayleigh radiance computations for satellite ocean water color remote sensing in particular for accounting for the water surface altitude effect wang 2016 the global viirs observations on both the suomi national polar orbiting partnership snpp and noaa 20 satellites are processed using the improved rayleigh radiance computations in the multi sensor level 1 to level 2 msl12 ocean color data processing system wang et al 2013 in this study we use lake tahoe as an example to demonstrate that high quality nl w λ spectra can now be derived from viirs measurements for global high altitude lakes to characterize and quantify the lake ecosystem as well as monitor environmental changes specifically viirs snpp derived nl w λ spectra are compared with those from the in situ measurements and shown to have good results furthermore based on the in situ sd measurements in the lake a regional empirical sd algorithm has been developed using the viirs derived nl w λ at the wavelength of 551 nm therefore the seasonal and interannual variabilities of nl w λ chl a and sd in lake tahoe are characterized and quantified in particular we show that when using viirs derived water property data the anomalous water property in lake tahoe during the 2017 2018 abnormal event can be quantitatively investigated and analyzed finally the potential to use lake tahoe as an ocean color validation site for evaluation and validation of satellite ocean color products as well as routine sensor performance monitoring wang et al 2015 is discussed 2 satellite derived and in situ measured water properties in lake tahoe 2 1 viirs measured nlw λ spectra and other water color products successfully launched in october 2011 viirs snpp provides continuous observations of the earth s atmosphere land cryosphere and ocean properties with the 14 reflective solar bands rsbs covering a spectral range of 410 2257 nm goldberg et al 2013 for the satellite ocean and inland water color remote sensing the viirs snpp five visible bands m1 m5 at the nominal central wavelengths of 410 443 486 551 and 671 nm two imaging i bands i1 and i2 at 638 and 862 nm two near infrared nir bands m6 and m7 at 745 and 862 nm and three swir bands m8 m10 and m11 at 1238 1601 and 2257 nm are used to derive viirs nl w λ spectra over the global ocean and coastal inland waters wang and jiang 2018b wang et al 2013 it is noted that viirs measurements have spatial resolutions of 750 m and 375 m for the m bands and i bands respectively thus viirs derived nl w λ spectra at the spatial resolution of 750 m are applicable for global open oceans wang et al 2016a while nl w λ at the image bands e g nl w 638 data with the spatial resolution of 375 m are useful for various coastal and inland water applications wang and jiang 2018b viirs global ocean and inland water color products have been routinely generated since 2012 using msl12 which was originally developed for producing consistent global ocean color data sets from multiple satellite sensors using a common data processing software wang 1999 wang et al 2002 it should be noted that for deriving accurate global ocean color products the on orbit vicarious calibration has been carried out for viirs using the in situ moby measurements clark et al 1997 in the waters off hawaii wang et al 2016b during the viirs period msl12 has been significantly modified and improved including an atmospheric correction algorithm jiang and wang 2014 wang and jiang 2018a wang et al 2012b cloud masking using the swir bands wang and

water color products e g chl a wang and son 2016 k d 490 wang et al 2009a iops shi and wang 2019 data quality assurance qa wei et al 2016 etc in particular improved toa rayleigh radiance computations for accurately accounting for the effects of high altitude inland waters have been developed and implemented in msl12 wang 2016 it should be noted that in the msl12 ocean water color data processing the atmospheric diffuse transmittance ioccg 2010 yang and gordon 1997 has also been modified to account for the high altitude lake surface atmospheric pressure changes i e accounting for the rayleigh optical thickness variations for both the solar and viewing directions this is also an important fact impacted directly by the rayleigh optical thickness variation due to significant atmospheric pressure changes over high altitude lakes ioccg 2010 however it is assumed that there is negligible change in the rayleigh aerosol interaction radiance term gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 in the viirs data processing for a high altitude lake it should also be noted that viirs derived ocean color products have been well evaluated and validated over various ocean regions and some sea level inland waters through presentations in various conferences meetings and workshops as well as publications barnes et al 2019 hlaing et al 2013 mikelsons et al 2020 wang et al 2016a however viirs derived inland water quality products have not been evaluated over any high altitude lakes such as lake tahoe one of the important issues for deriving accurate water property data over high altitude inland waters from remote sensing is to accurately account for the water surface altitude effect in the toa rayleigh radiance computations wang 2016 in addition to various other challenges related to the data processing over global sea level waters this problem existed in previous satellite ocean color data processing which assumed the sea level water surface property i e atmospheric pressure measured and used at the sea level gordon et al 1988a wang 2002 2005 for high altitude lakes such as lake tahoe this leads to an over estimation of the toa spectral rayleigh radiance contributions therefore over subtractions of rayleigh radiance values in atmospheric correction thereby deriving biased low nl w λ spectra or even negative values gordon and wang 1994 ioccg 2010 wang 2007 for example the ratio of the surface atmospheric pressure at 2 km altitude to that at sea level is about 0 78 i e the toa rayleigh scattering radiance values over a 2 km altitude lake have an approximately similar factor smaller than those over the sea level lakes wang 2016 in fact for high altitude inland waters the accurate calculation of the toa spectral rayleigh scattering radiances is really important particularly for the short visible bands because the toa radiances contributed from aerosols are usually less important because aerosols are mostly located close to sea level e g within 2 km with the improved toa rayleigh radiance computation in msl12 wang 2016 the effects of high altitude lakes i e significantly low atmospheric pressure and therefore reduced spectral rayleigh optical thicknesses are accurately accounted for therefore water property data can be derived accurately over global high altitude waters including lake tahoe 2 2 in situ measured nlw λ spectra as nasa s calibration site four permanent moored buoys located at different locations in lake tahoe routinely make in situ measurements such as longwave and shortwave radiations wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure aerosol optical depth aod and water skin temperature https laketahoe jpl nasa gov measurements specifically the moored buoy at the tb3 station as noted in fig 1 is located at 39 06 37 n 120 04 31 w hyperspectral radiance measurements in the wavelength range of 360 nm 875 nm were taken with the hyperspectral radiometers installed at above water surface 0 m 2 m and 9 m depths on the tb3 buoy each radiometer measured the downward spectral irradiance e d λ z and upward spectral radiance l u λ z as a function of water depth z measurements were made hourly from local time 6 00 to 19 00 the water attenuation coefficient for l u λ z was then calculated and consequently l u λ 0 calculated from l u λ 0 was estimated finally the remote sensing reflectance spectra r rs λ were calculated with l u λ 0 and e d λ 0 watanabe et al 2016 during 2013 in situ in water radiometric profile data were also taken at the tb3 station and mid lake stations with another vertical profiling hyperspectral radiometer system within 2 h of the local solar noon on march 1 april 28 july 25 september 9 october 25 and december 16 remote sensing reflectance spectra r rs λ were then calculated from the measurements of the subsurface upward spectral radiance l u λ 0 and the downward spectral irradiance e d λ 0 watanabe et al 2016 a total of 14 in situ r rs λ spectra measurements as described above at the station tb3 in the lake were shown in watanabe et al 2016 specifically these in situ r rs λ spectra covered a time period from december 16 2013 to april 15 2015 in this study these 14 in situ r rs λ spectra acquired at the tb3 station in lake tahoe fig 1 were converted to in situ nl w λ spectra to further compare evaluate and validate viirs derived nl w λ spectra in addition to the in situ radiometric measurements at the tb3 station continuous water quality monitoring has been routinely conducted since 1968 the sd and chl a at the depths of 0 10 50 100 m have been sampled routinely approximately every 34 days at the mid lake tahoe productivity mltp station located at 39 8 30 n 120 00 55 5 w noted in fig 1 the in situ sd measurements and coincident viirs derived nl w λ at the green band 551 nm can be used to develop an empirical algorithm to derive sd binding et al 2008 the temporal variations of viirs derived chl a and sd data at the mltp station are compared with those from the in situ measurements to evaluate satellite algorithms performance for these two important water property products 3 results 3 1 viirs derived nlw λ spectra compared with those from in situ measurements there are 10 out of 14 radiance matchups for viirs snpp derived and in situ measured nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station on the same date in lake tahoe to compare the viirs snpp derived and in situ measured nl w λ a box of 7 7 pixels remapped with a box about 1 1 km2 centered at the tb3 station in the remapped nl w λ image was set and the median of nl w λ values in the box was calculated as the viirs derived nl w λ value in order to compare with the in situ nl w λ spectra there were four cases with the cloud cover when viirs snpp passed over the tb3 station preventing the production of valid viirs nl w λ spectra fig 2 provides examples of comparative results between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station on june 15 2013 fig 2a july 15 2013 fig 2b august 15 2013 fig 2c and september 15 2013 fig 2d the comparisons in fig 2 show that viirs derived nl w λ spectra match quite well with those from the in situ measurements and the two data sets are generally consistent fig 2 however there are some minor differences in the matchups in nl w λ as viirs derived nl w 410 and nl w 443 are slightly biased low on june 15 2013 relative to those from the in situ measurements overall results in fig 2 demonstrate that viirs derived nl w λ spectra using the improved new rayleigh radiance computation in msl12 are generally accurate showing significant improvements compared to those with incorrect rayleigh radiance computations for global high altitude lakes i e significantly biased low nl w λ values and even negative at the blue bands the overall accuracy of viirs derived nl w λ spectra at the tb3 station is further evaluated fig 3 since lake tahoe has high water clarity values of nl w 638 and nl w 671 are generally very small close to zero differences in matchups for nl w 638 and nl w 671 are significantly amplified in the logarithmic scale as shown in fig 3 although the differences are actually trivial for nl w λ at the blue and green bands wavelengths at 410 443 486 and 551 nm viirs derived nl w λ data agree quite well with the in situ measurements with the mean nl w λ ratio value between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ of 0 999 and the coefficient of determination r 2 between the two data sets in linear scale of 0 857 specifically the mean nl w λ ratio values between viirs derived and in situ measured nl w λ at the viirs wavelengths of 410 443 486 551 638 and 671 nm are 1 019 0 936 1 076 0 967 1 297 and 1 286 respectively while the mean nl w λ absolute difference values between the two for the corresponding six viirs bands are 0 124 0 109 0 078 0 037 0 023 and 0 024 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 respectively it should be noted again that for small values such as nl w λ at the viirs red bands 638 and 671 nm the mean absolute difference is a better and more meaningful measure for describing the uncertainty in fact it shows the smallest mean absolute difference values for nl w λ at the red bands although the nl w λ ratios at these bands are the largest due to very small values results in figs 2 and 3 confirm that high quality nl w λ spectra can be derived from viirs snpp observations over lake tahoe therefore the lake water optical biological and biogeochemical property data e g chl a and sd can be derived from viirs snpp measured nl w λ spectra and these data can be used to study the lake water property dynamics characterize and quantify the long term ecosystem variability monitor environmental change and detect hazardous events over the global high altitude lakes these possibilities and potentials are evaluated and discussed below 3 2 viirs derived sd and chl a compared with the in situ data in lake tahoe the sd variations are correlated to the amount of fine sediment in the water column jassby et al 1999 2003 loading and settling rates of such fine inorganic particles 16 μm in diameter were found to have the largest impact on the lake clarity sahoo et al 2010 considering the fact that nl w λ at the red end of the spectrum 638 and 671 nm are usually close to zero for the lake nl w 551 can be a sensitive indicator for the inorganic particle concentrations and correlate with water clarity indeed binding et al 2015 showed that the sd in the great lakes can be well correlated to satellite derived nl w 551 values at the mltp station in lake tahoe fig 1 there are total of 57 valid viirs nl w λ retrievals coincident with the in situ sd measurements in the period between 2012 and 2018 using these 57 sets of data an empirical sd model for the lake can then be developed and described as following 1 s d 10 a 0 a 1 n l w 551 where coefficients a 0 1 484 and a 1 0 551 mw 1 cm2 μm sr which were derived from the best fit to the in situ sd data to viirs derived nl w 551 fig 4 shows a comparison between the viirs derived using eq 1 and in situ measured sd at the mltp station the mean and median ratios of the viirs derived sd and in situ values are 1 0649 and 1 0365 with the standard deviation std of 0 1969 the comparison results fig 4 show that viirs derived sd data are quite reasonable and can be used to estimate water clarity in the lake from satellite observations fig 5 further provides the performance evaluation of viirs derived chl a fig 5a and sd fig 5b with the corresponding in situ measurements at the mltp station during the period of 2012 2018 viirs derived chl a data show the same seasonal trend as that from the in situ chl a measurements i e high chl a in the winter and low chl a in the summer it should be noted that in situ chl a data were derived as mean values from measured chl a data at the surface and at 10 m water depth considering sd values are normally between 20 and 30 m therefore excluding in situ chl a data at 50 and 100 m results show that viirs derived low chl a values in the mltp station are 0 2 mg m 3 and consistent with those from in situ data however some discrepancies between viirs derived and in situ measured chl a can be found for high chl a values in the winter season for example viirs derived chl a had the same peaks as the in situ measurements in the winters of 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2017 2018 viirs derived chl a was particularly different from the in situ data in the winter of 2016 2017 fig 5a viirs derived sd data in the mltp station show the same seasonal and interannual variations as those from the in situ sd measurements fig 5b in the period between 2012 and 2016 viirs derived sd data were consistent with the in situ measurements in terms of both the magnitude and seasonal variation however relatively large sd discrepancies between them were found with anomalously low in situ sd measurements in mid 2016 and late 2017 although the sd seasonal variation from the two sd data sets was still the same although there are some disagreements in the magnitude for viirs and in situ measured sd figs 4 and 5b and chl a fig 5a results are generally consistent in terms of magnitude values and particularly in their variations it should be noted that the in situ sd and chl a measurements also have their own uncertainties due to the instrument limitations and the operation differences e g human factors for the sd estimation these uncertainties also contribute to the differences between viirs and in situ measured chl a and sd data therefore we can conclude that viirs derived chl a and sd data have reasonably good accuracy and these data products along with viirs derived nl w λ spectra can be used to study water properties in lake tahoe 3 3 viirs measured climatology of nlw λ chl a and sd noticeably there are some significant differences in viirs derived water property data in 2017 and early 2018 compared with those in the other years indeed an anomalous event happened in the period of 2017 to early 2018 in the region and significantly impacted water properties in lake tahoe staff report 2018 therefore for the calculations of climatology water properties in the lake viirs measurements from 2012 to 2016 excluding years 2017 and 2018 are used fig 6 provides the climatology images of nl w 410 fig 6a nl w 443 fig 6b nl w 486 fig 6c nl w 551 fig 6d nl w 638 fig 6e nl w 671 fig 6f chl a fig 6g and sd fig 6h which were calculated as the median of all valid retrievals from viirs snpp measurements between 2012 and 2016 providing the normal water optical biological and biogeochemical conditions of the lake results from viirs observations show that lake tahoe features include spatial uniformity in water properties and enhanced nl w λ at the blue bands except for small areas in the southern and northwestern parts of the lake where water depth is less than 20 m fig 6 shows that spatial distributions of chl a sd and nl w λ in the lake are quite uniform and there is little spatial difference with normal chl a 0 25 mg m 3 and sd 22 m for the entire lake the changes of nl w λ spectra are also small across the lake for nl w λ at the all viirs bands in fact there is no specific spatial pattern for all climatology nl w λ spectra in the lake spectrally viirs derived nl w λ spectra show the typical feature of clear blue waters gordon et al 1988b morel and maritorena 2001 showing nl w 443 fig 6b 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 while nl w 410 fig 6a and nl w 486 fig 6c are a little bit less than nl w 443 in comparison the climatology nl w 551 fig 6d in the lake is 0 3 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 both nl w 638 fig 6e and nl w 671 fig 6f are less than 0 05 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 a transect line from the north to south across the lake is defined to further characterize the uniformity of the lake spatial distributions in nl w λ spectra chl a and sd fig 6a fig 7 provides quantitative results of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd as a function of distance from the north to south along the transect line noted in fig 6a fig 7a shows that climatology nl w 443 is generally stable at 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 from the north of the transect line to 20 km in the lake and it trends a little lower to 0 6 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 from 20 km to 30 km however climatology nl w 551 value 0 3 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 is quite stable and does not show any noticeable change along the transect line fig 7a in the southern end of the transect line the water type changes from a typical clear blue water to a typical shallow bottom affected water with significantly enhanced nl w λ in the visible bands fig 7a the variations of climatology chl a and sd along the transect line are shown in fig 7b chl a shows little variation with a value of 0 25 mg m 3 for the majority of the lake even though it increases slightly to 0 3 mg m 3 in the northern end region and spikes to over 1 0 mg m 3 in the southern end region figs 6g and 7b similarly sd is quite stable at 22 m for the majority of the transect line typical oligotrophic waters although decreased sd can be found in the coastal region of southern lake tahoe figs 6h and 7b it is noted that significantly enhanced chl a and nl w λ and reduced sd are observed in the southern coast of the lake fig 6 as well as in the southern end of the transect line fig 7 in fact viirs derived nl w λ spectra in the southern coastal region show effects like typical bottom affected water with significantly enhanced nl w λ spectra fig 6 although viirs derived nl w λ spectra in the region might still be valid with the nir swir combined atmospheric algorithm wang and shi 2007 the lake bottom reflectance contributions to the enhancements of the derived nl w λ spectra in the visible bands especially in the blue bands can indeed lead to large errors in viirs derived chl a and sd data in the southern end of the region thus viirs derived chl a and sd in the bottom impacted region may have significant errors and should not be considered valid 3 4 characterization of seasonal and interannual variability in water property seasonal variations of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd in lake tahoe are shown in fig 8 for nl w 443 fig 8a f k and p it reaches its peak value in the summer season fig 8f and the minimum occurs in the winter season fig 8p the seasonal change of nl w 551 fig 8b g l and q is relatively small but quite noticeable with highs in the summer and lows in the winter corresponding well to the seasonal variation in sd fig 8e j o and t as expected similarly the seasonal variation of nl w 671 in the lake is also very small fig 8c h m and r similar to the climatology results spatial variations of chl a in the lake for each season are generally small fig 8d i n and s the highest chl a value can be found in the winter fig 8s while the lowest chl a occurs in the summer fig 8i the seasonal change of sd is also noticeable with the lowest sd in the summer fig 8j and the highest sd in the winter fig 8t in addition fig 9 shows the interannual variations of nl w λ spectra chl a and sd from 2012 to 2018 viirs derived nl w 443 in 2017 fig 9z decreased remarkably as compared to the other years for the entire lake fig 9a f k p u and ee particularly in the southern region of the lake nl w 443 dropped to below 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 this indicates that there were increased amounts of absorbing components in the water column it is noted that the statistical results in fig 9 should be quite reliable although there may be errors in the viirs derived nl w λ spectra although nl w 443 increased in 2018 fig 9ee the values were still lower than those in the period of 2012 2016 unlike nl w 443 fig 9a f k p u z and ee the interannual variations of nl w 551 fig 9b g i q v aa and ff and nl w 671 fig 9c h m r w bb and gg were not significant not noticeable it is noted that viirs derived chl a values in 2017 and 2018 may be over estimated due to the chl a algorithm issue in dealing with the increased amount of inorganic suspended particles from high river runoff in that year thus viirs derived chl a values in 2017 and 2018 might be biased and therefore are not shown in fig 9 except for the years 2017 and 2018 the spatial distributions of chl a in the other six years fig 9d i n s and x are similar on the other hand different from the chl a interannual variation sd showed notable decreases in 2016 and 2017 fig 9y and dd in comparison to normal climatology sd values fig 6h and to those in the other years fig 9e j o t and ii in addition the seasonal and interannual variation in nl w λ spectra for the entire lake tahoe are quantitatively evaluated fig 10 fig 10a shows the clear seasonal change in nl w λ spectra specifically nl w 410 nl w 443 and nl w 486 values are the highest in the summer and the lowest in the winter in the spring season nl w λ spectrum is similar to the climatology fig 10a the seasonal differences in nl w 551 are smaller than those of the shorter wavebands but are still obvious with highs in the summer and lows in the winter reflecting the sd seasonal variation in the lake fig 5b it is noted again that nl w 638 and nl w 671 are both close to 0 for all four seasons the interannual variability of nl w λ spectra for lake tahoe is also significant fig 10b in particular the nl w λ spectrum in 2017 was abnormal and outlying showing significantly low values for nl w 410 nl w 443 and nl w 486 for example nl w 410 in 2017 was 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 compared to the normal value of 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 in the other years in 2018 the depression of nl w 410 was alleviated but still lower than those in the other normal years fig 10b shows that nl w λ spectra in 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 were all similar although some slight interannual variations did exist all of these seasonal and interannual variations in viirs derived nl w λ spectra are consistent with nl w λ spectral images as shown in figs 8 and 9 3 5 the 2017 2018 anomaly event in lake tahoe the interannual variability of water properties in lake tahoe in figs 9 and 10 shows that anomalous nl w λ spectra and sd occurred in 2017 and this abnormal event extended to 2018 specifically the median values of sd for the entire lake tahoe in each month between 2012 and 2018 were calculated to characterize and quantify the long term temporal variations and the environmental anomaly in 2017 the sd variation in lake tahoe between 2012 and 2018 is shown in fig 11 a the seasonal variation of sd was more pronounced in comparison to the interannual sd variation with sd ranging between 18 19 m and 23 24 m the lowest sd values were in the summers of 2013 2016 and 2017 after removing the seasonal sd variation fig 11b shows that sd anomaly dropped below 2 m in the spring of 2017 and kept negative sd anomaly values for the entire 2017 year consistent with the local media report staff report 2018 in comparison the negative sd anomaly values in 2013 and 2016 were mild and lasted only a couple of months the temporal variation of the sd anomaly in fig 11b clearly shows that 2017 is the year with the least water clarity in the studying period between 2012 and 2018 fig 12 provides the quantitative spatial image details of the temporal evolvements of nl w λ spectra and sd in the period from early 2017 to spring 2018 in the period between december 2016 and february 2017 all lake water properties fig 12a d were similar to those of climatology for the winter season fig 8p q r and t starting in the spring of 2017 march 2017 may 2017 the decreased nl w 443 fig 12e was found comparable to the typical nl w 443 in the same season fig 8a in the summer of 2017 june 2017 august 2017 nl w 443 fig 12i was significantly lower than the same season climatology nl w 443 fig 8f in the autumn of 2017 nl w 443 reached the lowest fig 12m it is also noted that sd in this season fig 12p was also lower than the sd climatology in the autumn fig 8o starting in the 2017 2018 winter season nl w λ and sd went back to normal fig 12q t although anomalous nl w 443 and sd were still remarkable in comparison to their typical values fig 8p q r and t in the spring of 2018 march 2018 may 2018 viirs snpp measured nl w λ and sd fig 12u x in the lake were fully recovered from the abnormal environmental event in 2017 indeed the lake s nl w λ and sd images in this period were similar to their typical ones fig 8a b c and e the water property anomaly in 2017 was observed also by the in situ water quality monitoring system and reported elsewhere terc 2018 the annual average of sd 18 2 m terc 2018 was the lowest value ever recorded since lake tahoe long term monitoring started in 1968 while the average sd in 2014 2015 and 2016 in the lake were 23 7 22 3 and 21 1 m respectively this anomalous environmental variation was attributed to the extreme weather and hydrologic events all related to climatic change in the region the total precipitation in the region was 175 cm in 2017 in comparison to amounts below 50 cm in 2014 and 2015 this high precipitation event led to high inflow carrying unusually high amount of sediments from surrounding tributaries as a result the concentrations of inorganic particles in the lake were elevated throughout the year causing observed low water clarity which is consistent with viirs snpp measurements the in situ chl a measurements did not show anomalous values in 2017 although the in situ chl a data exhibited relatively higher values in the winter however anomalous high chl a values were derived from viirs snpp measurements in 2017 which were associated with low nl w λ in the shorter wavebands 410 443 and 486 nm figs 9z and 10b and may be heavily affected by absorption of high concentrations of inorganic sediments brought by high inflow as discussed above this discrepancy likely due to the satellite chl a algorithm issue despite the reasonably good agreement of satellite derived and in situ measurements in normal years suggested the importance of improving the understanding of detailed properties of optically significant components in the water column and optical process of the lake for future biogeochemical monitoring with higher accuracy 4 discussions and conclusion in the last three decades satellite ocean color remote sensing e g seawifs modis viirs etc has been widely used in user communities for scientific researches and applications mcclain 2009 to understand global and regional water optical biological and biogeochemical properties and to evaluate their impact on climatic change natural hazards and various other environmental variations in fact satellite ocean color data have been playing a critical role to monitor and understand water quality over the global open ocean coastal and inland waters ioccg 2008 ioccg 2018 the toa rayleigh scattering radiance computations however exhibited a significant error in satellite measured global high altitude water property data due to an issue in atmospheric correction to accurately account for the effects of the high altitude water surface property i e surface atmospheric pressure the error resulted in considerably biased low nl w λ spectra which are often unusable for water property monitoring indeed there are few satellite water color remote sensing studies over high altitude lakes it was shown that with new improved rayleigh radiance computations wang 2016 satellite remote sensing can now routinely produce accurate and reliable water optical properties over high altitude lake tahoe similar to the well established remote sensing capability over global sea level inland bodies of water the present results demonstrated that the new computation method can derive accurate nl w λ spectra from high altitude inland waters it also showed that chl a and sd values estimated from nl w λ spectra were reasonable therefore satellite measured nl w λ spectra chl a sd and potentially other related products can be effectively used to characterize spatial and temporal variations of the lake water properties this is indeed an important development for future satellite based water quality monitoring of global inland waters based on the in situ sd measurements we developed a regional sd retrieval algorithm from viirs observations for lake tahoe chl a and sd from viirs observations were generally consistent with the in situ measurements even though the algorithms are not perfect and some discrepancies indeed exist it is also noted that nl w 671 is higher in the center of the lake as in figs 6 8 and 9 while sd in the central lake is similar to sd in the coastal region although the differences are minor e g nl w 671 values of 0 031 0 036 and 0 031 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 for the transection line points of 5 15 and 25 km in fig 7 respectively it suggests that other water iop components such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom particularly suspended inorganic and organic particles may also contribute to the water property in the coastal region reflected particularly in the sd measurements viirs snpp observations over lake tahoe between 2012 and 2018 are used to quantify water optical nl w λ spectra biological chl a and water quality sd properties in the lake climatology nl w λ chl a and sd show that the spatial variation of the lake is quite small with chl a usually around 0 25 mg m 3 and enhanced nl w λ at the blue bands the present results also showed that there was seasonal variability in the measured variables the highest chl a and sd normally occur in the winter season and the lowest values in the summer season significant seasonal nl w λ variations can also be found at the viirs spectral bands of 410 443 and 486 nm in the summer viirs derived nl w λ at these three bands are generally above 0 8 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 while they are normally below 0 5 mw cm 2 μm 1 sr 1 in the winter the seasonal variation for viirs derived nl w 551 is also obvious with highs in the summer and lows in the winter in addition there is significant interannual variability of water properties in lake tahoe observed from viirs measurements from 2012 to 2018 in particular 2017 was an abnormal year with reduced sd and nl w λ at the blue bands the anomaly started in the spring of 2017 reached the minimum for sd and nl w 443 in the 2017 summer autumn season during the 2017 2018 winter sd started recovering and went back to the normal in the spring of 2018 anomalously low viirs measured sd values were consistent with in situ measurements following the anomalous climate condition in the region during the 2017 2018 period the increased suspended particles would probably be the cause of the low nl w λ in the blue end of the spectrum fig 10b which ultimately led to the overestimation of chl a in the season this result suggests that a better understanding of optical processes of the lake with detailed information about optically active components in the water column is desired to account for such extreme conditions as well as future changes in environmental conditions still the general trend of water clarity and chl a in a normal year were well estimated by viirs snpp observations with the current method the anomalous water properties observed from viirs snpp between 2017 and 2018 can be attributed to the interannual climate variability in the region as an element of the tributary watershed drainage within the truckee river basin system the tahoe watershed covers more than 1000 km2 thus the ecosystem can be significantly impacted by the precipitation variation in the region in early 2017 the western u s including california and nevada experienced a heavy precipitation period during the winter season following a multiyear drought period which impacted the region significantly https www ncdc noaa gov sotc national 201713 indeed the total precipitation in the region was 175 cm in 2017 in comparison to below 50 cm in 2014 and 2015 terc 2018 the anomalous precipitation amount and river runoff could transport more inorganic and organic suspended matters cdom and nutrients to the lake leading to the depressed sd in the 2017 2018 period the present research is the first study to derive validate and apply satellite measured nl w λ spectra from high altitude lakes using new rayleigh radiance computations and results shown here have important environmental and societal implications the study demonstrates that satellite ocean color remote sensing can provide long term monitoring with high frequency observations not only for the global ocean coastal and sea level inland waters but also for global high altitude inland waters for example lakes in the tibetan plateau which can be considerably affected by the glacier melting due to global climate change are rarely investigated because they are remotely scattered around in a vast area and usually have an inclement environment and weather conditions satellite remote sensing as demonstrated in this study can provide an effective and efficient tool to evaluate the long term environmental variability of these systems in response to climate change finally it has been clearly shown that lake tahoe is generally a clear oligotrophic water body with high spatial uniformity over almost the entire lake these characteristics make it ideal to be used as evaluation validation and a monitoring site for satellite ocean color remote sensing in fact lake tahoe has been used for calibration and validation of thermal bands for various satellite sensors barsi et al 2007 hook et al

logistically easy to access for maintaining the site as the site has already been established and used for calibration and validation for thermal bands 2 located at high altitude 2 km with less atmospheric effects i e less toa radiance contributions from molecules and aerosols and 3 weather conditions are generally cooperative e g no hurricanes and instruments at the location are more

17916,gas bubbles are introduced in water to absorb or strip volatile substances in a variety of unit operations for example during waste water treatment to calculate the transfer rate of substances between the liquid phase and the gas phase different assumptions have been made in literature regarding the gas phase composition and hydraulic pressure which both vary along the reactor height in this study analytical expressions were derived for the total macroscopic liquid gas transfer rate using either the complete gradients of the mole fraction and pressure comprehensive approach or a uniform value for one or both of them simulations with the comprehensive model were performed to understand the effect of the type of volatile substance and of the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate these effects were found to be highly interactive and often non linear next the simulation results of the comprehensive model were compared with those from models that assume either a uniform mole fraction or a uniform pressure in the complete reactor volume this illustrated that for soluble substances the mole fraction gradient strongly affects the total liquid gas transfer rate while the pressure gradient became only important under operating conditions that promote stripping i e for a high concentration in the liquid phase and low concentration in the inlet gas for very poorly soluble substances the pressure became more important under conditions that promote absorption these results on the importance of the mole fraction and pressure gradients remained equally valid when explicitly considering a typical variation of the volumetric overall transfer coefficient kla along the reactor height finally a simple and fast procedure was made available through a spreadsheet to select appropriate simplifying assumptions in reactor or plant wide models by applying the procedure to oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 in an aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactor it was demonstrated that some common simplifications can lead to significant errors for which corrections were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords absorption stripping aeration emission bubble wastewater treatment 1 introduction the basic principles of absorption and stripping via the injection of gas bubbles have been long known lewis and whitman 1924 and have proven useful for the design and optimization of various unit processes gas bubbles are introduced for example to promote the oxidation of pollutants in biological wastewater treatment reactors to remove nitrogen gas n2 in a re aeration tank for better sludge settling henze et al 2008 to absorb carbon dioxide for neutralization of alkaline wastewaters gomolka and gomolka 1991 to absorb carbon dioxide and strip oxygen from photo bioreactors for faster photo autotrophic growth shoener et al 2019 sundarrajan et al 2019 to strip volatile pollutants to absorb reactive gases for advanced oxidation processes or disinfection hand et al 1999 and to oxygenate aquaculture ponds boyd 1998 or surface waters preece et al 2019 for biological wastewater treatment in particular liquid gas transfer models have been coupled to biological conversion models to find strategies that minimize the aeration energy requirements whilst providing sufficient oxygen o2 jeppsson et al 2007 olsson and andrews 1978 schulze and kooistra 1969 also emissions of hazardous volatile substances such as benzene from the reactors have been quantified with such models mattermuller et al 1981 melcer 1994 mozo et al 2012 more recently emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 during wastewater treatment have become a concern leading to the application of liquid gas transfer principles to find emission minimization strategies daelman et al 2014 hiatt and grady 2008 von schulthess and gujer 1996 moreover carbon dioxide co2 stripping has been included in biological wastewater treatment models to understand its impact on ph and to develop soft sensors flores alsina et al 2015 hellinga et al 1999 solon et al 2017 sötemann et al 2005 spérandio and paul 1997 vanhooren et al 2000 weissenbacher et al 2007 the transfer rate of a volatile substance i from a liquid phase into a gas phase ṁl g i g d 1 is commonly calculated as the product of an overall transfer coefficient kl i m d 1 area of the liquid gas interface aint m2 and a driving force expressed as the difference between the actual liquid phase concentration cl i g m 3 and the liquid phase equilibrium concentration corresponding with the prevailing gas phase concentration cl eq i g m 3 i e the actual solubility as shown in eq 1 lewis and whitman 1924 eq 1 m i l g k l i a int c i l c eq i l the liquid gas transfer rate is positive when the liquid phase concentration is higher than the equilibrium value which means stripping takes place conversely a negative value arises when the liquid phase concentration is lower than the equilibrium value which means absorption occurs the interfacial area aint is typically written as the product of the volume specific area ai m2 m 3 and the reactor volume v m3 resulting in eq 2 wiesmann et al 2006 eq 2 m i l g k l a i c i l c eq i l v in full scale reactors the liquid gas transfer rate can vary significantly along the reactor height because bubbles undergo several changes while rising to the surface firstly the composition of the gas changes due to the transfer of substances into or out from the rising bubbles the resulting gradient of the gas phase mole fraction of a substance influences its actual solubility cl eq i which in turn affects its transfer rate eq 2 secondly there is a hydraulic pressure gradient from the bottom to the top due to the weight of the water column which also influences the actual solubility cl eq i and thus the transfer rate wiesmann et al 2006 other phenomena also occur such as expansion and coalescence of the bubbles which create a vertical gradient of the specific interfacial area ai amaral et al 2018 consequently it is questionable whether eq 2 can always be used to calculate the total macroscopic liquid gas transfer rate in a full scale reactor this becomes a more pressing question now that reactors taller than 6 m become more popular for wastewater treatment e g aerobic granular sludge reactors de bruin et al 2013 wiesmann et al 2006 in literature the gas phase composition and pressure have been considered with a varying degree of detail to calculate the total liquid gas transfer rate in a reactor table 1 sometimes a uniform mole fraction is assumed throughout the reactor e g the value at the bottom of the reactor i e the content in the inlet gas often air at the top i e the content in the off gas or an arithmetic or logarithmic mean of both in the latter two cases the depletion or enrichment of the gas phase along the reactor height is considered in a simplified way wiesmann et al 2006 but some authors considered the complete gradient of the mole fraction comprehensively by assuming a plug flow this approach led to more accurate predictions of n2o emissions from a wastewater treatment reactor fiat et al 2019 analogously a uniform pressure is often assumed e g the value at the top of the reactor i e the atmospheric pressure or the arithmetic mean of the top and bottom value the latter approach accounts for the increased actual solubility due to the water column in a simplified way van der lans 2000 but some authors considered the pressure gradient comprehensively table 1 illustrates that many different assumptions have been used and that there is no clear relationship between the chosen assumptions and the volatile substance or reactor height under study nor is there a convergence towards one accepted model over time evidently there is a need to better understand the effect of the mole fraction and pressure gradients on the total liquid gas transfer rate under different circumstances so that future studies can make appropriate assumptions the goal of this study was to understand when and why the vertical gradients of the gas phase composition and pressure affect the total liquid gas transfer rate and which commonly used characteristic values for the mole fraction and pressure can mimic the effect of these gradients best to this end analytical expressions for the total liquid gas transfer rate were first derived using either a comprehensive description of the mole fraction and pressure gradients or a uniform value for one or both of them next the comprehensive model was used to assess the influence of the molecular properties of a theoretical substance and the reactor design and operating conditions these results were subsequently compared with those of models with either a uniform mole fraction or uniform pressure to identify when the respective mole fraction and pressure gradients significantly affect the total transfer rate finally a procedure was described to quickly determine whether and how the vertical mole fraction and or pressure gradients should be considered under specific conditions by comparing the output of all the alternative derived analytical expressions this procedure was illustrated for typical concentrations of o2 co2 ch4 n2o and n2 in the liquid phase and inlet gas of an aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactor in order to find out which common simplifications table 1 are acceptable and which are not 2 methodology 2 1 analytical derivation of the total liquid gas transfer rate an expression was derived for the steady state total liquid gas transfer rate of a substance i in a reactor under specified conditions a mass balance was first derived over an infinitesimal gas volume at vertical position z m eq 3 under the assumption of a completely mixed liquid phase a pseudo steady state of the local mass and a uniform volumetric overall transfer coefficient klai d 1 derivation in supplementary information s2 1 eq 3 dx i g z dz k l a i rta p atm g q in g m i c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z where xg i mole

for stripping δc g m 3 at position z can be recognized as eq 4 which is a function of the local mole fraction xi g and pressure pg as mentioned in the introduction eq 4 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z this mass balance eq 3 was solved to obtain an expression for the mole fraction as a function of the position in the reactor xg i z and the mole fraction at the top in the off gas xg out i in particular first the mass balance was solved as a differential equation with boundary condition xg i z 0 xg in i while the driving force on the right hand side was described with a position dependent mole fraction xg i and pressure pg eq 5 eq 5 p g z p atm g ρ g h z where ρ kg m 3 is the density of the water g m s 2 the gravitational acceleration and h m the reactor height h then the mass balance was repeatedly solved with different combinations of one or more of the following simplifications the mole fraction in the driving force on the right hand side was approximated by a uniform value i e the value at the bottom or top of the reactor or the arithmetic mean the pressure in the driving force on the right hand side was approached by a uniform value i e the value at the top or the mean over the reactor the derivative on the left hand side was discretised over two points the bottom and the top of the reactor corresponding to a completely mixed gas phase there are dozens of possible combinations of these simplifications but 8 were selected to answer the research questions posed in this work when and why do the gradients of the mole fraction and pressure affect liquid gas transfer eq 7 eq 9 and which commonly used uniform values for the mole fraction and pressure can mimic these effects best eq 10 eq 15 for each set of assumptions the mole fraction at the top of the reactor xg out i was calculated supplementary information s2 2 and introduced in the steady state mass balance over the total gas volume in the reactor which reads as eq 6 after assuming a pseudo state gas phase and neglecting changes in the total molar gas flow supplementary information s2 3 eq 6 m i l g q in g p atm g m i rt x out i g x in i g this resulted in the final expressions for the total liquid gas transfer rate in table 2 2 2 simulations during all simulations the average overall transfer coefficient klai and inlet gas flow rate qg in were expressed as a function of the overall transfer coefficient of oxygen klao2 respectively via eq 16 de heyder et al 1997 and eq 17 van der lans 2000 eq 16 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 eq 17 q in g k l a o 2 a p atm g ρ g h 2 0 6 p atm g where di m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient this was necessary to ensure coherent values since klai and qg in are interdependent 2 2 1 effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions the model that comprehensively considered the gradients of the mole fraction and pressure was used to understand the effect of different molecular properties of a theoretical substance i and the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 first a qualitative sensitivity analysis was performed by examining the analytical expression and its partial derivatives gujer 2008 supplementary information s3 1 then the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 mole fraction eq s 15 and driving force eq 4 were quantitatively determined for different parameter values table 3 four extreme scenarios were investigated a very poorly soluble i e very low hi and a soluble i e moderate hi substance under operating conditions that promote stripping i e a high liquid phase concentration cl i 10 g m 3 and low inlet mole fraction xg in i 0 and under operating conditions that promote absorption i e a low liquid phase concentration cl i 0 g m 3 and high inlet mole fraction xg in i 0 1 for each of these scenarios a range of typical reactor heights h was investigated 2 2 2 importance of mole fraction and pressure gradients to investigate when the mole fraction and or pressure gradient significantly affects the total liquid gas transfer rate the results of the comprehensive model eq 7 were compared with that of the model that only ignores the mole fraction gradient eq 8 and the model that only ignores the hydrostatic pressure gradient eq 9 for the parameter values in table 3 to verify that the conclusions drawn from this comparison are not influenced by the assumption of a uniform klai the mass balance eq 3 was also numerically solved via the ode45 solver in matlab for each of the three assumptions for the mole fraction and pressure combined with an imposed klai gradient eq 18 the average klai was unchanged for a fair comparison but the local klai was assumed to decrease linearly by a factor 2 from the bottom to the top of the reactor based on the experimental observations by amaral et al 2018 eq 18 k l a i z k l a o 2 d i d o 2 4 3 2 3 h z the resulting numerical solution for the mole fraction gradient for the three sets of assumptions were substituted in eq 6 to find the respective total liquid gas transfer rates 2 2 3 procedure for model selection a spreadsheet is provided in the supplementary information that calculates the total liquid gas transfer rate with all the alternative derived equations table 2 and shows with colours which simplifications approach the results of the comprehensive model the procedure for model selection that can be performed with this tool was demonstrated in this work for five substances that are often considered in aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactors table 1 oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 the molecular properties of these substances and typical concentrations in the inlet gas and liquid phase were used table 4 these parameter values cover a wide range of aerobic wastewater treatment technologies e g aerobic granular sludge reactors sharon reactors membrane bioreactors etc to ensure that the comprehensive model eq 7 is a suitable reference it was validated supplementary information s5 with oxygen absorption rates obtained for different inlet gas flow rates and reactor heights wagner and popel 1998 and nitrous oxide emission rates under a fluctuating gas flow rate temperature and liquid phase concentration baresel et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions in this section the comprehensive model which considers the mole fraction and pressure gradient was used to understand the effect of molecular properties the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 this was first done qualitatively by analysing the analytical expression and then quantitatively to better understand the non linear and interactive effects 3 1 1 qualitative sensitivity analysis the total liquid gas transfer rate and its partial derivatives were examined to qualitatively assess the effect of changing parameter values supplementary information s3 1 notwithstanding the apparent complexity of the expression eq 7 the total transfer rate is a linear function of the cross sectional area a overall transfer coefficient of oxygen klao2 inlet mole fraction xg in i liquid phase concentration cl i and molar mass mi klao2 and a even act as simple proportionality factors so if the aeration intensity klao2 or reactor area a double the stripping or absorption rate doubles as well the partial derivatives confirmed the intuitive expectations that an increase of the inlet mole fraction xg in i or molar mass mi decreases the liquid gas transfer rate in other words the stripping rate ṁl g i decreases if stripping takes place ṁl g i 0 and the absorption rate ṁl g i increases if absorption takes place ṁl g i 0 this can be understood by the corresponding decrease of the driving force for stripping eq 4 conversely an increase of the liquid phase concentration cl i increases the stripping rate ṁl g i and decreases the absorption rate ṁl g i the partial derivatives showed that the strength of the effect of one parameter always depends on the value of other parameters due to interactive effects multiplications furthermore the effects of the reactor height h diffusion coefficient di and henry coefficient hi are non linear to obtain more insight into these non linear and interactive effects a quantitative sensitivity analysis was performed in the following section 4 1 2 table 5 summarizes the effects that were disclosed via the qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analysis 3 1 2 quantitative sensitivity analysis for extreme cases of stripping absorption and solubility simulations of the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 mole fraction gradient eq s 15 pressure gradient eq 5 and driving force gradient eq 4 were performed for a range of reactor heights in four extreme cases table 3 which are explained in the following order a very poorly soluble substance very low henry coefficient under conditions that promote stripping a high liquid phase concentration and low inlet gas content or absorption a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content and a soluble substance moderate henry coefficient under the same two conditions fig 2 for a very poorly soluble substance the stripping rate increased almost linearly with an increasing reactor height grey line fig 2a this is mainly because the gas has a longer residence time in a taller reactor so there was more time for transfer to take place as a result a higher mole fraction of the volatile substance was obtained at the top of the reactor solid versus dashed grey line fig 2b however the mole fraction gradient was slightly less steep for a taller reactor this can be explained by the increased pressure inside the reactor caused by the taller water column solid versus dashed line fig 2c which increased the equilibrium liquid phase concentration actual solubility in turn and thus led to a slightly weaker driving force for stripping solid versus dashed grey line fig 2d this pressure effect explains the marginally concave curve of the stripping rate with a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content absorption occurred only slowly for a very poorly soluble substance because of its tendency to reside in the gas phase grey line on fig 2e plotted on the secondary y axis the absorption rate ṁl g i increased convexly with an increasing reactor height this illustrates that the effect of the reactor height is not only non linear but also interactive as it can stimulate stripping in one case fig 2a and stimulate absorption in the other fig 2e the increase of the absorption rate with an increasing reactor height can be explained by the longer residence time of the gas which resulted in a lower mole fraction at the top of the reactor solid versus dashed grey line fig 2f yet the mole fraction gradient was steeper for a taller reactor since the higher hydrostatic pressure fig 2g increased the actual solubility cl eq i and thus led to a stronger driving force for absorption δc solid versus dashed grey line fig 2h this pressure effect explains the convexity of the absorption rate curve for a soluble substance the stripping rate was always lower than for a very poorly soluble substance since it has a stronger tendency to reside in the liquid phase black line fig 2a the stripping rate still increased with an increasing reactor height but the concavity was much more pronounced diminishing the slope strongly when the reactor was taller than 2 m as discussed before the higher transfer rate was due to the longer residence time of the gas but this effect was now counteracted by saturation of the gas phase with the substance around 2 m above the reactor bottom black lines fig 2b the maximal gas phase content was nearly reached because the substance was soluble the steep decrease of the driving force along the vertical direction also shows that an equilibrium was almost reached between the gas and liquid phase black lines fig 2d nevertheless a small driving force remained until the top of the reactor this was caused by the gradual decrease of the pressure fig 2c generating a gradual decrease of the actual solubility cl eq i and thus a slow continued release of the substance into the gas phase consequently the pressure gradient explains the continued slow increase of the gas phase mole fraction from 2 m on fig 2b fast absorption occurred when a soluble substance was present at a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content black line fig 2e the absorption rate increased concavely with an increasing reactor height the increase was again caused by the higher gas residence time but this effect was counteracted by the depletion of the gas phase before reaching the top of the reactor black lines fig 2f equilibrium between the gas and liquid phase was already almost reached at around 2 m above the reactor bottom black lines fig 2h the slow continued increase of the liquid gas transfer rate for reactors higher than 2 m was simply due to the choice of a fixed klao2 during the simulations which led to a higher gas flow rate qg in with an increasing reactor height eq 17 apart from the non linear effect of the reactor height and its interactions with the solubility hi and operating conditions xg in i and cl i also the non linear effects of the diffusion and henry coefficient and their interactions were investigated quantitatively supplementary information s3 2 a higher henry coefficient convexly decreased the stripping rate ṁl g i in case of stripping ṁl g i 0 and concavely increased the absorption rate ṁl g i in case of absorption ṁl g i 0 since a higher solubility always decreases the driving force for stripping eq 4 in contrast a higher diffusion coefficient concavely increased both the stripping and absorption rate via its effect on the overall transfer coefficient klai eq 16 3 2 importance of mole fraction and pressure gradients to identify when and why the respective mole fraction and or pressure gradients become important this section compared the comprehensive model eq 7 with the model that ignores the enrichment or depletion of the inlet gas uniform mole fraction eq 8 and the model that ignores the hydrostatic pressure uniform pressure eq 9 completely a plug flow was always considered in the gas phase for a fair comparison whenever there was a deviation from the comprehensive model the respective gradient that was ignored had a significant effect on the total transfer rate the mass balances eq 3 and eq 6 were also numerically solved with a typical gradient of the klai eq 18 to verify that the conclusions are robust for a very poorly soluble substance the mole fraction gradient could be neglected to calculate the stripping rate without a significant loss in accuracy whatever the reactor height solid grey and black lines fig 3a this is because the driving force for stripping stayed at a nearly uniform high value all along the reactor height under these conditions grey lines fig 2d mathematically this can be seen if a very low value of the henry coefficient hi and high liquid phase concentration are used in eq 4 the driving force can then be estimated by the liquid phase concentration eq 19 which is no longer a function of the mole fraction gradient eq 19 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z c i l 0 0001 p g z m i rt x i g z c i l f z for the same reason the model assuming a uniform pressure predicted nearly the same stripping rate dashed black line fig 3a in conclusion neither the mole fraction or pressure gradient were important to estimate the stripping rate of a very poorly soluble substance the absorption rate of a very poorly soluble substance could also be accurately calculated without consideration of the mole fraction gradient solid grey and black lines fig 3c this is because the mole fraction stayed near its inlet value all along the reactor height grey lines fig 2f this can be explained by the poor solubility of the substance which made the total transfer rate low since the mole fraction was nearly uniform the gradient of the driving force was mainly determined by the pressure gradient eq 20 and thus both gradients had a similar shape grey line fig 2g and h eq 20 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z c i l h i p g z m i rt x in i g as the driving force was strongly determined by the pressure gradient the model without pressure gradient deviated from the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3b this deviation increased with increasing reactor height due to the higher hydraulic pressure in conclusion only the pressure gradient was important to estimate the absorption rate of a very poorly soluble substance for a soluble substance the stripping rate was strongly overestimated when the gas phase mole fraction was assumed uniform especially for tall reactors solid grey and black lines fig 3b this is because the mole fraction showed a significant increase along the reactor height black lines fig 2b while the content in the inlet gas was always lower since the gas phase mole fraction was underestimated the driving force and thus also the stripping rate were overestimated in contrast the model with a uniform pressure showed only a minor deviation from the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3b e g 11 difference for a 10 m tall reactor the results were similar because the near saturation of the gas phase mole fraction black lines fig 2b was still considered however the actual solubility cl eq i was slightly underestimated by neglecting the hydrostatic pressure especially near the reactor bottom consequently the average driving force along the reactor height and thus also the stripping rate were slightly overestimated in conclusion especially the mole fraction gradient was important to estimate stripping rate of a soluble substance but also the pressure had a moderate effect the absorption rate of a soluble substance was strongly overestimated when the mole fraction gradient was neglected solid grey and black lines fig 3d this is because the mole fraction decreased steeply from the bottom towards top due to the tendency of the substance to reside in the liquid phase black lines fig 2f therefore the gas phase content was consistently overestimated when considering only the inlet gas composition consequently the driving force and thus also the absorption rate were overestimated conversely the model with a uniform pressure predicted nearly the same absorption rate as the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3d this is because already the complete available amount in the gas phase transferred to the liquid phase black lines fig 2f so inclusion of the hydraulic pressure did not enhance the absorption rate any further in conclusion only the mole fraction gradient was important to estimate the absorption rate of a soluble substance to verify the robustness of these conclusions the same three models were compared but now also considering a typical klai gradient eq 18 fig 1 the total liquid gas transfer rate hardly changed when a klai gradient was considered instead of a uniform value supplementary information s4 the largest change was encountered with the tallest reactor height 10 m for absorption but even then it was less than 4 higher more importantly the same conditions led to large deviations between the comprehensive model and the models with a uniform mole fraction and uniform pressure respectively consequently the conclusions drawn earlier for the importance of the mole fraction and pressure gradient under different conditions are robust 3 3 procedure for model selection whereas the extreme scenarios investigated until now illustrated when and why the gas phase mole fraction and or pressure gradients significantly affect the total liquid gas transfer rate this section investigated for which more realistic scenarios these effects can be incorporated in a simplified way via a mixed gas phase 3 3 1 spreadsheet for model comparison given the non linearity and interactions table 5 it is hard to envisage the effect of different molecular properties reactor designs and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate without explicit calculation therefore a spreadsheet is provided in the supplementary information which automatically calculates the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 after entering the parameter values of interest and compares it with the simplified models table 2 the user can define the required accuracy and a green colour automatically indicates which simplified models can be used under these conditions this can help to decide whether to include neglect or simplify the gradients of the mole fraction and or pressure in the gas phase for each specific application to balance the complexity with the required accuracy this is a more rational approach than a choice based on intuition or reports of very specific conditions where a certain gradient appeared to be important e g fiat et al 2019 showed that the mole fraction gradient was important to accurately estimate the n2o emissions in a 4 m high biological active filter 3 3 2 application to aerobic biological wastewater treatment o2 co2 ch4 n2o and n2 for typical concentrations of volatile substances in the gas and liquid phase of an aerobic wastewater treatment reactor the applicability was assessed of the models that assume a mixed gas phase with different uniform values for the mole fraction and pressure eq 10 eq 15 via comparison with the comprehensive model fig 4 as such the popular approaches in literature were critically evaluated table 1 and improvements were proposed for dissolved oxygen absorption was predicted by all models fig 4a the absorption rate also decreased with an increasing liquid phase concentration for all models since a smaller difference between the liquid phase concentration and the equilibrium value always decreases the driving force eq 4 even though the trends were the same some simplifications led to a strong deviation from the comprehensive model especially when only the pressure at the top of the reactor was considered light grey lines the absorption rate was severely underestimated this is caused by the rather poor solubility of oxygen ho2 0 0337 and high content in the inlet gas xg in o2 20 946 as explained in see section 4 2 yet also the models that mimicked the effect of the pressure gradient via the mean value showed a significant deviation when combined with the mole fraction at the top or bottom dark grey dashed and dotted lines this shows that the solubility of oxygen is still high enough 337 times higher than the extreme in section 4 2 to have a visible effect of the mole fraction gradient this scenario thus lies between the extremes in fig 3c and d where the mole fraction gradient already starts to have an influence while the pressure gradient is still important nevertheless these effects of the mole fraction and pressure gradients could be mimicked very well through their mean values dark grey dash dotted line this rather simple equation eq 11 may thus provide a good balance between complexity and accuracy for oxygen absorption in wastewater treatment reactors it would be an improvement compared to the many models in literature that neglect one or both gradients completely table 1 for carbon dioxide net stripping was predicted by all models fig 4b the stripping rate decreased with an increasing liquid phase concentration for all models since a larger difference with the equilibrium value always increases the driving force eq 4 similar trends were observed for nitrous oxide fig 4c even though the trends were the same for the different models a severe overestimation occurred when only the mole fraction at the bottom was considered dashed lines this is explained by the rather high solubility hco2 0 9864 and hn2o 0 6965 and low inlet gas mole fraction xg in co2 0 04 and xg in n2o 333 ppb as explained in section 4 2 none of the simplified models visually overlapped with the comprehensive model since also the pressure gradient is important for stripping of soluble substances fig 3b and none of the approximations of the mole fraction gradient with a uniform value are perfect the best approximation was obtained with the values at the top of the reactor light gey dotted line this is in line with the near complete saturation of the gas phase at the top of the reactor solid black lines on fig 2d however also the model using the mean mole fraction and pressure gave reasonable results dark grey dash dotted line as such the same expression could be used as for oxygen and the accuracy would already greatly improve compared to the many models in literature that neglect one or both gradients completely table 1 for methane stripping the simplified models did not only predict a similar trend as the comprehensive model but they also predicted very similar values fig 4d this can be explained by the low solubility hch4 0 0351 and atmospheric content xg in ch4 1 8 ppm which approximates the ideal case in fig 3a where neither the mole fraction nor the pressure gradient have a strong effect the models with a uniform mole fraction at the off gas or inlet value dashed and dotted lines showed the biggest though still limited deviation from the reference model this is because the solubility of methane is still high enough 351 times higher than the extreme scenario in section 4 2 to have a slight influence of the mole fraction gradient the mean value of the mole fraction and pressure dark grey dash dotted line gave the best approximation again nitrogen gas stripping was predicted for most of the considered liquid phase concentrations fig 4e nitrogen gas has a very poor solubility hn2 0 0172 but given the very high atmospheric content xg in n2 78 the driving force for stripping was not very strong eq 4 therefore some absorption ṁl g n2 0 was predicted for low liquid phase concentrations this corresponds to a scenario between the extreme cases in fig 3a and c where the pressure gradient is already important but the driving force for stripping is limited or slightly negative consequently the rates were overestimated when the hydraulic pressure was completely neglected light grey lines fig 4e the best approximation was again obtained with a mean mole fraction and pressure dark grey dash dotted line in conclusion the same relatively simple model eq 11 can be used to predict the liquid gas transfer rate of oxygen carbon dioxide nitrous oxide methane and nitrogen gas during biological wastewater treatment e g to apply in benchmark simulation models alex et al 2018 especially the effect of the pressure gradient was mimicked very well with a mean value as demonstrated by the identical expressions for the total transfer rate obtained with the complete pressure gradient and mean value combined with the inlet gas phase mole fraction eq 8 and eq 12 the effect of the mole fraction gradient could not be mimicked as well with an arithmetic mean fig 4b and c because this gradient is not always linear fig 2d and h but the approximation may be accurate enough for many applications a logarithmic mean mole fraction was not evaluated in this work because the analytical derivations with a mole fraction gradient could not provide a mechanistic explanation for the use of this more complex characteristic value nor could its mechanistic origins be traced back in literature spérandio and paul 1997 wiesmann et al 2006 furthermore this section focussed on a single value for the reactor height a rather high value of 10 m was chosen to clearly illustrate the effect of the different assumptions but the accompanying model selection tool can be used to do the same analysis for shallow or lab scale reactors the differences between the different assumptions will generally be smaller for more shallow reactors since the effect of the composition and pressure gradients becomes less pronounced section 4 2 3 4 remaining challenges the substances for which the total liquid gas transfer rate can be calculated are not limited to the provided examples other relevant substances for wastewater are nitric oxide hydrogen gas ammonia hydrogen sulfide dimethyl sulfoxide pentadecane benzene etc huang et al 2010 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2014 even so for very soluble substances like ammonia a correction factor is needed for the klai calculated with eq 16 as given by eq 21 lewis and whitman 1924 eq 21 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 k g i k l i k g i k l i h i here kg i and kl i m d 1 are the respective liquid and gas phase transfer coefficient since their ratio is typically around 40 for bubble aeration munz and roberts 1984 and henry coefficients of maximally 2 were considered during the simulations in this work table 3 this expression was simplified to eq 16 alternatively experimentally determined ratios between the transfer coefficients of a substance and oxygen can be used mattermuller et al 1981 or other correlations for klai can be applied arogo et al 1999 also the empirical relationship used to calculate the inlet gas flow rate is not generally valid eq 17 it was derived from experiments with bubble columns with coarse aeration at 20 c for superficial gas flow rates below 0 2 m s 1 van der lans 2000 yet other relationships from literature foley et al 2010 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 gavrilescu and roman 1994 kawase and mooyoung 1991 or measured values can be used in the same expressions table 2 and in the model selection tool the methodology presented in this work was designed to determine when why and how the gas phase mole fraction and pressure gradients should be considered to calculate the total liquid gas transfer rate several simplifying assumptions were made for this purpose during the analytical derivation e g the gradient of klai was neglected the gas phase was assumed in pseudo steady state no net change of the amount of gas was considered along the vertical direction i e there is no interaction between the transfer of different substances or the transfer of the substances compensate each other the liquid phase was assumed completely mixed the effect of the gas hold up on the pressure gradient was neglected and a uniform temperature was assumed in the gas and liquid phase supplementary information s2 the analytical solutions gave insight in the effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions 4 1 1 allowed the creation of a model selection tool in a spreadsheet 4 3 and can be substituted in existing models in any software with limited extra effort and computational demand because no extra differential equations are needed for example in the matlab implementations of the benchmark simulation models alex et al 2018 however the assumptions required for the analytical derivation also reduce the accuracy under specific circumstances for example for a very tall reactor the pseudo steady state assumption for the complete gas phase may become temporarily less appropriate immediately after a fast change in the liquid phase concentrations and or gas flow rate the derived analytical expressions are thus not meant as final universal models for liquid gas transfer other phenomena can still be included to the modellers wishes and these may require numerical solution methods for the gas phase mass balance eq s 1 for inspiration readers are referred to fiat et al 2019 who included transient conditions and the effect of the gas hold up and to van dijk et al 2018 who included non ideal liquid phase mixing the simulations in this work indicated that klai gradients do not necessarily have a strong effect on the total liquid gas transfer rate section 4 2 still there may be some conditions where the klai gradient is important given the still poorly understood dependency of this gradient on the sparger type liquid characteristics and gas flow rate amaral et al 2018 heijnen and van t riet 1984 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of the vertical gradient of the gas phase composition and pressure on the total stripping or absorption rate of volatile substances in tall reactors analytical expressions were derived for the total liquid gas transfer rate using either a comprehensive description of the mole fraction and pressure gradients or a uniform value for one or both of them the effects of the molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions on the liquid gas transfer rate are highly interactive and often non linear when both gradients are considered the mole fraction gradient influences the total transfer rate more for soluble substances the pressure gradient significantly influences the total transfer rate for soluble substances only under conditions that promote stripping while it becomes more important for very poorly soluble substances only under conditions that promote absorption also in case the kla gradient along the reactor height is significant the mole fraction and pressure gradients are important under the same conditions for typical reactor heights and operating conditions during aerobic biological wastewater treatment the hydraulic pressure was crucial to predict the absorption of oxygen and stripping of nitrogen gas while the mole fraction gradient was crucial as well for stripping of carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide moreover neither gradient was essential for methane stripping for wastewater treatment the effect of the mole fraction and pressure gradient may often be approximated by their mean

17916,gas bubbles are introduced in water to absorb or strip volatile substances in a variety of unit operations for example during waste water treatment to calculate the transfer rate of substances between the liquid phase and the gas phase different assumptions have been made in literature regarding the gas phase composition and hydraulic pressure which both vary along the reactor height in this study analytical expressions were derived for the total macroscopic liquid gas transfer rate using either the complete gradients of the mole fraction and pressure comprehensive approach or a uniform value for one or both of them simulations with the comprehensive model were performed to understand the effect of the type of volatile substance and of the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate these effects were found to be highly interactive and often non linear next the simulation results of the comprehensive model were compared with those from models that assume either a uniform mole fraction or a uniform pressure in the complete reactor volume this illustrated that for soluble substances the mole fraction gradient strongly affects the total liquid gas transfer rate while the pressure gradient became only important under operating conditions that promote stripping i e for a high concentration in the liquid phase and low concentration in the inlet gas for very poorly soluble substances the pressure became more important under conditions that promote absorption these results on the importance of the mole fraction and pressure gradients remained equally valid when explicitly considering a typical variation of the volumetric overall transfer coefficient kla along the reactor height finally a simple and fast procedure was made available through a spreadsheet to select appropriate simplifying assumptions in reactor or plant wide models by applying the procedure to oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 in an aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactor it was demonstrated that some common simplifications can lead to significant errors for which corrections were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords absorption stripping aeration emission bubble wastewater treatment 1 introduction the basic principles of absorption and stripping via the injection of gas bubbles have been long known lewis and whitman 1924 and have proven useful for the design and optimization of various unit processes gas bubbles are introduced for example to promote the oxidation of pollutants in biological wastewater treatment reactors to remove nitrogen gas n2 in a re aeration tank for better sludge settling henze et al 2008 to absorb carbon dioxide for neutralization of alkaline wastewaters gomolka and gomolka 1991 to absorb carbon dioxide and strip oxygen from photo bioreactors for faster photo autotrophic growth shoener et al 2019 sundarrajan et al 2019 to strip volatile pollutants to absorb reactive gases for advanced oxidation processes or disinfection hand et al 1999 and to oxygenate aquaculture ponds boyd 1998 or surface waters preece et al 2019 for biological wastewater treatment in particular liquid gas transfer models have been coupled to biological conversion models to find strategies that minimize the aeration energy requirements whilst providing sufficient oxygen o2 jeppsson et al 2007 olsson and andrews 1978 schulze and kooistra 1969 also emissions of hazardous volatile substances such as benzene from the reactors have been quantified with such models mattermuller et al 1981 melcer 1994 mozo et al 2012 more recently emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 during wastewater treatment have become a concern leading to the application of liquid gas transfer principles to find emission minimization strategies daelman et al 2014 hiatt and grady 2008 von schulthess and gujer 1996 moreover carbon dioxide co2 stripping has been included in biological wastewater treatment models to understand its impact on ph and to develop soft sensors flores alsina et al 2015 hellinga et al 1999 solon et al 2017 sötemann et al 2005 spérandio and paul 1997 vanhooren et al 2000 weissenbacher et al 2007 the transfer rate of a volatile substance i from a liquid phase into a gas phase ṁl g i g d 1 is commonly calculated as the product of an overall transfer coefficient kl i m d 1 area of the liquid gas interface aint m2 and a driving force expressed as the difference between the actual liquid phase concentration cl i g m 3 and the liquid phase equilibrium concentration corresponding with the prevailing gas phase concentration cl eq i g m 3 i e the actual solubility as shown in eq 1 lewis and whitman 1924 eq 1 m i l g k l i a int c i l c eq i l the liquid gas transfer rate is positive when the liquid phase concentration is higher than the equilibrium value which means stripping takes place conversely a negative value arises when the liquid phase concentration is lower than the equilibrium value which means absorption occurs the interfacial area aint is typically written as the product of the volume specific area ai m2 m 3 and the reactor volume v m3 resulting in eq 2 wiesmann et al 2006 eq 2 m i l g k l a i c i l c eq i l v in full scale reactors the liquid gas transfer rate can vary significantly along the reactor height because bubbles undergo several changes while rising to the surface firstly the composition of the gas changes due to the transfer of substances into or out from the rising bubbles the resulting gradient of the gas phase mole fraction of a substance influences its actual solubility cl eq i which in turn affects its transfer rate eq 2 secondly there is a hydraulic pressure gradient from the bottom to the top due to the weight of the water column which also influences the actual solubility cl eq i and thus the transfer rate wiesmann et al 2006 other phenomena also occur such as expansion and coalescence of the bubbles which create a vertical gradient of the specific interfacial area ai amaral et al 2018 consequently it is questionable whether eq 2 can always be used to calculate the total macroscopic liquid gas transfer rate in a full scale reactor this becomes a more pressing question now that reactors taller than 6 m become more popular for wastewater treatment e g aerobic granular sludge reactors de bruin et al 2013 wiesmann et al 2006 in literature the gas phase composition and pressure have been considered with a varying degree of detail to calculate the total liquid gas transfer rate in a reactor table 1 sometimes a uniform mole fraction is assumed throughout the reactor e g the value at the bottom of the reactor i e the content in the inlet gas often air at the top i e the content in the off gas or an arithmetic or logarithmic mean of both in the latter two cases the depletion or enrichment of the gas phase along the reactor height is considered in a simplified way wiesmann et al 2006 but some authors considered the complete gradient of the mole fraction comprehensively by assuming a plug flow this approach led to more accurate predictions of n2o emissions from a wastewater treatment reactor fiat et al 2019 analogously a uniform pressure is often assumed e g the value at the top of the reactor i e the atmospheric pressure or the arithmetic mean of the top and bottom value the latter approach accounts for the increased actual solubility due to the water column in a simplified way van der lans 2000 but some authors considered the pressure gradient comprehensively table 1 illustrates that many different assumptions have been used and that there is no clear relationship between the chosen assumptions and the volatile substance or reactor height under study nor is there a convergence towards one accepted model over time evidently there is a need to better understand the effect of the mole fraction and pressure gradients on the total liquid gas transfer rate under different circumstances so that future studies can make appropriate assumptions the goal of this study was to understand when and why the vertical gradients of the gas phase composition and pressure affect the total liquid gas transfer rate and which commonly used characteristic values for the mole fraction and pressure can mimic the effect of these gradients best to this end analytical expressions for the total liquid gas transfer rate were first derived using either a comprehensive description of the mole fraction and pressure gradients or a uniform value for one or both of them next the comprehensive model was used to assess the influence of the molecular properties of a theoretical substance and the reactor design and operating conditions these results were subsequently compared with those of models with either a uniform mole fraction or uniform pressure to identify when the respective mole fraction and pressure gradients significantly affect the total transfer rate finally a procedure was described to quickly determine whether and how the vertical mole fraction and or pressure gradients should be considered under specific conditions by comparing the output of all the alternative derived analytical expressions this procedure was illustrated for typical concentrations of o2 co2 ch4 n2o and n2 in the liquid phase and inlet gas of an aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactor in order to find out which common simplifications table 1 are acceptable and which are not 2 methodology 2 1 analytical derivation of the total liquid gas transfer rate an expression was derived for the steady state total liquid gas transfer rate of a substance i in a reactor under specified conditions a mass balance was first derived over an infinitesimal gas volume at vertical position z m eq 3 under the assumption of a completely mixed liquid phase a pseudo steady state of the local mass and a uniform volumetric overall transfer coefficient klai d 1 derivation in supplementary information s2 1 eq 3 dx i g z dz k l a i rta p atm g q in g m i c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z where xg i mole

for stripping δc g m 3 at position z can be recognized as eq 4 which is a function of the local mole fraction xi g and pressure pg as mentioned in the introduction eq 4 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z this mass balance eq 3 was solved to obtain an expression for the mole fraction as a function of the position in the reactor xg i z and the mole fraction at the top in the off gas xg out i in particular first the mass balance was solved as a differential equation with boundary condition xg i z 0 xg in i while the driving force on the right hand side was described with a position dependent mole fraction xg i and pressure pg eq 5 eq 5 p g z p atm g ρ g h z where ρ kg m 3 is the density of the water g m s 2 the gravitational acceleration and h m the reactor height h then the mass balance was repeatedly solved with different combinations of one or more of the following simplifications the mole fraction in the driving force on the right hand side was approximated by a uniform value i e the value at the bottom or top of the reactor or the arithmetic mean the pressure in the driving force on the right hand side was approached by a uniform value i e the value at the top or the mean over the reactor the derivative on the left hand side was discretised over two points the bottom and the top of the reactor corresponding to a completely mixed gas phase there are dozens of possible combinations of these simplifications but 8 were selected to answer the research questions posed in this work when and why do the gradients of the mole fraction and pressure affect liquid gas transfer eq 7 eq 9 and which commonly used uniform values for the mole fraction and pressure can mimic these effects best eq 10 eq 15 for each set of assumptions the mole fraction at the top of the reactor xg out i was calculated supplementary information s2 2 and introduced in the steady state mass balance over the total gas volume in the reactor which reads as eq 6 after assuming a pseudo state gas phase and neglecting changes in the total molar gas flow supplementary information s2 3 eq 6 m i l g q in g p atm g m i rt x out i g x in i g this resulted in the final expressions for the total liquid gas transfer rate in table 2 2 2 simulations during all simulations the average overall transfer coefficient klai and inlet gas flow rate qg in were expressed as a function of the overall transfer coefficient of oxygen klao2 respectively via eq 16 de heyder et al 1997 and eq 17 van der lans 2000 eq 16 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 eq 17 q in g k l a o 2 a p atm g ρ g h 2 0 6 p atm g where di m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient this was necessary to ensure coherent values since klai and qg in are interdependent 2 2 1 effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions the model that comprehensively considered the gradients of the mole fraction and pressure was used to understand the effect of different molecular properties of a theoretical substance i and the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 first a qualitative sensitivity analysis was performed by examining the analytical expression and its partial derivatives gujer 2008 supplementary information s3 1 then the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 mole fraction eq s 15 and driving force eq 4 were quantitatively determined for different parameter values table 3 four extreme scenarios were investigated a very poorly soluble i e very low hi and a soluble i e moderate hi substance under operating conditions that promote stripping i e a high liquid phase concentration cl i 10 g m 3 and low inlet mole fraction xg in i 0 and under operating conditions that promote absorption i e a low liquid phase concentration cl i 0 g m 3 and high inlet mole fraction xg in i 0 1 for each of these scenarios a range of typical reactor heights h was investigated 2 2 2 importance of mole fraction and pressure gradients to investigate when the mole fraction and or pressure gradient significantly affects the total liquid gas transfer rate the results of the comprehensive model eq 7 were compared with that of the model that only ignores the mole fraction gradient eq 8 and the model that only ignores the hydrostatic pressure gradient eq 9 for the parameter values in table 3 to verify that the conclusions drawn from this comparison are not influenced by the assumption of a uniform klai the mass balance eq 3 was also numerically solved via the ode45 solver in matlab for each of the three assumptions for the mole fraction and pressure combined with an imposed klai gradient eq 18 the average klai was unchanged for a fair comparison but the local klai was assumed to decrease linearly by a factor 2 from the bottom to the top of the reactor based on the experimental observations by amaral et al 2018 eq 18 k l a i z k l a o 2 d i d o 2 4 3 2 3 h z the resulting numerical solution for the mole fraction gradient for the three sets of assumptions were substituted in eq 6 to find the respective total liquid gas transfer rates 2 2 3 procedure for model selection a spreadsheet is provided in the supplementary information that calculates the total liquid gas transfer rate with all the alternative derived equations table 2 and shows with colours which simplifications approach the results of the comprehensive model the procedure for model selection that can be performed with this tool was demonstrated in this work for five substances that are often considered in aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactors table 1 oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 the molecular properties of these substances and typical concentrations in the inlet gas and liquid phase were used table 4 these parameter values cover a wide range of aerobic wastewater treatment technologies e g aerobic granular sludge reactors sharon reactors membrane bioreactors etc to ensure that the comprehensive model eq 7 is a suitable reference it was validated supplementary information s5 with oxygen absorption rates obtained for different inlet gas flow rates and reactor heights wagner and popel 1998 and nitrous oxide emission rates under a fluctuating gas flow rate temperature and liquid phase concentration baresel et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions in this section the comprehensive model which considers the mole fraction and pressure gradient was used to understand the effect of molecular properties the reactor design and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 this was first done qualitatively by analysing the analytical expression and then quantitatively to better understand the non linear and interactive effects 3 1 1 qualitative sensitivity analysis the total liquid gas transfer rate and its partial derivatives were examined to qualitatively assess the effect of changing parameter values supplementary information s3 1 notwithstanding the apparent complexity of the expression eq 7 the total transfer rate is a linear function of the cross sectional area a overall transfer coefficient of oxygen klao2 inlet mole fraction xg in i liquid phase concentration cl i and molar mass mi klao2 and a even act as simple proportionality factors so if the aeration intensity klao2 or reactor area a double the stripping or absorption rate doubles as well the partial derivatives confirmed the intuitive expectations that an increase of the inlet mole fraction xg in i or molar mass mi decreases the liquid gas transfer rate in other words the stripping rate ṁl g i decreases if stripping takes place ṁl g i 0 and the absorption rate ṁl g i increases if absorption takes place ṁl g i 0 this can be understood by the corresponding decrease of the driving force for stripping eq 4 conversely an increase of the liquid phase concentration cl i increases the stripping rate ṁl g i and decreases the absorption rate ṁl g i the partial derivatives showed that the strength of the effect of one parameter always depends on the value of other parameters due to interactive effects multiplications furthermore the effects of the reactor height h diffusion coefficient di and henry coefficient hi are non linear to obtain more insight into these non linear and interactive effects a quantitative sensitivity analysis was performed in the following section 4 1 2 table 5 summarizes the effects that were disclosed via the qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analysis 3 1 2 quantitative sensitivity analysis for extreme cases of stripping absorption and solubility simulations of the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 mole fraction gradient eq s 15 pressure gradient eq 5 and driving force gradient eq 4 were performed for a range of reactor heights in four extreme cases table 3 which are explained in the following order a very poorly soluble substance very low henry coefficient under conditions that promote stripping a high liquid phase concentration and low inlet gas content or absorption a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content and a soluble substance moderate henry coefficient under the same two conditions fig 2 for a very poorly soluble substance the stripping rate increased almost linearly with an increasing reactor height grey line fig 2a this is mainly because the gas has a longer residence time in a taller reactor so there was more time for transfer to take place as a result a higher mole fraction of the volatile substance was obtained at the top of the reactor solid versus dashed grey line fig 2b however the mole fraction gradient was slightly less steep for a taller reactor this can be explained by the increased pressure inside the reactor caused by the taller water column solid versus dashed line fig 2c which increased the equilibrium liquid phase concentration actual solubility in turn and thus led to a slightly weaker driving force for stripping solid versus dashed grey line fig 2d this pressure effect explains the marginally concave curve of the stripping rate with a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content absorption occurred only slowly for a very poorly soluble substance because of its tendency to reside in the gas phase grey line on fig 2e plotted on the secondary y axis the absorption rate ṁl g i increased convexly with an increasing reactor height this illustrates that the effect of the reactor height is not only non linear but also interactive as it can stimulate stripping in one case fig 2a and stimulate absorption in the other fig 2e the increase of the absorption rate with an increasing reactor height can be explained by the longer residence time of the gas which resulted in a lower mole fraction at the top of the reactor solid versus dashed grey line fig 2f yet the mole fraction gradient was steeper for a taller reactor since the higher hydrostatic pressure fig 2g increased the actual solubility cl eq i and thus led to a stronger driving force for absorption δc solid versus dashed grey line fig 2h this pressure effect explains the convexity of the absorption rate curve for a soluble substance the stripping rate was always lower than for a very poorly soluble substance since it has a stronger tendency to reside in the liquid phase black line fig 2a the stripping rate still increased with an increasing reactor height but the concavity was much more pronounced diminishing the slope strongly when the reactor was taller than 2 m as discussed before the higher transfer rate was due to the longer residence time of the gas but this effect was now counteracted by saturation of the gas phase with the substance around 2 m above the reactor bottom black lines fig 2b the maximal gas phase content was nearly reached because the substance was soluble the steep decrease of the driving force along the vertical direction also shows that an equilibrium was almost reached between the gas and liquid phase black lines fig 2d nevertheless a small driving force remained until the top of the reactor this was caused by the gradual decrease of the pressure fig 2c generating a gradual decrease of the actual solubility cl eq i and thus a slow continued release of the substance into the gas phase consequently the pressure gradient explains the continued slow increase of the gas phase mole fraction from 2 m on fig 2b fast absorption occurred when a soluble substance was present at a low liquid phase concentration and high inlet gas content black line fig 2e the absorption rate increased concavely with an increasing reactor height the increase was again caused by the higher gas residence time but this effect was counteracted by the depletion of the gas phase before reaching the top of the reactor black lines fig 2f equilibrium between the gas and liquid phase was already almost reached at around 2 m above the reactor bottom black lines fig 2h the slow continued increase of the liquid gas transfer rate for reactors higher than 2 m was simply due to the choice of a fixed klao2 during the simulations which led to a higher gas flow rate qg in with an increasing reactor height eq 17 apart from the non linear effect of the reactor height and its interactions with the solubility hi and operating conditions xg in i and cl i also the non linear effects of the diffusion and henry coefficient and their interactions were investigated quantitatively supplementary information s3 2 a higher henry coefficient convexly decreased the stripping rate ṁl g i in case of stripping ṁl g i 0 and concavely increased the absorption rate ṁl g i in case of absorption ṁl g i 0 since a higher solubility always decreases the driving force for stripping eq 4 in contrast a higher diffusion coefficient concavely increased both the stripping and absorption rate via its effect on the overall transfer coefficient klai eq 16 3 2 importance of mole fraction and pressure gradients to identify when and why the respective mole fraction and or pressure gradients become important this section compared the comprehensive model eq 7 with the model that ignores the enrichment or depletion of the inlet gas uniform mole fraction eq 8 and the model that ignores the hydrostatic pressure uniform pressure eq 9 completely a plug flow was always considered in the gas phase for a fair comparison whenever there was a deviation from the comprehensive model the respective gradient that was ignored had a significant effect on the total transfer rate the mass balances eq 3 and eq 6 were also numerically solved with a typical gradient of the klai eq 18 to verify that the conclusions are robust for a very poorly soluble substance the mole fraction gradient could be neglected to calculate the stripping rate without a significant loss in accuracy whatever the reactor height solid grey and black lines fig 3a this is because the driving force for stripping stayed at a nearly uniform high value all along the reactor height under these conditions grey lines fig 2d mathematically this can be seen if a very low value of the henry coefficient hi and high liquid phase concentration are used in eq 4 the driving force can then be estimated by the liquid phase concentration eq 19 which is no longer a function of the mole fraction gradient eq 19 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z c i l 0 0001 p g z m i rt x i g z c i l f z for the same reason the model assuming a uniform pressure predicted nearly the same stripping rate dashed black line fig 3a in conclusion neither the mole fraction or pressure gradient were important to estimate the stripping rate of a very poorly soluble substance the absorption rate of a very poorly soluble substance could also be accurately calculated without consideration of the mole fraction gradient solid grey and black lines fig 3c this is because the mole fraction stayed near its inlet value all along the reactor height grey lines fig 2f this can be explained by the poor solubility of the substance which made the total transfer rate low since the mole fraction was nearly uniform the gradient of the driving force was mainly determined by the pressure gradient eq 20 and thus both gradients had a similar shape grey line fig 2g and h eq 20 δc z c i l h i p g z m i rt x i g z c i l h i p g z m i rt x in i g as the driving force was strongly determined by the pressure gradient the model without pressure gradient deviated from the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3b this deviation increased with increasing reactor height due to the higher hydraulic pressure in conclusion only the pressure gradient was important to estimate the absorption rate of a very poorly soluble substance for a soluble substance the stripping rate was strongly overestimated when the gas phase mole fraction was assumed uniform especially for tall reactors solid grey and black lines fig 3b this is because the mole fraction showed a significant increase along the reactor height black lines fig 2b while the content in the inlet gas was always lower since the gas phase mole fraction was underestimated the driving force and thus also the stripping rate were overestimated in contrast the model with a uniform pressure showed only a minor deviation from the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3b e g 11 difference for a 10 m tall reactor the results were similar because the near saturation of the gas phase mole fraction black lines fig 2b was still considered however the actual solubility cl eq i was slightly underestimated by neglecting the hydrostatic pressure especially near the reactor bottom consequently the average driving force along the reactor height and thus also the stripping rate were slightly overestimated in conclusion especially the mole fraction gradient was important to estimate stripping rate of a soluble substance but also the pressure had a moderate effect the absorption rate of a soluble substance was strongly overestimated when the mole fraction gradient was neglected solid grey and black lines fig 3d this is because the mole fraction decreased steeply from the bottom towards top due to the tendency of the substance to reside in the liquid phase black lines fig 2f therefore the gas phase content was consistently overestimated when considering only the inlet gas composition consequently the driving force and thus also the absorption rate were overestimated conversely the model with a uniform pressure predicted nearly the same absorption rate as the comprehensive model dashed black line fig 3d this is because already the complete available amount in the gas phase transferred to the liquid phase black lines fig 2f so inclusion of the hydraulic pressure did not enhance the absorption rate any further in conclusion only the mole fraction gradient was important to estimate the absorption rate of a soluble substance to verify the robustness of these conclusions the same three models were compared but now also considering a typical klai gradient eq 18 fig 1 the total liquid gas transfer rate hardly changed when a klai gradient was considered instead of a uniform value supplementary information s4 the largest change was encountered with the tallest reactor height 10 m for absorption but even then it was less than 4 higher more importantly the same conditions led to large deviations between the comprehensive model and the models with a uniform mole fraction and uniform pressure respectively consequently the conclusions drawn earlier for the importance of the mole fraction and pressure gradient under different conditions are robust 3 3 procedure for model selection whereas the extreme scenarios investigated until now illustrated when and why the gas phase mole fraction and or pressure gradients significantly affect the total liquid gas transfer rate this section investigated for which more realistic scenarios these effects can be incorporated in a simplified way via a mixed gas phase 3 3 1 spreadsheet for model comparison given the non linearity and interactions table 5 it is hard to envisage the effect of different molecular properties reactor designs and operating conditions on the total liquid gas transfer rate without explicit calculation therefore a spreadsheet is provided in the supplementary information which automatically calculates the total liquid gas transfer rate eq 7 after entering the parameter values of interest and compares it with the simplified models table 2 the user can define the required accuracy and a green colour automatically indicates which simplified models can be used under these conditions this can help to decide whether to include neglect or simplify the gradients of the mole fraction and or pressure in the gas phase for each specific application to balance the complexity with the required accuracy this is a more rational approach than a choice based on intuition or reports of very specific conditions where a certain gradient appeared to be important e g fiat et al 2019 showed that the mole fraction gradient was important to accurately estimate the n2o emissions in a 4 m high biological active filter 3 3 2 application to aerobic biological wastewater treatment o2 co2 ch4 n2o and n2 for typical concentrations of volatile substances in the gas and liquid phase of an aerobic wastewater treatment reactor the applicability was assessed of the models that assume a mixed gas phase with different uniform values for the mole fraction and pressure eq 10 eq 15 via comparison with the comprehensive model fig 4 as such the popular approaches in literature were critically evaluated table 1 and improvements were proposed for dissolved oxygen absorption was predicted by all models fig 4a the absorption rate also decreased with an increasing liquid phase concentration for all models since a smaller difference between the liquid phase concentration and the equilibrium value always decreases the driving force eq 4 even though the trends were the same some simplifications led to a strong deviation from the comprehensive model especially when only the pressure at the top of the reactor was considered light grey lines the absorption rate was severely underestimated this is caused by the rather poor solubility of oxygen ho2 0 0337 and high content in the inlet gas xg in o2 20 946 as explained in see section 4 2 yet also the models that mimicked the effect of the pressure gradient via the mean value showed a significant deviation when combined with the mole fraction at the top or bottom dark grey dashed and dotted lines this shows that the solubility of oxygen is still high enough 337 times higher than the extreme in section 4 2 to have a visible effect of the mole fraction gradient this scenario thus lies between the extremes in fig 3c and d where the mole fraction gradient already starts to have an influence while the pressure gradient is still important nevertheless these effects of the mole fraction and pressure gradients could be mimicked very well through their mean values dark grey dash dotted line this rather simple equation eq 11 may thus provide a good balance between complexity and accuracy for oxygen absorption in wastewater treatment reactors it would be an improvement compared to the many models in literature that neglect one or both gradients completely table 1 for carbon dioxide net stripping was predicted by all models fig 4b the stripping rate decreased with an increasing liquid phase concentration for all models since a larger difference with the equilibrium value always increases the driving force eq 4 similar trends were observed for nitrous oxide fig 4c even though the trends were the same for the different models a severe overestimation occurred when only the mole fraction at the bottom was considered dashed lines this is explained by the rather high solubility hco2 0 9864 and hn2o 0 6965 and low inlet gas mole fraction xg in co2 0 04 and xg in n2o 333 ppb as explained in section 4 2 none of the simplified models visually overlapped with the comprehensive model since also the pressure gradient is important for stripping of soluble substances fig 3b and none of the approximations of the mole fraction gradient with a uniform value are perfect the best approximation was obtained with the values at the top of the reactor light gey dotted line this is in line with the near complete saturation of the gas phase at the top of the reactor solid black lines on fig 2d however also the model using the mean mole fraction and pressure gave reasonable results dark grey dash dotted line as such the same expression could be used as for oxygen and the accuracy would already greatly improve compared to the many models in literature that neglect one or both gradients completely table 1 for methane stripping the simplified models did not only predict a similar trend as the comprehensive model but they also predicted very similar values fig 4d this can be explained by the low solubility hch4 0 0351 and atmospheric content xg in ch4 1 8 ppm which approximates the ideal case in fig 3a where neither the mole fraction nor the pressure gradient have a strong effect the models with a uniform mole fraction at the off gas or inlet value dashed and dotted lines showed the biggest though still limited deviation from the reference model this is because the solubility of methane is still high enough 351 times higher than the extreme scenario in section 4 2 to have a slight influence of the mole fraction gradient the mean value of the mole fraction and pressure dark grey dash dotted line gave the best approximation again nitrogen gas stripping was predicted for most of the considered liquid phase concentrations fig 4e nitrogen gas has a very poor solubility hn2 0 0172 but given the very high atmospheric content xg in n2 78 the driving force for stripping was not very strong eq 4 therefore some absorption ṁl g n2 0 was predicted for low liquid phase concentrations this corresponds to a scenario between the extreme cases in fig 3a and c where the pressure gradient is already important but the driving force for stripping is limited or slightly negative consequently the rates were overestimated when the hydraulic pressure was completely neglected light grey lines fig 4e the best approximation was again obtained with a mean mole fraction and pressure dark grey dash dotted line in conclusion the same relatively simple model eq 11 can be used to predict the liquid gas transfer rate of oxygen carbon dioxide nitrous oxide methane and nitrogen gas during biological wastewater treatment e g to apply in benchmark simulation models alex et al 2018 especially the effect of the pressure gradient was mimicked very well with a mean value as demonstrated by the identical expressions for the total transfer rate obtained with the complete pressure gradient and mean value combined with the inlet gas phase mole fraction eq 8 and eq 12 the effect of the mole fraction gradient could not be mimicked as well with an arithmetic mean fig 4b and c because this gradient is not always linear fig 2d and h but the approximation may be accurate enough for many applications a logarithmic mean mole fraction was not evaluated in this work because the analytical derivations with a mole fraction gradient could not provide a mechanistic explanation for the use of this more complex characteristic value nor could its mechanistic origins be traced back in literature spérandio and paul 1997 wiesmann et al 2006 furthermore this section focussed on a single value for the reactor height a rather high value of 10 m was chosen to clearly illustrate the effect of the different assumptions but the accompanying model selection tool can be used to do the same analysis for shallow or lab scale reactors the differences between the different assumptions will generally be smaller for more shallow reactors since the effect of the composition and pressure gradients becomes less pronounced section 4 2 3 4 remaining challenges the substances for which the total liquid gas transfer rate can be calculated are not limited to the provided examples other relevant substances for wastewater are nitric oxide hydrogen gas ammonia hydrogen sulfide dimethyl sulfoxide pentadecane benzene etc huang et al 2010 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2014 even so for very soluble substances like ammonia a correction factor is needed for the klai calculated with eq 16 as given by eq 21 lewis and whitman 1924 eq 21 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 k g i k l i k g i k l i h i here kg i and kl i m d 1 are the respective liquid and gas phase transfer coefficient since their ratio is typically around 40 for bubble aeration munz and roberts 1984 and henry coefficients of maximally 2 were considered during the simulations in this work table 3 this expression was simplified to eq 16 alternatively experimentally determined ratios between the transfer coefficients of a substance and oxygen can be used mattermuller et al 1981 or other correlations for klai can be applied arogo et al 1999 also the empirical relationship used to calculate the inlet gas flow rate is not generally valid eq 17 it was derived from experiments with bubble columns with coarse aeration at 20 c for superficial gas flow rates below 0 2 m s 1 van der lans 2000 yet other relationships from literature foley et al 2010 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 gavrilescu and roman 1994 kawase and mooyoung 1991 or measured values can be used in the same expressions table 2 and in the model selection tool the methodology presented in this work was designed to determine when why and how the gas phase mole fraction and pressure gradients should be considered to calculate the total liquid gas transfer rate several simplifying assumptions were made for this purpose during the analytical derivation e g the gradient of klai was neglected the gas phase was assumed in pseudo steady state no net change of the amount of gas was considered along the vertical direction i e there is no interaction between the transfer of different substances or the transfer of the substances compensate each other the liquid phase was assumed completely mixed the effect of the gas hold up on the pressure gradient was neglected and a uniform temperature was assumed in the gas and liquid phase supplementary information s2 the analytical solutions gave insight in the effect of molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions 4 1 1 allowed the creation of a model selection tool in a spreadsheet 4 3 and can be substituted in existing models in any software with limited extra effort and computational demand because no extra differential equations are needed for example in the matlab implementations of the benchmark simulation models alex et al 2018 however the assumptions required for the analytical derivation also reduce the accuracy under specific circumstances for example for a very tall reactor the pseudo steady state assumption for the complete gas phase may become temporarily less appropriate immediately after a fast change in the liquid phase concentrations and or gas flow rate the derived analytical expressions are thus not meant as final universal models for liquid gas transfer other phenomena can still be included to the modellers wishes and these may require numerical solution methods for the gas phase mass balance eq s 1 for inspiration readers are referred to fiat et al 2019 who included transient conditions and the effect of the gas hold up and to van dijk et al 2018 who included non ideal liquid phase mixing the simulations in this work indicated that klai gradients do not necessarily have a strong effect on the total liquid gas transfer rate section 4 2 still there may be some conditions where the klai gradient is important given the still poorly understood dependency of this gradient on the sparger type liquid characteristics and gas flow rate amaral et al 2018 heijnen and van t riet 1984 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of the vertical gradient of the gas phase composition and pressure on the total stripping or absorption rate of volatile substances in tall reactors analytical expressions were derived for the total liquid gas transfer rate using either a comprehensive description of the mole fraction and pressure gradients or a uniform value for one or both of them the effects of the molecular properties reactor design and operating conditions on the liquid gas transfer rate are highly interactive and often non linear when both gradients are considered the mole fraction gradient influences the total transfer rate more for soluble substances the pressure gradient significantly influences the total transfer rate for soluble substances only under conditions that promote stripping while it becomes more important for very poorly soluble substances only under conditions that promote absorption also in case the kla gradient along the reactor height is significant the mole fraction and pressure gradients are important under the same conditions for typical reactor heights and operating conditions during aerobic biological wastewater treatment the hydraulic pressure was crucial to predict the absorption of oxygen and stripping of nitrogen gas while the mole fraction gradient was crucial as well for stripping of carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide moreover neither gradient was essential for methane stripping for wastewater treatment the effect of the mole fraction and pressure gradient may often be approximated by their mean

17917,extracellular polymeric substances eps have been considered as a barrier for toxic species penetration into the cells but their function in protecting electroactive biofilms eabs had been rarely revealed in this study the anode potential was used to regulate the eps quantity and components in mixed culture eabs where their resistance to ag shock was assessed the results showed that the eab grown at 0 v showed the highest anti shock capability by the ag exposure compared to those grown at 0 2 0 2 and 0 4 v the eab produced at 0 v had both of the highest amounts of loosely bound eps lb eps 61 9 mg eps g vss and tightly bound eps tb eps 74 8 mg eps g vss than those grown under other potentials where proteins and humic acid were the predominated components the abundance of genes associated with eps biosynthesis were also confirmed to be related with the applied anode potentials based on the metagenomic analysis considering proteins and humic acid in lb eps showed positive linearity with the current recovery and viability of the eabs these two main components might play important roles in reducing the ag toxicity synchronous fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy integrated two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analyses further confirmed that the oxygen and nitrogen moieties i e amide carbonyl co phenolic and c o c in proteins and humic acid of the lb eps were response for the binding with the ag to prevent the penetration into the cells the underlying molecular mechanisms of eps in protecting eabs from the ag shock explored in this study can provide implications for developing new methods to construct highly stable eabs graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps electroactive biofilms eabs anode potential ag shock anti shock capability 1 introduction as the most important part of bioelectrochemical system bes electrochemically active biofilms eabs can directly exchange electrons with extracellular solid carriers i e electrodes to generate electricity borole et al 2011 sevda et al 2018 however recent researches have shown that eabs are vulnerable to external disturbances especially heavy metals shock antibiotic exposure and ph changes logan and regan 2006 lovley 2012 the electron pathways and mass transfer inside eabs can be greatly changed by external disturbances chen et al 2015a men et al 2015 patil et al 2011 which consequently inhibits the bio electrocatalytic activity of bess li et al 2016 logan 2009 logan et al 2006 therefore strengthening the stability of eabs has become an issue of great concern for practical applications of bess extracellular polymeric substances eps mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and lipids flemming et al 2016 and have the ability to enhance

a permeability barrier to hinder intracellular penetration of metal ions nocelli et al 2016 von canstein et al 2008 in addition eps have been reported to significantly increase the resistance of biofilms to antibiotics and disinfectants through mechanisms including the creation of complex structures limitation of the transportation of xenobiotics and retention of the organic matter in the biofilms xue et al 2012 the groups e g amino carboxyl and phenol in eps have been considered to be the active sites for complexing various toxicants to increase the resistance of biofilms duan et al 2013 zhu et al 2012 these results provide valuable insights regarding the protection of eabs against external stresses such as heavy metals and antibiotics by stimulating eps formation recent studies have shown that controlling the operation parameters of bess can regulate the formation and structure of eabs on electrode surface to enhance their activities in recent studies electrode potentials have been confirmed to be significant in regulating biofilm formation and optimizing bes performance patil et al 2011 peng et al 2016 carmona martínez et al found that the biofilm biomass and current density in shewanellaputrefaciens inoculated bes increased with elevated anode potential carmona martínez et al 2013 li et al 2017 proved that geobacter biofilms developed at 0 2 0 4 v had the highest cytochrome c contents and reducing capacities among biofilms grown under various conditions peng et al 2016 found that exocellular electron transfer pathways rather than biofilm community variation were responsible for different eab activities at various set potentials in addition to the electrochemical activity of the biofilms the production and structure of eps were highly affected by the applied anode potential in pure culture geobacter biofilms yang et al 2019a however the variations in eps composition in mixed culture eabs at different anode potentials have not yet been clearly clarified moreover the role of eps in eabs for protecting biofilms from anti shock effects has remained largely unexplored therefore the aim of this study is to investigate eps variations in mixed culture eabs formed at different potentials and evaluate their effects on the stability of eabs against metal ion shock eabs were constructed at four different anode potentials i e 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v vs sce where the variations in eps in the as formed biofilms were examined ag one of the most toxic metal ions for bacteria silver et al 2006 was chosen as the external stimulation to explore the anti shock properties of the eabs as the biofilms became mature the relationship between the eps composition and the tolerance of eabs was established to elucidate the key components of eps in protecting eabs against ag shock to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to link the electrode potential eps composition and the resistance to external stimulation for a mixed culture eab the results may be useful for establishing highly stable eabs against external stresses and broadening their application of in the bes platform for environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 electroactive biofilm growth and ag exposure the eabs on the electrodes were developed using a single chamber bes the bes was constructed using 100 ml cylindrical glass container and a polytetrafluoroethylene lid where graphite plates 1 0 2 0 cm and titanium wire were used as the working and counter electrodes respectively and a saturated calom electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the reactors were run in duplicates at 30 c which were inoculated with 20 ml effluent of a previous well operating bes originally acclimated from anaerobic sludge yuan et al 2011 a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000c ch instrument shanghai china was used to set four different anode potentials 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v vs sce to enrich eabs and record the current generations of the

prepared by dissolving agno3 in deionized water after the mature eabs were achieved the anodes were taken out and inserted into the 60 mg l ag solution in duration of exposure 1 2 and 3 h the anodes were then washed using distilled water to remove ag solution and re installed in the bess for electrochemical tests the eabs were carefully scratched off the electrodes with a cell scraper for the eps extraction quantification and characterization 2 2 eab characterization chronoamperometry was used to record the current generation of the bess with a multichannel potentiostat turnover cyclic

software xue et al 2012 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis of eabs samples from the biofilm layers at the working electrode were gently scraped from the biofilm carriers under sterile conditions after centrifugation microbial dna was extracted from the residual biomass using an eznatm mag bind soil dna kit omega ga usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the v3 v4

after screening the sequence data for each operational taxonomic unit out were assigned using usearch v5 2 236 with 97 sequence identity the results were classified at the phylum and genus levels in addition to better understand the potential functional contributions of the observed microbes the metagenomic information for the biofilm was investigated according to yin et al 2018 the extracted dna

treated eabs were extracted following a method described previously cao et al 2011 yang et al 2019b for eps extraction 3 parallel graphite plates were merged into one eab sample and eps were extracted in triplicate in brief the eabs were first resuspended in 5 ml of nacl solution 0 9 and the suspension was further diluted with a solution that had been preheated to 70 c to maintain a temperature of 35 c in the final solution the resulting suspension was then sheared by a vortex mixer for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the organic matter in the supernatant was collected as the loosely bound eps lb eps cao et al 2011 the remaining bacterial pellet in the centrifuge tube after centrifugation was resuspended in 5 ml of 0 9 nacl solution the suspension was then sonicated for 10 min centrifuged at 5000 g for 20 min and washed two times using 0 9 nacl solution the tightly bound eps tb eps in the suspension was finally collected after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter yang et al 2019b polysaccharides in the collected eps were determined by the anthrone method larsson and tornkvist 1996 the protein and humic acid contents were measured by a bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce and a modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 respectively dna was measured by the diphenylamine colorimetric method burton 1956 the concentration of the eps components was expressed as a function of the vss of the biofilms mg g vss fig s1 then the structure of lb eps was analyzed using fluorescence eem excitation emission matrix using a luminescence spectrometer fls1000 edinburgh co uk shou et al 2018 the spectra were collected from 300 to 550 nm at 0 5 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm at 10 nm increments clsm was also applied to investigate the distribution of eps components in the biofilms the detailed information for the staining procedures is described in the supporting information si 1 2 5 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos fluorescence and ftir analyses 2dcos fluorescence and ftir analyses were performed to collect fluorescence and ftir spectra of lb eps with added ag concentrations in the range of 0 20 mg l as an external perturbation according to a previous study chen et al 2015b briefly a mixture of lb eps and ag was adjusted to ph 7 0 and shaken for 12 h at 25 c to ensure complete reaction equilibrium before conducting fluorescence and ftir measurements approximately 5 ml of each solution was amended with 0 04 m kno3 to maintain background ionic strength and then analyzed in three scans by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy edinburgh fs5 uk the excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the excitation wavelength range was set as 250 550 nm in 0 5 nm increments and a scan rate of 1000 nm min was used the remaining eps solutions were firstly freeze dried and then mixed with kbr ir grade using an agate grinder the mixture was compressed and subjected to the ftir measurements by a spectrum 8900 ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher usa the scanning conditions were as follows a spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 and a resolution of 4 cm 1 to illustrate the effect of ag on the structural variations in eps more clearly each of the spectra was adjusted by subtracting the spectrum without ag addition 2dcos analysis was performed using 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan prior to 2dcos analysis the ftir spectra were normalized and denoised by savitzky golay smoothing more detailed information on the mathematical procedures associated with 2d cos can be found in the supporting information si 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 eab resistance to ag toxicity at various anode potentials the mixed culture eabs were grown by inoculating effluents from a well operated bes where the current response was recorded by a potentiostat as shown in fig 1 a the currents under various anode potentials cycled over time after refilling the reactor with fresh substrate stable currents were achieved from the third refilling which indicated that the biofilms had become mature sem of the eabs showed the homogeneous growth of microorganisms on the graphite plates under all anode potentials fig s2 the maximum current density of the eabs was found to depend on the applied anode potential at 0 2 v the eab yielded a current density of 2 7 0 3 ma cm2 which was higher than those at 0 v 2 5 0 2 ma cm2 0 2 v 2 2 0 1 ma cm2 and 0 4 v 1 9 0 1 ma cm2 similar current responses were also observed from the cv scans under turnover conditions fig 1b a previous study also demonstrated that the eab at 0 2 v yielded the highest catalytic activity among investigated eabs li et al 2017 the underlying mechanism may be that an anode potential of 0 2 v could benefit eab metabolic activity due to the difference between the anode potential and the standard biological redox potential of the substrate li et al 2017 besides the amount of the eabs biomass under different anode potentials was in high accordance with the variation of current densities which was consistent with the previous finding by molenaar et al 2018 the highest amount of biomass was obtained for the eabs formed at 0 2 v than those at other anode potentials fig s1 suggesting that this potential is favorable for the formation of biofilm as well the mature eabs were further investigated for their resistance to ag shock however after being exposed to ag solution for 3 h the current recovery ratios were 3 2 40 0 18 5 and 15 8 for the eabs corresponding to 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v respectively fig 1c interestingly a maximum current density of 1 0 0 1 ma cm2 was obtained from the eab formed at 0 v which was significantly higher than those at other potentials these results indicated that the eab at 0 v not that at 0 2 v had the highest antishock capability notably no significant decrease in current was observed when the same eab at 0 v was treated in a kno3 solution fig s3 suggesting that the decrease in current resulted from ag exposure not the operation process i e moving electrode and oxygen exposure or toxicity of no3 in addition the antishock properties of the eabs were further evaluated by exposing the eabs to ag with different concentrations and duration periods as shown in fig s4 the current recovery of the eab formed at 0 v was the least affected by the low concentration of ag and short duration period to further confirm the adverse effect of ag shock the viability of the eabs was analyzed with fluorescent staining to distinguish live versus dead cells as shown in fig 2 a all the original electrodes were covered by the stained eabs with a varied thickness from 45 to 60 μm which are similar to those previously reported sun et al 2015 the thickest biofilm was obtained at 0 2 v indicating that the growth of exoelectrogens was favored at this potential in addition a typical two layer structure of the eabs a live outer layer and a dead inner core layer was observed which was in agreement with eabs developed by other researcher sun et al 2015 for all the eabs cells on the top layer were dead red in color after treatment with ag solution the ratios of live to dead cells before and after ag exposure was shown in fig 2b which had a similar tendency to the recovery ratios of current a viability of 39 2 was observed for the eab formed at 0 v which was also higher than other eabs indicating that more cells survived in this eab after ag exposure therefore the eabs developed at 0 v displayed the highest ag resistance in terms of electroactivity and cell viability even though the highest amount of biomass was obtained for the original eabs formed at 0 2 v fig s1 3 2 anode potential modulated the eps production in biofilms as previous studies have reported eps play important roles in protecting biofilms against external stress lai et al 2018 li et al 2019 wang et al 2013 xue et al 2012 in this regard the structure and components of the eps were analyzed and the values varied among the eabs formed at different anode potentials fig 3 a a total amount of 92 5 136 7 122 1 and 109 5 mg eps g vss could be produced from the eabs formed at 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v respectively these yields were similar to those previously reported for eabs angelaalincy et al 2017 stockl et al 2019 at the lowest and highest potentials electron transfer had to be balanced which may have resulted in the lower levels of eps production obtained at these potentials than at the middle potentials hirose et al 2018 eps can be divided into tb eps and lb eps with respect to their association states with bacterial cells cao et al 2011 the amounts of tb eps and lb eps were also affected by the anode potential the highest amounts of both lb eps 61 9 mg eps g vss and tb eps 74 8 mg eps g vss were produced in the eab formed at 0 v the results indicated that the anode potential is capable of modulating eps production in the mixed culture biofilms which was in good agreement with the effect of anode potential on eps production in pure culture geobacter biofilms yang et al 2019a using the extraction method proteins and polysaccharides were measured to be the predominant components in both tb eps and lb eps fig 3b and c which were homogenously distributed in the biofilms as revealed by clsm fig s5 the amounts of polysaccharides in lb eps increased as the potential increased from 0 2 to 0 4 v while the polysaccharides in tb eps only increased from 0 2 to 0 2 v however proteins and humic acid showed the highest amounts in both tb eps and lb eps at 0 v the 3d eem results also verified the higher fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein like and humic acid like substances ex em 245 260 330 356 and ex em 318 330 380 390 respectively for the lb eps samples at 0 v fig s6 a previous study observed that electrochemical cultivation promotes protein production in the eps of pure culture geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm considering that they were involved in the extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency stockl et al 2019 von canstein et al 2008 the same reason must be why proteins dominate among the eps secreted from mixed culture eabs to better understand the microbial metabolism related to eps biosynthesis transport and export we applied picrust to predict the functional genes associated with the production and transport of predominant components of eps i e exopolysaccharides adhesion proteins alginate synthesis compounds pili proteins and poly γ glutamate and genes related to tca cycle atp production and extracellular electron transfer from metagenomic samples of eabs formed at 0 2 0 4 v fig 3d accordingly the abundance of genes involved in adhesion proteins alginate synthesis i e alginate o acetyltransferase alginate biosynthesis transcriptional activator and alginate o acetyl transferase and folylpolyglutamate synthase in eabs at 0 v was higher than those of other eabs the exopolysaccharide synthesis related genes including exopolysaccharide synthesis and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein were highest in the eabs formed at 0 2 v which could explain the highest exopolysaccharide amounts in these eabs in contrast the eabs at 0 v showed the lowest abundance of genes encoding alginate lyases the release of alginate lyases can degrade eps allowing bacteria to disperse from eabs sutherland 1999 the downregulation of alginate lyase in eabs formed at 0 v might be one of the reasons for the high concentration of eps in these samples the functional genes associated with the tca cycle malate dehydrogenase fumarate hydratase succinate dehydrogenase 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase aconitate hydratase citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase and atp production adenylate kinase in eabs formed at 0 2 v were higher than those in eabs formed at 0 2 0 and 0 4 v in addition a greater abundance of genes of cytochrome c electron carrier protein and pili protein were observed in eabs formed at 0 2 v these results indicated more metabolic activities in eabs formed at 0 2 v which was consistent with the observed higher current generation 3 3 the importance of proteins and humic acid in lb eps for protecting eabs from ag toxicity it is worth mentioning that all eabs developed at different anode potentials had similar microbial communities as shown in fig s7 all biofilms were dominated by proteobacteria similar to g sulfurreducens this phenomenon was consistent with a previous study by zhu et al 2014 accordingly differences in antishock properties toward ag exposure should not be determined by the microbial community due to the lack of significant variation in various biofilms to determine the function of eps components in protecting the eabs the correlations between current recovery and concentration of the eps components from the ag treated experiments were investigated as shown in fig 4 the current recovery of eabs after ag exposure was weakly correlated with the polysaccharides and dna of the outer layer lb eps and inner layer tb eps r2 0 21 p 0 05 the results suggested that the polysaccharides and dna of lb eps could have limited the influence on the anti shock properties of the eabs however significant correlations r2 0 94 and 0 95 respectively p 0 05 were found between the current recovery of the eabs and the proteins or humic acid of the lb eps positive correlations r2 0 97 and 0 98 respectively p 0 05 between the proteins or humic acid of outer layer lb eps and cell viability were also obtained fig s8 proteins and humic acid can complex on the surface of solids to form porous flexible and lipophilic lb eps whitfield et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 it is also well known that proteins and humic acids are rich in chemical moieties that can bind with metal ions wei et al 2017 additionally wei et al 2019 recently found that the proteins in sludge eps followed by humic acid exhibited a relatively high adsorption capacity for metal ions whereas the lowest adsorption capacity was observed for polysaccharides notably stronger positive correlations were obtained between the proteins and humic acid of outer layer lb eps and current recovery than between those of inner layer tb eps and current recovery the reason for this result could be that metal ions will first bind with outer layer lb eps once the binding sites of lb eps are fully occupied ag will continuously bind with the proteins and ha of inner layer tb eps sem eds analysis also demonstrated that a large amount of ag accumulated in the eabs after they were exposed to ag solution fig s9 therefore the proteins and humic acid in lb eps could be the main components that react with ag as a physical barrier to weaken its toxicity toward bacterial cells 3 4 fluorescence and ftir hetero 2dcos revealed the mechanism of eps binding with silver considering that the above revealed lb eps played a key role in protecting the eabs the lb eps synthesized at 0 v under various ag concentrations were selected to investigate the binding mechanisms 2dcos analysis which integrates fluorescence and ftir spectroscopy has been proven to be a promising method to elucidate metal organic interaction mechanisms chen et al 2015b by using this hetero 2dcos analysis approach fluorescence and ftir signals can reflect the variations in different functional groups caused by ag while synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos analysis can help to better understand the relative direction and sequential orders of structural variations prior to 2dcos analysis general fluorescence and ftir were used to achieve a reliable determination of the conformational changes in eps induced by ag binding fig 5 a shows the response of the fluorescence spectra of lb eps to the addition of different concentrations of ag three fluorescence fractions including the protein like region 250 300 nm fulvic like region 300 380 nm and humic like region 380 550 nm could be roughly assigned on the spectra compared with the fulvic like peaks and the humic like peaks the fluorescence intensity of protein like peaks was relatively high indicating a high proportion of proteins in the lb eps as the concentration of ag increased the fluorescence intensities of the protein like fractions and humic like fractions weakened which indicated the occurrence of electronic structural changes in the fractions due to binding with ag the predominant infrared spectral characteristics of lb eps occurred in the range of 1000 2000 cm 1 where we could detect almost all the vibrational information on the component backbone of eps yu et al 2011 fig 5b shows that the predominant peaks of lb eps corresponded to o c o groups of polysaccharides 1080 cm 1 carbonyl co groups 1400 cm 1 of humic acids or proteins n h bending vibrations of amines 1600 cm 1 and co stretching in secondary amides amide i 1652 cm 1 it can be observed that the peak intensities of the n h bending of amines and co stretching of amides decreased as the concentration of ag increased in addition the bands at 1400 cm 1 and 1080 cm 1 which were assigned to carbonyl co 1400 cm 1 in humic acids or proteins and c o c 1080 cm 1 stretching in polysaccharides whitfield et al 2015 respectively became weaker with increasing ag concentration the results suggested that these groups such as carbonyl co in humic acids or proteins n h bending of amines and c o c of polysaccharides contributed strongly to binding ag then 2d fluorescence cos and 2d ftir cos analyses were performed using synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectra with the ag concentration as the external perturbation the synchronous 2d cos map for the synchronous fluorescence spectra of eps in the 250 550 nm region showed a predominant auto peak centered at 280 nm and a small peak at 480 nm identified from the cross peaks fig 5c which indicated that the interaction of ag with humic acids was less significant than that with protein these cross peaks were positive indicating that the spectral changes proceeded in the same direction i e decreased as the ag concentration increased moreover the asynchronous 2d cos map for the fluorescence spectra fig 5d provided additional information on the sequential binding relationship between eps components and ag positive cross peaks λ1 λ2 265 235 nm are located in the upper left corner of the asynchronous map according to noda s rule noda 2012 the change followed the order 280 nm 480 nm suggesting that ag bound to eps fractions in the following sequence protein like fraction humic like fraction moreover the binding mechanism between ag and eps was further investigated by 2d ftir cos analysis six peaks 1650 1600 1527 1400 1265 and 1080 cm 1 were more distinctly observed in the synchronous maps fig 5e than the ftir spectra fig 5b for lb eps at various ag concentrations the signs of the cross peaks from the synchronous map are presented in table s1 the peak at 1080 cm 1 was shown to change most significantly followed by the peaks at 1600 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 and all the cross peaks were positive this result verified that c o c carbonyl co and n h groups were the potential moieties that responded to ag binding in lb eps the asynchronous maps for 2d ftir cos showed three positive and twelve negative cross peaks fig 5f and table s1 the signs of the cross peaks table s1 in the asynchronous spectra reflect the order in which the corresponding functional groups interact with ag accordingly the sequence order of the functional groups involved in binding with ag could be established n h of amines 1600 cm 1 n h deformation and c n stretching in co nh of proteins 1527 cm 1 carbonyl co groups 1400 cm 1 co stretching in secondary amides amide i 1650 cm 1 c o stretching in phenolic groups 1265 cm 1 c o c of polysaccharides 1080 cm 1 previous research confirmed that eps from escherichia coli can entrap ag as agnps to hinder intracellular penetration of ag kang et al 2014 eps have also been reported to effectively bind several other heavy metal cations such as cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 through their large content of chelating groups e g amino carboxyl and phenol nocelli et al 2016 von canstein et al 2008 wei et al 2019 wei et al 2019 suggested that heavy metal sorption onto carbonyl co and aromatic cc stretching in humic acid and proteins from eps can be attributed to significant electrostatic interactions although the functional group abundance in eps differs among bacterial strains sheng and liu 2011 the binding of eps to toxic metals will give the biofilm enough time to undergo the physiological or metabolic changes necessary for alleviating the toxic effect of the metal nocelli et al 2016 therefore we can conclude that proteins were the predominant species in the eps responsible for binding silver to attenuate its toxicity in which n and o functional groups were the most important interaction sites 4 conclusion eps is considered the barrier for toxic species penetration into cells but their function in protecting eabs has rarely been revealed this study demonstrates for the first time that the anode potential can modulate the production of eps in mixed culture eabs where an anode potential of 0 v was favorable for producing eps with a desirable structure and composition to reduce ag toxicity structure analysis showed that outer layer lb eps were the main components contributing to the antishock capability of the eabs and chemical analysis demonstrated that the proteins and humic acids of lb eps were the main effective components after that spectroscopy combined with 2d cos analysis revealed that the sequence of eps backbones in terms of silver binding followed the order of amine of proteins carbonyl co groups phenolic groups c o c of polysaccharides the anode potential shows potential for modulation of eps production in eabs which also primarily determines the rate of electron flow from electroactive bacteria to the electrodes and controls the theoretical metabolic energy available for microbial growth therefore a balance between anti shock capacity and eet efficiency should be considered in the future finally the findings of this study have important implications for in depth understanding of the protective mechanism of electroactive biofilms and will finally lead to the optimization of bes performance under various wastewater matrices considering that bes has been proven to be a promising and sustainable wastewater treatment technology our

17917,extracellular polymeric substances eps have been considered as a barrier for toxic species penetration into the cells but their function in protecting electroactive biofilms eabs had been rarely revealed in this study the anode potential was used to regulate the eps quantity and components in mixed culture eabs where their resistance to ag shock was assessed the results showed that the eab grown at 0 v showed the highest anti shock capability by the ag exposure compared to those grown at 0 2 0 2 and 0 4 v the eab produced at 0 v had both of the highest amounts of loosely bound eps lb eps 61 9 mg eps g vss and tightly bound eps tb eps 74 8 mg eps g vss than those grown under other potentials where proteins and humic acid were the predominated components the abundance of genes associated with eps biosynthesis were also confirmed to be related with the applied anode potentials based on the metagenomic analysis considering proteins and humic acid in lb eps showed positive linearity with the current recovery and viability of the eabs these two main components might play important roles in reducing the ag toxicity synchronous fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy integrated two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analyses further confirmed that the oxygen and nitrogen moieties i e amide carbonyl co phenolic and c o c in proteins and humic acid of the lb eps were response for the binding with the ag to prevent the penetration into the cells the underlying molecular mechanisms of eps in protecting eabs from the ag shock explored in this study can provide implications for developing new methods to construct highly stable eabs graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps electroactive biofilms eabs anode potential ag shock anti shock capability 1 introduction as the most important part of bioelectrochemical system bes electrochemically active biofilms eabs can directly exchange electrons with extracellular solid carriers i e electrodes to generate electricity borole et al 2011 sevda et al 2018 however recent researches have shown that eabs are vulnerable to external disturbances especially heavy metals shock antibiotic exposure and ph changes logan and regan 2006 lovley 2012 the electron pathways and mass transfer inside eabs can be greatly changed by external disturbances chen et al 2015a men et al 2015 patil et al 2011 which consequently inhibits the bio electrocatalytic activity of bess li et al 2016 logan 2009 logan et al 2006 therefore strengthening the stability of eabs has become an issue of great concern for practical applications of bess extracellular polymeric substances eps mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and lipids flemming et al 2016 and have the ability to enhance bacterial adhesion promote biofilm structural development provide a protective barrier and store nutrients for biofilm growth adav et al 2008 vu et al 2009 xue et al 2012 recent studies have confirmed that eps play important roles in protecting biofilms against external stress li et al 2019 wang et al 2013 xue et al 2012 eps can effectively bind heavy metal cations such as ag pb2 and zn2 and act as a permeability barrier to hinder intracellular penetration of metal ions nocelli et al 2016 von canstein et al 2008 in addition eps have been reported to significantly increase the resistance of biofilms to antibiotics and disinfectants through mechanisms including the creation of complex structures limitation of the transportation of xenobiotics and retention of the organic matter in the biofilms xue et al 2012 the groups e g amino carboxyl and phenol in eps have been considered to be the active sites for complexing various toxicants to increase the resistance of biofilms duan et al 2013 zhu et al 2012 these results provide valuable insights regarding the protection of eabs against external stresses such as heavy metals and antibiotics by stimulating eps formation recent studies have shown that controlling the operation parameters of bess can regulate the formation and structure of eabs on electrode surface to enhance their activities in recent studies electrode potentials have been confirmed to be significant in regulating biofilm formation and optimizing bes performance patil et al 2011 peng et al 2016 carmona martínez et al found that the biofilm biomass and current density in shewanellaputrefaciens inoculated bes increased with elevated anode potential carmona martínez et al 2013 li et al 2017 proved that geobacter biofilms developed at 0 2 0 4 v had the highest cytochrome c contents and reducing capacities among biofilms grown under various conditions peng et al 2016 found that exocellular electron transfer pathways rather than biofilm community variation were responsible for different eab activities at various set potentials in addition to the electrochemical activity of the biofilms the production and structure of eps were highly affected by the applied anode potential in pure culture geobacter biofilms yang et al 2019a however the variations in eps composition in mixed culture eabs at different anode potentials have not yet been clearly clarified moreover the role of eps in eabs for protecting biofilms from anti shock effects has remained largely unexplored therefore the aim of this study is to investigate eps variations in mixed culture eabs formed at different potentials and evaluate their effects on the stability of eabs against metal ion shock eabs were constructed at four different anode potentials i e 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v vs sce where the variations in eps in the as formed biofilms were examined ag one of the most toxic metal ions for bacteria silver et al 2006 was chosen as the external stimulation to explore the anti shock properties of the eabs as the biofilms became mature the relationship between the eps composition and the tolerance of eabs was established to elucidate the key components of eps in protecting eabs against ag shock to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to link the electrode potential eps composition and the resistance to external stimulation for a mixed culture eab the results may be useful for establishing highly stable eabs against external stresses and broadening their application of in the bes platform for environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 electroactive biofilm growth and ag exposure the eabs on the electrodes were developed using a single chamber bes the bes was constructed using 100 ml cylindrical glass container and a polytetrafluoroethylene lid where graphite plates 1 0 2 0 cm and titanium wire were used as the working and counter electrodes respectively and a saturated calom electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the reactors were run in duplicates at 30 c which were inoculated with 20 ml effluent of a previous well operating bes originally acclimated from anaerobic sludge yuan et al 2011 a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000c ch instrument shanghai china was used to set four different anode potentials 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v vs sce to enrich eabs and record the current generations of the

prepared by dissolving agno3 in deionized water after the mature eabs were achieved the anodes were taken out and inserted into the 60 mg l ag solution in duration of exposure 1 2 and 3 h the anodes were then washed using distilled water to remove ag solution and re installed in the bess for electrochemical tests the eabs were carefully scratched off the electrodes with a cell scraper for the eps extraction quantification and characterization 2 2 eab characterization chronoamperometry was used to record the current generation of the bess with a multichannel potentiostat turnover cyclic

biotech co china was used to determine the biofilm biomass redmile gordon et al 2013 the morphologies of the biofilms formed on the graphite plates were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem yuan et al 2013 the volatile suspended solids vss of the eabs were measured according to a standard method ye et al 2011 the viability of the cells in the biofilms was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm biorad radiance 2100 mp usa biofilms before and after being exposed to ag were observed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds fei talos f200s czech the biofilms were also stained with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l7007 thermo fisher scientific inc usa rinsed in sterile pbs and examined by clsm wang et

software xue et al 2012 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis of eabs samples from the biofilm layers at the working electrode were gently scraped from the biofilm carriers under sterile conditions after centrifugation microbial dna was extracted from the residual biomass using an eznatm mag bind soil dna kit omega ga usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified and the purified amplicons were analyzed on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china after screening the sequence data for each operational taxonomic unit out were assigned using usearch v5 2 236 with 97 sequence identity the results were classified at the phylum and genus levels in addition to better understand the potential functional contributions of the observed microbes the metagenomic information for the biofilm was investigated according to yin et al 2018 the extracted dna

deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive biosample accession nos samn07840101 and samn07840102 2 4 eps extraction quantification and characterization the eps from the original eabs and the ag treated eabs were extracted following a method described previously cao et al 2011 yang et al 2019b for eps extraction 3 parallel graphite plates were merged into one eab sample and eps were extracted in triplicate in brief the eabs were first resuspended in 5 ml of nacl solution 0 9 and the suspension was further diluted with a solution that had been preheated to 70 c to maintain a temperature of 35 c in the final solution the resulting suspension was then sheared by a vortex mixer for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the organic matter in the supernatant was collected as the loosely bound eps lb eps cao et al 2011 the remaining bacterial pellet in the centrifuge tube after centrifugation was resuspended in 5 ml of 0 9 nacl solution the suspension was then sonicated for 10 min centrifuged at 5000 g for 20 min and washed two times using 0 9 nacl solution the tightly bound eps tb eps in the suspension was finally collected after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter yang et al 2019b polysaccharides in the collected eps were determined by the anthrone method larsson and tornkvist 1996 the protein and humic acid contents were measured by a bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce and a modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 respectively dna was measured by the diphenylamine colorimetric method burton 1956 the concentration of the eps components was expressed as a function of the vss of the biofilms mg g vss fig s1 then the structure of lb eps was analyzed using fluorescence eem excitation emission matrix using a luminescence spectrometer fls1000 edinburgh co uk shou et al 2018 the spectra were collected from 300 to 550 nm at 0 5 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm at 10 nm increments clsm was also applied to investigate the distribution of eps components in the biofilms the detailed information for the staining procedures is described in the supporting information si 1 2 5 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos fluorescence and ftir analyses 2dcos fluorescence and ftir analyses were performed to collect fluorescence and ftir spectra of lb eps with added ag concentrations in the range of 0 20 mg l as an external perturbation according to a previous study chen et al 2015b briefly a mixture of lb eps and ag was adjusted to ph 7 0 and shaken for 12 h at 25 c to ensure complete reaction equilibrium before conducting fluorescence and ftir measurements approximately 5 ml of each solution was amended with 0 04 m kno3 to maintain background ionic strength and then analyzed in three scans by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy edinburgh fs5 uk the excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the excitation wavelength range was set as 250 550 nm in 0 5 nm increments and a scan rate of 1000 nm min was used the remaining eps solutions were firstly freeze dried and then mixed with kbr ir grade using an agate grinder the mixture was compressed and subjected to the ftir measurements by a spectrum 8900 ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher usa the scanning conditions were as follows a spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 and a resolution of 4 cm 1 to illustrate the effect of ag on the structural variations in eps more clearly each of the spectra was adjusted by subtracting the spectrum without ag addition 2dcos analysis was performed using 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan prior to 2dcos analysis the ftir spectra were normalized and denoised by savitzky golay smoothing more detailed information on the mathematical procedures associated with 2d cos can be found in the supporting information si 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 eab resistance to ag toxicity at various anode potentials the mixed culture eabs were grown by inoculating effluents from a well operated bes where the current response was recorded by a potentiostat as shown in fig 1 a the currents under various anode potentials cycled over time after refilling the reactor with fresh substrate stable currents were achieved from the third refilling which indicated that the biofilms had become mature sem of the eabs showed the homogeneous growth of microorganisms on the graphite plates under all anode potentials fig s2 the maximum current density of the eabs was found to depend on the applied anode potential at 0 2 v the eab yielded a current density of 2 7 0 3 ma cm2 which was higher than those at 0 v 2 5 0 2 ma cm2 0 2 v 2 2 0 1 ma cm2 and 0 4 v 1 9 0 1 ma cm2 similar current responses were also observed from the cv scans under turnover conditions fig 1b a previous study also demonstrated that the eab at 0 2 v yielded the highest catalytic activity among investigated eabs li et al 2017 the underlying mechanism may be that an anode potential of 0 2 v could benefit eab metabolic activity due to the difference between the anode potential and the standard biological redox potential of the substrate li et al 2017 besides the amount of the eabs biomass under different anode potentials was in high accordance with the variation of current densities which was consistent with the previous finding by molenaar et al 2018 the highest amount of biomass was obtained for the eabs formed at 0 2 v than those at other anode potentials fig s1 suggesting that this potential is favorable for the formation of biofilm as well the mature eabs were further investigated for their resistance to ag shock however after being exposed to ag solution for 3 h the current recovery ratios were 3 2 40 0 18 5 and 15 8 for the eabs corresponding to 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v respectively fig 1c interestingly a maximum current density of 1 0 0 1 ma cm2 was obtained from the eab formed at 0 v which was significantly higher than those at other potentials these results indicated that the eab at 0 v not that at 0 2 v had the highest antishock capability notably no significant decrease in current was observed when the same eab at 0 v was treated in a kno3 solution fig s3 suggesting that the decrease in current resulted from ag exposure not the operation process i e moving electrode and oxygen exposure or toxicity of no3 in addition the antishock properties of the eabs were further evaluated by exposing the eabs to ag with different concentrations and duration periods as shown in fig s4 the current recovery of the eab formed at 0 v was the least affected by the low concentration of ag and short duration period to further confirm the adverse effect of ag shock the viability of the eabs was analyzed with fluorescent staining to distinguish live versus dead cells as shown in fig 2 a all the original electrodes were covered by the stained eabs with a varied thickness from 45 to 60 μm which are similar to those previously reported sun et al 2015 the thickest biofilm was obtained at 0 2 v indicating that the growth of exoelectrogens was favored at this potential in addition a typical two layer structure of the eabs a live outer layer and a dead inner core layer was observed which was in agreement with eabs developed by other researcher sun et al 2015 for all the eabs cells on the top layer were dead red in color after treatment with ag solution the ratios of live to dead cells before and after ag exposure was shown in fig 2b which had a similar tendency to the recovery ratios of current a viability of 39 2 was observed for the eab formed at 0 v which was also higher than other eabs indicating that more cells survived in this eab after ag exposure therefore the eabs developed at 0 v displayed the highest ag resistance in terms of electroactivity and cell viability even though the highest amount of biomass was obtained for the original eabs formed at 0 2 v fig s1 3 2 anode potential modulated the eps production in biofilms as previous studies have reported eps play important roles in protecting biofilms against external stress lai et al 2018 li et al 2019 wang et al 2013 xue et al 2012 in this regard the structure and components of the eps were analyzed and the values varied among the eabs formed at different anode potentials fig 3 a a total amount of 92 5 136 7 122 1 and 109 5 mg eps g vss could be produced from the eabs formed at 0 2 0 0 2 and 0 4 v respectively these yields were similar to those previously reported for eabs angelaalincy et al 2017 stockl et al 2019 at the lowest and highest potentials electron transfer had to be balanced which may have resulted in the lower levels of eps production obtained at these potentials than at the middle potentials hirose et al 2018 eps can be divided into tb eps and lb eps with respect to their association states with bacterial cells cao et al 2011 the amounts of tb eps and lb eps were also affected by the anode potential the highest amounts of both lb eps 61 9 mg eps g vss and tb eps 74 8 mg eps g vss were produced in the eab formed at 0 v the results indicated that the anode potential is capable of modulating eps production in the mixed culture biofilms which was in good agreement with the effect of anode potential on eps production in pure culture geobacter biofilms yang et al 2019a using the extraction method proteins and polysaccharides were measured to be the predominant components in both tb eps and lb eps fig 3b and c which were homogenously distributed in the biofilms as revealed by clsm fig s5 the amounts of polysaccharides in lb eps increased as the potential increased from 0 2 to 0 4 v while the polysaccharides in tb eps only increased from 0 2 to 0 2 v however proteins and humic acid showed the highest amounts in both tb eps and lb eps at 0 v the 3d eem results also verified the higher fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein like and humic acid like substances ex em 245 260 330 356 and ex em 318 330 380 390 respectively for the lb eps samples at 0 v fig s6 a previous study observed that electrochemical cultivation promotes protein production in the eps of pure culture geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm considering that they were involved in the extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency stockl et al 2019 von canstein et al 2008 the same reason must be why proteins dominate among the eps secreted from mixed culture eabs to better understand the microbial metabolism related to eps biosynthesis transport and export we applied picrust to predict the functional genes associated with the production and transport of predominant components of eps i e exopolysaccharides adhesion proteins alginate synthesis compounds pili proteins and poly γ glutamate and genes related to tca cycle atp production and extracellular electron transfer from metagenomic samples of eabs formed at 0 2 0 4 v fig 3d accordingly the abundance of genes involved in adhesion proteins alginate synthesis i e alginate o acetyltransferase alginate biosynthesis transcriptional activator and alginate o acetyl transferase and folylpolyglutamate synthase in eabs at 0 v was higher than those of other eabs the exopolysaccharide synthesis related genes including exopolysaccharide synthesis and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein were highest in the eabs formed at 0 2 v which could explain the highest exopolysaccharide amounts in these eabs in contrast the eabs at 0 v showed the lowest abundance of genes encoding alginate lyases the release of alginate lyases can degrade eps allowing bacteria to disperse from eabs sutherland 1999 the downregulation of alginate lyase in eabs formed at 0 v might be one of the reasons for the high concentration of eps in these samples the functional genes associated with the tca cycle malate dehydrogenase fumarate hydratase succinate dehydrogenase 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase aconitate hydratase citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase and atp production adenylate kinase in eabs formed at 0 2 v were higher than those in eabs formed at 0 2 0 and 0 4 v in addition a greater abundance of genes of cytochrome c electron carrier protein and pili protein were observed in eabs formed at 0 2 v these results indicated more metabolic activities in eabs formed at 0 2 v which was consistent with the observed higher current generation 3 3 the importance of proteins and humic acid in lb eps for protecting eabs from ag toxicity it is worth mentioning that all eabs developed at different anode potentials had similar microbial communities as shown in fig s7 all biofilms were dominated by proteobacteria similar to g sulfurreducens this phenomenon was consistent with a previous study by zhu et al 2014 accordingly differences in antishock properties toward ag exposure should not be determined by the microbial community due to the lack of significant variation in various biofilms to determine the function of eps components in protecting the eabs the correlations between current recovery and concentration of the eps components from the ag treated experiments were investigated as shown in fig 4 the current recovery of eabs after ag exposure was weakly correlated with the polysaccharides and dna of the outer layer lb eps and inner layer tb eps r2 0 21 p 0 05 the results suggested that the polysaccharides and dna of lb eps could have limited the influence on the anti shock properties of the eabs however significant correlations r2 0 94 and 0 95 respectively p 0 05 were found between the current recovery of the eabs and the proteins or humic acid of the lb eps positive correlations r2 0 97 and 0 98 respectively p 0 05 between the proteins or humic acid of outer layer lb eps and cell viability were also obtained fig s8 proteins and humic acid can complex on the surface of solids to form porous flexible and lipophilic lb eps whitfield et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 it is also well known that proteins and humic acids are rich in chemical moieties that can bind with metal ions wei et al 2017 additionally wei et al 2019 recently found that the proteins in sludge eps followed by humic acid exhibited a relatively high adsorption capacity for metal ions whereas the lowest adsorption capacity was observed for polysaccharides notably stronger positive correlations were obtained between the proteins and humic acid of outer layer lb eps and current recovery than between those of inner layer tb eps and current recovery the reason for this result could be that metal ions will first bind with outer layer lb eps once the binding sites of lb eps are fully occupied ag will continuously bind with the proteins and ha of inner layer tb eps sem eds analysis also demonstrated that a large amount of ag accumulated in the eabs after they were exposed to ag solution fig s9 therefore the proteins and humic acid in lb eps could be the main components that react with ag as a physical barrier to weaken its toxicity toward bacterial cells 3 4 fluorescence and ftir hetero 2dcos revealed the mechanism of eps binding with silver considering that the above revealed lb eps played a key role in protecting the eabs the lb eps synthesized at 0 v under various ag concentrations were selected to investigate the binding mechanisms 2dcos analysis which integrates fluorescence and ftir spectroscopy has been proven to be a promising method to elucidate metal organic interaction mechanisms chen et al 2015b by using this hetero 2dcos analysis approach fluorescence and ftir signals can reflect the variations in different functional groups caused by ag while synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos analysis can help to better understand the relative direction and sequential orders of structural variations prior to 2dcos analysis general fluorescence and ftir were used to achieve a reliable determination of the conformational changes in eps induced by ag binding fig 5 a shows the response of the fluorescence spectra of lb eps to the addition of different concentrations of ag three fluorescence fractions including the protein like region 250 300 nm fulvic like region 300 380 nm and humic like region 380 550 nm could be roughly assigned on the spectra compared with the fulvic like peaks and the humic like peaks the fluorescence intensity of protein like peaks was relatively high indicating a high proportion of proteins in the lb eps as the concentration of ag increased the fluorescence intensities of the protein like fractions and humic like fractions weakened which indicated the occurrence of electronic structural changes in the fractions due to binding with ag the predominant infrared spectral characteristics of lb eps occurred in the range of 1000 2000 cm 1 where we could detect almost all the vibrational information on the component backbone of eps yu et al 2011 fig 5b shows that the predominant peaks of lb eps corresponded to o c o groups of polysaccharides 1080 cm 1 carbonyl co groups 1400 cm 1 of humic acids or proteins n h bending vibrations of amines 1600 cm 1 and co stretching in secondary amides amide i 1652 cm 1 it can be observed that the peak intensities of the n h bending of amines and co stretching of amides decreased as the concentration of ag increased in addition the bands at 1400 cm 1 and 1080 cm 1 which were assigned to carbonyl co 1400 cm 1 in humic acids or proteins and c o c 1080 cm 1 stretching in polysaccharides whitfield et al 2015 respectively became weaker with increasing ag concentration the results suggested that these groups such as carbonyl co in humic acids or proteins n h bending of amines and c o c of polysaccharides contributed strongly to binding ag then 2d fluorescence cos and 2d ftir cos analyses were performed using synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectra with the ag concentration as the external perturbation the synchronous 2d cos map for the synchronous fluorescence spectra of eps in the 250 550 nm region showed a predominant auto peak centered at 280 nm and a small peak at 480 nm identified from the cross peaks fig 5c which indicated that the interaction of ag with humic acids was less significant than that with protein these cross peaks were positive indicating that the spectral changes proceeded in the same direction i e decreased as the ag concentration increased moreover the asynchronous 2d cos map for the fluorescence spectra fig 5d provided additional information on the sequential binding relationship between eps components and ag positive cross peaks λ1 λ2 265 235 nm are located in the upper left corner of the asynchronous map according to noda s rule noda 2012 the change followed the order 280 nm 480 nm suggesting that ag bound to eps fractions in the following sequence protein like fraction humic like fraction moreover the binding mechanism between ag and eps was further investigated by 2d ftir cos analysis six peaks 1650 1600 1527 1400 1265 and 1080 cm 1 were more distinctly observed in the synchronous maps fig 5e than the ftir spectra fig 5b for lb eps at various ag concentrations the signs of the cross peaks from the synchronous map are presented in table s1 the peak at 1080 cm 1 was shown to change most significantly followed by the peaks at 1600 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 and all the cross peaks were positive this result verified that c o c carbonyl co and n h groups were the potential moieties that responded to ag binding in lb eps the asynchronous maps for 2d ftir cos showed three positive and twelve negative cross peaks fig 5f and table s1 the signs of the cross peaks table s1 in the asynchronous spectra reflect the order in which the corresponding functional groups interact with ag accordingly the sequence order of the functional groups involved in binding with ag could be established n h of amines 1600 cm 1 n h deformation and c n stretching in co nh of proteins 1527 cm 1 carbonyl co groups 1400 cm 1 co stretching in secondary amides amide i 1650 cm 1 c o stretching in phenolic groups 1265 cm 1 c o c of polysaccharides 1080 cm 1 previous research confirmed that eps from escherichia coli can entrap ag as agnps to hinder intracellular penetration of ag kang et al 2014 eps have also been reported to effectively bind several other heavy metal cations such as cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 through their large content of chelating groups e g amino carboxyl and phenol nocelli et al 2016 von canstein et al 2008 wei et al 2019 wei et al 2019 suggested that heavy metal sorption onto carbonyl co and aromatic cc stretching in humic acid and proteins from eps can be attributed to significant electrostatic interactions although the functional group abundance in eps differs among bacterial strains sheng and liu 2011 the binding of eps to toxic metals will give the biofilm enough time to undergo the physiological or metabolic changes necessary for alleviating the toxic effect of the metal nocelli et al 2016 therefore we can conclude that proteins were the predominant species in the eps responsible for binding silver to attenuate its toxicity in which n and o functional groups were the most important interaction sites 4 conclusion eps is considered the barrier for toxic species penetration into cells but their function in protecting eabs has rarely been revealed this study demonstrates for the first time that the anode potential can modulate the production of eps in mixed culture eabs where an anode potential of 0 v was favorable for producing eps with a desirable structure and composition to reduce ag toxicity structure analysis showed that outer layer lb eps were the main components contributing to the antishock capability of the eabs and chemical analysis demonstrated that the proteins and humic acids of lb eps were the main effective components after that spectroscopy combined with 2d cos analysis revealed that the sequence of eps backbones in terms of silver binding followed the order of amine of proteins carbonyl co groups phenolic groups c o c of polysaccharides the anode potential shows potential for modulation of eps production in eabs which also primarily determines the rate of electron flow from electroactive bacteria to the electrodes and controls the theoretical metabolic energy available for microbial growth therefore a balance between anti shock capacity and eet efficiency should be considered in the future finally the findings of this study have important implications for in depth understanding of the protective mechanism of electroactive biofilms and will finally lead to the optimization of bes performance under various wastewater matrices considering that bes has been proven to be a promising and sustainable wastewater treatment technology our

17918,shoreline sand harbors high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib that may be resuspended into the water column through washing and resuspension studies have explored coastal processes that influence this sand water flux for fib but little is known about how microbial markers of contamination or the bacterial community interact in the sand water interface in this study we take a three tiered approach to explore the relationship between bacteria in sand sediment and overlying water at three shoreline sites and two associated rivers along an extended freshwater shoreline samples were collected over two years and analyzed for fib two microbial source tracking mst markers catellicoccus marimammalium gull2 bacteroides hf183 and targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis fib was much higher in sand than in water at all three sites gull2 marker was abundant in shoreline sand and water while hf183 marker was mostly present in rivers overall bacterial communities were dissimilar between sand sediment and water indicating little interaction sediment composition was generally unfavorable to bacterial resuspension results show that fib and mst markers were effective estimates of short term conditions at these locations and bacterial communities in sand and sediment reflected longer term conditions findings are useful for locating contamination sources and targeting restoration by evaluating scope of shoreline degradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis microbial source tracking indicator bacteria great lakes 1 introduction the microbial community in shoreline sand is a diverse and dynamic ecosystem that impacts multiple shoreline processes from nitrogen fixation to sulfur reduction mohiuddin et al 2017 to anaerobic digestion wurzbacher et al 2017 and fills a key link in energy transfer david et al 2016 both within the aquatic system and between aquatic and terrestrial systems the composition and diversity of this community is influenced by external factors including distant and local contamination sources nakatsu et al 2019 and in turn influences the associated interstitial eukaryotic biota found in this environment hölker et al 2015 wetted shoreline sand provides a transition zone for microbes between planktonic and benthic states but the constant interaction between the two matrices might imply consistency in the microbial communities of the sand and overlying water while research has identified the physical potential for settling and resuspension the frequency of exchange of microbes between sand and overlying water is not fully understood further there is some evidence that species or community composition varies with the dynamics of settling and resuspension and shear stress fang et al 2017 found more proteobacteria under dynamic flow conditions and more firmicutes species with static conditions there are also factors that determine the broader geographic distribution of bacterial communities and related dynamics nevers and whitman 2008 staley and sadowsky 2016 microbial transfer between sand and water has been focused on fecal indicator bacteria fib and microbes of public health concern e g bacteria fungi due to the human recreational activities in beach environments sabino et al 2011 world health organization 2003 sources of fecal contamination to nearshore water include sand borne bacteria originating from recent contamination by anthropogenic sources and wildlife or from naturalized populations byappanahalli et al 2015 edge and hill 2007 yamahara et al 2009 early observations identified the correlative relationship between fib in sand and water alm et al 2003 whitman and nevers 2003 and subsequent examinations have sought to characterize the bi directional movement of these bacteria through settling feng et al 2016 wu et al 2017 and wave induced resuspension ge et al 2012 le fevre and lewis 2003 few studies however have explored these relationships between the entire planktonic and benthic bacterial communities in the sand and sediment most microbes are particle bound in aquatic environments fries et al 2006 so sand water interactions are typically described using long established tenets of particle transport models in fact thupaki et al 2013 determined that sediment directly interacts with the bacteria e g e coli and considering short duration low intensity resuspension events greatly improved predictability in resuspension models using this paradigm understanding of bacterial transport mechanisms through settling and accumulation feng et al 2016 vertical transport wu et al 2017 and resuspension potential o mullan et al 2019 has greatly improved particle attachment and microbial survival including fib

see reviews by nevers et al 2014 weiskerger et al 2019 biofilm formation has been identified as a key factor in isolating bacterial communities and limiting exchange gobet et al 2012 by mediating nutrient and gas oxygen exchange and creating a barrier to predation weitere et al 2005 indeed some studies have identified complete separation of microbial communities between sand and water in intertidal sediments llobet brossa et al 1998 and freshwater shorelines cloutier et al 2015 other studies comparing microbial communities in sand and water have identified instead high similarity cui et al 2013 perhaps due to variation in biofilm composition biofilm integrity is also influenced by physical forces waves shear stress and tidal action can break up biofilms causing microbes to be released readily into the surrounding water boehm and weisberg 2005 current understanding of sand water interactions of bacterial communities in freshwater shorelines is limited by scope typically focused only on a small subset of these communities e g fib with limited integration of physical and ambient conditions in this study we compare the bacterial communities in shoreline sand nearshore water and underlying sediment at three locations with various morphologic and hydrologic conditions to describe the potential for sand water exchange using three different targets bacterial community targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis markers of fecal contamination sources microbial source tracking and fib commonly used in water quality monitoring programs we compare potential transfer between the two matrices findings will help explain the dynamics of water quality contamination and characterize shoreline health in lake michigan which will be useful in prioritizing restoration of degraded shorelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites were located along the southern lake michigan coastline in the laurentian great lakes fig 1 sites included the grand calumet river gc and jeorse park jp1 jp2 jpw in east chicago indiana 63rd street beach 63 1 63 2 in chicago illinois and the root river rec and north beach nb1 nb3 in racine wisconsin these sites have been the target of restoration efforts many ongoing to improve nearshore water quality kinzelman and mclellan 2009 converse et al 2012 nevers et al 2018 it should be noted that for the duration of the sampling period a gull deterrence program was in place at jeorse park 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 water sand and sediment in june august of 2016 and 2017 water samples 1 5l were collected weekly for 10 weeks n 80 per year table 1 water from gc was collected with a sterile collection bucket lowered from the bridge crossing at columbus drive rec samples were collected using a reach pole or sampling line all shoreline samples were collected by submerging autoclaved nalgene bottles below the surface in 45 cm deep water three intensive sampling events in 2016 and 2017 june july august included collection of sand defined as wetted foreshore sand in the swash zone 0 5 1 m from water s edge water at 45 cm depth as described above and sediment defined as submerged sediment sand at 45 cm water depth sampling sites in 2016 included only one 63rd site 63 1 and jpw a site closer to the breakwall was sampled rather than jp2 for sand collection a quadrat was randomly set while avoiding areas with accumulated gull fecal droppings litter and algae within each quadrat the top 1 2 cm surface sand was repeatedly scooped in small amounts into a whirl pak bag until 200 g was obtained three replicates were obtained within an approximately 8 m2 area using a separate shovel for each site that was sprayed with 70 ethanol and rinsed with sterile water between replicates for sediment collection a weighted quadrat was placed on the lake bottom in 45 cm deep water along a transect aligned with sand collection after allowing visible suspended sediment to settle 2 min sediment was collected by horizontally swiping scooping a sterilized 12 7 cm long 1 5 cm diameter plastic core tube along the top 1 cm of sediment while covering one tube end with the index finger the tube was slowly lifted out of the water to prevent loss of sample and emptied into a whirl pak bag the process was repeated until 200 g of sediment was collected a new sterile core was used to obtain three quadrat replicates water depth held constant for all samples in which 16s rrna gene sequencing was the endpoint sampling tools and bottles were sterilized with 10 bleach all other sterilization was by autoclaving all samples were placed on ice in coolers directly after collection and transported to the laboratory whirl pak bags containing sand and sediment were held overnight at 4 c and processed

and the largest percentage at 63 1 was medium sized sand 39 followed by coarse sand 21 while sand at 63 2 was primarily gravel 36 followed by medium sized sand 32 the indiana sites were quite different with most of the sand 56 jp1 59 jp2 and sediment 44 jp1 53 jp2 dominated by gravel the dominant sediment size fractions at these locations are not typically associated with settling and resuspension of fib jeng et al 2005 found that fib in their study were associated with fine 0 45 30 μ m and coarse 30 μ m size classes which are smaller than the dominant size fractions in this study

significant difference between sand and sediment microbial communities when compared by site location date or state beta diversity among sample diversity showed considerable overlap among communities

categorized by site were significantly different in this case both river sites rec and gc drove the relationship although the amount of variation described was lower than in the weighted unifrac unweighted unifrac first three axes 22 9 total this separation of gc also resulted in indiana being significantly different from illinois and wisconsin p 0 001 separation overall was decidedly determined as lake vs river with the microbial community in gc being different from all other sites there were 55 phyla in the water samples dominated by proteobacteria with actinobacteria and bacteroidetes also abundant the three phyla represent 90 relative proportion of all taxa table s2 in variable proportions among locations e g the gc site included greater relative proportions of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes taxa and fewer actinobacteria taxa than all other sampled sites significant differences in 485 taxa from all levels of taxonomic classification were identified when the seven locations were compared using lefse table s3 lefse analysis indicated that several taxa contributed to the higher proportion of bacteroidetes in gc including an undescribed genus of cyclobacteriaceae a finding previously documented nakatsu et al 2019 and the genera flavobacterium and fluviicola many of the differences were at the family level so it is difficult to identify factors that may drive these taxonomic differences among sites chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were found at all sites albeit in lower proportions than the three dominant phyla 3 4 3 comparisons of water sand and sediment communities communities in water were separated according to weighted unifrac fig 4 across all locations and dates of sampling there were only two sand and three sediment samples that had communities more like those in water than the rest of the sand sediment samples fig 4b and because of these samples permdisp was significant p 0 001 examining closely these samples four of the five were from the same sampling date 8 9 16 but collected across three states 3 wisconsin 1 illinois 1 indiana for each individual point adjacent samples were often river samples in both wisconsin and indiana like water actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were abundant in sand and sediment samples fig 5b however the bacterial phyla representing acidobacteria and firmicutes were more abundant in sand and sediment than water fig 7 taxonomic differences identified using lefse indicated there were 29 taxa with lda 2 0 in water samples compared to sand and sediment table s4 most differences were in the water samples with the phylum bacteroidetes with the highest lda value fig 5b within the bacteroidetes the family cyclobacteriaceae and genera sediminibacterium and paludibacter were significant 4 discussion movement of bacterial communities across the sand water interface emerged as a concern when it was determined that fib were present in shoreline sand in concentrations significantly higher than in nearshore water alm et al 2003 whitman and nevers 2003 historically research addressing this problem focused on identifying the original source and identifying the potential for resuspension ge et al 2010 kim et al 2004 multiple techniques have been applied to describe microbial interactions of sand and water including mst genomic analysis and hydrodynamic modeling while many studies have provided insight on sources and potential interactions e g see solo gabriele et al 2016 few have taken a three tiered approach across a broad geographic area to test the universality of emerging models and to link multiple shoreline processes affecting bacterial community composition 4 1 shoreline interactions of sand and water in this study both fib and gull2 were consistently higher in sand and sediment than in water at all locations sampled which supports historical findings abdelzaher et al 2009 previous studies have described shoreline sand as a sink for bacteria originating from both offshore and onshore sources with low energy embayments like jp and 63rd being prone to excessive accumulation byappanahalli et al 2015 whitman and nevers 2003 persistence in the sand is aided by protection from adverse environmental conditions desiccation sunlight predation etc kinzelman and mclellan 2009 weiskerger et al 2019 and intermittent growth when nutrients are available e g decaying algae and beach wrack byappanahalli et al 2006 nevers et al 2016 the lack of correlation between concentrations in sand and water in this study indicates that the two populations were not in constant flux or equilibrium gulls are often implicated as a shoreline non point source of bacteria byappanahalli et al 2015 lu et al 2011 this was borne out in this study by the abundance of gull2 in shoreline water and the lack in river water the similarity in pattern of concentration between fib and gull2 results where water sediment sand can be explained by accumulation and persistence of both targets in the shoreline sand with accumulation the sand itself becomes a potential secondary non point source of contamination to the water so ultimately both gulls and sand have the potential to contribute bacteria to the nearshore water during resuspension events boehm et al 2009 halliday et al 2014 while bacteria associated with the human gut koskey et al 2014 mclellan and eren 2014 were among those identified in sand and sediment the marker for human fecal contamination hf183 was only detected in water but for one sediment replicate previous studies have identified it as a conservative marker an indicator of very recent fecal contamination nevers et al 2018 which may explain this discrepancy the human gut associated bacteria could be indicative of longer term communities and impacts not readily detected using hf183 marker lower concentrations of fib and gull2 at jp compared to nb and 63rd were likely the result of management actions taking place for the duration of the study which also impacts comparisons across geographic scale jp has historically had high fib concentrations linked to gull populations so a program was initiated using trained dogs to chase gulls which effectively reduced fib concentration nevers et al 2018 a similar management strategy was historically implemented for short periods at the other two study sites nb converse et al 2012 and 63rd cathy breitenbach chicago park district personal communication bacterial communities identified through targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis differed between sand sediment and water fig 4b indicating that the communities were not in equilibrium cloutier et al 2015 similarly found that the nearshore water bacteria community differed from that in sand berm and sediment submerged halliday et al 2014 showed that bacterial communities in water collected on opposite sides of north america were more like one another than to those in the sand and sediment with which the water was in constant contact the lack of similarity between these two matrices has been attributed to biofilm formation in the sand and sediment gobet et al 2012 or differential decay between sand sediment and water zhang et al 2015 matrix specific factors and resulting impacts on reususpension potential could drive this difference 4 2 resuspension potential studies of nearshore hydrodynamics and shear stress have identified the need for high energy conditions to re suspend fib from shoreline sand or sediment phillips et al 2014 intensive work at 63rd has highlighted a propensity for resuspension during high energy events ge et al 2012 in this study it s possible that physical conditions were insufficient to resuspend bacterial groups due to biofilm formation or sediment composition the few instances where bacterial communities overlapped between sand sediment and water were during a single sampling event 8 9 16 fig 4b which could have been a regional event affecting all sites safaie et al n d deployed a lisst 100x instrument laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry sequoia scientific at jp in 2016 during our sampling period and determined that particle size distributions were multi modal their models of sediment fib interactions indicated that wind waves contributed to increased bottom shear stress frequently such that sediment resuspension characterized by elevated levels of suspended sediment and fib concentrations in the water column occurred often and almost weekly sediment resuspension foreshore sand and avian sources of e coli were needed to describe the observed variability in fib in water and sand models that included only riverine influences failed to describe the observed data the lack of interaction in results presented here could be due to the limited number of study dates 4 3 point source influences bacterial diversity would likely be high within a river and associated sites as a result of multiple point and nonpoint source inputs including riparian soils agriculture and treated or untreated wastewater effluent thupaki et al 2010 while the highest bacterial diversity was at rec nb1 and nb3 in wisconsin gc was singularly different from all other sites fig 4c with much lower diversity gc is in a heavy industrial area and receives periodic combined sewer overflows from multiple municipalities which explains the high detection rate of hf183 but not the lower overall diversity the lack of similarity between gc and associated shorelines could be due to a lack of hydrologic connection nakatsu et al 2019 mechanistic modeling by safaie et al n d examined contributions of various sources rivers birds sand at jp which indicated that contamination from gc is deflected off the harbor structure and does not reach jp beyond river impacts or local perturbations there is evidence that fib fluctuate on a regional scale with high and low concentrations detected simultaneously along extended coastlines nevers and whitman 2008 whitman and nevers 2008 this could explain correlations between 63rd with nb3 and jp but not with either river and the sand sediment water event of 8 9 15 the interplay between point and nonpoint sources can lead to location specific bacteria concentrations and affect bacterial community composition but broader geographic distributions and fluctuations are also present 4 4 patterns of geographic scale bacterial communities in water were significantly different across sites dates water type and states but there were no significant differences for community composition in sand and sediment for any of these variables fig 4b others have reported on high community similarity in sand and sediment across lakes cloutier et al 2015 across continents halliday et al 2014 and even across the world staley and sadowsky 2016 in contrast communities in water tend to exhibit higher geographic variation perhaps due to the multiple abiotic e g sunlight inactivation and biotic decay predation influences on this dynamic matrix the consistent community composition in sand and sediment lends support to the concept of sand as a sink for bacteria that becomes isolated through physical and or biological processes the sand community therefore represents longer term persistence or conditions at the location 5 conclusions bacterial communities in shoreline sand represent long term conditions or status of the shoreline while those in water are more representative of the influence of immediate sources and antecedent conditions e g river inputs sunlight inactivation predation bacterial communities in sand and water originate from multiple sources but once bacteria are entrained in the sand and sediment internal and external processes affect them differently than those in water the interaction of sand and water bacteria communities is likely impacted by high energy resuspension or washing events use of a three tiered

17918,shoreline sand harbors high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib that may be resuspended into the water column through washing and resuspension studies have explored coastal processes that influence this sand water flux for fib but little is known about how microbial markers of contamination or the bacterial community interact in the sand water interface in this study we take a three tiered approach to explore the relationship between bacteria in sand sediment and overlying water at three shoreline sites and two associated rivers along an extended freshwater shoreline samples were collected over two years and analyzed for fib two microbial source tracking mst markers catellicoccus marimammalium gull2 bacteroides hf183 and targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis fib was much higher in sand than in water at all three sites gull2 marker was abundant in shoreline sand and water while hf183 marker was mostly present in rivers overall bacterial communities were dissimilar between sand sediment and water indicating little interaction sediment composition was generally unfavorable to bacterial resuspension results show that fib and mst markers were effective estimates of short term conditions at these locations and bacterial communities in sand and sediment reflected longer term conditions findings are useful for locating contamination sources and

lakes 1 introduction the microbial community in shoreline sand is a diverse and dynamic ecosystem that impacts multiple shoreline processes from nitrogen fixation to sulfur reduction mohiuddin et al 2017 to anaerobic digestion wurzbacher et al 2017 and fills a key link in energy transfer david et al 2016 both within the aquatic system and between aquatic and terrestrial systems the composition and diversity of this community is influenced by external factors including distant and local contamination sources nakatsu et al 2019 and in turn influences the associated interstitial eukaryotic biota found in this environment hölker et al 2015 wetted shoreline sand provides a transition zone for microbes between planktonic and benthic states but the constant interaction between the two matrices might imply consistency in the microbial communities of the sand and overlying water while research has identified the physical potential for settling and resuspension the frequency of exchange of microbes between sand and overlying water is not fully understood further there is some evidence that species or community composition varies with the dynamics of settling and resuspension and shear stress fang et al 2017 found more proteobacteria under dynamic flow conditions and more firmicutes species with static conditions there are also factors that determine the broader geographic distribution of bacterial communities and related dynamics nevers and whitman 2008 staley and sadowsky 2016 microbial transfer between sand and water has been focused on fecal indicator bacteria fib and microbes of public health concern e g bacteria fungi due to the human recreational activities in beach environments sabino et al 2011 world health organization 2003 sources of fecal contamination to nearshore water include sand borne bacteria originating from recent contamination by anthropogenic sources and wildlife or from naturalized populations byappanahalli et al 2015 edge and hill 2007 yamahara et al 2009 early observations identified the correlative relationship between fib in sand and water alm et al 2003 whitman and nevers 2003 and subsequent examinations have sought to characterize the bi directional movement of these bacteria through settling feng et al 2016 wu et al 2017 and wave induced resuspension ge et al 2012 le fevre and lewis 2003 few studies however have explored these relationships between the entire planktonic and benthic bacterial communities in the sand and sediment most microbes are particle bound in aquatic environments fries et al 2006 so sand water interactions are typically described using long established tenets of particle transport models in fact thupaki et al 2013 determined that sediment directly interacts with the bacteria e g e coli and considering short duration low intensity resuspension events greatly improved predictability in resuspension models using this paradigm understanding of bacterial transport mechanisms through settling and accumulation feng et al 2016 vertical transport wu et al 2017 and resuspension potential o mullan et al 2019 has greatly improved particle attachment and microbial survival including fib

see reviews by nevers et al 2014 weiskerger et al 2019 biofilm formation has been identified as a key factor in isolating bacterial communities and limiting exchange gobet et al 2012 by mediating nutrient and gas oxygen exchange and creating a barrier to predation weitere et al 2005 indeed some studies have identified complete separation of microbial communities between sand and water in intertidal sediments llobet brossa et al 1998 and freshwater shorelines cloutier et al 2015 other studies comparing microbial communities in sand and water have identified instead high similarity cui et al 2013 perhaps due to variation in biofilm composition biofilm integrity is also influenced by physical forces waves shear stress and tidal action can break up biofilms causing microbes to be released readily into the surrounding water boehm and weisberg 2005 current understanding of sand water interactions of bacterial communities in freshwater shorelines is limited by scope typically

degraded shorelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites were located along the southern lake michigan coastline in the laurentian great lakes fig 1 sites included the grand calumet river gc and jeorse park jp1 jp2 jpw in east chicago indiana 63rd street beach 63 1 63 2 in chicago illinois and the root river rec and north beach nb1 nb3 in racine wisconsin these sites have been the target of restoration efforts many ongoing to improve nearshore water quality kinzelman and mclellan 2009 converse et al 2012 nevers et al 2018 it should be noted that for the duration of the sampling period a gull deterrence program was in place at jeorse park 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 water sand and sediment in june august of 2016 and 2017 water samples 1 5l were collected weekly for 10 weeks n 80 per year table 1 water from gc was collected with a sterile collection bucket lowered from the bridge crossing at columbus drive rec samples were collected using a reach pole or sampling line all shoreline samples were collected by submerging autoclaved nalgene bottles below the surface in 45 cm deep water three intensive sampling events in 2016 and 2017 june july august included collection of sand defined as wetted foreshore sand in the swash zone 0 5 1 m from water s edge water at 45 cm depth as described above and sediment defined as submerged sediment sand at 45 cm water depth sampling sites in 2016 included only one 63rd site 63 1 and jpw a site closer to the breakwall was sampled rather than jp2 for sand collection a quadrat was randomly set while avoiding areas with accumulated gull fecal droppings litter and algae within each quadrat the top 1 2 cm surface sand was repeatedly scooped in small amounts into a whirl pak bag until 200 g was obtained three replicates were obtained within an approximately 8 m2 area using a separate shovel for each site that was sprayed with 70 ethanol and rinsed with sterile water between replicates for sediment collection a weighted quadrat was placed on the lake bottom in 45 cm deep water along a transect aligned with sand collection after allowing visible suspended sediment to settle 2 min sediment was collected by horizontally swiping scooping a sterilized 12 7 cm long 1 5 cm diameter plastic core tube along the top 1 cm of sediment while covering one tube end with the index finger the tube was slowly lifted out of the water to prevent loss of sample and emptied into a whirl pak bag the process was repeated until 200 g of sediment was collected a new sterile core was used to obtain three quadrat replicates water depth held constant for all samples in which 16s rrna gene sequencing was the endpoint sampling tools and bottles were sterilized with 10 bleach all other sterilization was by autoclaving all samples were placed on ice in coolers directly after collection and transported to the laboratory whirl pak bags containing sand and sediment were held overnight at 4 c and processed

3 3 sand and sediment fractionation sand and sediment in wisconsin were both primarily categorized as medium sized sand 0 2 0 5 mm sand at sites in illinois were more distributed among size classes and the largest percentage at 63 1 was medium sized sand 39 followed by coarse sand 21 while sand at 63 2 was primarily gravel 36 followed by medium sized sand 32 the indiana sites were quite different with most of the sand 56 jp1 59 jp2 and sediment 44 jp1 53 jp2 dominated by gravel the dominant sediment size fractions at these locations are not typically associated with settling and resuspension of fib jeng et al 2005 found that fib in their study were associated with fine 0 45 30 μ m and coarse 30 μ m size classes which are smaller than the dominant size fractions in this study 3 4 bacterial community characterizations and comparisons of the 153 sand sediment and water samples analyzed there were enough illumina sequencing reads for all samples except for one replicate jpw water collected 8 9 2016 the samples produced 11 725 371 paired end reads after quality filtering and merging with an average of 77 528 reads sample ranging 9372 384 323 reads sequences were rarified

sequences were rarefied to 9700 reads sample sequences have been deposited into genbank under accession prjna578544 3 4 1 sand and sediment measurements of alpha diversity within sample revealed no significant difference between sand and sediment microbial communities when compared by site location date or state beta diversity among sample diversity showed considerable overlap among communities in the sand and in the sediment and did not differ significantly fig 4 a the results overall indicate considerable heterogeneity within and among collection sites regardless of whether the sample was sand or sediment however lefse analyses linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated there were significant differences of 38 taxa at different taxonomic levels of classification between sand and sediment communities table s1 notable are the often gut associated genus prevotella and family lachnospiraceae found significantly higher in sediment compared to sand fig 5 a 3 4 2 water bacterial

followed by n1 n3 and jpw fig 6 wisconsin had higher shannon diversity than illinois or indiana p 0 003 when all sites within a state were grouped dividing data by water type within state state location wisconsin lake wisconsin river and indiana river were significantly higher than indiana lake and illinois lake p 0 03 there was also a significant difference in shannon diversity among the

unifrac p 0 001 with the first three axes accounting for 61 of variation the first axis accounted for 28 9 of variation and strictly separated all gc samples using unweighted unifrac samples categorized by site were significantly different in this case both river sites rec and gc drove the relationship although the amount of variation described was lower than in the weighted unifrac unweighted unifrac first three axes 22 9 total this separation of gc also resulted in indiana being significantly different from illinois and wisconsin p 0 001 separation overall was decidedly determined as lake vs river with the microbial community in gc being different from all other sites there were 55 phyla in the water samples dominated by proteobacteria with actinobacteria and bacteroidetes also abundant the three phyla represent 90 relative proportion of all taxa table s2 in variable proportions among locations e g the gc site included greater relative proportions of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes taxa and fewer actinobacteria taxa than all other sampled sites significant differences in 485 taxa from all levels of taxonomic classification were identified when the seven locations were compared using lefse table s3 lefse analysis indicated that several taxa contributed to the higher proportion of bacteroidetes in gc including an undescribed genus of cyclobacteriaceae a finding previously documented nakatsu et al 2019 and the genera flavobacterium and fluviicola many of the differences were at the family level so it is difficult to identify factors that may drive these taxonomic differences among sites chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were found at all sites albeit in lower proportions than the three dominant phyla 3 4 3 comparisons of water sand and sediment communities communities in water were separated according to weighted unifrac fig 4 across all locations and dates of sampling there were only two sand and three sediment samples that had communities more like those in water than the rest of the sand sediment samples fig 4b and because of these samples permdisp was significant p 0 001 examining closely these samples four of the five were from the same sampling date 8 9 16 but collected across three states 3 wisconsin 1 illinois 1 indiana for each individual point adjacent samples were often river samples in both wisconsin and indiana like water actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were abundant in sand and sediment samples fig 5b however the bacterial phyla representing acidobacteria and firmicutes were more abundant in sand and sediment than water fig 7 taxonomic differences identified using lefse indicated there were 29 taxa with lda 2 0 in water samples compared to sand and sediment table s4 most differences were in the water samples with the phylum bacteroidetes with the highest lda value fig 5b within the bacteroidetes the family cyclobacteriaceae and genera sediminibacterium and paludibacter were significant 4 discussion movement of bacterial communities across the sand water interface emerged as a concern when it was determined that fib were present in shoreline sand in concentrations significantly higher than in nearshore water alm et al 2003 whitman and nevers 2003 historically research addressing this problem focused on identifying the original source and identifying the potential for resuspension ge et al 2010 kim et al 2004 multiple techniques have been applied to describe microbial interactions of sand and water including mst genomic analysis and hydrodynamic modeling while many studies have provided insight on sources and potential interactions e g see solo gabriele et al 2016 few have taken a three tiered approach across a broad geographic area to test the universality of emerging models and to link multiple shoreline processes affecting bacterial community composition 4 1 shoreline interactions of sand and water in this study both fib and gull2 were consistently higher in sand and sediment than in water at all locations sampled which supports historical findings abdelzaher et al 2009 previous studies have described shoreline sand as a sink for bacteria originating from both offshore and onshore sources with low energy embayments like jp and 63rd being prone to excessive accumulation byappanahalli et al 2015 whitman and nevers 2003 persistence in the sand is aided by protection from adverse environmental conditions desiccation sunlight predation etc kinzelman and mclellan 2009 weiskerger et al 2019 and intermittent growth when nutrients are available e g decaying algae and beach wrack byappanahalli et al 2006 nevers et al 2016 the lack of correlation between concentrations in sand and water in this study indicates that the two populations were not in constant flux or equilibrium gulls are often implicated as a shoreline non point source of bacteria byappanahalli et al 2015 lu et al 2011 this was borne out in this study by the abundance of gull2 in shoreline water and the lack in river water the similarity in pattern of concentration between fib and gull2 results where water sediment sand can be explained by accumulation and persistence of both targets in the shoreline sand with accumulation the sand itself becomes a potential secondary non point source of contamination to the water so ultimately both gulls and sand have the potential to contribute bacteria to the nearshore water during resuspension events boehm et al 2009 halliday et al 2014 while bacteria associated with the human gut koskey et al 2014 mclellan and eren 2014 were among those identified in sand and sediment the marker for human fecal contamination hf183 was only detected in water but for one sediment replicate previous studies have identified it as a conservative marker an indicator of very recent fecal contamination nevers et al 2018 which may explain this discrepancy the human gut associated bacteria could be indicative of longer term communities and impacts not readily detected using hf183 marker lower concentrations of fib and gull2 at jp compared to nb and 63rd were likely the result of management actions taking place for the duration of the study which also impacts comparisons across geographic scale jp has historically had high fib concentrations linked to gull populations so a program was initiated using trained dogs to chase gulls which effectively reduced fib concentration nevers et al 2018 a similar management strategy was historically implemented for short periods at the other two study sites nb converse et al 2012 and 63rd cathy breitenbach chicago park district personal communication bacterial communities identified through targeted metagenomic 16s rrna gene analysis differed between sand sediment and water fig 4b indicating that the communities were not in equilibrium cloutier et al 2015 similarly found that the nearshore water bacteria community differed from that in sand berm and sediment submerged halliday et al 2014 showed that bacterial communities in water collected on opposite sides of north america were more like one another than to those in the sand and sediment with which the water was in constant contact the lack of similarity between these two matrices has been attributed to biofilm formation in the sand and sediment gobet et al 2012 or differential decay between sand sediment and water zhang et al 2015 matrix specific factors and resulting impacts on reususpension potential could drive this difference 4 2 resuspension potential studies of nearshore hydrodynamics and shear stress have identified the need for high energy conditions to re suspend fib from shoreline sand or sediment phillips et al 2014 intensive work at 63rd has highlighted a propensity for resuspension during high energy events ge et al 2012 in this study it s possible that physical conditions were insufficient to resuspend bacterial groups due to biofilm formation or sediment composition the few instances where bacterial communities overlapped between sand sediment and water were during a single sampling event 8 9 16 fig 4b which could have been a regional event affecting all sites safaie et al n d deployed a lisst 100x instrument laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry sequoia scientific at jp in 2016 during our sampling period and determined that particle size distributions were multi modal their models of sediment fib interactions indicated that wind waves contributed to increased bottom shear stress frequently such that sediment resuspension characterized by elevated levels of suspended sediment and fib concentrations in the water column occurred often and almost weekly sediment resuspension foreshore sand and avian sources of e coli were needed to describe the observed variability in fib in water and sand models that included only riverine influences failed to describe the observed data the lack of interaction in results presented here could be due to the limited number of study dates 4 3 point source influences bacterial diversity would likely be high within a river and associated sites as a result of multiple point and nonpoint source inputs including riparian soils agriculture and treated or untreated wastewater effluent thupaki et al 2010 while the highest bacterial diversity was at rec nb1 and nb3 in wisconsin gc was singularly different from all other sites fig 4c with much lower diversity gc is in a heavy industrial area and receives periodic combined sewer overflows from multiple municipalities which explains the high detection rate of hf183 but not the lower overall diversity the lack of similarity between gc and associated shorelines could be due to a lack of hydrologic connection nakatsu et al 2019 mechanistic modeling by safaie et al n d examined contributions of various sources rivers birds sand at jp which indicated that contamination from gc is deflected off the harbor structure and does not reach jp beyond river impacts or local perturbations there is evidence that fib fluctuate on a regional scale with high and low concentrations detected simultaneously along extended coastlines nevers and whitman 2008 whitman and nevers 2008 this could explain correlations between 63rd with nb3 and jp but not with either river and the sand sediment water event of 8 9 15 the interplay between point and nonpoint sources can lead to location specific bacteria concentrations and affect bacterial community composition but broader geographic distributions and fluctuations are also present 4 4 patterns of geographic scale bacterial communities in water were significantly different across sites dates water type and states but there were no significant differences for community composition in sand and sediment for any of these variables fig 4b others have reported on high community similarity in sand and sediment across lakes cloutier et al 2015 across continents halliday et al 2014 and even across the world staley and sadowsky 2016 in contrast communities in water tend to exhibit higher geographic variation perhaps due to the multiple abiotic e g sunlight inactivation and biotic decay predation influences on this dynamic matrix the consistent community composition in sand and sediment lends support to the concept of sand as a sink for bacteria that becomes isolated through physical and or biological processes the sand community therefore represents longer term persistence or conditions at the location 5 conclusions bacterial communities in shoreline sand represent long term conditions or status of the shoreline while those in water are more representative of the influence of immediate sources and antecedent conditions e g river inputs sunlight inactivation predation bacterial communities in sand and water originate from multiple sources but once bacteria are entrained in the sand and sediment internal and external processes affect them differently than those in water the interaction of sand and water bacteria communities is likely impacted by high energy resuspension or washing events use of a three tiered

17919,micro aerobic enhancement technology has been developed as an effective tool to enhance simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and organic carbon during the integrated autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification iahd process under high loading however its mechanism of enhancement for functional bacteria remains ambiguous in this study we discovered that heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb are responsible for enhancing iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide loading in a continuous iahd bioreactor aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 promoted 2 to 4 times higher removal efficiencies of sulfide nitrate and acetate with an influent sulfide concentration of 18 75 mmol l metagenomic analysis revealed that trace oxygen stimulated the abundance of genes responsible for sulfide oxidation sqr glpe pdo sox and cysk which were upregulated by 15 2 129 9 and the genes encoding nitrate reductase were up regulated by 67 4 the increased acetate removal efficiency was attributed to upregulation of ack pta and tca cycle related genes the h nrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas were detected and regarded as h sonrb in our bioreactor according to illumina miseq sequencing these genera were absolutely dominant in the micro aerobic microbial community at relative abundances ranging from 82 72 to 90 84 the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal rates of pseudomonas c27 a typical h sonrb were at least 10 times higher under micro aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions besides the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic network was constructed based on the pseudomonas c27 genome the pdo and cysk genes found in this strain may be the most advantageous for autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb which are closely related to the high efficiency sulfide nitrate and acetate removal performance under high sulfide concentrations and a limited oxygen supply in addition after micro aerobic cultivation the anaerobic sulfide loading tolerance of the iahd bioreactor increased from 18 75 to 37 5 mmol l with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies increasing 1 5 to 3 times which suggests that intermittent micro aeration might be a more economical and efficient regime for high sulfide iahd regulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro aerobic enhancement high sulfide loading autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb metabolic network of sulfur nitrogen and carbon 1 introduction since the advent of actived sludge process technologies biological denitrification has been the preferred reliable and economically viable technology to remove nitrate from wastewater heterotrophic denitrification heden which is currently the most widely applied nitrogen removal biotechnology in municipal wastewater treatment plants reduces nitrate to n2 via heterotrophic denitrifiers in the presence of organic matter however the large demand for carbon source has restricted the development of the heden process during the treatment of high nitrogen containing sewage without organic carbon low c n the addition of an external carbon source is necessary to ensure a high nitrogen removal efficiency however this causes uncontrollable secondary pollution and increases the operating costs of the heden process hellman et al 2019 compared to heden instead of consuming organic carbon the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification auden process which uses sulfide sulfur or thiosulfate as electron donor to remove nitrogen can be effectively applied for low c n wastewater treatment one of the most valuable auden technologies developed in recent years is the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process based on the concept of sulfur recycling the sani process enables sludge reduction while performing denitrification with minimal energy consumption wu et al 2016 a large amount of sulfate is produced during the sani process but there is no need for post processing because the effluent can be directly discharged into the sea however the auden process also has limitations the slow growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers leads to a long start up stage and a relatively high hydraulic retention time hrt in addition the environmental capacity for sulfate in the receiving water inland rivers of most sewage treatment plants is low and the discharge of high concentration sulfate increases salinity moreover hydrogen sulfide produced by sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions releases odor and lowers the water quality thus considering the environmental impact and investment and operation cost discussed above mixotrophic denitrification also known as autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification has unique advantages over the heden and auden processes based on the concept of mixotrophic denitrification wang et al 2005 proposed an innovative and effective three unit simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification process to treat sulfate and ammonia laden high strength organic wastewater such as pharmacy tannery and dyeing industrial wastewater detailed in text s1 and fig s1 in which the integrated autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification iahd process is the key unit for nitrogen and organic carbon removal with extra bio sulfur generation because the auden and heden processes occur simultaneously during the iahd process autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb which oxidize sulfide with nitrate as an electron acceptor and heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb which use nitrate nitrite to degrade organic carbon are the two putative functional bacterial groups in traditional theory however the discovery of pseudomonas c27 which can perform sulfide oxidation under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions makes heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb receive increasing attention and h sonrb has become another putative functional bacterial group during the iahd process chen et al 2013 as the second processing unit of the simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification process the iahd processing unit receives effluent from the third aerobic nitrification unit which inevitably contains a certain amount of oxygen do 1 mg l do is generally considered to cause rapid degradation of the carbon source or inhibition of denitrifying enzymes which leads to a lower nitrogen removal efficiency during the denitrification process li et al 2017 however during the iahd process it was found that micro oxygen levels had a lower inhibitory effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency by saving heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria from high sulfide concentrations khanal and huang 2006 therefore dosing small quantities of air oxygen usually referred to as micro aeration into the iahd unit to weaken sulfide toxicity and achieve enhanced denitrification performance has drawn much attention more importantly creating micro aerobic conditions during iahd is not only feasible to ensure the stable operation of the process under high sulfide concentrations but it is also necessary to fit the actual operational situation chen et al 2010 first utilized micro aerobic conditions do 0 8 mg l to enhance the iahd process under a high sulfide concentration a lot of research has been carried out on micro aerobic technology during the iahd process including the optimization of do concentrations xu et al 2017 maximization of s0 recovery wang et al 2015 functional gene identification and microbial community analysis wang et al 2016a 2016b yu et al 2014 although iahd under micro aerobic conditions has been studied for 10 years to our knowledge the specific function of autotrophic denitrifiers and heterotrophic denitrifiers especially the h sonrb involved in those processes has received limited attention for the novel iahd process examining the functional roles of dominant bacteria and their mechanisms of action are necessary to understand the complex interactions and will be helpful to improve the design and operation of scaled up systems here we focused on the functional bacteria with high iahd performance under micro aerobic high sulfide loading conditions the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the enhanced sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies and rates under high sulfide loading by micro aerobic control 2 provide insight into the microbial community composition to better predict how these communities assemble in anaerobic and micro aerobic ecosystems 3 determine and study representative h sonrb to identify metabolic characteristics and mechanisms during the micro aerobic iahd process and 4 guide the general development and application of micro aerobic technologies based on the important role of h sonrb during iahd under micro aerobic conditions 2

china the change in proteins during pseudomonas c27 growth was examined using a modified bca protein assay kit sangon biotech c503051 china the activities of sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in the final residue were measured according to mohapatra et al 2006 the procedure for isolation of h sonrb bacteria is stated in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of micro aerobic conditions on iahd performance in the bioreactor the egsb bioreactor was started up with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l s n c 5 6 5 under anaerobic conditions when the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies stabilized at 99 the iahd process was considered to be successfully started up during stage ii the sulfide concentration increased to 12 5 mmol l doubling the sulfide concentration had almost no influence on sulfide and acetate removal merely making the nitrate removal efficiency decrease from 99 to 92 9 as shown in fig 2 and table 1 18 75 mmol l sulfide was the limiting concentration for the iahd process under anaerobic conditions during stage iii the breakdown of iahd was a gradual process and the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were as low as 24 9 24 1 and 42 1 respectively approximately 14 mmol l sulfide was detected in the effluent for 14 consecutive days this cumulative toxicity of sulfide might contribute to the poor performance of the iahd process thus micro aerobic conditions were created by introducing 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 air into the egsb bioreactor to reestablish peak performance of the iahd process as expected the sulfide removal efficiency began to increase after dosing with 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 air while compared to the sharp decrease of effluent nitrate and acetate declining to zero in 3 days the effluent sulfide decreased more slowly declining to zero in 18 days when the bioreactor performance stabilized the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were the same as in stage i from stage v to vii the sulfide concentration from 25 mmol l to 31 25 mmol l and aeration rate from 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 to 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 was successively increased to optimize the do concentration under a high sulfide concentration during stage vi the sulfide and acetate removal efficiencies all reached 100 corresponding to a removal of 91 3 nitrate under a sulfide concentration of 25 mmol l and aeration rate of 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 after 148 days cultivation under micro aerobic conditions the bioreactor was again converted to anaerobic operation the iahd process successfully tolerated a sulfide concentration of 37 5 mmol l during stage viii with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of 69 1 97 4 and 93 3 respectively however when the sulfide concentration was increased to 46 88 mmol l the sulfide was hardly removed and the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies decreased to approximate 40 thus the iahd process was considered to have collapsed during stage x the bioreactor was switched from anaerobic stage ix back to micro aerobic stage x the sulfide removal efficiency increased to 67 4 while the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies rebounded to as high as 90 1 and 85 3 respectively during the whole 355 days operation the s0 transformation rate was closely related to the sulfide and do concentrations during the anaerobic stage ii the sulfur transformation rate reached 92 4 which was almost twice that of stage i 56 2 the increased sulfide concentration led to an increased sulfur transformation rate which was similar to that reported by beristain cardoso et al 2011 in addition micro aerobic conditions were shown as an effective means to enhance the sulfur transformation rate xu et al 2017 successfully operated an integrated sulfate reduction sulfide oxidation bioreactor under micro aerobic conditions and achieved an s0 transformation rate of 71 8 with do of 0 1 0 12 mg l wang et al 2015 obtained an s0 transformation rate of 100 with sulfide loading of as high as 8 16 kg s m 3 d 1 with do of 0 1 0 3 mg l in our iahd process trace do 0 1 0 3 mg l improved the sulfur transformation rate from 10 9 to 81 5 under a sulfide concentration of 18 75 mmol l the do concentration under micro aerobic stages can t be directly measured due to high sulfide concentration 6 75 46 88 mmol l in bioreactor thus a control bioreactor full of tap water was employed to quantify oxygen under different aeration rates by this way the detected do fluctuated between 0 1 0 5 mg l table 1 which indicated the micro aerobic condition definitely existed in bioreactor what s more the orp in each stage was measured at the bottom middle and upper position of the bioreactor column by orp meter lei ci 991 china and the data indicated orp ranged from 220 to 430 mv under anaerobic stages while under micro aerobic stages did from 280 to 450 mv implying the neglected correlation between orp and aeration rates thus the data were not shown 3 2 the response of c n and s metabolic genes to micro aerobic conditions in order to explore the impact of micro aerobic conditions on functional genes involved in the uptake and biosynthesis of nitrogen and sulfur compounds samples a iii control m iv 2 6 18 75 mmol l sulfide with aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 and a viii 37 5 mmol l sulfide were used to analyze the up and down regulation of functional genes via metagenomic analysis fig 3 when an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 was supplied sulfide sqr thiosulfate sox and sulfite soeabc and e1 8 2 1 oxidation genes were on average 69 1 129 9 21 9 and 334 4 more abundant respectively in m iv 2 6 the pdo gene which encodes for pdo catalyzes the oxidation of glutathione persulfide gssh to form sulfite was upregulated by 15 2 thiosulfate phsac and psra and sulfite sir reductase genes decreased in abundance by 96 8 and 62 2 respectively the close relationship between sir ferredoxin sulfite reductase and the sulfide removal efficiency has been demonstrated by zhang et al 2019 using 16s metaproteomic functional composition prediction their study found that the abundance of ferredoxin sulfite reductase decreased by 24 2 when the sulfide removal efficiency increased from 37 8 to 71 7 in a sulfide oxidation autotrophic denitrification bioreactor the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway was also enhanced under micro aerobic conditions with sat and aprab up regulated by 7 3 and 28 2 respectively flavocytochrome c fcc and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr are the two enzymatic systems known to be involved in sulfide oxidation xu et al 2014 utilized geochip to reveal that fccab is expressed at a higher level under micro aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions during the sulfate and nitrate co reduction process the positive regulation of oxygen on sqr activity was also demonstrated by shibata et al 2001 who integrated the sqr gene in low copy numbers into escherichia coli and observed that the oxygen consumption increased proportionally to sqr activity in our iahd process fccab was downregulated by 65 1 under micro aerobic conditions with an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 however sqr was upregulated by 69 1 which indicates that trace oxygen enhances sulfide removal through the sqr leading pathway genes related to denitrification showed mixed results extracellular nitrate transport genes nrtabcd nitrate reductase genes narg nasab and napab and the nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz were more abundant by 296 4 67 4 and 19 2 respectively these results show that the nitrate removal efficiencies were four times higher in the bioreactor when trace oxygen was supplied after micro aerobic cultivation all the denitrification genes which reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas were upregulated from 3 6 to 70 5 and were responsible for the increased nitrate removal efficiency from 24 1 to 97 4 under anaerobic conditions clearly 18 75 mmol l sulfide was the limit of the anaerobic load for the bioreactor achieving a sulfide removal efficiency of 24 9 however the efficiency improved three times when the sulfide concentration increased to 37 5 mmol l after micro aerobic cultivation consistent with the increased sulfide removal efficiency the abundances of sox sqr and glpe were increased by 19 8 95 9 and 88 7 respectively thus we speculated that micro aerobic conditions not only stimulate sulfide nitrate and acetate removal during the iahd process but can also act as a promoter for enhancing sulfide tolerance under anaerobic conditions in the interest of energy conservation intermittent micro aeration can be an effective alternative to continuous aeration for improving iahd performance however the aeration rate aeration time and the substrate concentration still require in depth exploration in addition l serine was involved in sulfur metabolism l serine is converted to o acetyl l serine by cyse and reacts with sulfide under the regulation of cysk to generate l cysteine and acetate although the sulfide used to synthesize l cysteine can be ignored when compared to the total amount of sulfide in the system the upregulation of those two genes reflects the high metabolic level of microorganisms during and after micro aerobic cultivation microbial metabolism of organic carbon involves multiple pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway ppp and glyoxylate cycle as the main metabolic pathway to obtain energy for microbial growth the tca cycle was selected as a focal point and was linked to acetate degradation in fig 3 acetate kinase ak and phosphate acetyltransferase pta catalyze a two step reaction to convert acetate to acetyl coa in the tca cycle for energy metabolism their encoding genes ack and pta were upregulated by 27 3 under micro aerobic conditions there were eight key genes involved in the tca cycle except for a small downregulation of glta 8 7 and suca 1 8 the other genes were upregulated 5 7 92 1 under micro aerobic stimulation after micro aerobic cultivation genes encoding all eight enzymes of the tca cycle including ack and pta were upregulated by 4 9 72 3 during stage viii the upregulation of carbon metabolism genes not only explains the doubled acetate removal efficiency but also reflects a higher level of energy metabolism during stages iv and viii 3 3 composition and phylogenetic analysis of the microbial community the microbial communities of 10 sludge samples were characterized by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 15 dominant genera were identified within the 5 dominant phyla fig 4 and s3 during the start up stage with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l azoarcus thiobacillus thauera and arcobacter were the dominant genera with relative abundances of 36 72 29 09 11 84 and 9 68 respectively after doubling the sulfide concentration during stage ii the proportion of azoarcus doubled to 73 96 and aliidiomorina was observed at an abundance of 9 10 while the proportion of thiobacillus and arcobacter decreased to less than 1 when the sulfide concentration was further increased to 18 75 mmol l the microbial community structure showed a drastic change with pseudomonas 73 54 and azoarcus 13 23 dominating the bioreactor was subsequently operated under micro aerobic conditions in stages iv to vii a satisfactory iahd performance was obtained under sulfide concentrations of 18 75 mmol l and 25 mmol l with aeration rates of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 and 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 during stages iv and vi respectively table 1 the total proportion of azoarcus halomonas and aliidiomorina reached 95 35 and 96 92 during stages iv and vi respectively whereas compared to these two stages the sulfide nitrate and acetate efficiencies slightly decreased during stages v and vii and the dominant genera were completely different pseudomonas and arcobacter replaced azoarcus halomonas and aliidiomorina as the dominant genera with a total abundance of 95 69 stage v and 84 9 stage vii thus a closer relationship seems to exist between azoarcus aliidiomorina and high iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions however when the bioreactor was operated under anaerobic condition again during stage viii the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies increased from 88 1 to 97 4 and 85 4 93 3 respectively with pseudomonas accounting for 82 19 of microbial community based on this stage the relationship between azoarcus aliidiomorina and high iahd performance appeared to be weak while the high abundance of pseudomonas might be responsible for the successful iahd process these results were also verified in stages ix and x during stage ix which exhibited poor iahd performance the proportion of pseudomonas decreased to 70 63 during stage x the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased to 78 93 and the bioreactor regained enhanced sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies 3 4 effect of micro aerobic conditions on the growth of pseudomonas c27 in order to determine the functional bacteria responsible for enhanced iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide concentrations we sampled iahd sludge from stage iv micro aerobic 18 75 mmol l sulfide and stage viii anaerobic 37 5 mmol l four strains were isolated from the sludge namely pseudomonas wz4 2 pseudomonas wz7 pseudomonas wz5 and halomonas wz4 1 given their ability to simultaneously remove sulfide nitrate and acetate these strains were regarded as h sonrb table s2 summarizes the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of the four strains over 24 h as well as pseudomonas c27 isolated from the mother bioreactor by chen et al 2013 the highest sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were achieved by pseudomonas c27 which was selected as the representative h sonrb in further experiments the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal performances of pseudomonas c27 under anaerobic batch test i and micro aerobic batch test ii conditions were explored a lag stage lasted for 48 h in batch test i after which pseudomonas c27 began to quickly oxidize sulfide at 53 62 h fig 5 a at the end of the test 1 61 mmol l s2 remained and 4 97 mmol l s2 was converted to s2o3 2 s nitrate and acetate removal have similar trends to sulfide at the end of the batch test i 5 84 mmol l no2 n accumulated as the main denitrification product in batch test ii under micro aerobic conditions sulfide nitrate and acetate were immediately oxidized after the inoculation of pseudomonas c27 and the growth rate of c27 was also faster than under anaerobic conditions fig s5 all the oxidized sulfide was converted to thiosulfate and nitrite accumulated as an intermediate product with a peak value of 5 6 mmol l no2 n at 27 h this micro aerobic removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate was primarily due to the biodegradation of pseudomonas c27 when compared with the chemical control fig s6 the activities of relative enzymes under anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions are shown in table s3 the sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities increased to 0 11 0 02 u 0 09 0 007 u and 0 007 0 0003 u respectively under trace oxygen this adequately explains the efficient iahd process performed by pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions 3 5 sulfur nitrogen and organic carbon metabolic network in pseudomonas c27 based on the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways in the pseudomonas c27 genome figs s7 s15 table s4 a network was constructed of the sulfide and acetate coupled nitrate denitrification process fig 6 first sulfide hydrogen sulfide is catalyzed by sqr which is located on the plasma membrane to produce polysulfide or elemental sulfur that is then reacted with glutathione gsh to form gssh gssh is converted to gsh and is accompanied by the formation of sulfite under the catalysis of the persulfide dioxygenase pdo enzyme as shown in fig 6 this reaction requires the participation of oxygen liu et al 2014 thus the enhanced performance of pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions might be attributed to the oxygen targeted enhancement of this reaction however when sulfide oxidation occurs under anaerobic conditions we speculate that there are two most likely explanations 1 the pdo catalyzed reaction is short circuited due to a lack of oxygen or 2 some oxygen containing active substances will be generated during nitrate respiration replacing oxygen as a substrate for pdo ettwig et al 2010 discovered the fourth oxygen production mechanism in the anaerobic denitrifying bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera which lacks noszdfy although the pseudomonas c27 genome contains nosdfylz it is possible that it can also produce oxygen under anaerobic conditions via unknown pathways gsh is a tripeptide containing a thiol based active center that is formed by the combination of glutamic acid cysteine and glycine by interconversion between gsh and gssh an anti oxidation and anti toxicity effect is achieved in microorganisms in the presence of sulfide thiosulfate sulfide transferase tst catalyzes the reaction between sulfite and gssh to form thiosulfate and gsh hildebrandt and grieshaber 2008 in addition sulfides also form sulfites under sulfite reductase catalysis xin et al 2016 conducted a more detailed study on the sulfur oxidation process of heterotrophic microorganisms their research found that the protein domain cpduf442 which has thiosulfate thiotransferase activity in heterotrophic microbial cells can catalyze the conversion of gsh to gssh and sulfite to thiosulfate furthermore while conducting sulfide oxidation experiments in vitro it was found that polysulfide and gsh spontaneously generate gssh and sulfite and polysulfide can also spontaneously synthesize thiosulfate cysteine synthetase encoded by the cysk gene catalyzes the formation of cysteine from sulfide in pseudomonas c27 guo et al 2014 proposed a tca cycle bypass serine metabolic process based on proteomic studies of pseudomonas c27 under high sulfide stress in which the cysteine synthase catalyzed reaction is a key step of this alternative metabolic pathway gsha and gshb regulate the synthesis of gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase gclc and glutathione synthetase gss which catalyze the production of γ glutamylcysteine via cysteine and generate gsh to participate in sulfur metabolism when pseudomonas c27 uses acetate as carbon source for metabolism acetate kinase ak firstly catalyzes the formation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and then phosphotransferase pta catalyzes the generation of acetyl coa which enters the tca cycle to produce atp and nadh isocitrate is an important tca cycle intermediate in addition to the continued production of succinyl coa that can also form glyoxylate and succinate via catalysis of isocitrase through the glyoxylate cycle pathway subsequently producing s malate catalyzed by malate synthase electrons generated during the metabolism of sulfide and acetate are transferred into the respiratory chain by nadh and ubiquinone under micro aerobic conditions oxygen acts as an electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation complex iv under anaerobic conditions nitrate accepts electrons which is then reduced to nitrogen gas through nitrate respiration in pseudomonas c27 3 6 the important role of h sonrb involved in the iahd process under micro aerobic conditions systematic analysis of the microbial community structure metagenomes and functional bacteria can help elucidate the enhanced effects of micro aerobic conditions the dominant genera were classified into two broad categories namely heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb and autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb table s5 a high abundance of a sonrb is believed to be responsible for the high sulfide removal efficiency in sulfide containing wastewater treatment processes yang et al 2016 thiobacillus and arcobacter were the two main dominant a sonrb observed in the iahd bioreactor the sulfide oxidizing ability of thiobacillus has been described in detail by dopson and johnson 2012 arcobacter a common a sonrb in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process lives in microaerophilic conditions and acts as an autotrophic producer of filamentous sulfur wirsen et al 2002 however except for stage i with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l the total proportions of thiobacillus and arcobacter were lower than 5 during the stages when sulfide removal efficiencies were higher than 99 the relative abundance of h nrb demonstrated another interesting tendency the total proportion of the five dominant h nrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera aliidiomorina and halomonas were 50 29 and 86 95 in stages i and ii respectively and further increased to 97 in the micro aerobic stages iv and vi with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of 90 99 and 100 respectively two possible metabolic mechanisms involved in the iahd process which were proposed by zhang et al 2018 can provide reasonable explanations for the observed microbial community structure the combined function of h nrb and a sonrb supports the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate under low sulfide concentrations s2 6 25 mmol l as a subset of h nrb h sonrb might be responsible for sulfide removal working with h nrb to ensure a high iahd performance when the sulfide concentration increased this is embodied in the increased relative abundance of h nrb during stage ii the large proportion of h nrb including h sonrb in microbial community under micro aerobic conditions leads us to speculate that trace oxygen can improve the iahd performance by possibly targeting h sonrb to date a number of h sonrb have been reported and isolated from wastewater treatment processes and the natural environment including pseudomonas c27 chen et al 2013 pseudomonas crs1 wong and lee 2014 pseudomonas sp h117 su et al 2016 pseudomonas stutzeri dq1 zhao et al 2015 pseudomonas n2 and s4 sun et al 2019 pseudomonas wz4 2 wz7 and wz5 azoarcus taiwanesis nsc3t lee et al 2014 thauera hdd huang et al 2017 paracoccus n1 sun et al 2019 and halomonas wz4 1 we selected pseudomonas c27 to conduct the iahd process and measured the sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities under both anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal rates and enzyme activities increased under micro aerobic conditions fig 5 and table s3 however the inhibition of nitrate reduction by oxygen has been widely reported ji et al 2018 cojean et al 2019 oh and silverstein 1999 and ma et al 2017 demonstrated that trace oxygen could decrease the denitrification rate in anoxic bioreactors some researchers have used both oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors to conduct denitrification by pure strains oxygen competed with nitrate for the nitrate reductase resulting in a lower nitrate reduction rate wu et al 1994 unlike these studies metagenomics analysis showed that the nitrogen metabolism genes involved in the denitrification process were all upregulated except nirks and norbc in our bioreactor m iv 2 6 with an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 this is consistent with the proteomic analysis of the functional bacteria pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions by guo et al 2014 the nitrate reductases were upregulated approximately 4 0 fold and the hemoglobin which increased denitrification efficiency and atp production was special expression in pseudomonas c27 furthermore the carbon and sulfur metabolism of pseudomonas c27 was also accelerated under micro aerobic conditions after the micro aerobic stages the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies reached 69 1 97 4 and 93 3 during the anaerobic stage viii with a sulfide concentration of 37 5 mmol l the big proportion of pseudomonas 82 19 in the microbial community suggests a relationship between increased load tolerance and iahd performance under anaerobic conditions and h sonrb the potential high efficiency enzyme system of pseudomonas c27 a typical h sonrb under high sulfide stress was confirmed by guo et al 2013 from the genomic perspective the advantages of pseudomonas c27 h sonrb for sulfide oxidation over thiobacillus denitrificans beller et al 2006 a sonrb might be obvious firstly the type of sqr enzymes are different between thiobacillus denitrificans and pseudomonas c27 according to fig s14 sqrb pseudomonas c27 translocates across the cytoplasmic membrane via twin arginine translocation tat pathway while the translocation mechanism of sqra thiobacillus denitrificans is still unknown gregersen et al 2011 secondly there are no pdo genes in the thiobacillus denitrificans genome the pdo enzyme catalyzes the reaction of gssh to gsh and accelerates the oxidation of sulfides thereby speeding up the detoxification process thirdly pseudomonas c27 has the cysk gene encoding for cysteine synthetase which catalyzes sulfide to generate acetate although the sulfide consumed in this pathway could be ignored urgent research is required to determine whether the produced acetate can be transferred to the tca cycle and continue to generate energy for metabolism if we make an assumption that the metabolic characteristics of pseudomonas c27 containing pdo and cysk genes is universal in h sonrb the phenomenon that h sonrb displace a sonrb as the dominant bacteria under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide concentrations could be easily understood of course the inhibitory effects of sulfide on a sonrb activity are the other reason for the low relative abundance of a sonrb under high sulfide concentrations lu et al 2018 presented convincing results that the nitrate reduction rate was significantly inhibited becoming the rate limiting step at 6 25 mmol l sulfide while the sulfide oxidation rate reached as high as 100 3 mg s2 g vss l under extremely high sulfide stress 31 25 mmol l tielens et al 2002 proposed that fumarate rather than nitrate can serve as the electron acceptor when autotrophic denitrification is limited which indicates the potential sulfide oxidizing ability of a sonrb at extremely high sulfide concentrations however in this study the nitrate and sulfide removal efficiencies both decreased and there was no notable difference between them when the sulfide concentration increased micro aerobic conditions have already been demonstrated as an effective technology for enhancing sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies in the iahd process chen et al 2017 wang et al 2016a 2016b the discovery of the essential role of h sonrb under micro aerobic conditions provides us with a new means of control by changing or reconstructing the microbial community composition to include a high abundance of h sonrb optimize the aeration rate and develop controlling strategies for low c n and s n wastewater to obtain high iahd performance meanwhile the separation and purification of sulfur oxidase found in h sonrb can be used to form a targeted high efficiency enzyme product that eliminates the metabolic inhibition of high sulfide concentrations by exogenous strengthening of the enzyme while also enhancing the carbon and nitrogen removal process in the iahd system furthermore from an engineering point of view this micro aerobic technology could be intermittently applied to improve the load tolerance of the h sonrb driven iahd process and simultaneously achieve the highest sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies with the lowest energy expenditure in industrial wastewater treatment 4 conclusion based on the enhanced iahd performance observed under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide loading the functional bacteria and their possible metabolic mechanisms were elaborated in this present work the h sonrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas predominated with a large proportion of 82 72 90 84 in the five micro aerobic microbial communities which contributed to satisfactory sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies pseudomonas c27 was selected as the typical h sonrb and its metabolism against high sulfide under the help of trace oxygen was discussed in micro aerobic condition its sulfide nitrate and acetate removals rates were 10 times more than that in anaerobic condition according to genomic analysis the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic network was constructed the pdo and cyck genes in pseudomonas c27 contributes to its unique advantage of metabolism over a sonrb eg thiobacillus denitrificans in micro aerobic conditions besides in metagenomics analysis under micro aerobic condition of bioreactor pdo and cysk genes up regulated by 15 2 and 39 1 respectively thus we speculated the trace oxygen might has stimulated effect on h sonrb resulted in the enhance iahd performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

17919,micro aerobic enhancement technology has been developed as an effective tool to enhance simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and organic carbon during the integrated autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification iahd process under high loading however its mechanism of enhancement for functional bacteria remains ambiguous in this study we discovered that heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb are responsible for enhancing iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide loading in a continuous iahd bioreactor aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 promoted 2 to 4 times higher removal efficiencies of sulfide nitrate and acetate with an influent sulfide concentration of 18 75 mmol l metagenomic analysis revealed that trace oxygen stimulated the abundance of genes responsible for sulfide oxidation sqr glpe pdo sox and cysk which were upregulated by 15 2 129 9 and the genes encoding nitrate reductase were up regulated by 67 4 the increased acetate removal efficiency was attributed to upregulation of ack pta and tca cycle related genes the h nrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas were detected and regarded as h sonrb in our bioreactor according to illumina miseq sequencing these genera were absolutely dominant in the micro aerobic microbial community at relative abundances ranging from 82 72 to 90 84 the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal rates of pseudomonas c27 a typical h sonrb were at least 10 times higher under micro aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions besides the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic network was constructed based on the pseudomonas c27 genome the pdo and cysk genes found in this strain may be the most advantageous for autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb which are closely related to the high efficiency sulfide nitrate and acetate removal performance under high sulfide concentrations and a limited oxygen supply in addition after micro aerobic cultivation the anaerobic sulfide loading tolerance of the iahd bioreactor increased from 18 75 to 37 5 mmol l with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies increasing 1 5 to 3 times which suggests that intermittent micro aeration might be a more economical and efficient regime for high sulfide iahd regulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro aerobic enhancement high sulfide loading autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb metabolic network of sulfur nitrogen and carbon 1 introduction since the advent of actived sludge process technologies biological denitrification has been the preferred reliable and economically viable technology to remove nitrate from wastewater heterotrophic denitrification heden which is currently the most widely applied nitrogen removal biotechnology in municipal wastewater treatment plants reduces nitrate to n2 via heterotrophic denitrifiers in the presence of organic matter however the large demand for carbon source has restricted the development of the heden process during the treatment of high nitrogen containing sewage without organic carbon low c n the addition of an external carbon source is necessary to ensure a high nitrogen removal efficiency however this causes uncontrollable secondary pollution and increases the operating costs of the heden process hellman et al 2019 compared to heden instead of consuming organic carbon the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification auden process which uses sulfide sulfur or thiosulfate as electron donor to remove nitrogen can be effectively applied for low c n wastewater treatment one of the most valuable auden technologies developed in recent years is the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process based on the concept of sulfur recycling the sani process enables sludge reduction while performing denitrification with minimal energy consumption wu et al 2016 a large amount of sulfate is produced during the sani process but there is no need for post processing because the effluent can be directly discharged into the sea however the auden process also has limitations the slow growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers leads to a long start up stage and a relatively high hydraulic retention time hrt in addition the environmental capacity for sulfate in the receiving water inland rivers of most sewage treatment plants is low and the discharge of high concentration sulfate increases salinity moreover hydrogen sulfide produced by sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions releases odor and lowers the water quality thus considering the environmental impact and investment and operation cost discussed above mixotrophic denitrification also known as autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification has unique advantages over the heden and auden processes based on the concept of mixotrophic denitrification wang et al 2005 proposed an innovative and effective three unit simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification process to treat sulfate and ammonia laden high strength organic wastewater such as pharmacy tannery and dyeing industrial wastewater detailed in text s1 and fig s1 in which the integrated autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification iahd process is the key unit for nitrogen and organic carbon removal with extra bio sulfur generation because the auden and heden processes occur simultaneously during the iahd process autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb which oxidize sulfide with nitrate as an electron acceptor and heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb which use nitrate nitrite to degrade organic carbon are the two putative functional bacterial groups in traditional theory however the discovery of pseudomonas c27 which can perform sulfide oxidation under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions makes heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb receive increasing attention and h sonrb has become another putative functional bacterial group during the iahd process chen et al 2013 as the second processing unit of the simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification process the iahd processing unit receives effluent from the third aerobic nitrification unit which inevitably contains a certain amount of oxygen do 1 mg l do is generally considered to cause rapid degradation of the carbon source or inhibition of denitrifying enzymes which leads to a lower nitrogen removal efficiency during the denitrification process li et al 2017 however during the iahd process it was found that micro oxygen levels had a lower inhibitory effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency by saving heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria from high sulfide concentrations khanal and huang 2006 therefore dosing small quantities of air oxygen usually referred to as micro aeration into the iahd unit to weaken sulfide toxicity and achieve enhanced denitrification performance has drawn much attention more importantly creating micro aerobic conditions during iahd is not only feasible to ensure the stable operation of the process under high sulfide concentrations but it is also necessary to fit the actual operational situation chen et al 2010 first utilized micro aerobic conditions do 0 8 mg l to enhance the iahd process under a high sulfide concentration a lot of research has been carried out on micro aerobic technology during the iahd process including the optimization of do concentrations xu et al 2017 maximization of s0 recovery wang et al 2015 functional gene identification and microbial community analysis wang et al 2016a 2016b yu et al 2014 although iahd under micro aerobic conditions has been studied for 10 years to our knowledge the specific function of autotrophic denitrifiers and heterotrophic denitrifiers especially the h sonrb involved in those processes has received limited attention for the novel iahd process examining the functional roles of dominant bacteria and their mechanisms of action are necessary to understand the complex interactions and will be helpful to improve the design and operation of scaled up systems here we focused on the functional bacteria with high iahd performance under micro aerobic high sulfide loading conditions the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the enhanced sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies and rates under high sulfide loading by micro aerobic control 2 provide insight into the microbial community composition to better predict how these communities assemble in anaerobic and micro aerobic ecosystems 3 determine and study representative h sonrb to identify metabolic characteristics and mechanisms during the micro aerobic iahd process and 4 guide the general development and application of micro aerobic technologies based on the important role of h sonrb during iahd under micro aerobic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor design and operation a lab scale expanded granular sludge bed egsb with working a volume of 3 8 l height 120 cm internal diameter 50 mm was established fig 1 the granular sludge was suspended using internal circulating fluid with a reflux ratio of approximately 6 1 the egsb bioreactor was inoculated with 1 9 l of mature activated sludge taken from the 3 year old mother denitrifying sulfide removal bioreactor chen et al 2013 and operated at room temperature with an hrt of 12 h the average concentrations of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were 63 4 g l and 41 8 g l respectively the synthetic medium for the start up stage was supplemented with 6 25 mmol l s2 7 5 mmol l no3 n 6 25 mmol l ch3coo c 1 5 g l na2co3 0 5 g l nh4cl 0

increased according to the sulfide concentration to maintain an influent ph of 8 0 0 1 high purity air was dosed into the recycled effluent at a controlled rate using a rotor flowmeter beixing china the experiment lasted for 355 days and was divided into ten stages the bioreactor was aerated with 2 6 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 air during five of the stages namely iv v vi vii and x while the remaining stages operated under anaerobic conditions 2 2 batch tests to evaluate the effects of micro aeration on simultaneous sulfide nitrate and acetate removal by h sonrb pseudomonas c27 genbank number of

sulfide was immediately measured according to the methylene blue method walter 1998 while no2 no3 so4 2 and s2o3 2 were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 usa equipped with an as11 hc 4 250 mm analytical column with hydroxyl eluent 1 5 mmol l naoh at 1 cm3 min gas chromatography agilent 7890a usa was employed for the ch3coo detection the s0 transformation rate was determined by mass balance calculation according to huang et al 2015 the do in the bioreactor was measured with a do meter ph oxi 340i wtw germany the ph of the influent was measured with a ph meter phs 25 shanghai china the change in proteins during pseudomonas c27 growth was examined using a modified bca protein assay kit sangon biotech c503051 china the activities of sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in the final residue were measured according to mohapatra et al 2006 the procedure for isolation of h sonrb bacteria is stated in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of micro aerobic conditions on iahd performance in the bioreactor the egsb bioreactor was started up with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l s n c 5 6 5 under anaerobic conditions when the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies stabilized at 99 the iahd process was considered to be successfully started up during stage ii the sulfide concentration increased to 12 5 mmol l doubling the sulfide concentration had almost no influence on sulfide and acetate removal merely making the nitrate removal efficiency decrease from 99 to 92 9 as shown in fig 2 and table 1 18 75 mmol l sulfide was the limiting concentration for the iahd process under anaerobic conditions during stage iii the breakdown of iahd was a gradual process and the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were as low as 24 9 24 1 and 42 1 respectively approximately 14 mmol l sulfide was detected in the effluent for 14 consecutive days this cumulative toxicity of sulfide might contribute to the poor performance of the iahd process thus micro aerobic conditions were created by introducing 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 air into the egsb bioreactor to reestablish peak performance of the iahd process as expected the sulfide removal efficiency began to increase after dosing with 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 air while compared to the sharp decrease of effluent nitrate and acetate declining to zero in 3 days the effluent sulfide decreased more slowly declining to zero in 18 days when the bioreactor performance stabilized the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were the same as in stage i from stage v to vii the sulfide concentration from 25 mmol l to 31 25 mmol l and aeration rate from 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 to 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 was successively increased to optimize the do concentration under a high sulfide concentration during stage vi the sulfide and acetate removal efficiencies all reached 100 corresponding to a removal of 91 3 nitrate under a sulfide concentration of 25 mmol l and aeration rate of 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 after 148 days cultivation under micro aerobic conditions the bioreactor was again converted to anaerobic operation the iahd process successfully tolerated a sulfide concentration of 37 5 mmol l during stage viii with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of 69 1 97 4 and 93 3 respectively however when the sulfide concentration was increased to 46 88 mmol l the sulfide was hardly removed and the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies decreased to approximate 40 thus the iahd process was considered to have collapsed during stage x the bioreactor was switched from anaerobic stage ix back to micro aerobic stage x the sulfide removal efficiency increased to 67 4 while the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies rebounded to as high as 90 1 and 85 3 respectively during the whole 355 days operation the s0 transformation rate was closely related to the sulfide and do concentrations during the anaerobic stage ii the sulfur transformation rate reached 92 4 which was almost twice that of stage i 56 2 the increased sulfide concentration led to an increased sulfur transformation rate which was similar to that reported by beristain cardoso et al 2011 in addition micro aerobic conditions were shown as an effective means to enhance the sulfur transformation rate xu et al 2017 successfully operated an integrated sulfate reduction sulfide oxidation bioreactor under micro aerobic conditions and achieved an s0 transformation rate of 71 8 with do of 0 1 0 12 mg l wang et al 2015 obtained an s0 transformation rate of 100 with sulfide loading of as high as 8 16 kg s m 3 d 1 with do of 0 1 0 3 mg l in our iahd process trace do 0 1 0 3 mg l improved the sulfur transformation rate from 10 9 to 81 5 under a sulfide concentration of 18 75 mmol l the do concentration under micro aerobic stages can t be directly measured due to high sulfide concentration 6 75 46 88 mmol l in bioreactor thus a control bioreactor full of tap water was employed to quantify oxygen under different aeration rates by this way the detected do fluctuated between 0 1 0 5 mg l table 1 which indicated the micro aerobic condition definitely existed in bioreactor what s more the orp in each stage was measured at the bottom middle and upper position of the bioreactor column by orp meter lei ci 991 china and the data indicated orp ranged from 220 to 430 mv under anaerobic stages while under micro aerobic stages did from 280 to 450 mv implying the neglected correlation between orp and aeration rates thus the data were not shown 3 2 the response of c n and s metabolic genes to micro aerobic conditions in order to explore the impact of micro aerobic conditions on functional genes involved in the uptake and biosynthesis of nitrogen and sulfur compounds samples a iii control m iv 2 6 18 75 mmol l sulfide with aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 and a viii 37 5 mmol l sulfide were used to analyze the up and down regulation of functional genes via metagenomic analysis fig 3 when an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 was supplied sulfide sqr thiosulfate sox and sulfite soeabc and e1 8 2 1 oxidation genes were on average 69 1 129 9 21 9 and 334 4 more abundant respectively in m iv 2 6 the pdo gene which encodes for pdo catalyzes the oxidation of glutathione persulfide gssh to form sulfite was upregulated by 15 2 thiosulfate phsac and psra and sulfite sir reductase genes decreased in abundance by 96 8 and 62 2 respectively the close relationship between sir ferredoxin sulfite reductase and the sulfide removal efficiency has been demonstrated by zhang et al 2019 using 16s metaproteomic functional composition prediction their study found that the abundance of ferredoxin sulfite reductase decreased by 24 2 when the sulfide removal efficiency increased from 37 8 to 71 7 in a sulfide oxidation autotrophic denitrification bioreactor the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway was also enhanced under micro aerobic conditions with sat and aprab up regulated by 7 3 and 28 2 respectively flavocytochrome c fcc and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr are the two enzymatic systems known to be involved in sulfide oxidation xu et al 2014 utilized geochip to reveal that fccab is expressed at a higher level under micro aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions during the sulfate and nitrate co reduction process the positive regulation of oxygen on sqr activity was also demonstrated by shibata et al 2001 who integrated the sqr gene in low copy numbers into escherichia coli and observed that the oxygen consumption increased proportionally to sqr activity in our iahd process fccab was downregulated by 65 1 under micro aerobic conditions with an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 however sqr was upregulated by 69 1 which indicates that trace oxygen enhances sulfide removal through the sqr leading pathway genes related to denitrification showed mixed results extracellular nitrate transport genes nrtabcd nitrate reductase genes narg nasab and napab and the nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz were more abundant by 296 4 67 4 and 19 2 respectively these results show that the nitrate removal efficiencies were four times higher in the bioreactor when trace oxygen was supplied after micro aerobic cultivation all the denitrification genes which reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas were upregulated from 3 6 to 70 5 and were responsible for the increased nitrate removal efficiency from 24 1 to 97 4 under anaerobic conditions clearly 18 75 mmol l sulfide was the limit of the anaerobic load for the bioreactor achieving a sulfide removal efficiency of 24 9 however the efficiency improved three times when the sulfide concentration increased to 37 5 mmol l after micro aerobic cultivation consistent with the increased sulfide removal efficiency the abundances of sox sqr and glpe were increased by 19 8 95 9 and 88 7 respectively thus we speculated that micro aerobic conditions not only stimulate sulfide nitrate and acetate removal during the iahd process but can also act as a promoter for enhancing sulfide tolerance under anaerobic conditions in the interest of energy conservation intermittent micro aeration can be an effective alternative to continuous aeration for improving iahd performance however the aeration rate aeration time and the substrate concentration still require in depth exploration in addition l serine was involved in sulfur metabolism l serine is converted to o acetyl l serine by cyse and reacts with sulfide under the regulation of cysk to generate l cysteine and acetate although the sulfide used to synthesize l cysteine can be ignored when compared to the total amount of sulfide in the system the upregulation of those two genes reflects the high metabolic level of microorganisms during and after micro aerobic cultivation microbial metabolism of organic carbon involves multiple pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway ppp and glyoxylate cycle as the main metabolic pathway to obtain energy for microbial growth the tca cycle was selected as a focal point and was linked to acetate degradation in fig 3 acetate kinase ak and phosphate acetyltransferase pta catalyze a two step reaction to convert acetate to acetyl coa in the tca cycle for energy metabolism their encoding genes ack and pta were upregulated by 27 3 under micro aerobic conditions there were eight key genes involved in the tca cycle except for a small downregulation of glta 8 7 and suca 1 8 the other genes were upregulated 5 7 92 1 under micro aerobic stimulation after micro aerobic cultivation genes encoding all eight enzymes of the tca cycle including ack and pta were upregulated by 4 9 72 3 during stage viii the upregulation of carbon metabolism genes not only explains the doubled acetate removal efficiency but also reflects a higher level of energy metabolism during stages iv and viii 3 3 composition and phylogenetic analysis of the microbial community the microbial communities of 10 sludge samples were characterized by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 15 dominant genera were identified within the 5 dominant phyla fig 4 and s3 during the start up stage with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l azoarcus thiobacillus thauera and arcobacter were the dominant genera with relative abundances of 36 72 29 09 11 84 and 9 68 respectively after doubling the sulfide concentration during stage ii the proportion of azoarcus doubled to 73 96 and aliidiomorina was observed at an abundance of 9 10 while the proportion of thiobacillus and arcobacter decreased to less than 1 when the sulfide concentration was further increased to 18 75 mmol l the microbial community structure showed a drastic change with pseudomonas 73 54 and azoarcus 13 23 dominating the bioreactor was subsequently operated under micro aerobic conditions in stages iv to vii a satisfactory iahd performance was obtained under sulfide concentrations of 18 75 mmol l and 25 mmol l with aeration rates of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 and 5 2 ml min 1 l 1 during stages iv and vi respectively table 1 the total proportion of azoarcus halomonas and aliidiomorina reached 95 35 and 96 92 during stages iv and vi respectively whereas compared to these two stages the sulfide nitrate and acetate efficiencies slightly decreased during stages v and vii and the dominant genera were completely different pseudomonas and arcobacter replaced azoarcus halomonas and aliidiomorina as the dominant genera with a total abundance of 95 69 stage v and 84 9 stage vii thus a closer relationship seems to exist between azoarcus aliidiomorina and high iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions however when the bioreactor was operated under anaerobic condition again during stage viii the nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies increased from 88 1 to 97 4 and 85 4 93 3 respectively with pseudomonas accounting for 82 19 of microbial community based on this stage the relationship between azoarcus aliidiomorina and high iahd performance appeared to be weak while the high abundance of pseudomonas might be responsible for the successful iahd process these results were also verified in stages ix and x during stage ix which exhibited poor iahd performance the proportion of pseudomonas decreased to 70 63 during stage x the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased to 78 93 and the bioreactor regained enhanced sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies 3 4 effect of micro aerobic conditions on the growth of pseudomonas c27 in order to determine the functional bacteria responsible for enhanced iahd performance under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide concentrations we sampled iahd sludge from stage iv micro aerobic 18 75 mmol l sulfide and stage viii anaerobic 37 5 mmol l four strains were isolated from the sludge namely pseudomonas wz4 2 pseudomonas wz7 pseudomonas wz5 and halomonas wz4 1 given their ability to simultaneously remove sulfide nitrate and acetate these strains were regarded as h sonrb table s2 summarizes the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of the four strains over 24 h as well as pseudomonas c27 isolated from the mother bioreactor by chen et al 2013 the highest sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were achieved by pseudomonas c27 which was selected as the representative h sonrb in further experiments the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal performances of pseudomonas c27 under anaerobic batch test i and micro aerobic batch test ii conditions were explored a lag stage lasted for 48 h in batch test i after which pseudomonas c27 began to quickly oxidize sulfide at 53 62 h fig 5 a at the end of the test 1 61 mmol l s2 remained and 4 97 mmol l s2 was converted to s2o3 2 s nitrate and acetate removal have similar trends to sulfide at the end of the batch test i 5 84 mmol l no2 n accumulated as the main denitrification product in batch test ii under micro aerobic conditions sulfide nitrate and acetate were immediately oxidized after the inoculation of pseudomonas c27 and the growth rate of c27 was also faster than under anaerobic conditions fig s5 all the oxidized sulfide was converted to thiosulfate and nitrite accumulated as an intermediate product with a peak value of 5 6 mmol l no2 n at 27 h this micro aerobic removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate was primarily due to the biodegradation of pseudomonas c27 when compared with the chemical control fig s6 the activities of relative enzymes under anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions are shown in table s3 the sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities increased to 0 11 0 02 u 0 09 0 007 u and 0 007 0 0003 u respectively under trace oxygen this adequately explains the efficient iahd process performed by pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions 3 5 sulfur nitrogen and organic carbon metabolic network in pseudomonas c27 based on the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways in the pseudomonas c27 genome figs s7 s15 table s4 a network was constructed of the sulfide and acetate coupled nitrate denitrification process fig 6 first sulfide hydrogen sulfide is catalyzed by sqr which is located on the plasma membrane to produce polysulfide or elemental sulfur that is then reacted with glutathione gsh to form gssh gssh is converted to gsh and is accompanied by the formation of sulfite under the catalysis of the persulfide dioxygenase pdo enzyme as shown in fig 6 this reaction requires the participation of oxygen liu et al 2014 thus the enhanced performance of pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions might be attributed to the oxygen targeted enhancement of this reaction however when sulfide oxidation occurs under anaerobic conditions we speculate that there are two most likely explanations 1 the pdo catalyzed reaction is short circuited due to a lack of oxygen or 2 some oxygen containing active substances will be generated during nitrate respiration replacing oxygen as a substrate for pdo ettwig et al 2010 discovered the fourth oxygen production mechanism in the anaerobic denitrifying bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera which lacks noszdfy although the pseudomonas c27 genome contains nosdfylz it is possible that it can also produce oxygen under anaerobic conditions via unknown pathways gsh is a tripeptide containing a thiol based active center that is formed by the combination of glutamic acid cysteine and glycine by interconversion between gsh and gssh an anti oxidation and anti toxicity effect is achieved in microorganisms in the presence of sulfide thiosulfate sulfide transferase tst catalyzes the reaction between sulfite and gssh to form thiosulfate and gsh hildebrandt and grieshaber 2008 in addition sulfides also form sulfites under sulfite reductase catalysis xin et al 2016 conducted a more detailed study on the sulfur oxidation process of heterotrophic microorganisms their research found that the protein domain cpduf442 which has thiosulfate thiotransferase activity in heterotrophic microbial cells can catalyze the conversion of gsh to gssh and sulfite to thiosulfate furthermore while conducting sulfide oxidation experiments in vitro it was found that polysulfide and gsh spontaneously generate gssh and sulfite and polysulfide can also spontaneously synthesize thiosulfate cysteine synthetase encoded by the cysk gene catalyzes the formation of cysteine from sulfide in pseudomonas c27 guo et al 2014 proposed a tca cycle bypass serine metabolic process based on proteomic studies of pseudomonas c27 under high sulfide stress in which the cysteine synthase catalyzed reaction is a key step of this alternative metabolic pathway gsha and gshb regulate the synthesis of gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase gclc and glutathione synthetase gss which catalyze the production of γ glutamylcysteine via cysteine and generate gsh to participate in sulfur metabolism when pseudomonas c27 uses acetate as carbon source for metabolism acetate kinase ak firstly catalyzes the formation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and then phosphotransferase pta catalyzes the generation of acetyl coa which enters the tca cycle to produce atp and nadh isocitrate is an important tca cycle intermediate in addition to the continued production of succinyl coa that can also form glyoxylate and succinate via catalysis of isocitrase through the glyoxylate cycle pathway subsequently producing s malate catalyzed by malate synthase electrons generated during the metabolism of sulfide and acetate are transferred into the respiratory chain by nadh and ubiquinone under micro aerobic conditions oxygen acts as an electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation complex iv under anaerobic conditions nitrate accepts electrons which is then reduced to nitrogen gas through nitrate respiration in pseudomonas c27 3 6 the important role of h sonrb involved in the iahd process under micro aerobic conditions systematic analysis of the microbial community structure metagenomes and functional bacteria can help elucidate the enhanced effects of micro aerobic conditions the dominant genera were classified into two broad categories namely heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb and autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb table s5 a high abundance of a sonrb is believed to be responsible for the high sulfide removal efficiency in sulfide containing wastewater treatment processes yang et al 2016 thiobacillus and arcobacter were the two main dominant a sonrb observed in the iahd bioreactor the sulfide oxidizing ability of thiobacillus has been described in detail by dopson and johnson 2012 arcobacter a common a sonrb in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification process lives in microaerophilic conditions and acts as an autotrophic producer of filamentous sulfur wirsen et al 2002 however except for stage i with a sulfide concentration of 6 25 mmol l the total proportions of thiobacillus and arcobacter were lower than 5 during the stages when sulfide removal efficiencies were higher than 99 the relative abundance of h nrb demonstrated another interesting tendency the total proportion of the five dominant h nrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera aliidiomorina and halomonas were 50 29 and 86 95 in stages i and ii respectively and further increased to 97 in the micro aerobic stages iv and vi with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies of 90 99 and 100 respectively two possible metabolic mechanisms involved in the iahd process which were proposed by zhang et al 2018 can provide reasonable explanations for the observed microbial community structure the combined function of h nrb and a sonrb supports the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate under low sulfide concentrations s2 6 25 mmol l as a subset of h nrb h sonrb might be responsible for sulfide removal working with h nrb to ensure a high iahd performance when the sulfide concentration increased this is embodied in the increased relative abundance of h nrb during stage ii the large proportion of h nrb including h sonrb in microbial community under micro aerobic conditions leads us to speculate that trace oxygen can improve the iahd performance by possibly targeting h sonrb to date a number of h sonrb have been reported and isolated from wastewater treatment processes and the natural environment including pseudomonas c27 chen et al 2013 pseudomonas crs1 wong and lee 2014 pseudomonas sp h117 su et al 2016 pseudomonas stutzeri dq1 zhao et al 2015 pseudomonas n2 and s4 sun et al 2019 pseudomonas wz4 2 wz7 and wz5 azoarcus taiwanesis nsc3t lee et al 2014 thauera hdd huang et al 2017 paracoccus n1 sun et al 2019 and halomonas wz4 1 we selected pseudomonas c27 to conduct the iahd process and measured the sulfide oxidase nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities under both anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal rates and enzyme activities increased under micro aerobic conditions fig 5 and table s3 however the inhibition of nitrate reduction by oxygen has been widely reported ji et al 2018 cojean et al 2019 oh and silverstein 1999 and ma et al 2017 demonstrated that trace oxygen could decrease the denitrification rate in anoxic bioreactors some researchers have used both oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors to conduct denitrification by pure strains oxygen competed with nitrate for the nitrate reductase resulting in a lower nitrate reduction rate wu et al 1994 unlike these studies metagenomics analysis showed that the nitrogen metabolism genes involved in the denitrification process were all upregulated except nirks and norbc in our bioreactor m iv 2 6 with an aeration rate of 2 6 ml min 1 l 1 this is consistent with the proteomic analysis of the functional bacteria pseudomonas c27 under micro aerobic conditions by guo et al 2014 the nitrate reductases were upregulated approximately 4 0 fold and the hemoglobin which increased denitrification efficiency and atp production was special expression in pseudomonas c27 furthermore the carbon and sulfur metabolism of pseudomonas c27 was also accelerated under micro aerobic conditions after the micro aerobic stages the sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies reached 69 1 97 4 and 93 3 during the anaerobic stage viii with a sulfide concentration of 37 5 mmol l the big proportion of pseudomonas 82 19 in the microbial community suggests a relationship between increased load tolerance and iahd performance under anaerobic conditions and h sonrb the potential high efficiency enzyme system of pseudomonas c27 a typical h sonrb under high sulfide stress was confirmed by guo et al 2013 from the genomic perspective the advantages of pseudomonas c27 h sonrb for sulfide oxidation over thiobacillus denitrificans beller et al 2006 a sonrb might be obvious firstly the type of sqr enzymes are different between thiobacillus denitrificans and pseudomonas c27 according to fig s14 sqrb pseudomonas c27 translocates across the cytoplasmic membrane via twin arginine translocation tat pathway while the translocation mechanism of sqra thiobacillus denitrificans is still unknown gregersen et al 2011 secondly there are no pdo genes in the thiobacillus denitrificans genome the pdo enzyme catalyzes the reaction of gssh to gsh and accelerates the oxidation of sulfides thereby speeding up the detoxification process thirdly pseudomonas c27 has the cysk gene encoding for cysteine synthetase which catalyzes sulfide to generate acetate although the sulfide consumed in this pathway could be ignored urgent research is required to determine whether the produced acetate can be transferred to the tca cycle and continue to generate energy for metabolism if we make an assumption that the metabolic characteristics of pseudomonas c27 containing pdo and cysk genes is universal in h sonrb the phenomenon that h sonrb displace a sonrb as the dominant bacteria under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide concentrations could be easily understood of course the inhibitory effects of sulfide on a sonrb activity are the other reason for the low relative abundance of a sonrb under high sulfide concentrations lu et al 2018 presented convincing results that the nitrate reduction rate was significantly inhibited becoming the rate limiting step at 6 25 mmol l sulfide while the sulfide oxidation rate reached as high as 100 3 mg s2 g vss l under extremely high sulfide stress 31 25 mmol l tielens et al 2002 proposed that fumarate rather than nitrate can serve as the electron acceptor when autotrophic denitrification is limited which indicates the potential sulfide oxidizing ability of a sonrb at extremely high sulfide concentrations however in this study the nitrate and sulfide removal efficiencies both decreased and there was no notable difference between them when the sulfide concentration increased micro aerobic conditions have already been demonstrated as an effective technology for enhancing sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies in the iahd process chen et al 2017 wang et al 2016a 2016b the discovery of the essential role of h sonrb under micro aerobic conditions provides us with a new means of control by changing or reconstructing the microbial community composition to include a high abundance of h sonrb optimize the aeration rate and develop controlling strategies for low c n and s n wastewater to obtain high iahd performance meanwhile the separation and purification of sulfur oxidase found in h sonrb can be used to form a targeted high efficiency enzyme product that eliminates the metabolic inhibition of high sulfide concentrations by exogenous strengthening of the enzyme while also enhancing the carbon and nitrogen removal process in the iahd system furthermore from an engineering point of view this micro aerobic technology could be intermittently applied to improve the load tolerance of the h sonrb driven iahd process and simultaneously achieve the highest sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies with the lowest energy expenditure in industrial wastewater treatment 4 conclusion based on the enhanced iahd performance observed under micro aerobic conditions with high sulfide loading the functional bacteria and their possible metabolic mechanisms were elaborated in this present work the h sonrb pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas predominated with a large proportion of 82 72 90 84 in the five micro aerobic microbial communities which contributed to satisfactory sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies pseudomonas c27 was selected as the typical h sonrb and its metabolism against high sulfide under the help of trace oxygen was discussed in micro aerobic condition its sulfide nitrate and acetate removals rates were 10 times more than that in anaerobic condition according to genomic analysis the sulfur nitrogen and carbon metabolic network was constructed the pdo and cyck genes in pseudomonas c27 contributes to its unique advantage of metabolism over a sonrb eg thiobacillus denitrificans in micro aerobic conditions besides in metagenomics analysis under micro aerobic condition of bioreactor pdo and cysk genes up regulated by 15 2 and 39 1 respectively thus we speculated the trace oxygen might has stimulated effect on h sonrb resulted in the enhance iahd performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
