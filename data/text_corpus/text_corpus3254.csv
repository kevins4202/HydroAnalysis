16270,the antiozonant n phenyl n 1 3 dimethylbutyl p phenylenediamine 6 ppd is added to tires to increase their lifetime and is emitted with tire and road wear particles into the environment recently one of its transformation products tps 6 ppd quinone 6 ppdq has gained attention due to its toxicity towards coho salmon in this study the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd is investigated by a series of ozonation experiments in the lab followed by analysis of tps using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms a total of 38 tps were detected and tentatively identified which were formed either directly from 6 ppd or via 6 ppdq as intermediate a suspect screening by lc hrms showed 32 of these tps to occur in snow collected from urban roads as surrogate of road runoff where 6 ppdq 4 aminodiphenylamine 4 adpa tp 213 and tp 249 were the most prominent besides 6 ppd more than 90 of the total load of 6 ppd and its tps was found in the particulate fraction of snow thus retaining the particulate fraction of road runoff before its discharge into surface water would substantially reduce the emission of 6 ppd and many of its tps some tps prevailed in the water phase of the snow due to their higher polarity a total of 13 tps were detected by suspect screening in the dissolved phase of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent their total load was markedly enhanced during a day of snowmelt approx 1100 g d and rainfall approx 2000 g d compared to dry weather approx 190 g d 6 ppd and 6 ppdq contributed to less than 1 to this total load in the water phase estimated concentrations of max 0 1 µg l the elimination of the estimated total loads of 6 ppd related tps from the water phase in wwtp ranged from 22 to 67 depending on weather conditions eventually tp 249 4 adpa and tp 259 2 dominated in wwtp effluent estimated concentration from 0 5 up to 2 µg l thus tp 249 and tp 259 2 are likely the most specific and stable tps of 6 ppd to be determined in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words snowmelt road runoff urban runoff 6ppd quinone 6ppdq trwps 1 introduction tire and road wear particles trwps are generated on roads as an inevitable consequence of tire use in automotive traffic there is increasing scientific interest into both the occurrence and fate of trwps in the environment and of tire related compounds which were added to tires and may be released from trwps while they reside in the environment one prominent class of compounds are n n disubstituted phenylenediamines which are added to tires to prevent the oxidative degradation of the rubber and thus to maintain its structure and tire function they protect rubber because they are highly reactive towards oxygen or ozone layer and lattimer 1990 this reactivity inevitably results in various transformation products tps of antiozonants in tires and later on also in trwps one of the most frequently used members of this class of compounds is n phenyl n 1 3 dimethylbutyl p phenylenediamine 6 ppd because it is less reactive towards molecular oxygen but reacts well with ozone the reaction mechanism of 6 ppd with ozone and some of its ozonation products have been studied from the perspective of material protection lattimer et al 1983 five tps with lower molecular weight and another 5 tps with higher molecular weight than 6 ppd were reported the structure of one of those tps was erroneously assumed to be a nitrone lattimer et al 1983 which was later confirmed to be 6 ppd quinone 6 ppdq tian et al 2021 6 ppdq was recently proven to be toxic to coho salmon in the us tian et al 2021 other fish chum salmon however appear to be less affected by it hiki et al 2021 mcintyre et al 2021 recent screening studies reported the occurrence of 6 ppdq in road runoff and in urban streams affected by road runoff but quantitative data are scarce and await confirmation challis et al 2021 haddad et al 2018 johannessen et al 2021 some studies reported organic chemicals that leach from tire particles müller et al 2021 peter et al 2018 seiwert et al 2020 however such chemicals may also be transformed either in tires during their production and use in trwps during aging in the environment or in aqueous environment after their release from trwps wagner et al 2021 such transformation processes significantly enhance the number of compounds of potential environmental relevance this is also true for 6 ppd as it is obvious that 6 ppdq is only one of its several tps lattimer et al 1983 unice et al 2015 this study revisits the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd this time from an environmental perspective specifically it addresses the following questions which tps are formed from 6 ppd this question is answered by laboratory ozonation experiments and analysis by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms which of these 6 ppd related tps can be found in road runoff this is studied by a suspect screening of snow collected from roads as surrogate of road runoff for the tps found in lab experiment how do these compounds partition between the particulate and the aqueous fraction of road runoff this is considered by analyzing the water and particle phase of snow separately how much of 6 ppd and its tps arrives at and leaves from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps receiving road runoff for this purpose suspect screenings of the influent and effluent of a wwtp during dry weather snowmelt and a rain event are performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals

cooled ultrapure water the ozone was produced by an ozone generator cmg 10 5 innovatec geraetetechnik the ozone stock solution was standardized by its uv absorption at 258 nm ε 3000 m 1 cm 1 elovitz and von gunten 1999 experiments were performed in amber glass vials at room temperature 23 2 c ozonation in solution was initiated by spiking the pre determined volume of ozone stock solution into 10 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 containing 1 mg l of 6 ppd initial doses of ozone were 1 2 5 and 10 mg l for ozonation in solid phase the solid 6 ppd was prepared by adding 15 µl of its methanol stock solution in a glass vial and evaporate until dryness under a gentle stream of argon the glass vial was then placed in a flask saturated with continuous flow of ozone containing oxygen after being exposed to gaseous ozone the glass vials were taken out and 1 ml of methanol water 1 1 added the samples were directly analyzed using rplc ms without further enrichment the ozonation of 6 ppd tps namely 4 adpa 4 hdpa and 6 ppdq was individually investigated under similar experimental conditions aiming to achieve the full picture of the 6 ppd ozonation pathways the gas phase and aqueous phase ozonation of dppd another n n disubstituted phenylenediamine was also studied in comparison to 6 ppd 2 4 analysis with uplc tof ms aqueous samples and extracts of particles were analyzed by

from lab scale experiments identification of tps was done by evaluating the rplc ms data in a retention time window of 1 to 10 min and a mass range of m z 50 to 1200 markerlynx was used to perform the peak picking for the molecular ion trace function 1 with 0 1 min deviation in retention time and 0 01 da deviation in exact mass the marker table with relative intensities to the total marker intensity was exported to excel and all further evaluations were performed there the peaks with a relative intensity above 1 and newly appeared in the ozonated samples compared to controls were selected sum formulas were assigned by using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and an elemental composition of c 0 100 h 0 100 n 0 20 o 0 20 and na 0 2 and by taking into account the fragment ions the fragment ions were used if available to propose a structure based on possible transformations that may happen to the parent compound 6 ppd the confidence levels were reported according to schymanski schymanski et al 2014 tps that do not have a structure that could be proven by standard compounds were named according to their observed nominal mass m h m na or m h if two tps exhibited the same

office 20 14 0 688 2020 chemaxon http www chemaxon com 3 results discussion 3 1 lab scale ozonation of 6 ppd and related compounds lab scale ozonation was performed to study the tps that originate from oxidation processes of 6 ppd either during tire use or after its abrasion and transformation into trwps the reaction of solid 6 ppd with ozone gas may simulate the transformation of 6 ppd in tires and trwps while the reaction with ozone in aqueous solution including hydrolytic reactions may simulate reactions after the release of 6 ppd from tires or from trwps into the surrounding water in total 38 tps of 6 ppd were detected in these two sets of ozonation experiments by lc hrms and identified to various levels by their exact mass formula and product ions structure or by reference compounds tab s1 a total of 26 of these tps have not been reported before in literature the various tps of 6 ppd were arranged along six pathways a to f fig 1 in extension of the scheme of lattimer et al lattimer et al 1983 who investigated the gas phase ozonation of 6 ppd to study its effectiveness as an antiozonant and by incorporating the work of tian et al tian et al 2021 separate ozonation experiments with two commercially available tps 4 adpa and 4 hdpa supported the pathway fig 1 which is further extended by 6 ppdq ozonation pathway g and h fig 2 the reactions of 6 ppd with ozone gas and with ozone in water form similar tps but with different relative yields fig 1 fig s1 such differences may be due to the different reaction mechanisms and kinetics of a homogenous solution and a heterogenous solid gas reaction and the presence or absence of water for hydrolytic reactions however both reaction conditions are of environmental relevance one initial step under both conditions is the oxidation dehydrogenation of 6 ppd to the more conjugated benzoquinone imine n 4 1 3 dimethylbutyl imino 2 5 cyclohexadiene 1 ylidene 6 ppdqi m z 267 esi pos duchacek and kuta 1990 huntink 2003 a mix of 6 ppd and 6 ppdqi was reported to be used in tire manufacturing datta et al 2004 in aqueous solution an equilibrium likely exists between both substances depending on the redox conditions immediately after preparing the aqueous solution of 6 ppd in contact with air 6 ppdqi is also detectable fig s 2 this is one reason why 6 ppd quantification in aqueous solution is difficult likely the further oxidation of 6 ppdqi by two subsequent oxygen additions via tp283 1 leads to 6 ppdq m z 299 the tps that were detected and tentatively identified in this study can be arranged along different pathways fig 1 given that many of these reactions are competitive rather than consecutive and do not only involve oxidation reactions experiments at different ozone dosages were not instrumental in verifying these pathways therefore much of fig 1 awaits experimental verification of the many tps the following appeared to be most relevant in terms of their peak areas figure s1 along the quinone pathway a tp283 1 the direct product of 6 ppdqi as well as its two oxidation products 6 ppdq formed by oxygen addition and tp 281 formed by dehydrogenation were the major products however several other products are formed along this path fig 1 along the nitroso aryl pathway b tp285 3 formed by the oxidation of one of the amino groups of 6 ppd and no dpa product of further oxidation and oxidative cleavage of the aliphatic side chain were dominating tp285 3 has been found to be relatively stable lattimer et al 1983 which could explain its comparatively high signal intensity in our experiment fig s1 the next two pathways c d in fig 1 were more relevant for ozonation of 6 ppd in water than for ozonation of dry 6 ppd by ozone in air both these pathways involve hydrolysis of amino bonds of 6 ppd the hdpa pathway c leads to 4 hdpa hydrolysis of 6 ppd has been reported to be quite fast in water half life of 8 h at ph 7 echa 2021a 4 hdpa may however also be formed from 6 ppdqi the hydrolysis of which is even faster half life of 4 7 h at ph 7 echa 2021b along the aryl hydrolysis pathway d tp 194 is the major product fig s1 oxidation of tp 194 may lead to tp 138 the tp with the lowest molecular weight detected in these experiments from the side chain oxidation pathway f tp 285 4 was detected as an initial product this can break down to form 4 adpa a comparably large peak fig s1 or leads to tp 269 and tp 227 the side chain oxidation of 6 ppdqi leads to tp 283 2 an overview of all tps and their identification level is given in tab s1 6 ppd is not the only n n disubstituted phenylenediamine that may be added as antioxidant or specifically as antiozonant to tires dppd is also of importance and its ozonation in aqueous phase and gas phase were additionally investigated in this study five tps known from 6 ppd were also found as dppd products belonging to the nitroso aryl pathway the aryl hydrolysis pathway or the hdpa pathway tab s3 dppd has not played a role in the most recent discussion on chemicals released from tires or trwps although its leaching potential is lower than that of 6 ppd müller et al 2021 its tps could contribute to tire derived leachables analogous to 6 ppd the oxidative transformation of 6 ppdq was studied and 12 further tps were detected fig 2 all these tps were also found during 6 ppd ozonation with tp 249 and tp 265 showing the highest intensity fig s1 the products detected from 6 ppdq ozonation confirm that its quinone system was primarily attacked by ozone pathway h this is in line with previous studies on ozonation of quinones ramseier and gunten 2009 all the tps within pathway h result from an attack on the quinone ring followed by ring opening and rearrangement one exception tp 351 only oxidation of the quinone ring and alkyl chain other tps are explainable by the loss of the aniline moiety or the alkyl chain pathway g fig 2 tab s2 these results show that 6 ppdq is subjected to further degradation in the presence of oxidants in agreement to this the half life of 6 ppdq in dechlorinated drinking water was recently reported to be 33 h at room temperature hiki et al 2021 above discussion on the relative importance of different tps in lab scale ozonation experiments is based on their peak intensities fig s1 because reference chemicals were only available for 6 ppd and three tps preventing a full quantification of all the tps detected however the response factors of these four compounds in lc hrms were comparatively similar and ranged from 0 44 4 hdpa to 1 2 6 ppd tab s4 on this basis it appears justified to evaluate the relevance of different tps of 6 ppd based on their peak intensities however this cannot substitute a later full quantification of those tps that are or will become available as reference compounds 3 2 occurrence of 6 ppd and its tps in snow from urban roads in urban environment snow is expected to accumulate particles generated on roads for the period from snowfall to snow melt therefore three snow samples collected in leipzig germany in february 2021 were analyzed by lc hrms and a suspect screening was performed for the tps found from lab scale experiments fig 1 fig 2 tab s1 tab s2 the water and the particulate fraction of the snow samples were analyzed separately a total of 32 tps of 6 ppd including 6 ppdq were detected in the water or the particulate phase of all three snow samples fig 3 b fig s4b analytically this confirms the previous finding that lab experiments can be very useful to generate suspects for the screening of environmental samples seiwert et al 2016 more importantly this result outlines that the diversity of tps formed by ozonation of 6 ppd in the lab is of relevance also in the environment indeed 6 ppdq is only one of those tps and the detection of 9 of its tps proves that 6 ppdq is not a dead end product the tps which are known from the lab experiments but not detected in snow are primarily intermediates such as tp283 1 6 ppdqi and tp285 2 fig 1 the load in the snow particles and water of 6 ppd and the 32 tps detected was clearly dominated by 6 ppd with 40 50 of the total peak area tpa fig 3a this shows that 6 ppd is much stabilized by its embedding into the rubber matrix of trwps the tps with the highest relative contribution based on peak areas are 4 adpa and 6 ppdq both around 8 of tpa followed by tp 213 tp 297 3 tp 249 tp 205 and tp 257 all 2 tpa on average 4 adpa may however also originate from other disubstituted phenylenediamines in tires like dppd as demonstrated in this study tab s3 the compositions of all three snow samples are comparatively similar even though they were collected from different streets with ongoing aging of trwps and ongoing transformation of 6 ppd and its tps the pattern of 6 ppd related compounds in the environment may differ from the ones observed from snow samples likely tps occurring later in the transformation pathways fig 1 are then gaining relative importance recent studies have shown 6 ppd and 6 ppdq to occur in surface runoff and in urban streams affected by surface runoff challis et al 2021 johannessen et al 2021 tian et al 2021 as well as in road dust huang et al 2021 however other tps except 6 ppdq have not yet been considered nor has the particulate phase been considered in such studies the overwhelming majority of 6 ppd in the snow is observed in the particulate phase containing trwps rather than in water distribution ratio water particle 0 001 fig 3b similarly the particulate phase dominates the load in snow for most of the tps of 6 ppd as well with a proportion of 90 ratio 0 1 to 99 ratio 0 01 for individual compounds fig 3b for 6 ppdq the share of the aqueous phase is only little higher than for 6 ppd these findings agree to the suggestion of 6 ppdq being a potential chemical marker for trwps in the environment klöckner et al 2021 for several tps formed from 6 ppdq namely tp 197 tp 299 and tp 302 right side of fig 3b the proportion in the water phase equals or even exceeds the proportion in the particle phase of the snow ratio 1 this may reflect the higher polarity of these tps expressed by their lower predicted logd values compared to most tps directly formed from 6 ppd fig s5 summing the peak areas of 6 ppd and all its tps 90 93 of tpa are found in the particulate phase and only 6 10 in the water phase of all three snow samples this is primarily due to the large contribution of 6 ppd 40 50 of tpa which is almost exclusively found in the particulate phase in a recent leaching study 3 of 6 ppd was determined in the leachate müller et al 2021 a value much higher than the 0 1 found here this may indicate that equilibration between the particulate and water phase had not taken place in all snow samples in this study despite the melting and sample processing in the lab at room temperature for approx 2 h also the contact time of particles in surface runoff before its entry into a sewer system is limited and may not be sufficient to reach the equilibrium concentrations in the two phases non equilibrium is even more likely because chemicals transport within the trwp rubber phase is highly hindered huntink 2003 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the strong dominance of the particle phase for the load of 6 ppd and many of its tps in the snow samples is also true for surface runoff in times of rainfall the dominance of the particulate phase for the load of 6 ppd and its tps outlines the option to effectively control their emission into environment by retaining the particles of road runoff before its discharge in the case of combined sewer systems this can be effectively done in wwtps see section 3 3 the situation may however be different for separate sewer systems even when settling basins are in place to retain the particles of surface runoff 6 ppd and its tps may slowly be released into the water phase during extended residence times of trwps in such basins moreover the above data suggest that analyzing 6 ppd and 6 ppdq only in the water phase of discharges rich in particles such as combined sewer overflow or untreated surface runoff but not in the particulate phase being discharged together with the water would drastically underestimate the amounts transferred to surface waters 3 3 occurrence of 6 ppd and its tps in a wastewater treatment plant in combined sewer systems the surface runoff is collected together with wastewater from other sources households industry etc and treated in wwtps therefore the influent and effluent of a wwtp treating wastewater from a combined sewer system was analyzed by suspect screening for 6 ppd and its tps over one day during snowmelt rainfall and dry weather 6 10 samples per day 22 samples of each influent and effluent in total only the dissolved phase was analyzed as particle removal in wwtps is known to be very high cheng et al 2021 of the 38 tps found from lab scale experiments 13 tps including 3 tps of 6 ppdq were detected in the water phase of the wwtp influent fig 4 fig s6 6 ppd could only be determined during snowmelt while 6 ppdq was determined during snowmelt and rainfall neither of the two was detected during dry weather loq approx 25 ng l their contribution to the sum of the 6 ppd related compounds in the influent was low approx 1 of tpa the major signals in the influent however correspond to tp257 tp259 1 and tp259 2 pathway a 4 adpa and no dpa pathway b all originating from 6 ppd fig 1 as well as tp249 from 6 ppdq fig 2 the load of all these compounds was clearly enhanced during snowmelt and rainfall fig 4 this supports the assumption that these compounds do originate from surface runoff and from trwps rather than from the other wastewater sources collected in combined sewer systems households industry etc 4 adpa no dpa 4 hdpa tp194 and tp138 were detected in the water phase of wwtp influent also during dry weather although at much lower concentration than during snowmelt and rainfall 4 adpa is known to be applied in pharmaceuticals photography and in dyestuff industries khanna et al 1987 so that surface runoff indeed may not be the only source of 4 adpa in municipal wastewater however the peak area of all 6 ppd related compounds during dry weather was one order of magnitude lower than during snow melt or rainfall fig 4 4 adpa no dpa 4 hdpa and tp138 could originate from other diphenylamine antioxidants tab s3 which were recently detected to be present in treatment plant influents as well zhang et al 2021 in wwtp influent 4 hdpa and 6 ppdq were quantified based on available reference compounds the mean concentration of 4 hdpa ranged from 0 07 µg l for the day with snowmelt to 0 02 µg l at dry weather table 1 concentrations of 6 ppdq were even higher especially during snowmelt reaching 0 1 µg l based on the mean flow of water at the sampling days the loads were around 5 g d for 4 hpda and 5 g d for 6 ppdq at dry weather and increased to 17 g d and 26 g d respectively for the day with snowmelt table 1 the estimated total load of 6 ppd and its tps in the influent was 190 g d at dry weather and increased to 1100 and 2000 g d at the day of snowmelt and rainfall respectively table 1 in wwtp effluent 14 tps of 6 ppd could still be observed their estimated total load was reduced by 22 rainfall and 45 snow melt to approx 1600 g d and 600 g d removal increased to 65 for the day with regular dry weather conditions table 1 no clear indication of removal in wwtp was found for tp 259 2 4 adpa tp 213 and tp 235 the compounds dominating the effluent pattern were tp 249 tp 259 2 and 4 adpa these tps appear stable enough to withstand biological wastewater treatment at least partially especially tp 249 and tp 259 2 are thus promising candidates to search for in the aquatic environment their identification was not successful in this study but would be desirable while 6 ppd was detected in the effluent only during the snowmelt event 6 ppdq was found during snow melt and rainfall but contributed to 1 or less to the 6 ppd related compounds in wwtp effluent however it should be noted that the biological treatment process in wwtps may form additional tps of 6 ppd or one of its tps this study confines itself to the 38 tps that were detected in lab experiments on abiotic oxidative transformation fig 1 fig 2 for wwtp effluents a median concentration of 0 018 µg l of 6 ppd from 5 samples was reported echa 2021c data on the concentration of 6 ppd in influents and effluents of municipal wwtps and the extent of 6 ppd removal are not available yet no reports appear to exist on concentration of any of 6 ppd tps in municipal wastewater for stormwater a median value of 0 11 µg l for 6 ppd was documented for four samples echa 2021c for 6 ppdq recent studies report stormwater concentrations in the range of 0 2 1 2 µg l challis et al 2021 tian et al 2022 the concentrations of 6 ppdq found here in the influent of the wwtp during snowmelt and rainfall are even lower than the reported data on road runoff which may in part be due to the dilution of road runoff with wastewater from households and industry in the combined sewer systems 4 conclusions a total 38 tps were identified to various confidence levels in this study as products of the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd while 6 ppdq may be of specific concern due to its biological effects understanding the environmental fate of 6 ppd requires a much broader view on its tps 34 tps of 6 ppd are detected in the snow from urban roads the major load of 6 ppd and its tps in snow from urban roads is in the particulate phase namely from 6 ppd and 6 ppdq 90 99 with increasing polarity of the tps the aqueous phase is gaining importance this likely also applies for surface runoff after rainfall retaining the particulate fraction of road runoff before its discharge into surface water would substantially reduce the emission of 6 ppd and many of its tps up to 13 tps of 6 ppd were detected in the influent to a wwtp treating combined sewer water the proportion of 6 ppd and 6 ppdq to the total signal area of all 6 ppd related compounds in the dissolved phase was 1 outlining that in this phase other tps are becoming increasingly important the estimated load of 6 ppd and its tps in municipal wastewater was elevated by about one order of magnitude during snowmelt and rain compared to dry weather conditions their elimination in wwtp was moderate with 22 65 depending on the weather conditions total 14 tps of 6 ppd were still detectable in the effluent of wwtp with tp 249 tp 259 2 and 4 adpa as the dominant compounds the reactivity of 6 ppd and the large number of tps complicates studying the environmental fate of 6 ppd and assessing its environmental risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16270,the antiozonant n phenyl n 1 3 dimethylbutyl p phenylenediamine 6 ppd is added to tires to increase their lifetime and is emitted with tire and road wear particles into the environment recently one of its transformation products tps 6 ppd quinone 6 ppdq has gained attention due to its toxicity towards coho salmon in this study the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd is investigated by a series of ozonation experiments in the lab followed by analysis of tps using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms a total of 38 tps were detected and tentatively identified which were formed either directly from 6 ppd or via 6 ppdq as intermediate a suspect screening by lc hrms showed 32 of these tps to occur in snow collected from urban roads as surrogate of road runoff where 6 ppdq 4 aminodiphenylamine 4 adpa tp 213 and tp 249 were the most prominent besides 6 ppd more than 90 of the total load of 6 ppd and its tps was found in the particulate fraction of snow thus retaining the particulate fraction of road runoff before its discharge into surface water would substantially reduce the emission of 6 ppd and many of its tps some tps prevailed in the water phase of the snow due to their higher polarity a total of 13 tps were detected by suspect screening in the dissolved phase of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent their total load was markedly enhanced during a day of snowmelt approx 1100 g d and rainfall approx 2000 g d compared to dry weather approx 190 g d 6 ppd and 6 ppdq contributed to less than 1 to this total load in the water phase estimated concentrations of max 0 1 µg l the elimination of the estimated total loads of 6 ppd related tps from the water phase in wwtp ranged from 22 to 67 depending on weather conditions eventually tp 249 4 adpa and tp 259 2 dominated in wwtp effluent estimated concentration from 0 5 up to 2 µg l thus tp 249 and tp 259 2 are likely the most specific and stable tps of 6 ppd to be determined in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words snowmelt road runoff urban runoff 6ppd quinone 6ppdq trwps 1 introduction tire and road wear particles trwps are generated on roads as an inevitable consequence of tire use in automotive traffic there is increasing scientific interest into both the occurrence and fate of trwps in the environment and of tire related compounds which were added to tires and may be released from trwps while they reside in the environment one prominent class of compounds are n n disubstituted phenylenediamines which are added to tires to prevent the oxidative degradation of the rubber and thus to maintain its structure and tire function they protect rubber because they are highly reactive towards oxygen or ozone layer and lattimer 1990 this reactivity inevitably results in various transformation products tps of antiozonants in tires and later on also in trwps one of the most frequently used members of this class of compounds is n phenyl n 1 3 dimethylbutyl p phenylenediamine 6 ppd because it is less reactive towards molecular oxygen but reacts well with ozone the reaction mechanism of 6 ppd with ozone and some of its ozonation products have been studied from the perspective of material protection lattimer et al 1983 five tps with lower molecular weight and another 5 tps with higher molecular weight than 6 ppd were reported the structure of one of those tps was erroneously assumed to be a nitrone lattimer et al 1983 which was later confirmed to be 6 ppd quinone 6 ppdq tian et al 2021 6 ppdq was recently proven to be toxic to coho salmon in the us tian et al 2021 other fish chum salmon however appear to be less affected by it hiki et al 2021 mcintyre et al 2021 recent screening studies reported the occurrence of 6 ppdq in road runoff and in urban streams affected by road runoff but quantitative data are scarce and await confirmation challis et al 2021 haddad et al 2018 johannessen et al 2021 some studies reported organic chemicals that leach from tire particles müller et al 2021 peter et al 2018 seiwert et al 2020 however such chemicals may also be transformed either in tires during their production and use in trwps during aging in the environment or in aqueous environment after their release from trwps wagner et al 2021 such transformation processes significantly enhance the number of compounds of potential environmental relevance this is also true for 6 ppd as it is obvious that 6 ppdq is only one of its several tps lattimer et al 1983 unice et al 2015 this study revisits the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd this time from an environmental perspective specifically it addresses the following questions which tps are formed from 6 ppd this question is answered by laboratory ozonation experiments and analysis by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms which of these 6 ppd related tps can be found in road runoff this is studied by a suspect screening of snow collected from roads as surrogate of road runoff for the tps found in lab experiment how do these compounds partition between the particulate and the aqueous fraction of road runoff this is considered by analyzing the water and particle phase of snow separately how much of 6 ppd and its tps arrives at and leaves from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps receiving

cooled ultrapure water the ozone was produced by an ozone generator cmg 10 5 innovatec geraetetechnik the ozone stock solution was standardized by its uv absorption at 258 nm ε 3000 m 1 cm 1 elovitz and von gunten 1999 experiments were performed in amber glass vials at room temperature 23 2 c ozonation in solution was initiated by spiking the pre determined volume of ozone stock solution into 10 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 containing 1 mg l of 6 ppd initial doses of ozone were 1 2 5 and 10 mg l for ozonation in solid phase the solid 6 ppd was prepared by adding 15 µl of its methanol stock solution in a glass vial and evaporate until dryness under a gentle stream of argon the glass vial was then placed in a flask saturated with continuous flow of ozone containing oxygen after being exposed to gaseous ozone the glass vials were taken out and 1 ml of methanol water 1 1 added the samples were directly analyzed using rplc ms without further enrichment the ozonation of 6 ppd tps namely 4 adpa 4 hdpa and 6 ppdq was individually investigated under similar experimental conditions aiming to achieve the full picture of the 6 ppd ozonation pathways the gas phase and aqueous

from lab scale experiments identification of tps was done by evaluating the rplc ms data in a retention time window of 1 to 10 min and a mass range of m z 50 to 1200 markerlynx was used to perform the peak picking for the molecular ion trace function 1 with 0 1 min deviation in retention time and 0 01 da deviation in exact mass the marker table with relative intensities to the total marker intensity was exported to excel and all further evaluations were performed there the peaks with a relative intensity above 1 and newly appeared in the ozonated samples compared to controls were selected sum formulas were assigned by using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and an elemental composition of c 0 100 h 0 100 n 0 20 o 0 20 and na 0 2 and by taking into account the fragment ions the fragment ions were used if available to propose a structure based on possible transformations that may happen to the parent compound 6 ppd the confidence levels were reported according to schymanski schymanski et al 2014 tps that do not have a structure that could be proven by standard compounds were named according to their observed nominal mass m h m na or m h if two tps exhibited the same

office 20 14 0 688 2020 chemaxon http www chemaxon com 3 results discussion 3 1 lab scale ozonation of 6 ppd and related compounds lab scale ozonation was performed to study the tps that originate from oxidation processes of 6 ppd either during tire use or after its abrasion and transformation into trwps the reaction of solid 6 ppd with ozone gas may simulate the transformation of 6 ppd in tires and trwps while the reaction with ozone in aqueous solution including hydrolytic reactions may simulate reactions after the release of 6 ppd from tires or from trwps into the surrounding water in total 38 tps of 6 ppd were detected in these two sets of ozonation experiments by lc hrms and identified to various levels by their exact mass formula and product ions structure or by reference compounds tab s1 a total of 26 of these tps have not been reported before in literature the various tps of 6 ppd were arranged along six pathways a to f fig 1 in extension of the scheme of lattimer et al lattimer et al 1983 who investigated the gas phase ozonation of 6 ppd to study its effectiveness as an antiozonant and by incorporating the work of tian et al tian et al 2021 separate ozonation experiments with two commercially available tps 4 adpa and 4 hdpa supported the pathway fig 1 which is further extended by 6 ppdq ozonation pathway g and h fig 2 the reactions of 6 ppd with ozone gas and with ozone in water form similar tps but with different relative yields fig 1 fig s1 such differences may be due to the different reaction mechanisms and kinetics of a homogenous solution and a heterogenous solid gas reaction and the presence or absence of water for hydrolytic reactions however both reaction conditions are of environmental relevance one initial step under both conditions is the oxidation dehydrogenation of 6 ppd to the more conjugated benzoquinone imine n 4 1 3 dimethylbutyl imino 2 5 cyclohexadiene 1 ylidene 6 ppdqi m z 267 esi pos duchacek and kuta 1990 huntink 2003 a mix of 6 ppd and 6 ppdqi was reported to be used in tire manufacturing datta et al 2004 in aqueous solution an equilibrium likely exists between both substances depending on the redox conditions immediately after preparing the aqueous solution of 6 ppd in contact with air 6 ppdqi is also detectable fig s 2 this is one reason why 6 ppd quantification in aqueous solution is difficult likely the further oxidation of 6 ppdqi by two subsequent oxygen additions via tp283 1 leads to 6 ppdq m z 299 the tps that were detected and tentatively identified in this study can be arranged along different pathways fig 1 given that many of these reactions are competitive rather than consecutive and do not only involve oxidation reactions experiments at different ozone dosages were not instrumental in verifying these pathways therefore much of fig 1 awaits experimental verification of the many tps the following appeared to be most relevant in terms of their peak areas figure s1 along the quinone pathway a tp283 1 the direct product of 6 ppdqi as well as its two oxidation products 6 ppdq formed by oxygen addition and tp 281 formed by dehydrogenation were the major products however several other products are formed along this path fig 1 along the nitroso aryl pathway b tp285 3 formed by the oxidation of one of the amino groups of 6 ppd and no dpa product of further oxidation and oxidative cleavage of the aliphatic side chain were dominating tp285 3 has been found to be relatively stable lattimer et al 1983 which could explain its comparatively high signal intensity in our experiment fig s1 the next two pathways c d in fig 1 were more relevant for ozonation of 6 ppd in water than for ozonation of dry 6 ppd by ozone in air both these pathways involve hydrolysis of amino bonds of 6 ppd the hdpa pathway c leads to 4 hdpa hydrolysis of 6 ppd has been reported to be quite fast in water half life of 8 h at ph 7 echa 2021a 4 hdpa may however also be formed from 6 ppdqi the hydrolysis of which is even faster half life of 4 7 h at ph 7 echa 2021b along the aryl hydrolysis pathway d tp 194 is the major product fig s1 oxidation of tp 194 may lead to tp 138 the tp with the lowest molecular weight detected in these experiments from the side chain oxidation pathway f tp 285 4 was detected as an initial product this can break down to form 4 adpa a comparably large peak fig s1 or leads to tp 269 and tp 227 the side chain oxidation of 6 ppdqi leads to tp 283 2 an overview of all tps and their identification level is given in tab s1 6 ppd is not the only n n disubstituted phenylenediamine that may be added as antioxidant or specifically as antiozonant to tires dppd is also of importance and its ozonation in aqueous phase and gas phase were additionally investigated in this study five tps known from 6 ppd were also found as dppd products belonging to the nitroso aryl pathway the aryl hydrolysis pathway or the hdpa pathway tab s3 dppd has not played a role in the most recent discussion on chemicals released from tires or trwps although its leaching potential is lower than that of 6 ppd müller et al 2021 its tps could contribute to tire derived leachables analogous to 6 ppd the oxidative transformation of 6 ppdq was studied and 12 further tps were detected fig 2 all these tps were also found during 6 ppd ozonation with tp 249 and tp 265 showing the highest intensity fig s1 the products detected from 6 ppdq ozonation confirm that its quinone system was primarily attacked by ozone pathway h this is in line with previous studies on ozonation of quinones ramseier and gunten 2009 all the tps within pathway h result from an attack on the quinone ring followed by ring opening and rearrangement one exception tp 351 only oxidation of the quinone ring and alkyl chain other tps are explainable by the loss of the aniline moiety or the alkyl chain pathway g fig 2 tab s2 these results show that 6 ppdq is subjected to further degradation in the presence of oxidants in agreement to this the half life of 6 ppdq in dechlorinated drinking water was recently reported to be 33 h at room temperature hiki et al 2021 above discussion on the relative importance of different tps in lab scale ozonation experiments is based on their peak intensities fig s1 because reference chemicals were only available for 6 ppd and three tps preventing a full quantification of all the tps detected however the response factors of these four compounds in lc hrms were comparatively similar and ranged from 0 44 4 hdpa to 1 2 6 ppd tab s4 on this basis it appears justified to evaluate the relevance of different tps of 6 ppd based on their peak intensities however this cannot substitute a later full quantification of those tps that are or will become available as reference compounds 3 2 occurrence of 6 ppd and its tps in snow from urban roads in urban environment snow is expected to accumulate particles generated on roads for the period from snowfall to snow melt therefore three snow samples collected in leipzig germany in february 2021 were analyzed by lc hrms and a suspect screening was performed for the tps found from lab scale experiments fig 1 fig 2 tab s1 tab s2 the water and the particulate fraction of the snow samples were analyzed separately a total of 32 tps of 6 ppd including 6 ppdq were detected in the water or the particulate phase of all three snow samples fig 3 b fig s4b analytically this confirms the previous finding that lab experiments can be very useful to generate suspects for the screening of environmental samples seiwert et al 2016 more importantly this result outlines that the diversity of tps formed by ozonation of 6 ppd in the lab is of relevance also in the environment indeed 6 ppdq is only one of those tps and the detection of 9 of its tps proves that 6 ppdq is not a dead end product the tps which are known from the lab experiments but not detected in snow are primarily intermediates such as tp283 1 6 ppdqi and tp285 2 fig 1 the load in the snow particles and water of 6 ppd and the 32 tps detected was clearly dominated by 6 ppd with 40 50 of the total peak area tpa fig 3a this shows that 6 ppd is much stabilized by its embedding into the rubber matrix of trwps the tps with the highest relative contribution based on peak areas are 4 adpa and 6 ppdq both around 8 of tpa followed by tp 213 tp 297 3 tp 249 tp 205 and tp 257 all 2 tpa on average 4 adpa may however also originate from other disubstituted phenylenediamines in tires like dppd as demonstrated in this study tab s3 the compositions of all three snow samples are comparatively similar even though they were collected from different streets with ongoing aging of trwps and ongoing transformation of 6 ppd and its tps the pattern of 6 ppd related compounds in the environment may differ from the ones observed from snow samples likely tps occurring later in the transformation pathways fig 1 are then gaining relative importance recent studies have shown 6 ppd and 6 ppdq to occur in surface runoff and in urban streams affected by surface runoff challis et al 2021 johannessen et al 2021 tian et al 2021 as well as in road dust huang et al 2021 however other tps except 6 ppdq have not yet been considered nor has the particulate phase been considered in such studies the overwhelming majority of 6 ppd in the snow is observed in the particulate phase containing trwps rather than in water distribution ratio water particle 0 001 fig 3b similarly the particulate phase dominates the load in snow for most of the tps of 6 ppd as well with a proportion of 90 ratio 0 1 to 99 ratio 0 01 for individual compounds fig 3b for 6 ppdq the share of the aqueous phase is only little higher than for 6 ppd these findings agree to the suggestion of 6 ppdq being a potential chemical marker for trwps in the environment klöckner et al 2021 for several tps formed from 6 ppdq namely tp 197 tp 299 and tp 302 right side of fig 3b the proportion in the water phase equals or even exceeds the proportion in the particle phase of the snow ratio 1 this may reflect the higher polarity of these tps expressed by their lower predicted logd values compared to most tps directly formed from 6 ppd fig s5 summing the peak areas of 6 ppd and all its tps 90 93 of tpa are found in the particulate phase and only 6 10 in the water phase of all three snow samples this is primarily due to the large contribution of 6 ppd 40 50 of tpa which is almost exclusively found in the particulate phase in a recent leaching study 3 of 6 ppd was determined in the leachate müller et al 2021 a value much higher than the 0 1 found here this may indicate that equilibration between the particulate and water phase had not taken place in all snow samples in this study despite the melting and sample processing in the lab at room temperature for approx 2 h also the contact time of particles in surface runoff before its entry into a sewer system is limited and may not be sufficient to reach the equilibrium concentrations in the two phases non equilibrium is even more likely because chemicals transport within the trwp rubber phase is highly hindered huntink 2003 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the strong dominance of the particle phase for the load of 6 ppd and many of its tps in the snow samples is also true for surface runoff in times of rainfall the dominance of the particulate phase for the load of 6 ppd and its tps outlines the option to effectively control their emission into environment by retaining the particles of road runoff before its discharge in the case of combined sewer systems this can be effectively done in wwtps see section 3 3 the situation may however be different for separate sewer systems even when settling basins are in place to retain the particles of surface runoff 6 ppd and its tps may slowly be released into the water phase during extended residence times of trwps in such basins moreover the above data suggest that analyzing 6 ppd and 6 ppdq only in the water phase of discharges rich in particles such as combined sewer overflow or untreated surface runoff but not in the particulate phase being discharged together with the water would drastically underestimate the amounts transferred to surface waters 3 3 occurrence of 6 ppd and its tps in a wastewater treatment plant in combined sewer systems the surface runoff is collected together with wastewater from other sources households industry etc and treated in wwtps therefore the influent and effluent of a wwtp treating wastewater from a combined sewer system was analyzed by suspect screening for 6 ppd and its tps over one day during snowmelt rainfall and dry weather 6 10 samples per day 22 samples of each influent and effluent in total only the dissolved phase was analyzed as particle removal in wwtps is known to be very high cheng et al 2021 of the 38 tps found from lab scale experiments 13 tps including 3 tps of 6 ppdq were detected in the water phase of the wwtp influent fig 4 fig s6 6 ppd could only be determined during snowmelt while 6 ppdq was determined during snowmelt and rainfall neither of the two was detected during dry weather loq approx 25 ng l their contribution to the sum of the 6 ppd related compounds in the influent was low approx 1 of tpa the major signals in the influent however correspond to tp257 tp259 1 and tp259 2 pathway a 4 adpa and no dpa pathway b all originating from 6 ppd fig 1 as well as tp249 from 6 ppdq fig 2 the load of all these compounds was clearly enhanced during snowmelt and rainfall fig 4 this supports the assumption that these compounds do originate from surface runoff and from trwps rather than from the other wastewater sources collected in combined sewer systems households industry etc 4 adpa no dpa 4 hdpa tp194 and tp138 were detected in the water phase of wwtp influent also during dry weather although at much lower concentration than during snowmelt and rainfall 4 adpa is known to be applied in pharmaceuticals photography and in dyestuff industries khanna et al 1987 so that surface runoff indeed may not be the only source of 4 adpa in municipal wastewater however the peak area of all 6 ppd related compounds during dry weather was one order of magnitude lower than during snow melt or rainfall fig 4 4 adpa no dpa 4 hdpa and tp138 could originate from other diphenylamine antioxidants tab s3 which were recently detected to be present in treatment plant influents as well zhang et al 2021 in wwtp influent 4 hdpa and 6 ppdq were quantified based on available reference compounds the mean concentration of 4 hdpa ranged from 0 07 µg l for the day with snowmelt to 0 02 µg l at dry weather table 1 concentrations of 6 ppdq were even higher especially during snowmelt reaching 0 1 µg l based on the mean flow of water at the sampling days the loads were around 5 g d for 4 hpda and 5 g d for 6 ppdq at dry weather and increased to 17 g d and 26 g d respectively for the day with snowmelt table 1 the estimated total load of 6 ppd and its tps in the influent was 190 g d at dry weather and increased to 1100 and 2000 g d at the day of snowmelt and rainfall respectively table 1 in wwtp effluent 14 tps of 6 ppd could still be observed their estimated total load was reduced by 22 rainfall and 45 snow melt to approx 1600 g d and 600 g d removal increased to 65 for the day with regular dry weather conditions table 1 no clear indication of removal in wwtp was found for tp 259 2 4 adpa tp 213 and tp 235 the compounds dominating the effluent pattern were tp 249 tp 259 2 and 4 adpa these tps appear stable enough to withstand biological wastewater treatment at least partially especially tp 249 and tp 259 2 are thus promising candidates to search for in the aquatic environment their identification was not successful in this study but would be desirable while 6 ppd was detected in the effluent only during the snowmelt event 6 ppdq was found during snow melt and rainfall but contributed to 1 or less to the 6 ppd related compounds in wwtp effluent however it should be noted that the biological treatment process in wwtps may form additional tps of 6 ppd or one of its tps this study confines itself to the 38 tps that were detected in lab experiments on abiotic oxidative transformation fig 1 fig 2 for wwtp effluents a median concentration of 0 018 µg l of 6 ppd from 5 samples was reported echa 2021c data on the concentration of 6 ppd in influents and effluents of municipal wwtps and the extent of 6 ppd removal are not available yet no reports appear to exist on concentration of any of 6 ppd tps in municipal wastewater for stormwater a median value of 0 11 µg l for 6 ppd was documented for four samples echa 2021c for 6 ppdq recent studies report stormwater concentrations in the range of 0 2 1 2 µg l challis et al 2021 tian et al 2022 the concentrations of 6 ppdq found here in the influent of the wwtp during snowmelt and rainfall are even lower than the reported data on road runoff which may in part be due to the dilution of road runoff with wastewater from households and industry in the combined sewer systems 4 conclusions a total 38 tps were identified to various confidence levels in this study as products of the abiotic oxidative transformation of 6 ppd while 6 ppdq may be of specific concern due to its biological effects understanding the environmental fate of 6 ppd requires a much broader view on its tps 34 tps of 6 ppd are detected in the snow from urban roads the major load of 6 ppd and its tps in snow from urban roads is in the particulate phase namely from 6 ppd and 6 ppdq 90 99 with increasing polarity of the tps the aqueous phase is gaining importance this likely also applies for surface runoff after rainfall retaining the particulate fraction of road runoff before its discharge into surface water would substantially reduce the emission of 6 ppd and many of its tps up to 13 tps of 6 ppd were detected in the influent to a wwtp treating combined sewer water the proportion of 6 ppd and 6 ppdq to the total signal area of all 6 ppd related compounds in the dissolved phase was 1 outlining that in this phase other tps are becoming increasingly important the estimated load of 6 ppd and its tps in municipal wastewater was elevated by about one order of magnitude during snowmelt and rain compared to dry weather conditions their elimination in wwtp was moderate with 22 65 depending on the weather conditions total 14 tps of 6 ppd were still detectable in the effluent of wwtp with tp 249 tp 259 2 and 4 adpa as the dominant compounds the reactivity of 6 ppd and the large number of tps complicates studying the environmental fate of 6 ppd and assessing its environmental risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16271,most people in ghana have no or only basic access to safely managed water especially in rural areas much of the population relies on groundwater for drinking which can be contaminated with fluoride and lead to dental fluorosis children under the age of two are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of fluoride and can retain 80 90 of a fluoride dose compared to 60 in adults despite numerous local studies no spatially continuous picture exists of the fluoride contamination across ghana nor is there any estimate of what proportion of the population is potentially exposed to unsafe fluoride levels here we spatially model the probability of fluoride concentrations exceeding 1 0 mg l in groundwater across ghana to identify risk areas and estimate the number of children and adults exposed to unsafe fluoride levels in drinking water we use a set of geospatial predictor variables with random forest modeling and evaluate the model performance through spatial cross validation we found that approximately 15 of the area of ghana mainly in the northeast has a high probability of fluoride contamination the total at risk population is about 920 000 persons or 3 of the population with an estimated 240 000 children 0 9 years in at risk areas in some districts such as karaga gushiegu tamale and mion 4 out of 10 children are potentially exposed to fluoride poisoning geology and high evapotranspiration are the main drivers of fluoride enrichment in groundwater consequently climate change might put even greater pressure on the area s water resources our

water intake as high as 3 4 l day for adults this is 1 5 2 times higher than the who estimated daily water consumption who 2017 therefore apambire et al 1997 recommended an upper safe threshold of fluoride concentration in drinking water of 1 0 mg l the high exposure of the population in ghana to fluoride led craig et al 2015 to recommend an age specific threshold for fluoride intake the risk of developing non carcinogenic effects such as permanent dental fluorosis is greater at an early age during the development of tooth enamel young children can also retain 80 90 of a given fluoride dose compared to 60 in adults who 2004 with about 90 of the fluoride absorbed from liquids compared to 30 40 absorbed from solids who 1996 hence craig et al 2015 recommended an upper threshold of fluoride in drinking water of 1 0 mg l for older children and adults and an even lower level 0 6 mg l in the first two years of life kumar et al 2019 zango et al 2019 this is particularly relevant for ghana where children 0 9 years old account for approximately 25 of the total population gss 2020 by contrast in european countries children represent only about 12 of the population therefore identifying children who are potentially exposed to unsafe fluoride levels in drinking water is critical in ghana the spatial distribution of the fluoride contamination in groundwater throughout ghana is related to the geological topographical and climatic characteristics of the country sunkari et al 2020 where groundwater testing has not been carried out spatial environmental and socioeconomic variables are instrumental predictors for identifying areas at risk amini et al 2008 podgorski and berg 2020 recently machine learning methods such as random forest have been adopted for spatial analysis for their advantages in evaluating complex and non linear spatial relationships where a large number of variables might be needed to explain a given spatial phenomenon lary et al 2016 however for machine learning methods such as random forest challenges arise when attempting to account for dependency structures associated with spatial data that differ from those of non spatial datasets meyer et al 2012 pohjankukka et al 2017 valavi et al 2019 one challenge is that spatial autocorrelation sac between variables can bias and inflate results even though the phenomenon is a natural one occurring where related variables provide the same information in a given area another is that using traditional non spatial validation methods to maintain the hypothesis of spatial independence is difficult throughout the validation process these methods create a random set of validation points that may be very close to the training points resulting in an overly optimistic view of a model s performance ploton et al 2020 the use of spatial cross validation can be valuable for maintaining independence between the training and testing data to help ensure reliable performance estimations in the context of spatial modeling araujo et al 2005 thereby avoiding inflated estimates of prediction accuracy associated with traditional cross validation methods e g k folds hammond and verbyla 1996 misiuk et al 2019 spatial cross validation avoids problems related to inflated prediction accuracy caused by spatial autocorrelation by choosing a sufficiently large block size that avoids spatial autocorrelation between variables and sufficiently represents the classes roberts et al 2017 similarly the area of applicability aoa also called applicability domain identifies the areas where the model has knowledge of environmental conditions which are set by the range of the training data the aoa is a valuable tool to identify areas where the model is able to learn from the training data and where its estimated performance is still reliable meyer and pebesma 2021 despite numerous local studies on fluoride contamination of groundwater in ghana affam et al 2012 alfredo et al 2014 anim gyampo et al 2012 anku et al 2009 apambire 1996 atipoka 2009 craig et al 2018 firempong et al 2013 ganyaglo et al 2019 loh et al 2012 smedley et al 2002 yidana et al 2012 zango et al 2019 no comprehensive assessment of fluoride hazard and risk yet exists for the whole country including estimates of the number of children and adults potentially exposed to unsafe levels therefore in the present study we spatially model the probability of the occurrence of geogenic fluoride concentrations greater than 1 0 mg l in groundwater in ghana a set of geospatial predictor variables with random forests is used we address the abovementioned shortcomings of using random forests in a spatial context by evaluating the model performance through state of the art spatial cross validation and by assessing model uncertainties we then use the resulting hazard map of fluoride contamination to estimate the population and the children potentially exposed to fluoride levels in drinking water that may affect their health this hazard map and estimation of the at risk population will be invaluable for guiding location based risk reduction policy and intervention changes to improve the future outcomes of children living in high risk fluoride contamination areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ghana is located in west africa at the gulf of guinea between 1 20 east to 3 25 west and 4 50 to 11 18 north fig 1 its population reached 31 million inhabitants in 2020 the country has a generally equatorial tropical climate in the south and a semi arid climate in the north the south has relatively high and stable temperatures throughout the year with an average daily temperature ranging from 21 30 c the northeast has the most elevated temperatures in the country reaching 35 40 c during the hottest months of the year from february to april rainfall decreases with increasing latitude ranging from about 1900 mm per year in the southwest to about 800 mm in the north asiamah et al 1997 the geology of the country is dominated by voltaic birimian and granitic geological formations in the north while the south is dominated by birimian and middle precambrian rock formations an extended description of the geology is provided in fig s1 the state of the soil is strongly influenced by the climate of the country in the north leptosols and plinthosols are observed which are semi arid and poor soils while in the south the most characteristic soils are lateritic such as ochrosols and oxysols which are soils normally found in tropical rainforests jones et al 2013 the topography of the country is gentle with a low plain on the coast and an extensive plateau in the south central part of the country and highlands mainly in the west less than 1 of the territory has slopes greater than 5 and the altitude varies from sea level to 885 m on mount afadjato 2 2 fluoride data and predictor variables the fluoride concentration dataset consisted of 611 of our own groundwater quality data measurements as well as 2623 collected from other sources abusa et al 2018 addo et al 2011 affam et al 2012 agyemang 2020 anornu et al 2017 arko et al 2019 avi et al 2019 boakye opoku 2013 chegbeleh et al 2020 cida 2011 egbi et al 2019 gastineau 2015 kulinkina et al 2017 mensah essilfie 2013 nkansah et al 2019 smedley 1996 smedley et al 2002 zango et al 2019 more information is provided in supplementary table s1 of these data 13 of the wells exceed the guideline value of 1 5 mg l recommended by the who and 22 exceed 1 0 mg l the guideline for tropical countries like ghana with a higher than average water consumption and therefore greater exposure apambire et al 1997 craig et al 2015 sixty five geospatial predictor variables of climate geology soil topography and ecology were collected based on their known or potential relationships with high fluoride levels in groundwater fig 2 presents a selection of these explanatory variables while supplementary fig s2 shows the 19 predictor variables ultimately selected the spatial resolution of most of the explanatory variables was the same at 250 m and a common spatial analysis unit was created by assigning the point data of fluoride concentrations to a grid of 250 m2 when more than one point in a pixel was available the geometric mean was calculated the data were then categorized as zero for concentrations 1 0 mg l i e class zero and one for concentrations 1 0 mg l i e class one 2 3 random forest modeling random forest is an ensemble method based on classification and regression trees that use recursive binary splitting to split a dataset into two sets for the selection of the optimal variables breiman 2001 a reliable prediction is ensured by growing a large number of dissimilar trees based on a random resampling of the original data and a random subset of the variables the final prediction is the result of the average of all the trees the present random forest model was created using the r statistical programming language r core team 2020 any bias produced by splitting data into particular training and testing data sets was avoided by performing 1000 iterations with different subsets of training and testing data since a large disparity in class frequencies can negatively influence the performance of a model the data set was balanced for each iteration by randomly down sampling the majority class in the training set to match the least frequent class i e class one or sample points with a fluoride concentration over the threshold of 1 0 mg l each model was produced by growing 1001 trees the 19 predictors variables used in modeling were selected based on their contribution to the overall model performance as measured by accuracy therefore variables that had a mean decrease in accuracy 0 on average over all random forest model iterations were retained that is only variables that systematically improved the predicted accuracy were kept 2 4 spatial cross validation of the model the performance of the model was verified on the test data by spatial cross validation with the r package blockcv valavi et al 2019 this step avoids the bias that occurs when the data used to train the model are not spatially independent from the data used to validate the model ambroise and mclachlan 2002 pohjankukka et al 2017 the spatial independence of the training and validation data was achieved by spatially separating the training and validation data sets using 28 blocks of approximately 81 81 km in size the block size was defined to ensure that both classes had sufficient representation roberts et al 2017 using a semivariogram of the predictor variables the block size was also used to assess and avoid spatial autocorrelation of those variables an example of the fold assignment and the semivariogram of the predictor variables is shown in fig s3 the sensitivity specificity balanced accuracy precision brier score receiver operating characteristic roc curve and area under the curve auc were calculated for cut off probabilities between 0 and 1 sensitivity provides the proportion of high measured fluoride concentrations that are correctly identified by the model conversely specificity provides the proportion of low measured fluoride concentrations that are correctly identified by the model balanced accuracy describes the overall performance of the model through an average of sensitivity and specificity while precision reports on the proportion of cases that were labelled with fluoride contamination that are indeed contaminated with fluoride the brier score verifies the accuracy of the prediction by showing how far the predictions are from the truth brier score values closer to zero indicate a better calibration of the model the roc depicts the relationship between the false positive rate 1 specificity and sensitivity the auc measures the area under the roc curve with values closer to one indicating a better predictive capability of the model a better understanding and interpretation of the random forest model results were achieved using the importance of variables and partial dependence plots pdp the influence of the predictor variables on the prediction outcome of the model was determined by calculating the importance of the variables although this still does not relate the predictor variable to the prediction outcome for this reason partial dependence plots pdps were also calculated greenwell 2017 which show the effect that changes in an explanatory variable have on the prediction 2 5 hazard map the hazard probability map of fluoride in groundwater exceeding 1 0 mg l in ghana was calculated using the average of 1000 model predictions each run was created through the random forest model built with the final predictor variables in the compiled dataset of low and high fluoride concentrations the averaged map is less sensitive to any arbitrary selection produced by the specific splitting of the training and test data sets we then classified the fluoride hazard in groundwater as high or low using the average probability cut off which was taken at the point at which the specificity and sensitivity of a model are equal in a balanced sample between low and high values this usually corresponds to the highest overall accuracy over all cut off points we then created two additional maps that classify the fluoride hazard in groundwater as high or low using the minimum and maximum probability cut off points from the 1000 iterations the standard deviation for each pixel for the three hazard maps was then calculated this represents the confidence in the prediction of the value of each pixel over the entire study area as well as the spatial stability of the models the spatially uncertain areas were calculated using the aoa with the r package cast meyer and pebesma 2021 the aoa is the area where the model can be applied with an expected average performance that is comparable to that estimated with the training data in areas outside the aoa the model predictions are more uncertain as these areas contain predictor values not found within the limits of the training data the aoa is derived from the dissimilarity index di which provides a threshold to define the aoa the di uses a unitless measure to determine how much each point outside the training data differs from the training data for this it evaluates the distances in a multidimensional predictor variable space by weighting the predictor variables by their importance derived from the random forest model the aoa is determined by the 0 95 quantile threshold of the di values of the training data using this threshold a new data point is outside the aoa when the di exceeds the 0 95 quantile subsequently the pixels with a high standard deviation and uncertainty were removed from the final hazard map of high fluoride contamination the indication of the regions of less certainty provides valuable information for the final interpretation of the results 2 6 estimation of the at risk population our use of the global population age structure for the year 2020 worldpop 2018 allowed us to identify the total population and children aged 0 9 years living in areas with groundwater fluoride concentrations exceeding 1 0 mg l because not all the population relies on groundwater we used national level groundwater usage rates for urban and rural areas who unicef joint monitoring program jmp 2019 finally to identify urban and rural areas in the country we used the ghs smod 06 of the joint research centre jrc of the european commission which indicates the degree of urbanization in 2020 based on landsat image data and global population grids pesaresi et al 2019 we then estimated the potentially affected population by multiplying the pixel s groundwater consuming population by its probability of having a high risk of fluoride contamination as previously described podgorski and berg 2020 the population at risk was then broken down by district and region across the country 3 results 3 1 predictor variables we modeled the probability of groundwater fluoride exceeding 1 0 mg l in ghana by initially considering 65 geospatial variables from these 19 variables were kept which are plotted in fig 3a according to their decreasing relative importance the final set of variables is presented in descending order according to their importance in fig 3a this diverse set of variables includes climatic geological soil and topographic variables the effects of geologic features and potential evapotranspiration pet on the probability model of high fluoride are shown in fig 3b note however that the model performance see section 3 2 is derived from the combination of explanatory variables representing the complexity and diversity of the system and not just from any particular variable the partial dependence plots provided in supplemental material fig s4 provide further insights into the relationships between the predictor variables and fluoride contamination 3 2 hazard map the hazard probability map of groundwater fluoride contamination generated from the final random forest model is presented in fig 4 several regions of high probability are evident across the country the northeast is the most affected region with probabilities varying between 50 and 90 this region extends from eastern gonja to the northernmost district of bongo excluding a low probability belt between the districts of mamprugu moagduri and bunkpurugu yonyo in the northwest the sawla tuna kalba and bole districts have a probability of around 50 70 of groundwater fluoride contamination and an isolated area in the south near accra has a probability of around 50 60 as indicated by the histogram in fig 4 1 2 and 16 5 of the country have a probability 80 and 50 respectively of having fluoride in groundwater exceeding 1 0 mg l 3 3 performance of the model no significant variation beyond 2 across the metrics was detected among the 1000 different models runs the corresponding 1000 roc curves shown in fig 4 have a standard deviation of 0 012 demonstrating consistent accuracies ranging between auc values of 0 72 and 0 81 mean 0 76 sensitivity specificity precision and balanced accuracy all have values around 70 at the optimal cutoff for precision for example this means that the prediction was correct 7 out of 10 times where the model indicated a fluoride concentration exceeding the threshold these metrics show that the model produced stable predictions across the 1000 iterations the brier score which reports the quadratic error of probability and has a range of to 1 where values close to 0 represent a more accurate model is around 0 2 overall these results indicate a good calibration of the model 3 4 estimation of the at risk population about 15 6 or 37 300 km2 of the total land area of ghana may contain fluoride contamination above the threshold these areas are mainly in the northeastern part of the country where 24 of ghana s districts are located to calculate the number of people potentially affected by high fluoride in drinking water the population living in these hazard areas was adjusted by the proportion of untreated groundwater use the total population that has a risk of ingesting high fluoride concentrations in drinking water is around 920 000 fig 5 a or 3 of the population fig 5c shows that karaga gushiegu yendi and savelugu nanton have the highest populations of potentially exposed individuals comprising about 42 of those potentially exposed at the district level 4 discussion 4 1 predictive variables geogenic fluoride contamination is a complex process and our study of its predictors confirms that high fluoride concentrations in groundwater depend on an interplay of a number of variables amini et al 2008 frencken 1992 though all play a role some variables do contribute more in predicting contamination and we found the geology climate and soils of the area to be the main drivers of high fluoride levels fig 3 this is consistent with high fluoride levels that are widely reported in the bongo area which are associated with the eburnearn supergroup and its k feldspar rich granitoids of mainly granite and monzonite apambire et al 1997 smedley et al 1995 the highest levels of fluoride have also been reported in the rocks of the voltaian supergroup oti pendjari group which are composed of sandstone mudstone siltstone and carbonate in agreement with our findings on the role of climate high fluoride levels have also been reported in more arid conditions such as those observed in northern ghana see the partial dependence plot of pet in fig 3b here higher temperatures and evaporation rates lead to high fluoride concentrations cida 2011 edmunds and smedley 2013 which is especially apparent during the dry season when fluoride concentrations increase alfredo et al 2014 malago 2017 this is a problem in areas like northern ghana where wells closed for safety reasons due to their high fluoride concentration have been reopened in periods of water stress to alleviate water shortages craig et al 2015 ganyaglo et al 2019 in the face of future expected higher temperatures and increased water stress related to climate change in northern ghana epa 2020 we expect even more pressure and new challenges related to water safety for the population in that area 4 2 spatial cross validation and model performance the uncertainties of our model were determined using spatial cross validation this led to stable and reliable metrics and maps across all iterations however spatial cross validation can also downplay the results by not accounting for the predictive capability of the model for combinations of predictor data that are similar but spatially distant from the training data the possibility also exists that by separating the blocks for training the diversity of training data is inadvertently reduced see fig s3 we attempted to moderate this effect through the careful implementation of blocks and multiple iterations this agrees with the literature consensus which also suggests that a block based spatial validation approach to building a predictive model is most appropriate roberts et al 2017 moreover this approach bolsters the credibility of the resulting maps overall we reduced the biases produced by an unbalanced training sample by creating a balanced sample for the model by randomly down sampling all classes in the training set to match the minority class i e class one leaving this unbalanced however means that the majority class would dominate the classification this is especially relevant for the fluoride concentration because the over represented class corresponds to cases where fluoride 1 0 mg l is reported i e class zero not correcting this bias would mean that sensitivity a metric that informs about the correct prediction of positive cases would be under represented compared to specificity which correspondingly affects the balanced accuracy evans and cushman 2009 khalilia et al 2011 furthermore by iterating the model 1000 times by randomly selecting the data from our balanced sample we avoided any bias introduced by data splitting because of this calibration metrics reporting the model s predictive performance with the new data indicate that the models generalize well this highlights that the pixels assigned to areas with fluoride presence above 1 0 mg l are well determined this is also evident in the ability of the model to identify cases within the dataset around 70 of the time sensitivity and in the overall ability of the models to correctly identify both classes which is also around 70 at a cutoff of 0 49 compared to other studies using surface predictor variables e g amini et al 2008 bindal and singh 2019 cao et al 2022 the metrics of this model are somewhat lower but this is because we use spatial cross validation which provides a useful estimate of the model s predictive performance without an optimistic bias due to the sac for example pohjankukka et al 2017 has shown that the metrics produced by non spatial cross validation can be up to 40 more optimistic than those of spatial cross validation similar results were reported by dolan et al 2021 ploton et al 2020 roberts et al 2017 4 3 hazard map we created a hazard map of geogenic groundwater fluoride contamination for the whole of ghana fig 4 where high concentrations of fluoride mainly affect the northeastern part of the country between the northern region and the upper east region fluoride contamination in this area is extensively documented in the literature see supplementary table s3 the northern region has been recognized for its high fluoride concentrations in relation to the rocks of the oti pendjari group with reported fluoride concentrations of over 4 0 mg l anim gyampo et al 2012 cida 2011 high fluoride concentrations are also observed in northwestern ghana mainly in districts of the savannah region with concentrations over 1 5 mg l reported by some studies arhin and affam 2010 loh et al 2020 in general the model shows a very low probability 0 10 of fluoride concentration above the threshold in the south of the country see supplementary table s3 only in specific areas of the eastern region does the model have a 50 60 probability of fluoride concentrations above 1 0 mg l and these concentrations were mainly related to restricted areas within the eburnearn supergroup however in the south of the country the model shows less certainty see area outside the aoa fig s5d especially in the western western north and ahafo regions where the reporting or measurement of fluoride levels has been sparse this uncertainty is likely due to combinations of predictor values that are not found in the training data despite this these results are most likely correct as this area has environmental characteristics inversely related to higher fluoride concentration including a more humid tropical climate and high rainfall that dilutes the chemical composition of the groundwater frencken 1992 furthermore the authors who have reported high fluoride levels in the area have linked these findings to anthropogenic agrochemical pollution or seawater intrusion yidana 2010 zango et al 2019 identifying areas of higher uncertainty where modeling is more complex is relevant for prioritizing resources in the design of future sampling campaigns here future studies should look empirically into highlighted areas where more sampling is required to confirm results refine the model and create a more accurate representation of the geogenic hazard contamination future studies could also attempt modeling anthropogenic sources and salt water intrusion we estimated the number of people potentially at risk from excess fluoride in drinking water by creating a risk map of fluoride contamination 1 0 mg l we generated a reliable high fluoride hazard map by removing 0 7 of the pixels with standard deviation and 1 3 of the pixels with high uncertainty supplementary fig s5 the exclusion of these pixels had only a limited effect on the fluoride hazard map given that the standard deviation was not significant and that the difference in pixels between the maps was located at the class boundaries this behavior is expected as modeling at class boundaries usually shows more discrepancies than within the class features foody 2005 steele et al 1998 by contrast the area of uncertainty where the model was not trained with these environments is highly concentrated in the south of the country where almost no fluoride hazard was modeled 4 4 estimation of the at risk population ghana faces a major challenge in providing drinking water to its most at risk population as the northeastern part of the country which has the highest exposure to fluoride contamination also contains a greater proportion of the national population of children aged 0 9 years see supplementary fig s6 districts in the northern region have the largest exposed population fig 6 though the exposure varies significantly in districts such as gushiegu karaga and mion approximately 4 out of 10 children are potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that can affect their health the savelugu nanton district has the largest exposed child population of about 19 000 children followed by the karaga district with about 17 000 children in total an estimated 920 000 people are potentially exposed in ghana fig 5 the northeastern part of the country has the highest proportion of the rural population and therefore the highest dependency on groundwater who unicef joint monitoring program jmp 2019 furthermore this area and particularly the northern region has a poverty level close to 50 of the population and this level unlike in other regions of ghana has not been reduced in recent decades unicef 2016 children and adults must also often deal with psychological problems stemming from the social stigma of having teeth with fluorosis castilho 2009 dongzagla et al 2019 of note ghana conducted a census in 2021 such that the number of at risk people can be updated when this new information becomes available regardless new spatially disaggregated population databases would increasingly help to identify risk groups rather than considering the population as a whole this will provide a better understanding of the spatial patterns of the distribution and characteristics of these at risk populations thereby allowing the provision of information at more relevant administrative scales 4 5 applicability the hazard and risk maps are at a scale that can serve the authorities as a basis for more detailed research on water quality in ghana priority areas for further investigation and possible mitigation could be determined in part for example by the list of districts with a higher presence of young children potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that can harm their health fig 6 or by the identification of fluoride hazard areas fig 4 the results highlight not only hotspots of fluoride contamination and potentially exposed populations but also data gaps both the modeling approach and the choice of variables can serve as a basis for studying groundwater quality in other areas outside of ghana furthermore the spatial approach for model validation should be relevant to other machine learning applications that are conducted in a spatial context 5 conclusions we present the first hazard map of fluoride in groundwater resources throughout ghana which was produced by geospatially modeling the fluoride concentration using a random forest machine learning algorithm the northeastern part of the country consistently exceeds a fluoride concentration of 1 0 mg l in groundwater although the southern part of the country has a very low probability of reaching this concentration a better and broader distribution of sampling data would be needed to confirm these results refine the model and create a more accurate model of contamination we also identified that approximately 240 000 children and 680 000 adults are potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that may affect their health an important point to be stressed is that the majority of the child population is located in the north of the country where a higher probability exists for exposure to high fluoride levels in groundwater this region of ghana has a greater reliance on groundwater as well as the poorest population therefore these concerns highlight the challenges the country faces in protecting its at risk population a remaining question is to what extent the expected increase in aridity in the northern region might affect fluoride concentrations overall climate change is expected to make water scarcer and as a result increase fluoride concentrations in this area which would force people to seek unsafe drinking water sources we have reduced the effect of spatial dependencies in the training and testing data by evaluating model performance through spatial cross validation thereby avoiding overly optimistic results using the area of applicability has allowed us to identify areas with greater confidence in the prediction partial dependence plots depict the relationships between variables and the probability of high fluoride contamination these techniques assist the validation and interpretation of otherwise black box models overall the model created here is a valuable resource for estimating

16271,most people in ghana have no or only basic access to safely managed water especially in rural areas much of the population relies on groundwater for drinking which can be contaminated with fluoride and lead to dental fluorosis children under the age of two are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of fluoride and can retain 80 90 of a fluoride dose compared to 60 in adults despite numerous local studies no spatially continuous picture exists of the fluoride contamination across ghana nor is there any estimate of what proportion of the population is potentially exposed to unsafe fluoride levels here we spatially model the probability of fluoride concentrations exceeding 1 0 mg l in groundwater across ghana to identify risk areas and estimate the number of children and adults exposed to unsafe fluoride levels in drinking water we use a set of geospatial predictor variables with random forest modeling and evaluate the model performance through spatial cross validation we found that approximately 15 of the area of ghana mainly in the northeast has a high probability of fluoride contamination the total at risk population is about 920 000 persons or 3 of the population with an estimated 240 000 children 0 9 years in at risk areas in some districts such as karaga gushiegu tamale and mion 4 out of 10 children are potentially exposed to fluoride poisoning geology and high evapotranspiration are the main drivers of fluoride enrichment in groundwater consequently climate change might put even greater pressure on the area s water resources our hazard maps should raise awareness and understanding of geogenic fluoride contamination in ghana and can advise decision making at local levels to avoid or mitigate fluoride related risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords africa drinking water resources human health fluorosis random forest modeling groundwater pollution geogenic contamination 1 introduction only 41 of the population in ghana has access to safely managed water services and another 44 has only basic access while the remaining 14 has limited to no access who unicef joint monitoring program 2020 in rural areas and especially in the northern regions of the country the population therefore depends directly on groundwater wells for drinking atipoka 2009 however the groundwater in ghana is often naturally contaminated with fluoride and its consumption can lead to dental fluorosis alfredo et al 2014 barbier et al 2010 smedley et al 1995 the world health organization who has established a guideline maximum fluoride concentration of 1 5 mg l for drinking water which is based on an estimated drinking water intake of 2 l day for adults and emphasizes that countries should identify locally relevant standards based on their characteristics who 2017 in countries with generally high temperatures such as ghana where water consumption and thus exposure are higher a lower threshold has been suggested as is the case in india bureau of indian standards bis 2012 apambire et al 1997 reported that the year round high temperatures in the upper region of northern ghana averaging 32 c can lead to a daily water intake as high as 3 4 l day for adults this is 1 5 2 times higher than the who estimated daily water consumption who 2017 therefore apambire et al 1997 recommended an upper safe threshold of fluoride concentration in drinking water of 1 0 mg l the high exposure of the population in ghana to fluoride led craig et al 2015 to recommend an age specific threshold for fluoride intake the risk of developing non carcinogenic effects such as permanent dental fluorosis is greater at an early age during the development of tooth enamel young children can also retain 80 90 of a given fluoride dose compared to 60 in adults who 2004 with about 90 of the fluoride absorbed from liquids compared to 30 40 absorbed from solids who 1996 hence craig et al 2015 recommended an upper threshold of fluoride in drinking water of 1 0 mg l for older children and adults and an even lower level 0 6 mg l in the first two years of life kumar et al 2019 zango et al 2019 this is particularly relevant for ghana where children 0 9 years old account for approximately 25 of the total population gss 2020 by contrast in european countries children represent only about 12 of the population therefore identifying children who are potentially exposed to unsafe fluoride levels in drinking water is critical in ghana the spatial distribution of the fluoride contamination in groundwater throughout ghana is related to the geological topographical and climatic characteristics of the country sunkari et al 2020 where groundwater testing has not been carried out spatial environmental and socioeconomic variables are instrumental predictors for identifying areas at risk amini et al 2008 podgorski and berg 2020 recently machine learning methods such as random forest have been adopted for spatial analysis for their advantages in evaluating complex and non linear spatial relationships where a large number of variables might be needed to explain a given spatial phenomenon lary et al 2016 however for machine learning methods such as random forest challenges arise when attempting to account for dependency structures associated with spatial data that differ from those of non spatial datasets meyer et al 2012 pohjankukka et al 2017 valavi et al 2019 one challenge is that spatial autocorrelation sac between variables can bias and inflate results even though the phenomenon is a natural one occurring where related variables provide the same information in a given area another is that using traditional non spatial validation methods to maintain the hypothesis of spatial independence is difficult throughout the validation process these methods create a random set of validation points that may be very close to the training points resulting in an overly optimistic view of a model s performance ploton et al 2020 the use of spatial cross validation can be valuable for maintaining independence between the training and testing data to help ensure reliable performance estimations in the context of spatial modeling araujo et al 2005 thereby avoiding inflated estimates of prediction accuracy associated with traditional cross validation methods e g k folds hammond and verbyla 1996 misiuk et al 2019 spatial cross validation avoids problems related to inflated prediction accuracy caused by spatial autocorrelation by choosing a sufficiently large block size that avoids spatial autocorrelation between variables and sufficiently represents the classes roberts et al 2017 similarly the area of applicability aoa also called applicability domain identifies the areas where the model has knowledge of environmental conditions which are set by the range of the training data the aoa is a valuable tool to identify areas where the model is able to learn from the training data and where its estimated performance is still reliable meyer and pebesma 2021 despite numerous local studies on fluoride contamination of groundwater in ghana affam et al 2012 alfredo et al 2014 anim gyampo et al 2012 anku et al 2009 apambire 1996 atipoka 2009 craig et al 2018 firempong et al 2013 ganyaglo et al 2019 loh et al 2012 smedley et al 2002 yidana et al 2012 zango et al 2019 no comprehensive assessment of fluoride hazard and risk yet exists for the whole country including estimates of the number of children and adults potentially exposed to unsafe levels therefore in the present study we spatially model the probability of the occurrence of geogenic fluoride concentrations greater than 1 0 mg l in groundwater in ghana a set of geospatial predictor variables with random forests is used we address the abovementioned shortcomings of using random forests in a spatial context by evaluating the model performance through state of the art spatial cross validation and by assessing model uncertainties we then use the resulting hazard map of fluoride contamination to estimate the population and the children potentially exposed to fluoride levels in drinking water that may affect their health this hazard map and estimation of the at risk population will be invaluable for guiding location based risk reduction policy and intervention changes to improve the future outcomes of children living in high risk fluoride contamination areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ghana is located in west africa at the gulf of guinea between 1 20 east to 3 25 west and 4 50 to 11 18 north fig 1 its population reached 31 million inhabitants in 2020 the country has a generally equatorial tropical climate in the south and a semi arid climate in the north the south has relatively high and stable temperatures throughout the year with an average daily temperature ranging from 21 30 c the northeast has the most elevated temperatures in the country reaching 35 40 c during the hottest months of the year from february to april rainfall decreases with increasing latitude ranging from about 1900 mm per year in the southwest to about 800 mm in the north asiamah et al 1997 the geology of the country is dominated by voltaic birimian and granitic geological formations in the north while the south is dominated by birimian and middle precambrian rock formations an extended description of the geology is provided in fig s1 the state of the soil is strongly influenced by the climate of the country in the north leptosols and plinthosols are observed which are semi arid and poor soils while in the south the most characteristic soils are lateritic such as ochrosols and oxysols which are soils normally found in tropical rainforests jones et al 2013 the topography of the country is gentle with a low plain on the coast and an extensive plateau in the south central part of the country and highlands mainly in the west less than 1 of the territory has slopes greater than 5 and the altitude varies from sea level to 885 m on mount afadjato 2 2 fluoride data and predictor variables the fluoride concentration dataset consisted of 611 of our own groundwater quality data measurements as well as 2623 collected from other sources abusa et al 2018 addo et al 2011 affam et al 2012 agyemang 2020 anornu et al 2017 arko et al 2019 avi et al 2019 boakye opoku 2013 chegbeleh et al 2020 cida 2011 egbi et al 2019 gastineau 2015 kulinkina et al 2017 mensah essilfie 2013 nkansah et al 2019 smedley 1996 smedley et al 2002 zango et al 2019 more information is provided in supplementary table s1 of these data 13 of the wells exceed the guideline value of 1 5 mg l recommended by the who and 22 exceed 1 0 mg l the guideline for tropical countries like ghana with a higher than average water consumption and therefore greater exposure apambire et al 1997 craig et al 2015 sixty five geospatial predictor variables of climate geology soil topography and ecology were collected based on their known or potential relationships with high fluoride levels in groundwater fig 2 presents a selection of these explanatory variables while supplementary fig s2 shows the 19 predictor variables ultimately selected the spatial resolution of most of the explanatory variables was the same at 250 m and a common spatial analysis unit was created by assigning the point data of fluoride concentrations to a grid of 250 m2 when more than one point in a pixel was available the geometric mean was calculated the data were then categorized as zero for concentrations 1 0 mg l i e class zero and one for concentrations 1 0 mg l i e class one 2 3 random forest modeling random forest is an ensemble method based on classification and regression trees that use recursive binary splitting to split a dataset into two sets for the selection of the optimal variables breiman 2001 a reliable prediction is ensured by growing a large number of dissimilar trees based on a random resampling of the original data and a random subset of the variables the final prediction is the result of the average of all the trees the present random forest model was created using the r statistical programming language r core team 2020 any bias produced by splitting data into particular training and testing data sets was avoided by performing 1000 iterations with different subsets of training and testing data since a large disparity in class frequencies can negatively influence the performance of a model the data set was balanced for each iteration by randomly down sampling the majority class in the training set to match the least frequent class i e class one or sample points with a fluoride concentration over the threshold of 1 0 mg l each model was produced by growing 1001 trees the 19 predictors variables used in modeling were selected based on their contribution to the overall model performance as measured by accuracy therefore variables that had a mean decrease in accuracy 0 on average over all random forest model iterations were retained that is only variables that systematically improved the predicted accuracy were kept 2 4 spatial cross validation of the model the performance of the model was verified on the test data by spatial cross validation with the r package blockcv valavi et al 2019 this step avoids the bias that occurs when the data used to train the model are not spatially independent from the data used to validate the model ambroise and mclachlan 2002 pohjankukka et al 2017 the spatial independence of the training and validation data was achieved by spatially separating the training and validation data sets using 28 blocks of approximately 81 81 km in size the block size was defined to ensure that both classes had sufficient representation roberts et al 2017 using a semivariogram of the predictor variables the block size was also used to assess and avoid spatial autocorrelation of those variables an example of the fold assignment and the semivariogram of the predictor variables is shown in fig s3 the sensitivity specificity balanced accuracy precision brier score receiver operating characteristic roc curve and area under the curve auc were calculated for cut off probabilities between 0 and 1 sensitivity provides the proportion of high measured fluoride concentrations that are correctly identified by the model conversely specificity provides the proportion of low measured fluoride concentrations that are correctly identified by the model balanced accuracy describes the overall performance of the model through an average of sensitivity and specificity while precision reports on the proportion of cases that were labelled with fluoride contamination that are indeed contaminated with fluoride the brier score verifies the accuracy of the prediction by showing how far the predictions are from the truth brier score values closer to zero indicate a better calibration of the model the roc depicts the relationship between the false positive rate 1 specificity and sensitivity the auc measures the area under the roc curve with values closer to one indicating a better predictive capability of the model a better understanding and interpretation of the random forest model results were achieved using the importance of variables and partial dependence plots pdp the influence of the predictor variables on the prediction outcome of the model was determined by calculating the importance of the variables although this still does not relate the predictor variable to the prediction outcome for this reason partial dependence plots pdps were also calculated greenwell 2017 which show the effect that changes in an explanatory variable have on the prediction 2 5 hazard map the hazard probability map of fluoride in groundwater exceeding 1 0 mg l in ghana was calculated using the average of 1000 model predictions each run was created through the random forest model built with the final predictor variables in the compiled dataset of low and high fluoride concentrations the averaged map is less sensitive to any arbitrary selection produced by the specific splitting of the training and test data sets we then classified the fluoride hazard in groundwater as high or low using the average probability cut off which was taken at the point at which the specificity and sensitivity of a model are equal in a balanced sample between low and high values this usually corresponds to the highest overall accuracy over all cut off points we then created two additional maps that classify the fluoride hazard in groundwater as high or low using the minimum and maximum probability cut off points from the 1000 iterations the standard deviation for each pixel for the three hazard maps was then calculated this represents the confidence in the prediction of the value of each pixel over the entire study area as well as the spatial stability of the models the spatially uncertain areas were calculated using the aoa with the r package cast meyer and pebesma 2021 the aoa is the area where the model can be applied with an expected average performance that is comparable to that estimated with the training data in areas outside the aoa the model predictions are more uncertain as these areas contain predictor values not found within the limits of the training data the aoa is derived from the dissimilarity index di which provides a threshold to define the aoa the di uses a unitless measure to determine how much each point outside the training data differs from the training data for this it evaluates the distances in a multidimensional predictor variable space by weighting the predictor variables by their importance derived from the random forest model the aoa is determined by the 0 95 quantile threshold of the di values of the training data using this threshold a new data point is outside the aoa when the di exceeds the 0 95 quantile subsequently the pixels with a high standard deviation and uncertainty were removed from the final hazard map of high fluoride contamination the indication of the regions of less certainty provides valuable information for the final interpretation of the results 2 6 estimation of the at risk population our use of the global population age structure for the year 2020 worldpop 2018 allowed us to identify the total population and children aged 0 9 years living in areas with groundwater fluoride concentrations exceeding 1 0 mg l because not all the population relies on groundwater we used national level groundwater usage rates for urban and rural areas who unicef joint monitoring program jmp 2019 finally to identify urban and rural areas in the country we used the ghs smod 06 of the joint research centre jrc of the european commission which indicates the degree of urbanization in 2020 based on landsat image data and global population grids pesaresi et al 2019 we then estimated the potentially affected population by multiplying the pixel s groundwater consuming population by its probability of having a high risk of fluoride contamination as previously described podgorski and berg 2020 the population at risk was then broken down by district and region across the country 3 results 3 1 predictor variables we modeled the probability of groundwater fluoride exceeding 1 0 mg l in ghana by initially considering 65 geospatial variables from these 19 variables were kept which are plotted in fig 3a according to their decreasing relative importance the final set of variables is presented in descending order according to their importance in fig 3a this diverse set of variables includes climatic geological soil and topographic variables the effects of geologic features and potential evapotranspiration pet on the probability model of high fluoride are shown in fig 3b note however that the model performance see section 3 2 is derived from the combination of explanatory variables representing the complexity and diversity of the system and not just from any particular variable the partial dependence plots provided in supplemental material fig s4 provide further insights into the relationships between the predictor variables and fluoride contamination 3 2 hazard map the hazard probability map of groundwater fluoride contamination generated from the final random forest model is presented in fig 4 several regions of high probability are evident across the country the northeast is the most affected region with probabilities varying between 50 and 90 this region extends from eastern gonja to the northernmost district of bongo excluding a low probability belt between the districts of mamprugu moagduri and bunkpurugu yonyo in the northwest the sawla tuna kalba and bole districts have a probability of around 50 70 of groundwater fluoride contamination and an isolated area in the south near accra has a probability of around 50 60 as indicated by the histogram in fig 4 1 2 and 16 5 of the country have a probability 80 and 50 respectively of having fluoride in groundwater exceeding 1 0 mg l 3 3 performance of the model no significant variation beyond 2 across the metrics was detected among the 1000 different models runs the corresponding 1000 roc curves shown in fig 4 have a standard deviation of 0 012 demonstrating consistent accuracies ranging between auc values of 0 72 and 0 81 mean 0 76 sensitivity specificity precision and balanced accuracy all have values around 70 at the optimal cutoff for precision for example this means that the prediction was correct 7 out of 10 times where the model indicated a fluoride concentration exceeding the threshold these metrics show that the model produced stable predictions across the 1000 iterations the brier score which reports the quadratic error of probability and has a range of to 1 where values close to 0 represent a more accurate model is around 0 2 overall these results indicate a good calibration of the model 3 4 estimation of the at risk population about 15 6 or 37 300 km2 of the total land area of ghana may contain fluoride contamination above the threshold these areas are mainly in the northeastern part of the country where 24 of ghana s districts are located to calculate the number of people potentially affected by high fluoride in drinking water the population living in these hazard areas was adjusted by the proportion of untreated groundwater use the total population that has a risk of ingesting high fluoride concentrations in drinking water is around 920 000 fig 5 a or 3 of the population fig 5c shows that karaga gushiegu yendi and savelugu nanton have the highest populations of potentially exposed individuals comprising about 42 of those potentially exposed at the district level 4 discussion 4 1 predictive variables geogenic fluoride contamination is a complex process and our study of its predictors confirms that high fluoride concentrations in groundwater depend on an interplay of a number of variables amini et al 2008 frencken 1992 though all play a role some variables do contribute more in predicting contamination and we found the geology climate and soils of the area to be the main drivers of high fluoride levels fig 3 this is consistent with high fluoride levels that are widely reported in the bongo area which are associated with the eburnearn supergroup and its k feldspar rich granitoids of mainly granite and monzonite apambire et al 1997 smedley et al 1995 the highest levels of fluoride have also been reported in the rocks of the voltaian supergroup oti pendjari group which are composed of sandstone mudstone siltstone and carbonate in agreement with our findings on the role of climate high fluoride levels have also been reported in more arid conditions such as those observed in northern ghana see the partial dependence plot of pet in fig 3b here higher temperatures and evaporation rates lead to high fluoride concentrations cida 2011 edmunds and smedley 2013 which is especially apparent during the dry season when fluoride concentrations increase alfredo et al 2014 malago 2017 this is a problem in areas like northern ghana where wells closed for safety reasons due to their high fluoride concentration have been reopened in periods of water stress to alleviate water shortages craig et al 2015 ganyaglo et al 2019 in the face of future expected higher temperatures and increased water stress related to climate change in northern ghana epa 2020 we expect even more pressure and new challenges related to water safety for the population in that area 4 2 spatial cross validation and model performance the uncertainties of our model were determined using spatial cross validation this led to stable and reliable metrics and maps across all iterations however spatial cross validation can also downplay the results by not accounting for the predictive capability of the model for combinations of predictor data that are similar but spatially distant from the training data the possibility also exists that by separating the blocks for training the diversity of training data is inadvertently reduced see fig s3 we attempted to moderate this effect through the careful implementation of blocks and multiple iterations this agrees with the literature consensus which also suggests that a block based spatial validation approach to building a predictive model is most appropriate roberts et al 2017 moreover this approach bolsters the credibility of the resulting maps overall we reduced the biases produced by an unbalanced training sample by creating a balanced sample for the model by randomly down sampling all classes in the training set to match the minority class i e class one leaving this unbalanced however means that the majority class would dominate the classification this is especially relevant for the fluoride concentration because the over represented class corresponds to cases where fluoride 1 0 mg l is reported i e class zero not correcting this bias would mean that sensitivity a metric that informs about the correct prediction of positive cases would be under represented compared to specificity which correspondingly affects the balanced accuracy evans and cushman 2009 khalilia et al 2011 furthermore by iterating the model 1000 times by randomly selecting the data from our balanced sample we avoided any bias introduced by data splitting because of this calibration metrics reporting the model s predictive performance with the new data indicate that the models generalize well this highlights that the pixels assigned to areas with fluoride presence above 1 0 mg l are well determined this is also evident in the ability of the model to identify cases within the dataset around 70 of the time sensitivity and in the overall ability of the models to correctly identify both classes which is also around 70 at a cutoff of 0 49 compared to other studies using surface predictor variables e g amini et al 2008 bindal and singh 2019 cao et al 2022 the metrics of this model are somewhat lower but this is because we use spatial cross validation which provides a useful estimate of the model s predictive performance without an optimistic bias due to the sac for example pohjankukka et al 2017 has shown that the metrics produced by non spatial cross validation can be up to 40 more optimistic than those of spatial cross validation similar results were reported by dolan et al 2021 ploton et al 2020 roberts et al 2017 4 3 hazard map we created a hazard map of geogenic groundwater fluoride contamination for the whole of ghana fig 4 where high concentrations of fluoride mainly affect the northeastern part of the country between the northern region and the upper east region fluoride contamination in this area is extensively documented in the literature see supplementary table s3 the northern region has been recognized for its high fluoride concentrations in relation to the rocks of the oti pendjari group with reported fluoride concentrations of over 4 0 mg l anim gyampo et al 2012 cida 2011 high fluoride concentrations are also observed in northwestern ghana mainly in districts of the savannah region with concentrations over 1 5 mg l reported by some studies arhin and affam 2010 loh et al 2020 in general the model shows a very low probability 0 10 of fluoride concentration above the threshold in the south of the country see supplementary table s3 only in specific areas of the eastern region does the model have a 50 60 probability of fluoride concentrations above 1 0 mg l and these concentrations were mainly related to restricted areas within the eburnearn supergroup however in the south of the country the model shows less certainty see area outside the aoa fig s5d especially in the western western north and ahafo regions where the reporting or measurement of fluoride levels has been sparse this uncertainty is likely due to combinations of predictor values that are not found in the training data despite this these results are most likely correct as this area has environmental characteristics inversely related to higher fluoride concentration including a more humid tropical climate and high rainfall that dilutes the chemical composition of the groundwater frencken 1992 furthermore the authors who have reported high fluoride levels in the area have linked these findings to anthropogenic agrochemical pollution or seawater intrusion yidana 2010 zango et al 2019 identifying areas of higher uncertainty where modeling is more complex is relevant for prioritizing resources in the design of future sampling campaigns here future studies should look empirically into highlighted areas where more sampling is required to confirm results refine the model and create a more accurate representation of the geogenic hazard contamination future studies could also attempt modeling anthropogenic sources and salt water intrusion we estimated the number of people potentially at risk from excess fluoride in drinking water by creating a risk map of fluoride contamination 1 0 mg l we generated a reliable high fluoride hazard map by removing 0 7 of the pixels with standard deviation and 1 3 of the pixels with high uncertainty supplementary fig s5 the exclusion of these pixels had only a limited effect on the fluoride hazard map given that the standard deviation was not significant and that the difference in pixels between the maps was located at the class boundaries this behavior is expected as modeling at class boundaries usually shows more discrepancies than within the class features foody 2005 steele et al 1998 by contrast the area of uncertainty where the model was not trained with these environments is highly concentrated in the south of the country where almost no fluoride hazard was modeled 4 4 estimation of the at risk population ghana faces a major challenge in providing drinking water to its most at risk population as the northeastern part of the country which has the highest exposure to fluoride contamination also contains a greater proportion of the national population of children aged 0 9 years see supplementary fig s6 districts in the northern region have the largest exposed population fig 6 though the exposure varies significantly in districts such as gushiegu karaga and mion approximately 4 out of 10 children are potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that can affect their health the savelugu nanton district has the largest exposed child population of about 19 000 children followed by the karaga district with about 17 000 children in total an estimated 920 000 people are potentially exposed in ghana fig 5 the northeastern part of the country has the highest proportion of the rural population and therefore the highest dependency on groundwater who unicef joint monitoring program jmp 2019 furthermore this area and particularly the northern region has a poverty level close to 50 of the population and this level unlike in other regions of ghana has not been reduced in recent decades unicef 2016 children and adults must also often deal with psychological problems stemming from the social stigma of having teeth with fluorosis castilho 2009 dongzagla et al 2019 of note ghana conducted a census in 2021 such that the number of at risk people can be updated when this new information becomes available regardless new spatially disaggregated population databases would increasingly help to identify risk groups rather than considering the population as a whole this will provide a better understanding of the spatial patterns of the distribution and characteristics of these at risk populations thereby allowing the provision of information at more relevant administrative scales 4 5 applicability the hazard and risk maps are at a scale that can serve the authorities as a basis for more detailed research on water quality in ghana priority areas for further investigation and possible mitigation could be determined in part for example by the list of districts with a higher presence of young children potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that can harm their health fig 6 or by the identification of fluoride hazard areas fig 4 the results highlight not only hotspots of fluoride contamination and potentially exposed populations but also data gaps both the modeling approach and the choice of variables can serve as a basis for studying groundwater quality in other areas outside of ghana furthermore the spatial approach for model validation should be relevant to other machine learning applications that are conducted in a spatial context 5 conclusions we present the first hazard map of fluoride in groundwater resources throughout ghana which was produced by geospatially modeling the fluoride concentration using a random forest machine learning algorithm the northeastern part of the country consistently exceeds a fluoride concentration of 1 0 mg l in groundwater although the southern part of the country has a very low probability of reaching this concentration a better and broader distribution of sampling data would be needed to confirm these results refine the model and create a more accurate model of contamination we also identified that approximately 240 000 children and 680 000 adults are potentially exposed to levels of fluoride that may affect their health an important point to be stressed is that the majority of the child population is located in the north of the country where a higher probability exists for exposure to high fluoride levels in groundwater this region of ghana has a greater reliance on groundwater as well as the poorest population therefore these concerns highlight the challenges the country faces in protecting its at risk population a remaining question is to what extent the expected increase in aridity in the northern region might affect fluoride concentrations overall climate change is expected to make water scarcer and as a result increase fluoride concentrations in this area which would force people to seek unsafe drinking water sources we have reduced the effect of spatial dependencies in the training and testing data by evaluating model performance through spatial cross validation thereby avoiding overly optimistic results using the area of applicability has allowed us to identify areas with greater confidence in the prediction partial dependence plots depict the relationships between variables and the probability of high fluoride contamination these techniques assist the validation and interpretation of otherwise black box models overall the model created here is a valuable resource for estimating the presence and absence of fluoride contamination throughout ghana particularly in areas without widespread well testing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16272,the distribution and fate of contaminants of emerging concern cecs was studied in relation to hydrological conditions land use characteristics and spatial contiguity in houxi river thirty four cecs were detected in the surface water during a three year sampling campaign caffeine was most prevalent 99 frequency while bisphenol a had the highest median concentration 78 2 ng l among the detected cecs caffeine and the other prevalent cecs lincomycin and bisphenol a with median concentrations of 3 89 ng l 0 26 ng l and 78 2 ng l respectively were positively correlated with land use types related to anthropogenic activities grass barren built up and cropland areas and landscape indexes for human activities the analysis of similarities revealed significant annual variations with increasing trends in both the concentrations and detection frequencies of cecs spatial variations were demonstrated by higher concentrations and detection frequencies downstream compared to upstream the singular value decomposition analysis revealed that the downstream sites were the major contributors 55 6 100 to the spatial variability of most cecs moran s i analysis based on downstream contiguity indicated strong spatial autocorrelation among the connected sites for most cecs this was further supported by longer correlation lengths for 18 cecs than the average distance between the sampling sites the spatial autocorrelation can be attributed to the physicochemical properties of cecs and local hydrological dynamics including temperature wind speed and sunshine hours for most cecs local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with an average value of 75 5 the results of this study provide new insight to evaluate cec distributions which will be beneficial to policymakers for the management and prioritization of cec contaminants in the houxi watershed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cecs antibiotics surface water svd local contribution land use 1 introduction urbanization has a strong positive association with the use of personal care medical and cosmetic products to improve living standards and quality of life resulting in the environmental discharge of the contaminants of emerging concern cecs consequently cecs have been reported worldwide in countries including spain zhao et al 2015 pakistan ashfaq et al 2019 japan nakada et al 2007 china w w wang et al 2018 and brazil pompei et al 2019 cecs are frequently detected in various environmental systems including surface water sun et al 2016b drinking water qiao et al 2011 wastewater sludge and suspended solids y y wang et al 2018 great attention has been paid to cecs due to their potential negative effects on the health of humans and other organisms brausch and rand 2011 kim et al 2009 including endocrine disruption subedi et al 2015 the spread of antibiotic resistance genes schoenfuss et al 2016 and ecological disruption adyari et al 2020 hu et al 2020 2017 such as altering ecological interactions and processes or altering relationships among organisms richmond et al 2017 river water is an important source of drinking water the frequent detection of cecs in river water indicates that there is a need to better investigate their distribution and transport in the river water environment previous studies have indicated that cec pollution is more seriously influenced by anthropogenic activities in urban rivers compared to rivers in rural areas b b ma et al 2017 r r ma et al 2017 mei et al 2018 and the concentrations of cecs have increased with the expansion of urbanization chen et al 2012 sun et al 2016a however most sampling campaigns bai et al 2018 jaffrézic et al 2017 have been conducted within a limited time period and focused on the temporal variations between seasons cui et al 2019 hong et al 2018 there is a knowledge gap on the annual variations of cecs in river water various statistical tools have been applied to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors this is achieved by reducing the data dimensionality to identify the major factors responsible for such variability principal component analysis pca karpuzcu et al 2014 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds peng et al 2020 and analysis of similarities anosim peng et al 2020 are among the most widely used multivariate statistical tools to investigate spatial variations in environmental components these methods highlight spatial and temporal variability on the basis of a small number of uncorrelated variables chounlamany et al 2017 but do not provide the relative contributions of different sites to the spatial variability recently the singular value decomposition svd was used to calculate the relative contributions of spatial sites to the distribution of environmental and phytoplankton community composition variables sabater liesa et al 2018 pca can be utilized to describe the main spatial variance of cecs in sampling sites while svd is able to quantify the site contributions to the variability of cec concentrations in the watershed few studies have combined pca with svd to reveal the spatial structure of cecs in watersheds both pca analysis and svd analysis have attributes that can be used to explain the different dimensions of spatial variability which can then be utilized for cec regulation through focusing on particular sites with predominant contributions therefore the application of the combination of pca and svd to investigate the spatial distribution and structural pattern of cecs can be useful in developing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial perspective of environmental cec analysis in river systems upstream pollutants can influence downstream sites however most studies have focused on the spatial distribution of contaminants without considering the spatial influences in the direction of river flow w w wang et al 2018 and underestimate the spatial autocorrelation which can be applied to evaluate the spatial dependence on cecs over time chang 2008 as an alternative moran s index moran s i explores the spatial autocorrelation of environmental factors and contaminants regarding the spatial sites in the river with the consideration of river flow ginebreda et al 2018 sabater liesa et al 2018 recently moran s i was used to evaluate the impact of spatial influences on the distribution of cecs in downstream sites of a river ginebreda et al 2018 to justify the spatial influences correlation length was used as an estimate of the maximum distance at which a contaminant could influence its neighbor site and the local or neighbor contribution to contamination sources was elucidated ginebreda et al 2018 generally the local hydrological and meteorological dynamics such as water temperature wind speed and sunshine hours might affect cec distributions by influencing their natural attenuations via biodegradation freese et al 2006 and photodegradation batchu 2013 and may consequently alter their spatial autocorrelation in addition the physicochemical properties of cecs such as n octanol water partition constant pka or solid liquid distribution coefficient kd may also influence the cec distribution in the adsorbed and dissolved phases tong et al 2009 and the hydrolysis of cecs consequently changing their occurrence and spatial autocorrelation nevertheless the local environmental factors and the compound physicochemical properties have been considered in few spatial autocorrelation analyses houxi river is a very suitable site for the investigation of the occurrence fate distribution and spatial autocorrelation of cecs there were four objectives in this study to monitor the occurrence spatial and temporal variations of cecs in the houxi river over three consecutive years to explore the relationship between cecs and land use characteristics to quantify the spatial autocorrelation and correlation length of each cec along the river and to predict the factors responsible for the variability and to assess the contributions of local and neighbor sources to the cec contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

and stored at 20 c before instrumental analysis sun et al 2016b the whole sample preparation procedure was completed within 48 h the information about kd determination was listed in text s1 the instrumental analysis of cecs was achieved by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms abi sciex 6500 qtrap usa consisting of a shimadzu lc system lc 30a coupled to abi 6500 triple

characteristic precursor ion product ion transition pairs of each cec were selected in mrm mode rashid et al 2020 the quantification of each cec was conducted by the external standard method for each sampling batch an instrumental blank procedural blank sample repetition blank spike and matrix spike were applied all instrumental and procedural blanks were below the method detection limits mqls additionally the blank recovery matrix recovery method detection limits mdls and mqls of different cecs in the houxi river watershed are given in table s1 the information on qa qc is presented in text s2 2 3 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis was applied to investigate the cec characteristics in the whole watershed the spatial structure analysis of cecs among sampling sites was explored by singular value decomposition svd moran s i correlation lengths and neighbor and local contributions were applied to evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of cecs all calculations for spatial analysis were carried out by using excel microsoft 2 3 1 multivariate statistical analysis the temporal variations of each cec concentration among three years were investigated by one way anova to obtain the degree of separation r among different groups of the differences of all detected cecs across longitudinal river sections and during three years the analysis of similarities anosim based on euclidean distance was applied by past v 4 02 the r values ranged between 0 and 1 with r 0 representing no separation and r 1 representing complete separation among groups principal component analysis pca was performed on log transformed data to explore the variations of cec concentrations and on binary data for detection frequency the value was marked as 1 or 0 if a cec was detected or not detected of cecs at 10 sampling sites during 2017 2019 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between cecs and landscape characteristics in r studio version 4 0 2 the corrplot package was used to perform the significance test with the p value adjusted by the false discovery rate fdr method to reduce the false positive results while achieving the visualization of the correlation matrix 2 3 2 spatial structure analysis the spatial structure difference of the diverse cecs in the houxi river was analyzed by svd rectangular matrix m composed of m columns indicating sampling sites and n rows indicating the number of sampling campaigns was decomposed into a product of three matrices m u σ v t by eigenvalue for the interpretation of data structure the matrix u σ vt were calculated by an online svd calculator online numerical calculators 2020 as the singular values of the m matrix the diagonal components σ i of the vt matrix were used to calculate the contribution of each sampling site i to the whole spatial variability during three years according to the previous study sabater liesa et al 2018 2 3 3 river network and spatial correlation contiguity matrix was applied to capture the spatial autocorrelation of ten interconnected nodes i e sampling sites in the houxi river ginebreda et al 2018 the sites were presented by the adjacency matrix a defined as aij 1 if nodes i and j are connected aij 0 if nodes i and j are not neighbors or i j due to the asymmetrical nature of the river flow the dissolved cecs flow in the direction of river flow the adjacency matrix a was assumed to be lower triangular hence for spatial autocorrelation analysis moran s i asymmetric adjacency matrix a was applied as 1 2 at a with row standardization moran s index moran s i was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the exploratory variable by using eq 1 1 moran s i n i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i μ x j μ i 1 n j 1 n a ij i 1 n x i μ 2 where xi is the observation of variable x at site i μ is its mean and n is the number of all sampling sites in houxi river moran s i was conveniently calculated by using eq 2 2 moran s i i j a ij z i z j z t a z where z x μ σ x standardized a is a normalized version of a so that a ij a ij ij a ij and ij a ij 1 the expected moran s i value is used by the expression 1 n 1 n number of sites for the null hypothesis 2 3 4 correlation length correlation length l is identified as the distance threshold beyond which a site no longer has any influence on subsequent neighboring sites the correlation length for each selected cec was estimated from the linear fit of local moran s i as a function of the topological distance taking it as the intercept with the x axis furthermore the topological distance value of intercept along the x axis was approximately converted to geographical distance by multiplying with the mean separation distance 2 24 km between connected sites ginebreda et al 2018 this was achieved by using eq 3 and eq 4 sequentially 3 moran s i a t b 4 l b a d where t is the topological distance d is the average distance between sampling sites the a and b can be attained from the linear fit of local moran s i as a function of the topological distance 2 3 5 quantifying neighbor vs local contributions the relative contribution of the connected upstream site and the local effect sources sink in cec contamination was measured for river topology sabater liesa et al 2018 quantitative estimations of the overall neighbor influence and the local contributions for the cec concentrations can be calculated by using eq 5 5 1 ρ x t axe x t x x t ε x t x ρ x t a x x t x and x t ε x t x provide quantitative estimations for the overall neighbor influence and the local contributions for the cec concentrations in the houxi river respectively where a is the above mentioned adjacency matrix x is an n dimension vector n number of sampling sites of the cec concentrations ε is an n dimension vector used to reflect the local effects of individual cec at each sampling site and ρ is a coupling constant coefficient determined by moran s i for computational simplicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 status of cecs in houxi river the concentration ranges and detection frequencies of cecs in the houxi river watershed are listed in table 1 in all 34 cecs were detected in the surface water of houxi river caffeine and benzophenone 3 showed the highest detection frequency with values of 99 and 93 respectively ten additional cecs namely crotamiton diazepam levofloxacin lincomycin miconazole ofloxacin trimethoprim bisphenol a diclofenac and propyl paraben were detected in more than 50 of 116 samples bisphenol a was the most abundant cec with a maximum concentration of up to 10 300 ng l s8 spring 2019 and a median concentration of 78 2 ng l the antibiotics also raised high concern due to their frequent detection and high concentrations for example the maximum concentrations of lincomycin and ofloxacin reached 432 ng l s8 autumn 2019 and 253 ng l s6 spring 2019 respectively with median values of below limit of detection bld and 1 18 ng l respectively cecs could disrupt the microbial structure even at low concentrations adyari et al 2020 3 2 relationship between cecs and land use characteristics the forest land use type accounted for 74 85 of the total land at the upstream site decreasing to 40 and 42 at s8 and s10 respectively where the highest percentages for the built up land use type were observed 21 and 23 respectively with high detection frequencies and concentrations seven cecs were selected to explore their relationships with land use type and landscape index presented in fig 2 notably the cec concentrations were mainly correlated with forest cropland built up barren and grass land use types the ratio of forest area is significantly negatively correlated with lincomycin and bisphenol a indicating the relatively low cec pollution in the forest area caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a had relatively strong positive relationships with most of the cropland built up barren and grass land use types which were closely associated with human activities similar results were also found in previous research tang et al 2021 investigated cec distributions in peri urban and urban watersheds and found that cec concentrations in the urban watershed were higher than those in the less urbanized watershed and cec concentrations were positively correlated with population density hong et al 2018 indicated that higher cec concentrations were observed from highly urbanized areas in addition fairbairn s study emphasized that land use could affect instream concentrations and loadings of cecs fairbairn et al 2016 noticeably the concentrations of caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a had strong positive relationships with patch density and shannon s diversity index which are the landscape indexes for the spatial heterogeneity and diversity of different land use types positively correlating with human activities lower patch density and shannon s diversity index values indicated that there was lower pressure due to anthropogenic activity and that the watershed had better purification ability the concentrations of caffeine and lincomycin were positively correlated with the location weighted landscape index which indicated the discharge of non point source pollutants such as precipitation and runoff additionally caffeine had the strongest positive relationships with cropland built up barren and grass areas and could be selected as the indicator of anthropogenic influence in the houxi river watershed due to its frequent occurrence in domestic raw wastewater discharge the strong relationship between caffeine and most landscape indexes shdi lwlid lwlie and lwli also revealed the strong influence of human activities on the watershed high landscape indexes could reflect the poor purification of cecs in the watershed 3 3 annual variations based on anosim both the detection frequencies r 0 290 p 0 0001 n 116 and detected concentrations r 0 163 p 0 0001 n 116 showed significant annual differences as they could be agglomerated into separate groups from 2017 to 2019 using pca fig s1a and fig s1b the detection frequencies in 2018 had a slightly different tendency from those in 2017 and 2019 which was mainly caused by lower detection frequencies of propyphenazone sulfachloropyridazine thiabendazole metoprolol acid bisphenol s methyl paraben and triclosan table 1 in addition a higher detection frequency was observed in 2019 for most cecs including flumequine lomefloxacin levofloxacin ofloxacin sulfachloropyridazine sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole enzacamene caffeine diazepam metoprolol metoprolol acid miconazole propyphenazone thiabendazole trimethoprim bisphenol a bisphenol af propyl paraben and triclosan table 1 for the detected concentrations 10 cecs showed significantly higher levels in 2019 including ibuprofen enzacamene propyl paraben diclofenac diazepam bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole levofloxacin sulfachloropyridazine and ofloxacin fig 3 the increasing pattern of both detection frequencies and concentrations in the houxi river watershed indicated the growing problems caused by cec pollution the increase of built up land area in houxi watershed has been observed zhu et al 2019 indicating the increasing anthropogenic influence on the river which has resulted in an increasing pattern of rising cec pollution qian et al 2021 also noticed the increased anthropogenic effects on the houxi watershed additionally a similar increasing pattern of triclosan and triclocarban was observed in the jiulong river in southeastern china lv et al 2014 3 4 spatial variations cec concentrations in the houxi river showed significant spatial variations between upstream and downstream sites r 0 411 p 0 0001 anosim the ranges and medians of 34 cec concentrations and detection frequencies from both upstream and downstream sites are shown in table s3 and the results of anosim are shown in table s4 pca indicated that the cec concentrations in the fully urbanized areas s8 10 with considerably more intensive human activities were completely separated from all upstream sites s1 s5 which had little anthropogenic activity pressure however the peri urbanized areas s6 and s7 slightly overlapped with the upstream sites fig s2 generally the downstream cec concentrations were much higher than upstream concentrations as shown in fig 4 and fig s3 for example the median concentrations of caffeine lincomycin and acetaminophen were 17 8 ng l 59 55 ng l and 6 43 ng l downstream respectively while they were 1 32 ng l bld and bld upstream respectively the concentrations of caffeine crotamiton lincomycin metoprolol ofloxacin acetaminophen propyphenazone sulfadiazine thiabendazole trimethoprim metoprolol acid and bisphenol a at s6 s10 were all higher than those at s1 s5 notably the acetaminophen and caffeine concentrations increased from those in s6 which might be attributed to the discharge of domestic raw water sun et al 2016b in this peri urban area the contribution of each sampling site to the cec spatial variability was calculated as described in section 2 3 1 fig 5 generally the downstream sites were the main contributors to the spatial variability 55 6 100 of the most cecs such as caffeine 94 1 and metoprolol 99 7 in detail the spatial variability of indomethacin 35 2 and levofloxacin 41 2 was mainly contributed by s8 while the spatial variability of caffeine 39 9 diazepam 53 5 lincomycin 59 1 sulfadiazine 47 6 sulfapyridine 38 1 and bisphenol a 31 6 was mainly contributed by s9 s10 was the predominant contributor to the variability of sulfapyridine 46 6 sulfathiazole 67 5 and metoprolol acid 57 4 the cec usage patterns at sampling sites may have varied greatly during the three years studied however relatively even contributions from each sampling site were observed in the spatial variability of enzacamene flumequine lomefloxacin oxytetracycline diclofenac ibuprofen methyl paraben propyl paraben and triclosan indicating their stable usage patterns 3 5 spatial autocorrelation and connectivity considering the direction of river flow the river network contiguity matrix was applied and spatial autocorrelation among all sampling sites was calculated as moran s i for each cec fig 6 generally the moran s i of most cecs was positive which indicated a similar spatial pattern of cec distribution among the connected sampling sites with moran s i as autocorrelation parameter ρ the correlation length was calculated for each cec ginebreda et al 2018 the current network resolution was adequately clear for monitoring the 27 cecs with positive ρ values and all correlation lengths were beyond the separation of sites suggesting that they could be used to predict the influences of these cecs downstream ginebreda et al 2018 however with ρ 0 the downstream influences of seven cecs could not be predicted including enzacamene flumequine levofloxacin miconazole ofloxacin sulfathiazole and bisphenol af generally the correlation lengths of 9 cecs were below 25 km river length indicating their efficient natural attenuation along the river however the input of the other 18 cecs with correlation lengths longer than the river length might raise more risk concerns for the receiving coastal water as shown in fig s4 correlation length was positively correlated with moran s i p 0 001 indicating that a higher moran s i value of the cec implied a stronger spatial autocorrelation and more influence downstream thus more attention should be paid to cecs with high moran s i value which may have more influence on the river system the results would be helpful in prioritizing the cec pollutants in the houxi watershed moran s i fig 7 was significantly correlated with the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd log transformed a compound with a low log kd value was more likely to have a high moran s i value which indicated its strong spatial autocorrelation and longer correlation length fig 7 for example low log kd values of metoprolol and lincomycin 1 54 and 2 57 respectively indicated their tendency to dissolve in the water these cecs had strong spatial autocorrelations with moran s i of 0 82 and 0 66 respectively with correlation lengths of 53 km and 41 km respectively in contrast a high log kd value of a compound such as lomefloxacin and miconazole at 1 84 and 0 71 respectively could indicate their tendency to be adsorbed on suspended solids thereby leading to the potential risk to the sediment resulting in the spatial dissimilarities 0 012 and 0 28 respectively of dissolved lomefloxacin and miconazole among the connecting sites in addition the natural attenuation of cecs in the river water including biodegradation photodegradation and hydrolysis could also reduce the spatial autocorrelation as the water flowed from upstream to downstream benotti and brownawell 2007 in addition to the cec physicochemical properties local weather conditions and hydrological dynamics might also govern the spatial autocorrelation of the dissolved cecs ginebreda et al 2018 the strong wind in october table s5 caused fluctuations in the river water which might have promoted the dissolved cecs to be adsorbed by suspended solids and sediments decreasing cec spatial autocorrelation fig s5 in addition the lower water temperature in january inhibited microbial activity and reduced the cec biodegradation freese et al 2006 the lower solar radiation intensity and duration in january reduced the photodegradation of photo sensitive cecs batchu 2013 such as sulfamethoxazole which tended to have stronger spatial autocorrelation in january than in other months fig s6 consequently more cecs might have transferred with water flow and significantly increased the spatial autocorrelation in january fig s6 3 6 neighbor and local contributions the contributions of neighbor and local sources were calculated by eq 5 for the monitored cecs local and neighbor contributions for different cecs during sampling seasons are presented in fig s7 seasonal variations of local contribution were observed for some cecs such as caffeine and trimethoprim in july and october the neighbor contributions for caffeine were higher than in january and april which might be attributed to its low biodegradation under relatively low temperatures notably the main contributor of trimethoprim was the neighbor influence in april with a contribution of 62 5 to 88 6 however the local contribution was dominant in other sampling seasons as shown in fig 8 for most cecs the local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with a range of 28 9 100 and an average value of 75 5 local contribution was the major source for most antibiotics including flumequine lomefloxacin levofloxacin metronidazole ofloxacin sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole with the lowest contribution of 88 4 for metronidazole however neighbor sites also had non negligible influences on lincomycin 50 2 oxytetracycline 31 5 sulfachloropyridazine 39 7 sulfadiazine 43 7 and sulfamethoxazole 21 4 which might attribute to their long correlation length 41 km 39 km 39 km 36 km and 25 km respectively as a result their concentrations were strongly influenced by pollutants at upstream sites the local sources accounted for some analgesic pollutions such as indomethacin 78 2 acetaminophen 87 3 diclofenac 90 6 and ibuprofen 73 5 while the propyphenazone 55 3 was mainly dominated by neighbor influence this finding indicated that even for compounds that belonged to the same classes the pattern of local and neighbor contributions was different rapid urbanization may cause the intensive discharge of cecs resulting in the local contribution of cecs to the river 4 conclusions thirty four cecs were detected in surface water samples from the houxi river watershed during 2017 2019 benzophenone 3 caffeine ofloxacin and trimethoprim were frequently detected with the concentration ranges of bld 215 ng l bld 280 ng l bld 253 ng l and bld 189 ng l respectively caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a showed positive relationships with the land use types connected closely with human activities annual increasing trends and spatial variations of cec detection frequencies and concentrations were observed lower cec contamination was observed in the upstream sites compared with the downstream sites for most cecs the result of svd revealed the contribution of the sampling sites to the spatial variability of cec concentrations in the river river flow direction and its influence downstream were considered in the adjacency matrix used in moran s i calculation of which the values indicated the spatial autocorrelation of cecs among the connected sampling sites the correlation lengths of 18 cecs were longer than the river length which indicated their limited natural attenuation and the potential risks to the receiving water both the compound physicochemical properties and the local hydrological dynamics affected the spatial autocorrelation and correlation length of cecs in the river for most cecs local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with an average value of 75

16272,the distribution and fate of contaminants of emerging concern cecs was studied in relation to hydrological conditions land use characteristics and spatial contiguity in houxi river thirty four cecs were detected in the surface water during a three year sampling campaign caffeine was most prevalent 99 frequency while bisphenol a had the highest median concentration 78 2 ng l among the detected cecs caffeine and the other prevalent cecs lincomycin and bisphenol a with median concentrations of 3 89 ng l 0 26 ng l and 78 2 ng l respectively were positively correlated with land use types related to anthropogenic activities grass barren built up and cropland areas and landscape indexes for human activities the analysis of similarities revealed significant annual variations with increasing trends in both the concentrations and detection frequencies of cecs spatial variations were demonstrated by higher concentrations and detection frequencies downstream compared to upstream the singular value decomposition analysis revealed that the downstream sites were the major contributors 55 6 100 to the spatial variability of most cecs moran s i analysis based on downstream contiguity indicated strong spatial autocorrelation among the connected sites for most cecs this was further supported by longer correlation lengths for 18 cecs than the average distance between the sampling sites the spatial autocorrelation can be attributed to the physicochemical properties of cecs and local hydrological dynamics including temperature wind speed and sunshine hours for most cecs local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with an average value of 75 5 the results of this study provide new insight to evaluate cec distributions which will be beneficial to policymakers for the management and prioritization of cec contaminants in the houxi watershed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cecs antibiotics surface water svd local contribution land use 1 introduction urbanization has a strong positive association with the use of personal care medical and cosmetic products to improve living standards and quality of life resulting in the environmental discharge of the contaminants of emerging concern cecs consequently cecs have been reported worldwide in countries including spain zhao et al 2015 pakistan ashfaq et al 2019 japan nakada et al 2007 china w w wang et al 2018 and brazil pompei et al 2019 cecs are frequently detected in various environmental systems including surface water sun et al 2016b drinking water qiao et al 2011 wastewater sludge and suspended solids y y wang et al 2018 great attention has been paid to cecs due to their potential negative effects on the health of humans and other organisms brausch and rand 2011 kim et al 2009 including endocrine disruption subedi et al 2015 the spread of antibiotic resistance genes schoenfuss et al 2016 and ecological disruption adyari et al 2020 hu et al 2020 2017 such as altering ecological interactions and processes or altering relationships among organisms richmond et al 2017 river water is an important source of drinking water the frequent detection of cecs in river water indicates that there is a need to better investigate their distribution and transport in the river water environment previous studies have indicated that cec pollution is more seriously influenced by anthropogenic activities in urban rivers compared to rivers in rural areas b b ma et al 2017 r r ma et al 2017 mei et al 2018 and the concentrations of cecs have increased with the expansion of urbanization chen et al 2012 sun et al 2016a however most sampling campaigns bai et al 2018 jaffrézic et al 2017 have been conducted within a limited time period and focused on the temporal variations between seasons cui et al 2019 hong et al 2018 there is a knowledge gap on the annual variations of cecs in river water various statistical tools have been applied to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors this is achieved by reducing the data dimensionality to identify the major factors responsible for such variability principal component analysis pca karpuzcu et al 2014 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds peng et al 2020 and analysis of similarities anosim peng et al 2020 are among the most widely used multivariate statistical tools to investigate spatial variations in environmental components these methods highlight spatial and temporal variability on the basis of a small number of uncorrelated variables chounlamany et al 2017 but do not provide the relative contributions of different sites to the spatial variability recently the singular value decomposition svd was used to calculate the relative contributions of spatial sites to the distribution of environmental and phytoplankton community composition variables sabater liesa et al 2018 pca can be utilized to describe the main spatial variance of cecs in sampling sites while svd is able to quantify the site contributions to the variability of cec concentrations in the watershed few studies have combined pca with svd to reveal the spatial structure of cecs in watersheds both pca analysis and svd analysis have attributes that can be used to explain the different dimensions of spatial variability which can then be utilized for cec regulation through focusing on particular sites with predominant contributions therefore the application of the combination of pca and svd to investigate the spatial distribution and structural pattern of cecs can be useful in developing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial perspective of environmental cec analysis in river systems upstream pollutants can influence downstream sites however most studies have focused on the spatial distribution of contaminants without considering the spatial influences in the direction of river flow w w wang et al 2018 and underestimate the spatial autocorrelation which can be applied to evaluate the spatial dependence on cecs over time chang 2008 as an alternative moran s index moran s i explores the spatial autocorrelation of environmental factors and contaminants regarding the spatial sites in the river with the consideration of river flow ginebreda et al 2018 sabater liesa et al 2018 recently moran s i was used to evaluate the impact of spatial influences on the distribution of cecs in downstream sites of a river ginebreda et al 2018 to justify the spatial influences correlation length was used as an estimate of the maximum distance at which a contaminant could influence its neighbor site and the local or neighbor contribution to contamination sources was elucidated ginebreda et al 2018 generally the local hydrological and meteorological dynamics such as water temperature wind speed and sunshine hours might affect cec distributions by influencing their natural attenuations via biodegradation freese et al 2006 and photodegradation batchu 2013 and may consequently alter their spatial autocorrelation in addition the physicochemical properties of cecs such as n octanol water partition constant pka or solid liquid distribution coefficient kd may also influence the cec distribution in the adsorbed and dissolved phases tong et al 2009 and the hydrolysis of cecs consequently changing their occurrence and spatial autocorrelation nevertheless the local environmental factors and the compound physicochemical properties have been considered in few spatial autocorrelation analyses houxi river is a very suitable site for the investigation of the occurrence fate distribution and spatial autocorrelation of cecs there were four objectives in this study to monitor the occurrence spatial and temporal variations of cecs in the houxi river over three consecutive years to explore the relationship between cecs and land use characteristics to quantify the spatial autocorrelation and correlation length of each cec along the river and to predict the factors responsible for the variability and to assess the contributions of local and neighbor sources to the cec contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling houxi river is a subtropical river in southeast china with a river length of 25 km the houxi river watershed consists of a drainage area of 205 km2 located in southeastern china 24 34 24 46 n 117 55 118 7 e peng et al 2020 due to the rapid urbanization of xiamen city houxi river has undergone a strong impact of human activities for twenty years due to the typical characteristic of an urbanizing river that originates from a rural area and flows through an urban area isabwe et al 2019 houxi river is an ideal system for deeply understanding the influence of human activities on cec behaviors at the watershed scale ten sampling sites s1 s10 were selected along the river in this study fig 1 s1 is the headwater s2 s3 and s4 s5 are from separated reservoirs which are the drinking water conservation areas the upstream section s1 s5 is under less pressure from anthropogenic activities compared to the downstream section as s6 s8 is located in the peri urban area and s9 s10 is

amber glass bottles at 4 c in the dark the houxi river system and its watershed boundaries were depicted according to the digital elevation map dem using arcgis 10 4 software seven land use types in the dry season of 2017 including built up land cropland forest grass orchard water and others were identified based on landsat 8 images which were obtained from the data sharing infrastructure of the earth system science in china http www geodata cn the unsupervised and synthetic land use classification were performed by envi 5 1 and arcgis 10 4 respectively every land use category percentage was

and stored at 20 c before instrumental analysis sun et al 2016b the whole sample preparation procedure was completed within 48 h the information about kd determination was listed in text s1 the instrumental analysis of cecs was achieved by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms abi sciex 6500 qtrap usa consisting of a shimadzu lc system lc 30a coupled to abi 6500 triple

table s2 the mass spectrometric measurements were achieved in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode quality assurance and quality control qa qc was conducted for identification the two most abundant characteristic precursor ion product ion transition pairs of each cec were selected in mrm mode rashid et al 2020 the quantification of each cec was conducted by the external standard method for each sampling batch an instrumental blank procedural blank sample repetition blank spike and matrix spike were applied all instrumental and procedural blanks were below the method detection limits mqls additionally the blank recovery matrix recovery method detection limits mdls and mqls of different cecs in the houxi river watershed are given in table s1 the information on qa qc is presented in text s2 2 3 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis was applied to investigate the cec characteristics in the whole watershed the spatial structure analysis of cecs among sampling sites was explored by singular value decomposition svd moran s i correlation lengths and neighbor and local contributions were applied to evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of cecs all calculations for spatial analysis were carried out by using excel microsoft 2 3 1 multivariate statistical analysis the temporal variations of each cec concentration among three years were investigated by one way anova to obtain the degree of separation r among different groups of the differences of all detected cecs across longitudinal river sections and during three years the analysis of similarities anosim based on euclidean distance was applied by past v 4 02 the r values ranged between 0 and 1 with r 0 representing no separation and r 1 representing complete separation among groups principal component analysis pca was performed on log transformed data to explore the variations of cec concentrations and on binary data for detection frequency the value was marked as 1 or 0 if a cec was detected or not detected of cecs at 10 sampling sites during 2017 2019 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between cecs and landscape characteristics in r studio version 4 0 2 the corrplot package was used to perform the significance test with the p value adjusted by the false discovery rate fdr method to reduce the false positive results while achieving the visualization of the correlation matrix 2 3 2 spatial structure analysis the spatial structure difference of the diverse cecs in the houxi river was analyzed by svd rectangular matrix m composed of m columns indicating sampling sites and n rows indicating the number of sampling campaigns was decomposed into a product of three matrices m u σ v t by eigenvalue for the interpretation of data structure the matrix u σ vt were calculated by an online svd calculator online numerical calculators 2020 as the singular values of the m matrix the diagonal components σ i of the vt matrix were used to calculate the contribution of each sampling site i to the whole spatial variability during three years according to the previous study sabater liesa et al 2018 2 3 3 river network and spatial correlation contiguity matrix was applied to capture the spatial autocorrelation of ten interconnected nodes i e sampling sites in the houxi river ginebreda et al 2018 the sites were presented by the adjacency matrix a defined as aij 1 if nodes i and j are connected aij 0 if nodes i and j are not neighbors or i j due to the asymmetrical nature of the river flow the dissolved cecs flow in the direction of river flow the adjacency matrix a was assumed to be lower triangular hence for spatial autocorrelation analysis moran s i asymmetric adjacency matrix a was applied as 1 2 at a with row standardization moran s index moran s i was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the exploratory variable by using eq 1 1 moran s i n i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i μ x j μ i 1 n j 1 n a ij i 1 n x i μ 2 where xi is the observation of variable x at site i μ is its mean and n is the number of all sampling sites in houxi river moran s i was conveniently calculated by using eq 2 2 moran s i i j a ij z i z j z t a z where z x μ σ x standardized a is a normalized version of a so that a ij a ij ij a ij and ij a ij 1 the expected moran s i value is used by the expression 1 n 1 n number of sites for the null hypothesis 2 3 4 correlation length correlation length l is identified as the distance threshold beyond which a site no longer has any influence on subsequent neighboring sites the correlation length for each selected cec was estimated from the linear fit of local moran s i as a function of the topological distance taking it as the intercept with the x axis furthermore the topological distance value of intercept along the x axis was approximately converted to geographical distance by multiplying with the mean separation distance 2 24 km between connected sites ginebreda et al 2018 this was achieved by using eq 3 and eq 4 sequentially 3 moran s i a t b 4 l b a d where t is the topological distance d is the average distance between sampling sites the a and b can be attained from the linear fit of local moran s i as a function of the topological distance 2 3 5 quantifying neighbor vs local contributions the relative contribution of the connected upstream site and the local effect sources sink in cec contamination was measured for river topology sabater liesa et al 2018 quantitative estimations of the overall neighbor influence and the local contributions for the cec concentrations can be calculated by using eq 5 5 1 ρ x t axe x t x x t ε x t x ρ x t a x x t x and x t ε x t x provide quantitative estimations for the overall neighbor influence and the local contributions for the cec concentrations in the houxi river respectively where a is the above mentioned adjacency matrix x is an n dimension vector n number of sampling sites of the cec concentrations ε is an n dimension vector used to reflect the local effects of individual cec at each sampling site and ρ is a coupling constant coefficient determined by moran s i for computational simplicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 status of cecs in houxi river the concentration ranges and detection frequencies of cecs in the houxi river watershed are listed in table 1 in all 34 cecs were detected in the surface water of houxi river caffeine and benzophenone 3 showed the highest detection frequency with values of 99 and 93 respectively ten additional cecs namely crotamiton diazepam levofloxacin lincomycin miconazole ofloxacin trimethoprim bisphenol a diclofenac and propyl paraben were detected in more than 50 of 116 samples bisphenol a was the most abundant cec with a maximum concentration of up to 10 300 ng l s8 spring 2019 and a median concentration of 78 2 ng l the antibiotics also raised high concern due to their frequent detection and high concentrations for example the maximum concentrations of lincomycin and ofloxacin reached 432 ng l s8 autumn 2019 and 253 ng l s6 spring 2019 respectively with median values of below limit of detection bld and 1 18 ng l respectively cecs could disrupt the microbial structure even at low concentrations adyari et al 2020 3 2 relationship between cecs and land use characteristics the forest land use type accounted for 74 85 of the total land at the upstream site decreasing to 40 and 42 at s8 and s10 respectively where the highest percentages for the built up land use type were observed 21 and 23 respectively with high detection frequencies and concentrations seven cecs were selected to explore their relationships with land use type and landscape index presented in fig 2 notably the cec concentrations were mainly correlated with forest cropland built up barren and grass land use types the ratio of forest area is significantly negatively correlated with lincomycin and bisphenol a indicating the relatively low cec pollution in the forest area caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a had relatively strong positive relationships with most of the cropland built up barren and grass land use types which were closely associated with human activities similar results were also found in previous research tang et al 2021 investigated cec distributions in peri urban and urban watersheds and found that cec concentrations in the urban watershed were higher than those in the less urbanized watershed and cec concentrations were positively correlated with population density hong et al 2018 indicated that higher cec concentrations were observed from highly urbanized areas in addition fairbairn s study emphasized that land use could affect instream concentrations and loadings of cecs fairbairn et al 2016 noticeably the concentrations of caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a had strong positive relationships with patch density and shannon s diversity index which are the landscape indexes for the spatial heterogeneity and diversity of different land use types positively correlating with human activities lower patch density and shannon s diversity index values indicated that there was lower pressure due to anthropogenic activity and that the watershed had better purification ability the concentrations of caffeine and lincomycin were positively correlated with the location weighted landscape index which indicated the discharge of non point source pollutants such as precipitation and runoff additionally caffeine had the strongest positive relationships with cropland built up barren and grass areas and could be selected as the indicator of anthropogenic influence in the houxi river watershed due to its frequent occurrence in domestic raw wastewater discharge the strong relationship between caffeine and most landscape indexes shdi lwlid lwlie and lwli also revealed the strong influence of human activities on the watershed high landscape indexes could reflect the poor purification of cecs in the watershed 3 3 annual variations based on anosim both the detection frequencies r 0 290 p 0 0001 n 116 and detected concentrations r 0 163 p 0 0001 n 116 showed significant annual differences as they could be agglomerated into separate groups from 2017 to 2019 using pca fig s1a and fig s1b the detection frequencies in 2018 had a slightly different tendency from those in 2017 and 2019 which was mainly caused by lower detection frequencies of propyphenazone sulfachloropyridazine thiabendazole metoprolol acid bisphenol s methyl paraben and triclosan table 1 in addition a higher detection frequency was observed in 2019 for most cecs including flumequine lomefloxacin levofloxacin ofloxacin sulfachloropyridazine sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole enzacamene caffeine diazepam metoprolol metoprolol acid miconazole propyphenazone thiabendazole trimethoprim bisphenol a bisphenol af propyl paraben and triclosan table 1 for the detected concentrations 10 cecs showed significantly higher levels in 2019 including ibuprofen enzacamene propyl paraben diclofenac diazepam bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole levofloxacin sulfachloropyridazine and ofloxacin fig 3 the increasing pattern of both detection frequencies and concentrations in the houxi river watershed indicated the growing problems caused by cec pollution the increase of built up land area in houxi watershed has been observed zhu et al 2019 indicating the increasing anthropogenic influence on the river which has resulted in an increasing pattern of rising cec pollution qian et al 2021 also noticed the increased anthropogenic effects on the houxi watershed additionally a similar increasing pattern of triclosan and triclocarban was observed in the jiulong river in southeastern china lv et al 2014 3 4 spatial variations cec concentrations in the houxi river showed significant spatial variations between upstream and downstream sites r 0 411 p 0 0001 anosim the ranges and medians of 34 cec concentrations and detection frequencies from both upstream and downstream sites are shown in table s3 and the results of anosim are shown in table s4 pca indicated that the cec concentrations in the fully urbanized areas s8 10 with considerably more intensive human activities were completely separated from all upstream sites s1 s5 which had little anthropogenic activity pressure however the peri urbanized areas s6 and s7 slightly overlapped with the upstream sites fig s2 generally the downstream cec concentrations were much higher than upstream concentrations as shown in fig 4 and fig s3 for example the median concentrations of caffeine lincomycin and acetaminophen were 17 8 ng l 59 55 ng l and 6 43 ng l downstream respectively while they were 1 32 ng l bld and bld upstream respectively the concentrations of caffeine crotamiton lincomycin metoprolol ofloxacin acetaminophen propyphenazone sulfadiazine thiabendazole trimethoprim metoprolol acid and bisphenol a at s6 s10 were all higher than those at s1 s5 notably the acetaminophen and caffeine concentrations increased from those in s6 which might be attributed to the discharge of domestic raw water sun et al 2016b in this peri urban area the contribution of each sampling site to the cec spatial variability was calculated as described in section 2 3 1 fig 5 generally the downstream sites were the main contributors to the spatial variability 55 6 100 of the most cecs such as caffeine 94 1 and metoprolol 99 7 in detail the spatial variability of indomethacin 35 2 and levofloxacin 41 2 was mainly contributed by s8 while the spatial variability of caffeine 39 9 diazepam 53 5 lincomycin 59 1 sulfadiazine 47 6 sulfapyridine 38 1 and bisphenol a 31 6 was mainly contributed by s9 s10 was the predominant contributor to the variability of sulfapyridine 46 6 sulfathiazole 67 5 and metoprolol acid 57 4 the cec usage patterns at sampling sites may have varied greatly during the three years studied however relatively even contributions from each sampling site were observed in the spatial variability of enzacamene flumequine lomefloxacin oxytetracycline diclofenac ibuprofen methyl paraben propyl paraben and triclosan indicating their stable usage patterns 3 5 spatial autocorrelation and connectivity considering the direction of river flow the river network contiguity matrix was applied and spatial autocorrelation among all sampling sites was calculated as moran s i for each cec fig 6 generally the moran s i of most cecs was positive which indicated a similar spatial pattern of cec distribution among the connected sampling sites with moran s i as autocorrelation parameter ρ the correlation length was calculated for each cec ginebreda et al 2018 the current network resolution was adequately clear for monitoring the 27 cecs with positive ρ values and all correlation lengths were beyond the separation of sites suggesting that they could be used to predict the influences of these cecs downstream ginebreda et al 2018 however with ρ 0 the downstream influences of seven cecs could not be predicted including enzacamene flumequine levofloxacin miconazole ofloxacin sulfathiazole and bisphenol af generally the correlation lengths of 9 cecs were below 25 km river length indicating their efficient natural attenuation along the river however the input of the other 18 cecs with correlation lengths longer than the river length might raise more risk concerns for the receiving coastal water as shown in fig s4 correlation length was positively correlated with moran s i p 0 001 indicating that a higher moran s i value of the cec implied a stronger spatial autocorrelation and more influence downstream thus more attention should be paid to cecs with high moran s i value which may have more influence on the river system the results would be helpful in prioritizing the cec pollutants in the houxi watershed moran s i fig 7 was significantly correlated with the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd log transformed a compound with a low log kd value was more likely to have a high moran s i value which indicated its strong spatial autocorrelation and longer correlation length fig 7 for example low log kd values of metoprolol and lincomycin 1 54 and 2 57 respectively indicated their tendency to dissolve in the water these cecs had strong spatial autocorrelations with moran s i of 0 82 and 0 66 respectively with correlation lengths of 53 km and 41 km respectively in contrast a high log kd value of a compound such as lomefloxacin and miconazole at 1 84 and 0 71 respectively could indicate their tendency to be adsorbed on suspended solids thereby leading to the potential risk to the sediment resulting in the spatial dissimilarities 0 012 and 0 28 respectively of dissolved lomefloxacin and miconazole among the connecting sites in addition the natural attenuation of cecs in the river water including biodegradation photodegradation and hydrolysis could also reduce the spatial autocorrelation as the water flowed from upstream to downstream benotti and brownawell 2007 in addition to the cec physicochemical properties local weather conditions and hydrological dynamics might also govern the spatial autocorrelation of the dissolved cecs ginebreda et al 2018 the strong wind in october table s5 caused fluctuations in the river water which might have promoted the dissolved cecs to be adsorbed by suspended solids and sediments decreasing cec spatial autocorrelation fig s5 in addition the lower water temperature in january inhibited microbial activity and reduced the cec biodegradation freese et al 2006 the lower solar radiation intensity and duration in january reduced the photodegradation of photo sensitive cecs batchu 2013 such as sulfamethoxazole which tended to have stronger spatial autocorrelation in january than in other months fig s6 consequently more cecs might have transferred with water flow and significantly increased the spatial autocorrelation in january fig s6 3 6 neighbor and local contributions the contributions of neighbor and local sources were calculated by eq 5 for the monitored cecs local and neighbor contributions for different cecs during sampling seasons are presented in fig s7 seasonal variations of local contribution were observed for some cecs such as caffeine and trimethoprim in july and october the neighbor contributions for caffeine were higher than in january and april which might be attributed to its low biodegradation under relatively low temperatures notably the main contributor of trimethoprim was the neighbor influence in april with a contribution of 62 5 to 88 6 however the local contribution was dominant in other sampling seasons as shown in fig 8 for most cecs the local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with a range of 28 9 100 and an average value of 75 5 local contribution was the major source for most antibiotics including flumequine lomefloxacin levofloxacin metronidazole ofloxacin sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole with the lowest contribution of 88 4 for metronidazole however neighbor sites also had non negligible influences on lincomycin 50 2 oxytetracycline 31 5 sulfachloropyridazine 39 7 sulfadiazine 43 7 and sulfamethoxazole 21 4 which might attribute to their long correlation length 41 km 39 km 39 km 36 km and 25 km respectively as a result their concentrations were strongly influenced by pollutants at upstream sites the local sources accounted for some analgesic pollutions such as indomethacin 78 2 acetaminophen 87 3 diclofenac 90 6 and ibuprofen 73 5 while the propyphenazone 55 3 was mainly dominated by neighbor influence this finding indicated that even for compounds that belonged to the same classes the pattern of local and neighbor contributions was different rapid urbanization may cause the intensive discharge of cecs resulting in the local contribution of cecs to the river 4 conclusions thirty four cecs were detected in surface water samples from the houxi river watershed during 2017 2019 benzophenone 3 caffeine ofloxacin and trimethoprim were frequently detected with the concentration ranges of bld 215 ng l bld 280 ng l bld 253 ng l and bld 189 ng l respectively caffeine lincomycin and bisphenol a showed positive relationships with the land use types connected closely with human activities annual increasing trends and spatial variations of cec detection frequencies and concentrations were observed lower cec contamination was observed in the upstream sites compared with the downstream sites for most cecs the result of svd revealed the contribution of the sampling sites to the spatial variability of cec concentrations in the river river flow direction and its influence downstream were considered in the adjacency matrix used in moran s i calculation of which the values indicated the spatial autocorrelation of cecs among the connected sampling sites the correlation lengths of 18 cecs were longer than the river length which indicated their limited natural attenuation and the potential risks to the receiving water both the compound physicochemical properties and the local hydrological dynamics affected the spatial autocorrelation and correlation length of cecs in the river for most cecs local contribution predominated over neighbor influence with an average value of 75

16273,a new focus on biofiltration has emerged that aims to shape microbial communities to improve treatment efficacy it is therefore necessary to understand the linkages between microbial community structure and biofilter function however the assembly and interaction of microbial communities in biological activated carbon bac filters are unknown in this study we selected one coal based granular activated carbon gac gac 13 with simultaneously developed micropore and micro level macropore volume used for a bench scale bac column experiment and compared it with other coal based gacs and wood based gac in terms of the dissolved organic carbon doc removal and microbial community characteristics the results showed that there was no difference between the doc removal efficiency of bac 13 and the other two coal based bac filters with high iodine value in the period dominated by adsorption while the doc removal efficiency of bac 13 64 7 0 6 was significantly higher than that of other bac filters 36 3 0 8 54 1 0 4 with a difference of 0 3 0 7 mg l in doc during the steady state the bacterial communities were strongly assembled by deterministic rather than stochastic factors where the surface polarity of gac had a greater effect on the microbial communities than its physical properties the corresponding co occurrence network revealed that microbes in the bac filter may be more cooperative than competitive the keystone bacterium hyphomicrobium which had a relatively low abundance contributed 0 3 1 more to the most abundant functions and produced 5 21 proteins g gac more than the dominant bacterium sphingobium the metaproteomic based approach could provide more accurate information regarding the contributions of different species to metabolic functions the pore size distribution of gac was found to be an important factor in determining bac filter performance the most important pore sizes were micropores and micro level macropores 0 2 10 μm and 100 μm in diameter and the latter impacted the abundance of keystone species overall our findings provide new insights into shaping microbial communities by optimizing pore size structure to improve bac performance especially the abundance of keystone species graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofiltration bacterial community assembly co occurrence network metaproteomic analysis pore size distribution keystone species 1 introduction biological activated carbon bac filters can remove a variety of pollutants through activated carbon adsorption and biodegradation cuthbertson et al 2020 including disinfection byproduct precursors mckie et al 2015 ammonium wagner et al 2018 micropollutants lu et al 2019 and metals cerrato et al 2010 the bac process is widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps due to its simplicity effectiveness and economy and in china since 2020 the daily water supply capacity of full scale dwtps with o3 bac has exceeded 40 million m3 d hydraulic loading empty bed contact time basu et al 2016 temperature jantarakasem et al 2020 backwashing korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 media type emelko et al 2006 and oxidant residuals lohwacharin et al 2015 are important design and operational parameters affecting bac performance the key operational practices of biofilters are different from those of conventional filters by promoting and maintaining biological activity on the filter material the conversion of organic and inorganic components could be increased kirisits et al 2019 biodegradation capacity is mainly affected by biomass microbial community structure and microbial growth rate gagnon and huck 2001 lazarova and manem 1995 oh et al 2018 some studies have shown that the quantity or activity of the biomass remained essentially constant after running bac for a long time however biomass was not the decisive factor affecting the bac performance in terms of organic matter removal boon et al 2011 lu et al 2020 pharand et al 2015 and the effect of the microbial community was greater than that of biomass gagnon and huck 2001 oh et al 2018 ross et al 2019 recently the focus of biofiltration research has shifted from development of design and operational strategies to customizing microbial communities for further enhancements in performance kirisits et al 2019 peterson and summers 2021 e g bioaugmentation albers et al 2018 and supplementation of limiting nutrients keithley and kirisits 2019 therefore it is critical to understand how the structure function and dynamics of the microbial communities contribute to bac process and how they can be shaped to improve treatment efficacy some studies have investigated the microbial community structure and function in bac filters han et al 2013 li et al 2017 liao et al 2013 oh et al 2018 xiang et al 2013 however little is known about the microbial community assembly and the interaction between species in bac filters in microbial community construction and diversity maintenance there are two distinct theories that determine microbial community assembly i e the traditional niche based theory ramette and tiedje 2007 and the unified neutral theory hubbell 2005 according to traditional niche based theory the microbial community structure is shaped mainly by deterministic factors such as competition and niche differentiation sloan et al 2006 creating a strong link between microbial composition and the environment in which they grow chen et al 2021 ofiţeru et al 2010 the controversial neutral theory identifies stochastic factors as the main drivers of microbial community assembly such as death birth immigration and speciation hubbell 2005 the neutral community model ncm was used to describe how much of the variation in the microbial communities could be determined by neutral stochastic process in one study ncm explained a large fraction of the community variation in the river chen et al 2019a vignola et al 2018 indicated that the filter medium is a deterministic factor that can drive the assembly of microbial communities in a laboratory scale filter filled with quartz sand and granular activation carbon gac the structure of microbial communities in gac biofilters has been reported to differ from that in sand biofilters gerrity et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 microbial co occurrence networks using random matrix theory rmt have recently been used not only to reveal interactions between species in a variety of environments such as soils zheng et al 2021 and activated sludge sun et al 2021 but also to identify putative keystone taxa that are important for maintaining the functional stability of systems ya et al 2021 keystone taxa are highly connected taxa that exert a crucial influence on microbial community structure and function irrespective of their abundance across space and time and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbiome function and ecosystem processes banerjee et al 2018 microorganisms play key roles in ensuring the long term stable operation of bac lu et al 2020 sharaf and liu 2021 however to the best our knowledge there are no reports on the putative keystone taxa and interactions between dominant taxa and keystone taxa in bac filters this limits our understanding of the mechanisms between microbial community structure and bac filter function gac as the colonization site of microorganisms promotes microbial attachment and biofilm formation on its rough surface the porous structures surface chemistries carbon ages and particle size of gac affect microbial community composition du et al 2020 lu et al 2021 mercier et al 2014 in our previous study it was speculated that the gac micro level macropores a 0 2 10 μm in diameter and micro level macropores b 100 μm could affect bac performance and may play an equally important role as micropores 2 nm this leads to the question of whether the pore size distribution of gac can be adjusted to improve bac performance and if so what is the underlying microbial mechanism therefore in this study we selected one coal based gac with more developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b structure for a bench scale bac filter experiment and compared it in terms of organic matter removal and microbial community characteristics with four other gacs with less developed micro level macropore a or b ncm and rmt based network analysis were used to reveal the assembly of the microbial communities and the interactions between microbial species at the steady state in bac filter especially the relationship between dominant taxa and keystone taxa the aim of this study is to provide a theoretical basis for enhancing microbial diversity and improving bac performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in addition to the four types of gac gac 9 gac 12 used in our previous study lu et al 2020 one gac with more developed micropores and micro level macropores a and b gac 13 was chosen the particle size of the five gac types was 8 30 mesh effective size 0 5 2 36 mm and their other properties are listed in table 1 the characteristics ph doc uv254 nh4 n and turbidity of the sand filter effluent taken from a dwtp in beijing are listed in table s1 the water treatment process was as follows coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration gac biofiltration and chlorination 2 2 experiment set up and operation five bench scale bac columns each filled with different gacs were run in parallel at a constant temperature 20 25 c for approximately 250 days the bac columns 130 cm in height and 5 cm in diameter were continuously operated in down flow mode fed with sand filter effluent and packed with 80 cm of gac supported by a gravel layer of 20 cm at the bottom fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the five bac columns the bac filters were run under a flow rate of 87 ml min and empty bed contact time of 18 min the columns were backwashed simultaneously with air and water for 4 5 min twice a week or when the head loss of one of the columns reached a critical value when water level rose by 5 cm the doc concentrations of the influent and effluent of the bac columns were measured regularly and the assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations of the influent and effluent at day 220 were analyzed using the bioassay method liu et al 2002 at one month intervals 0 5 1 g gac was taken from the top surface upper 10 cm of the bac columns for biomass measurement using the adenosine triphosphate atp method lu et al 2019 and after doc removal had reached a steady state gac samples were taken for microbial community composition and functional analysis after each sampling the columns were immediately replenished with fresh gac of the same quantity 0 5 1

sampling dna extraction and 16s rrna sequence analysis two filter biomass samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were collected from the surface of each bac filter column at a steady state days 210 and

metagenomic analysis the protein samples were treated by reductive alkylation trypsin digestion to obtain peptides desalination and then subjected to lc ms ms analysis peptide identification was performed using proteome discoverer 2 2 software thermo scientific against the amino acid sequence database generated from the metagenomic assembly section 2 3 2 finally the species and function of the identified proteins were annotated against the ncbi nr and kegg databases the raw mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited at proteomexchange with the dataset identifier pxd015811 2 3 4 bioinformatic analysis to determine the neutral assembly of bacterial communities in bac filters ncm was used to predict the detection frequency of operational taxonomic units otus and their relative abundances sloan et al 2006 the r code used to fit the ncm in this study was adapted from previous studies burns et al 2016 chen et al 2019a text s5 only the otus shared between influent and bac filter communities were included for ncm analysis and the otus were subsequently separated into three partitions depending on whether their observed frequency was greater than the model prediction enriched less than the prediction disadvantaged or within neutral the 95 confidence intervals of the model predictions the shannon index was calculated to assess the alpha diversity of the bacterial communities unweighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis pcoa and analysis of similarity anosim were constructed to compare the bacterial community composition a structural equation model sem was constructed to evaluate how gac type affected bacterial diversity shannon index in bac filters using the r package text s6 including iodine adsorption capacity k surface area acidic surface functional groups micropores d 2 nm micro level macropores a d 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores b d 100 μm to determine the interactions among different species within the bacterial community and keystone information in bac filters a microbial molecular ecological network men was constructed using a rmt based bioinformatic approach http ieg2 ou edu mena based on the 16s rrna gene deng et al 2012 to determine the statistical significance of the empirical networks 100 random networks corresponding to each empirical network were constructed using the maslov sneppen procedure and the averages and standard deviations for all indexes for each random network were obtained maslov and sneppen 2002 a standard t test was performed to assess the significance of the network indexes between the empirical network and the corresponding random network the network was graphed using cytoscape software 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using one way anova followed by duncan multiple comparison test by spss statistics version 20 with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bac filter performance in terms of doc and aoc 3 1 1 five gacs characteristics activated carbon adsorption is mainly dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of adsorbate westerhoff et al 2005 ph temperature pivokonsky et al 2021 porosity and surface chemical properties of adsorbent faria et al 2004 the pore structure fig s1 table 1 and surface acid functional group content of five gacs were investigated fig s2 table s2 the differential pore size distribution curves of the gacs show four obvious peaks at diameters of 2 nm micropores 2 50 nm mesopores 0 2 10 μm micro level macropores a and 100 μm micro level macropores b fig s1 and their corresponding pore volume had significant differences between the five gacs of which the volume of micro level macropores a of gac 13 0 28 ml g was higher than that of other gacs 0 14 0 25 ml g fig 2 a the results showed that the acidic surface functional group content of wood based gac was significantly higher than that of coal based gacs fig 2b acidic surface functional groups are known to increase surface polarity and reduce the adsorption capacity franz et al 2000 the results of adsorption isothermal model showed that the adsorption capacity parameter kf of coal based gacs were higher than that of wood based gac and gac 10 had the highest adsorption capacity 2 00 followed by gac 12 1 75 and gac 13 1 66 fig 2c however there was no difference in acidic surface functional group content among coal based gacs 3 1 2 doc and aoc removal the operation of bench scale bac filters was divided into three periods fig 3 a organic matter was primarily removed by adsorption period a adsorption gradually decreased whereas biodegradation increased period b and biological processes dominated period c simpson 2008 terry and summers 2018 in period a at an average influent water of doc 2 2 mg l the removal of bac 13 was similar to that of bac 10 with a difference of 0 1 mg l in period c the removal of bac 13 was only 0 3 mg l higher than that of bac 10 however significant differences were observed in doc removal efficiency 64 70 vs 54 15 fig 3b at an average influent water of aoc 294 4 μg acetate c l the aoc removal efficiency of bac 13 was significantly higher than that of other bac filters with a difference of 10 8 37 0 μg acetate c l in period c fig 3c the results indicate that microorganisms contribute greatly to the removal of organic matter by bac and the role of microorganisms in bac 13 was found to be significant p 0 05 however the biomass of bac 11 was significantly higher than that of bac 13 p 0 05 by at least seven times as much fig 3d it is speculated that microbial community composition may be the key factor affecting bac performance when the biomass reaches a certain level which is supported by previous studies boon et al 2011 oh et al 2018 ross et al 2019 therefore unlike previous studies we then systematically investigated the microbial community characteristics in bac filters in detail including microbial community assembly microbial species interaction microbial community structure and function and the contribution of keystone and abundant taxa to function 3 2 the microbial community assembly in the steady state bac filter 3 2 1 microbial community assembly strongly influenced by deterministic selection if neutral processes were dominant in the microbial community assembly in bac filters the ncm predictions would be in agreement with the experimental data however the majority of the taxa that were shared between influent water and filter media communities were either more frequent enriched or less frequent disadvantaged than would be expected by their relative abundances table 2 fig s3 for example 60 of taxa the ones shared between influent and filter communities were either enriched 22 or disadvantaged 38 and only 40 of the shared otus equal to 15 of the total otus detected in the bac 13 filter media fell in the neutral region table 2 this suggests that deterministic selection may dominate microbial community assembly in bac filters 3 2 2 influential factors of microbial communities pcoa ordinations and anosim tests showed that differences in the bacterial community compositions between the influent and bac filters exhibited a clear separation r 0 989 p 0 001 fig 4 a differences among species composition proportions at the class level between influent and bac filters were evaluated by one way analysis of variance fig 4b and s4 and the results show that there were significant differences among the groups for some species p 0 05 for example planctomycetes accounted for 1 5 6 7 13 4 25 5 11 6 and 6 5 in influent and bac 9 bac 13 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 sem was used to evaluate the direct effects of gac properties on the bacterial community in five bac filters and four coal based bac filters respectively due to the difference in surface polarity between wood and coal based gac the final sem explained 99 6 of the variation in bacterial diversity shannon index in the five bac filters fig 4c the effects of surface polarity of gac on the bacterial diversity λ 0 96 were much greater than the effects of the physical properties of gac e g adsorption capacity k λ 0 35 pore volume of micro level macropores a λ 0 34 and surface area λ 0 06 however for the four kinds of coal based bac filters there was no difference in gac surface polarity and the factors influencing bacterial diversity followed the order k λ 0 96 micro level macropores a λ 0 92 micropores λ 0 31 acidic surface functional groups λ 0 28 surface area λ 0 11 iodine λ 0 62 micro level macropores b λ 0 88 fig 4d the results indicate that the effects of the surface polarity of gac on the assembly of the bacterial communities in the bac filters were greater than those of the pore size distribution in which the effect of micro level macropores a was greater than that of micropores 3 3 microbial co occurrence network analysis 3 3 1 network description network analysis can be used to identify putative keystone taxa which are regarded to be important in maintaining the stability of ecosystem function ya et al 2021 in this study environmental disturbance is represented by the difference among gacs so we put together the microbial samples of five bac filters at the steady state for analysis in order to analyze the common keystone species and the influence of gac properties on them a network analysis was performed to analyze microbial co occurrence in the steady state bac filters fig 5 a the network topology fit the power law distribution well r2 0 84 table s3 a module is regarded as a functional unit in the bacterial community within which populations may tend to have similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 there were nine modules with a modularity value of 0 468 fig 5a table s3 which was higher than that of the corresponding randomized networks 0 325 indicating that the networks appeared to be modular wu et al 2016 the number of otus originally used to construct the network was 685 and the constructed network contained 120 nodes characterizing the size and complexity of the network shi et al 2019 and 371 edges including 241 65 positive and 130 35 negative interactions fig 5a in the network positive interactions include mutualism and commensalism whereas negative interactions include amensalism competition and predation among others faust and raes 2012 this implies that microbes in the bac filter may be more cooperative than competitive in addition the majority of the nodes in the constructed networks were derived from 16 phyla and the different phyla varied greatly fig s5 however the proportions of nodes were different from their relative abundances among the microbial communities based on phylogenetic analysis this difference in the microbial communities and networks highlights the importance of studying microbial interactions which can help us better understand the microbial assembly process ya et al 2021 3 3 2 identification of keystone microorganisms the within module connectivity zi among module connectivity pi plot is typically used to assess the topological functions of network nodes and all nodes are divided into four categories according to zi and pi values peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 zhou et al 2011 previous studies have suggested that hubs and connectors may be regarded as keystone species which are important for maintaining ecological system stability deng et al 2016 in this study one module hub and seven connectors were detected in the constructed network fig 5b and table 3 otu 21 was derived from proteobacteria as a module hub most of the connectors were proteobacteria and only one taxon otu 889 was from cyanobacteria with a relative abundance of 0 27 otus 451 12 and 367 belonged to the same genus hyphomicrobium with relative abundances ranging from 0 08 to 0 38 hyphomicrobium could utilize formaldehyde or other low molecular weight carboxylic acids kasuga et al 2016 otu 689 relative abundance 0 15 was derived from the genus phreatobacter which also utilized low molecular weight compounds such as formate baek and choi 2019 otu 889 relative abundance 0 21 was derived from the genus candidatus obscuribacter which is also able to utilize short chain volatile fatty acids glucose and amino acids qiu et al 2019 ozone followed by bac filter is widely used in water treatment in which ozone would produce low molecular weight by products that can lead to bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in distribution systems jurado sánchez et al 2014 and are an important group of ozonation disinfection by products odbps e g carbonyl compounds carboxylic acids and keto acids pulicharla et al 2020 in this study the men revealed that the keystone species in bac filters had the ability to metabolize these low molecular weight substrates which effectively reduced bacterial regrowth in distribution systems and the risk of odbps in ozonated water some keystone species acting as connectors are related to different genera with similar functions ya et al 2021 in this study the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium in the bac 9 bac 13 filters were 1 6 0 9 1 6 2 9 and 2 2 respectively and the relative abundances of candidatus obscuribacter in the bac 9 bac 13 filters was 0 4 0 04 0 09 0 3 and 0 9 respectively fig 5c previous studies also found that low abundance species may be as important as or more important than abundant taxa in maintaining the stability of microbial networks shi et al 2016 dssf69 and unclassified f acetobacteraceae were two of the most abundant genera followed by sphingobium amphiplicatus and sphingomonas fig 5c and s6 the network analysis revealed that putative keystone species had competitive interactions with abundant taxa for example the keystone species hyphomicrobium was negatively associated with gemmata unclassified f acetobacteraceae and candidatus obscuribacter and had positive associations with pirellula and fimbriiglobus fig 5d interestingly competitive interactions with keystone taxa have been shown to promote bacterial and fungal diversity chen et al 2019b 3 4 difference in microbial community composition in bac filter identified by multi omics to better understand the bacterial community structure in the bac filters metaproteomic and metagenomic analyses were employed fig s7 and s8 and there were numerous differences in the bacterial community composition fig 6 sphingomonas gemmata and belnapia accounted for larger proportions in the identification of metagenomics than in metaproteomics whereas smaller proportions of hyphomicrobium and crenalkalicoccus were observed by metagenomics for example sphingomonas gemmata belnapia hyphomicrobium and crenalkalicoccus accounted for 8 7 6 6 12 1 1 3 and 0 3 respectively based on metagenomic analysis and 5 5 4 6 2 6 6 6 and 6 2 respectively based on metaproteomic analysis of the bac 13 filter fig 6 this may be explained by the observation that metaproteomic analysis of microbial community compositions is based on proteins which are related to the functional community whereas metagenomic analysis is based on dna sequencing tian and wang 2021 the identified peptide sequences was analyzed against the metagenomic database of this study the species abundance identified by metaproteomic analysis more closely reflects activity which is independent of the numerical abundance and function therefore it may be possible that some species were abundant but not active leary et al 2014 leary et al 2013 in addition metagenomic analysis may be disrupted by the sequencing of accumulated dna originating from dead cells or extracellular polymeric substances that contain large quantities of extracellular dna klein et al 2011 3 5 keystone taxa and abundant taxa involved in metabolism 3 5 1 the main contributor to microbial community functions keystone taxa there were some differences with respect to the top five abundant pathways in bac filters between metagenomics and metaproteomics fig s9 however these five abundant metabolic pathways were mainly related to metabolism particularly for biosynthesis of amino acids carbon metabolism and two component system fig s10 and s11 we further evaluated the contribution of keystone taxa and abundant taxa to the five top abundant pathways in each bac filter using multi omics metaproteomics analysis indicated that sphingobium and hyphomicrobium were the main contributors to the five top abundant pathways in wood based bac 11 accounting for 9 4 and 6 6 respectively however hyphomicrobium contributed the most to all coal based bac filters with contributions of 9 6 9 1 9 5 and 11 1 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 12 and bac 13 respectively followed by sphingobium with contributions of 9 3 8 1 8 6 and 10 5 respectively fig 7 a and fig s10 metagenomic analysis revealed that gemmata and belnapia contributed more to the five most abundant pathways in wood based bac 11 and the contribution of species was different in coal based bac filters however in general the contribution of sphingomonas and belnapia were higher than that of the other genera fig 7a and fig s11 metaproteomics and metagenomics revealed different contributions of species to the top five abundant pathways metagenomic analysis revealed that the abundance of hyphomicrobium is low 0 4 1 3 and its potential contribution 0 8 1 7 is much lower than that of the dominant species sphingomonas 4 6 17 2 however metaproteomics analysis suggested that the contribution of hyphomicrobium 6 6 11 2 was higher than that of sphingomonas 5 1 6 4 protein expression is a reflection of specific microbial activities therefore metaproteomics could be crucial to provide insights into which functions are expressed and which species play major roles in the microbial community e g species that are less abundant but active hettich et al 2012 kirisits et al 2019 kleiner et al 2017 3 5 2 effect of gac pore size distribution on keystone species and bac performance the metaproteomics analysis revealed that hyphomicrobium accounted for an abundance of 5 9 3 7 1 1 5 9 and 6 6 in bac 9 bac 13 filters fig 6 and it produced proteins related to the five most abundant pathways with 189 192 156 199 and 208 proteins g gac fig s9 both relative abundances of keystone species hyphomicrobium and the numbers of proteins associated with the five most abundant pathways produced by hyphomicrobium showed a good linear relationship with the volume of micro level macropore a in gac with r2 0 95 and 0 68 respectively fig 7b this indicates that the micro level macropore a may affect the composition and function of keystone species in bac filters however biodegradation cannot ultimately determine the bac performance in terms of doc removal because the adsorption capacity of gac is also an important factor in this study the abundance of keystone species was higher in bac 9 than in bac 10 and the numbers of proteins were similar however the adsorption capacity parameter kf of gac 10 2 00 was higher than that of gac 9 1 33 at the steady state in bac filter the doc removal of bac 9 0 8 mg l was lower than that of bac 10 1 3 mg l with removal efficiencies of 36 3 and 54 2 respectively the gac adsorption capacity is the primary factor causing this phenomenon in our previous studies the fresh gacs mainly removed doc with molecular weight mw of 150 1600 da by gac adsorption alone and bacteria obtained by bac filters mainly degraded doc with mw of 1600 8600 da by biodegradation alone after gac adsorption saturation bacteria were added to the saturated gac there was still enough doc left in the water for microbial utilization however the microorganisms mainly degraded doc with mw of 150 1600 da followed by those with mw of 1600 8600 da fig s12 lu et al 2019 therefore it is speculated that microorganisms drive gac adsorption to maintain its function and the doc adsorbed by gac is the main nutrient source of microorganisms in the bac filters here the model was fitted to identify factors including the micropores xm micro level macropore a xa micro level macropore b xb and surface polarity xsp of gac associated with bac filter performance at steady state of which xm and xsp represents the adsorption capacity of gac xa is related to keystone species and xb is related to biomass the model that was well fitting for five bac filters could be expressed as doc removal 0 5 xm 0 3 xa 0 9 xb 8 5 xsp 2 9 r2 0 99 if only the coal based bac filters with no difference in surface polarity were considered the model that was well fitting was doc removal 0 5 xm 0 5 xa 0 8 xb 0 001 xsp 0 05 r2 0 99 the selected gac 13 in this study had a well developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b structure which ensured a higher adsorption capacity and stronger biodegradation capacity and especially promoted the abundance of keystone species therefore gac 13 is more suitable for the bac process this study proposes a method for shaping the microbial community to improve bac performance i e optimizing the pore size structure of gac to improve the abundance of keystone species however the optimal ratio between micropore and micro level macropore a and b needs to be studied in addition microbial diversity is influenced by raw water seasonal changes or various treatment processes perrin et al 2019 therefore whether the results of this study are applicable to other bac filters was not evaluated future studies will be carried out to reveal whether the full scale bac filters performance can be improved by shaping microbial communities through optimizing pore size structure independent of raw water origin 4 conclusions the results show that gac with simultaneously developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b can improve the organic matter removal efficiency in bac filters the microbial community assembly in the bac filters was shaped by deterministic factors and co occurrence network analysis indicated that the relative abundances of the identified keystone species were relatively low of which the most abundant was hyphomicrobium there were numerous differences in the bacterial community compositions in bac filters identified by dna based metagenomics and protein based metaproteomics and metaproteomics provided better insights into which species played major roles in the microbial community we conclude that gac pore size structure determines bac performance by shaping microbial community in which micropores and micro level macropores a ensure higher adsorption capacity and stronger biodegradation capacity respectively these findings may provide a theoretical basis for improving bac performance by optimizing the pore size distribution characteristics of gac to build a favorable environment for microbes however the optimal ratio between micropore and micro level macropore volume and applicability remain to be studied and should be the focus of future research declaration of competing interest the

16273,a new focus on biofiltration has emerged that aims to shape microbial communities to improve treatment efficacy it is therefore necessary to understand the linkages between microbial community structure and biofilter function however the assembly and interaction of microbial communities in biological activated carbon bac filters are unknown in this study we selected one coal based granular activated carbon gac gac 13 with simultaneously developed micropore and micro level macropore volume used for a bench scale bac column experiment and compared it with other coal based gacs and wood based gac in terms of the dissolved organic carbon doc removal and microbial community characteristics the results showed that there was no difference between the doc removal efficiency of bac 13 and the other two coal based bac filters with high iodine value in the period dominated by adsorption while the doc removal efficiency of bac 13 64 7 0 6 was significantly higher than that of other bac filters 36 3 0 8 54 1 0 4 with a difference of 0 3 0 7 mg l in doc during the steady state the bacterial communities were strongly assembled by deterministic rather than stochastic factors where the surface polarity of gac had a greater effect on the microbial communities than its physical properties the corresponding co occurrence network revealed that microbes in the bac filter may be more cooperative than competitive the keystone bacterium hyphomicrobium which had a relatively low abundance contributed 0 3 1 more to the most abundant functions and produced 5 21 proteins g gac more than the dominant bacterium sphingobium the metaproteomic based approach could provide more accurate information regarding the contributions of different species to metabolic functions the pore size distribution of gac was found to be an important factor in determining bac filter performance the most important pore sizes were micropores and micro level macropores 0 2 10 μm and 100 μm in diameter and the latter impacted the abundance of keystone species overall our findings provide new insights into shaping microbial communities by optimizing pore size structure to improve bac performance

cuthbertson et al 2020 including disinfection byproduct precursors mckie et al 2015 ammonium wagner et al 2018 micropollutants lu et al 2019 and metals cerrato et al 2010 the bac process is widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps due to its simplicity effectiveness and economy and in china since 2020 the daily water supply capacity of full scale dwtps with o3 bac has exceeded 40

residuals lohwacharin et al 2015 are important design and operational parameters affecting bac performance the key operational practices of biofilters are different from those of conventional filters by promoting and maintaining biological activity on the filter material the conversion of organic and inorganic components could be increased kirisits et al 2019 biodegradation capacity is mainly affected by biomass microbial community structure and microbial growth rate gagnon and huck 2001 lazarova and manem 1995 oh et al 2018 some studies have shown that the quantity or activity of the biomass remained essentially constant after running bac for a long time however biomass was not the decisive factor affecting the bac performance in terms of organic matter removal boon et al 2011 lu et al 2020 pharand et al 2015 and the effect of the microbial community was greater than that of biomass gagnon and huck 2001 oh et al 2018 ross et al 2019 recently the focus of biofiltration research has shifted from development of design and operational strategies to customizing microbial communities for further enhancements in performance kirisits et al 2019 peterson and summers 2021 e g bioaugmentation albers et al 2018 and supplementation of limiting nutrients keithley and kirisits 2019 therefore it is critical to understand how the structure function and dynamics of the microbial communities contribute to bac process and how they can be shaped to improve treatment efficacy some studies have investigated the microbial community structure and function in bac filters han et al 2013 li et al 2017 liao et al 2013 oh et al 2018 xiang et al 2013 however little is known about the microbial community assembly and the interaction between species in bac filters in microbial community construction and diversity maintenance there are two distinct theories that determine microbial community assembly i e the traditional niche based theory ramette and tiedje 2007 and the unified neutral theory hubbell 2005 according to traditional niche based theory the microbial community structure is shaped mainly by deterministic factors such as competition and niche differentiation sloan et al 2006 creating a strong link between microbial composition and the environment in which they grow chen et al 2021 ofiţeru et al 2010 the controversial neutral theory identifies stochastic factors as the main drivers of microbial community assembly such as death birth immigration and speciation hubbell 2005 the neutral community model ncm was used to describe how much of the variation in the microbial communities could be determined by neutral stochastic process in one study ncm explained a large fraction of the community variation in the river chen et al 2019a vignola et al 2018 indicated that the filter medium is a deterministic factor that can drive the assembly of microbial communities in a laboratory scale filter filled with quartz sand and granular activation carbon gac the structure of microbial communities in gac biofilters has been reported to differ from that in sand biofilters gerrity et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 microbial co occurrence networks using random matrix theory rmt have recently been used not only to reveal interactions between species in a variety of environments such as soils zheng et al 2021 and activated sludge sun et al 2021 but also to identify putative keystone taxa that are important for maintaining the functional stability of systems ya et al 2021 keystone taxa are highly connected taxa that exert a crucial influence on microbial community structure and function irrespective of their abundance across space and time and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbiome function and ecosystem processes banerjee et al 2018 microorganisms play key roles in ensuring the long term stable operation of bac lu et al 2020 sharaf and liu 2021 however to the best our knowledge there are no reports on the putative keystone taxa and interactions between dominant taxa and keystone taxa in bac filters this limits our understanding of the mechanisms between microbial community structure and bac filter function gac as the colonization site of microorganisms promotes microbial attachment and biofilm formation on its rough surface the porous structures surface chemistries carbon ages and particle size of gac affect microbial community composition du et al 2020 lu et al 2021 mercier et al 2014 in our previous study it was speculated that the gac micro level macropores a 0 2 10 μm in diameter and micro level macropores b 100 μm could affect bac performance and may play an equally important role as micropores 2 nm this leads to the question of whether the pore size distribution of gac can be adjusted to improve bac performance and if so what is the underlying microbial mechanism therefore in this study we selected one coal based gac with more developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b structure for a bench scale bac filter experiment and compared it in terms of organic matter removal and microbial community characteristics with four other gacs with less developed micro level macropore a or b ncm and rmt based network analysis were used to reveal the assembly of the microbial communities and the interactions between microbial species at the steady state in bac filter especially the relationship between dominant taxa and keystone taxa the aim of this study is to provide a theoretical basis for enhancing microbial diversity and improving bac performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in addition to the four types of gac gac 9 gac 12 used in our previous study lu et al 2020 one gac with more developed micropores and micro level macropores a and b gac 13 was chosen the particle size of the five gac types was 8 30 mesh effective size 0 5 2 36 mm and their other properties are listed in table 1 the characteristics ph doc uv254 nh4 n and turbidity of the sand filter effluent taken from a dwtp in beijing are listed in table s1 the water treatment process was as follows coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration gac biofiltration and chlorination 2 2 experiment set up and operation five bench scale bac columns each filled with different gacs were run in parallel at a constant temperature 20 25 c for approximately 250 days the bac columns 130 cm in height and 5 cm in diameter were continuously operated in down flow mode fed with sand filter effluent and packed with 80 cm of gac supported by a gravel layer of 20 cm at the bottom fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the five bac columns the bac filters were run under a flow rate of 87 ml min and empty bed contact time of 18 min the columns were backwashed simultaneously with air and water for 4 5 min twice a week or when the head loss of one of the columns reached a critical value when water level rose by 5 cm the doc concentrations of the influent and effluent of the bac columns were measured regularly and the assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations of the influent and effluent at day 220 were analyzed using the bioassay method liu et al 2002 at one month intervals 0 5 1 g gac was taken from the top surface upper 10 cm of the bac columns for biomass measurement using the adenosine triphosphate atp method lu et al 2019 and after doc removal had reached a steady state gac samples were taken for microbial community composition and functional analysis after each sampling the columns were immediately replenished with fresh gac of the same quantity 0 5 1

sampling dna extraction and 16s rrna sequence analysis two filter biomass samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were collected from the surface of each bac filter column at a steady state days 210 and

bioinformatic analysis to determine the neutral assembly of bacterial communities in bac filters ncm was used to predict the detection frequency of operational taxonomic units otus and their relative abundances sloan et al 2006 the r code used to fit the ncm in this study was adapted from previous studies burns et al 2016 chen et al 2019a text s5 only the otus shared between influent and bac filter communities were included for ncm analysis and the otus were subsequently separated into three partitions depending on whether their observed frequency was greater than the model prediction enriched less than the prediction disadvantaged or within neutral the 95 confidence intervals of the model predictions the shannon index was calculated to assess the alpha diversity of the bacterial communities unweighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis pcoa and analysis of similarity anosim were constructed to compare the bacterial community composition a structural equation model sem was constructed to evaluate how gac type affected bacterial diversity shannon index in bac filters using the r package text s6 including iodine adsorption capacity k surface area acidic surface functional groups micropores d 2 nm micro level macropores a d 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores b d 100 μm to determine the interactions among different species within the bacterial community and keystone information in bac filters a microbial molecular ecological network men was constructed using a rmt based bioinformatic approach http ieg2 ou edu mena based on the 16s rrna gene deng et al 2012 to determine the statistical significance of the empirical networks 100 random networks corresponding to each empirical network were constructed using the maslov sneppen procedure and the averages and standard deviations for all indexes for each random network were obtained maslov and sneppen 2002 a standard t test was performed to assess the significance of the network indexes between the empirical network and the corresponding random network the network was graphed using cytoscape software 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using one way anova followed by duncan multiple comparison test by spss statistics version 20 with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bac filter performance in terms of doc and aoc 3 1 1 five gacs characteristics activated carbon adsorption is mainly dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of adsorbate westerhoff et al 2005 ph temperature pivokonsky et al 2021 porosity and surface chemical properties of adsorbent faria et al 2004 the pore structure fig s1 table 1 and surface acid functional group content of five gacs were investigated fig s2 table s2 the differential pore size distribution curves of the gacs show four obvious peaks at diameters of 2 nm micropores 2 50 nm mesopores 0 2 10 μm micro level macropores a and 100 μm micro level macropores b fig s1 and their corresponding pore volume had significant differences between the five gacs of which the volume of micro level macropores a of gac 13 0 28 ml g was higher than that of other gacs 0 14 0 25 ml g fig 2 a the results showed that the acidic surface functional group content of wood based gac was significantly higher than that of coal based gacs fig 2b acidic surface functional groups are known to increase surface polarity and reduce the adsorption capacity franz et al 2000 the results of adsorption isothermal model showed that the adsorption capacity parameter kf of coal based gacs were higher than that of wood based gac and gac 10 had the highest adsorption capacity 2 00 followed by gac 12 1 75 and gac 13 1 66 fig 2c however there was no difference in acidic surface functional group content among coal based gacs 3 1 2 doc and aoc removal the operation of bench scale bac filters was divided into three periods fig 3 a organic matter was primarily removed by adsorption period a adsorption gradually decreased whereas biodegradation increased period b and biological processes dominated period c simpson 2008 terry and summers 2018 in period a at an average influent water of doc 2 2 mg l the removal of bac 13 was similar to that of bac 10 with a difference of 0 1 mg l in period c the removal of bac 13 was only 0 3 mg l higher than that of bac 10 however significant differences were observed in doc removal efficiency 64 70 vs 54 15 fig 3b at an average influent water of aoc 294 4 μg acetate c l the aoc removal efficiency of bac 13 was significantly higher than that of other bac filters with a difference of 10 8 37 0 μg acetate c l in period c fig 3c the results indicate that microorganisms contribute greatly to the removal of organic matter by bac and the role of microorganisms in bac 13 was found to be significant p 0 05 however the biomass of bac 11 was significantly higher than that of bac 13 p 0 05 by at least seven times as much fig 3d it is speculated that microbial community composition may be the key factor affecting bac performance when the biomass reaches a certain level which is supported by previous studies boon et al 2011 oh et al 2018 ross et al 2019 therefore unlike previous studies we then systematically investigated the microbial community characteristics in bac filters in detail including microbial community assembly microbial species interaction microbial community structure and function and the contribution of keystone and abundant taxa to function 3 2 the microbial community assembly in the steady state bac filter 3 2 1 microbial community assembly strongly influenced by deterministic selection if neutral processes were dominant in the microbial community assembly in bac filters the ncm predictions would be in agreement with the experimental data however the majority of the taxa that were shared between influent water and filter media communities were either more frequent enriched or less frequent disadvantaged than would be expected by their relative abundances table 2 fig s3 for example 60 of taxa the ones shared between influent and filter communities were either enriched 22 or disadvantaged 38 and only 40 of the shared otus equal to 15 of the total otus detected in the bac 13 filter media fell in the neutral region table 2 this suggests that deterministic selection may dominate microbial community assembly in bac filters 3 2 2 influential factors of microbial communities pcoa ordinations and anosim tests showed that differences in the bacterial community compositions between the influent and bac filters exhibited a clear separation r 0 989 p 0 001 fig 4 a differences among species composition proportions at the class level between influent and bac filters were evaluated by one way analysis of variance fig 4b and s4 and the results show that there were significant differences among the groups for some species p 0 05 for example planctomycetes accounted for 1 5 6 7 13 4 25 5 11 6 and 6 5 in influent and bac 9 bac 13 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 sem was used to evaluate the direct effects of gac properties on the bacterial community in five bac filters and four coal based bac filters respectively due to the difference in surface polarity between wood and coal based gac the final sem explained 99 6 of the variation in bacterial diversity shannon index in the five bac filters fig 4c the effects of surface polarity of gac on the bacterial diversity λ 0 96 were much greater than the effects of the physical properties of gac e g adsorption capacity k λ 0 35 pore volume of micro level macropores a λ 0 34 and surface area λ 0 06 however for the four kinds of coal based bac filters there was no difference in gac surface polarity and the factors influencing bacterial diversity followed the order k λ 0 96 micro level macropores a λ 0 92 micropores λ 0 31 acidic surface functional groups λ 0 28 surface area λ 0 11 iodine λ 0 62 micro level macropores b λ 0 88 fig 4d the results indicate that the effects of the surface polarity of gac on the assembly of the bacterial communities in the bac filters were greater than those of the pore size distribution in which the effect of micro level macropores a was greater than that of micropores 3 3 microbial co occurrence network analysis 3 3 1 network description network analysis can be used to identify putative keystone taxa which are regarded to be important in maintaining the stability of ecosystem function ya et al 2021 in this study environmental disturbance is represented by the difference among gacs so we put together the microbial samples of five bac filters at the steady state for analysis in order to analyze the common keystone species and the influence of gac properties on them a network analysis was performed to analyze microbial co occurrence in the steady state bac filters fig 5 a the network topology fit the power law distribution well r2 0 84 table s3 a module is regarded as a functional unit in the bacterial community within which populations may tend to have similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 there were nine modules with a modularity value of 0 468 fig 5a table s3 which was higher than that of the corresponding randomized networks 0 325 indicating that the networks appeared to be modular wu et al 2016 the number of otus originally used to construct the network was 685 and the constructed network contained 120 nodes characterizing the size and complexity of the network shi et al 2019 and 371 edges including 241 65 positive and 130 35 negative interactions fig 5a in the network positive interactions include mutualism and commensalism whereas negative interactions include amensalism competition and predation among others faust and raes 2012 this implies that microbes in the bac filter may be more cooperative than competitive in addition the majority of the nodes in the constructed networks were derived from 16 phyla and the different phyla varied greatly fig s5 however the proportions of nodes were different from their relative abundances among the microbial communities based on phylogenetic analysis this difference in the microbial communities and networks highlights the importance of studying microbial interactions which can help us better understand the microbial assembly process ya et al 2021 3 3 2 identification of keystone microorganisms the within module connectivity zi among module connectivity pi plot is typically used to assess the topological functions of network nodes and all nodes are divided into four categories according to zi and pi values peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 zhou et al 2011 previous studies have suggested that hubs and connectors may be regarded as keystone species which are important for maintaining ecological system stability deng et al 2016 in this study one module hub and seven connectors were detected in the constructed network fig 5b and table 3 otu 21 was derived from proteobacteria as a module hub most of the connectors were proteobacteria and only one taxon otu 889 was from cyanobacteria with a relative abundance of 0 27 otus 451 12 and 367 belonged to the same genus hyphomicrobium with relative abundances ranging from 0 08 to 0 38 hyphomicrobium could utilize formaldehyde or other low molecular weight carboxylic acids kasuga et al 2016 otu 689 relative abundance 0 15 was derived from the genus phreatobacter which also utilized low molecular weight compounds such as formate baek and choi 2019 otu 889 relative abundance 0 21 was derived from the genus candidatus obscuribacter which is also able to utilize short chain volatile fatty acids glucose and amino acids qiu et al 2019 ozone followed by bac filter is widely used in water treatment in which ozone would produce low molecular weight by products that can lead to bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in distribution systems jurado sánchez et al 2014 and are an important group of ozonation disinfection by products odbps e g carbonyl compounds carboxylic acids and keto acids pulicharla et al 2020 in this study the men revealed that the keystone species in bac filters had the ability to metabolize these low molecular weight substrates which effectively reduced bacterial regrowth in distribution systems and the risk of odbps in ozonated water some keystone species acting as connectors are related to different genera with similar functions ya et al 2021 in this study the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium in the bac 9 bac 13 filters were 1 6 0 9 1 6 2 9 and 2 2 respectively and the relative abundances of candidatus obscuribacter in the bac 9 bac 13 filters was 0 4 0 04 0 09 0 3 and 0 9 respectively fig 5c previous studies also found that low abundance species may be as important as or more important than abundant taxa in maintaining the stability of microbial networks shi et al 2016 dssf69 and unclassified f acetobacteraceae were two of the most abundant genera followed by sphingobium amphiplicatus and sphingomonas fig 5c and s6 the network analysis revealed that putative keystone species had competitive interactions with abundant taxa for example the keystone species hyphomicrobium was negatively associated with gemmata unclassified f acetobacteraceae and candidatus obscuribacter and had positive associations with pirellula and fimbriiglobus fig 5d interestingly competitive interactions with keystone taxa have been shown to promote bacterial and fungal diversity chen et al 2019b 3 4 difference in microbial community composition in bac filter identified by multi omics to better understand the bacterial community structure in the bac filters metaproteomic and metagenomic analyses were employed fig s7 and s8 and there were numerous differences in the bacterial community composition fig 6 sphingomonas gemmata and belnapia accounted for larger proportions in the identification of metagenomics than in metaproteomics whereas smaller proportions of hyphomicrobium and crenalkalicoccus were observed by metagenomics for example sphingomonas gemmata belnapia hyphomicrobium and crenalkalicoccus accounted for 8 7 6 6 12 1 1 3 and 0 3 respectively based on metagenomic analysis and 5 5 4 6 2 6 6 6 and 6 2 respectively based on metaproteomic analysis of the bac 13 filter fig 6 this may be explained by the observation that metaproteomic analysis of microbial community compositions is based on proteins which are related to the functional community whereas metagenomic analysis is based on dna sequencing tian and wang 2021 the identified peptide sequences was analyzed against the metagenomic database of this study the species abundance identified by metaproteomic analysis more closely reflects activity which is independent of the numerical abundance and function therefore it may be possible that some species were abundant but not active leary et al 2014 leary et al 2013 in addition metagenomic analysis may be disrupted by the sequencing of accumulated dna originating from dead cells or extracellular polymeric substances that contain large quantities of extracellular dna klein et al 2011 3 5 keystone taxa and abundant taxa involved in metabolism 3 5 1 the main contributor to microbial community functions keystone taxa there were some differences with respect to the top five abundant pathways in bac filters between metagenomics and metaproteomics fig s9 however these five abundant metabolic pathways were mainly related to metabolism particularly for biosynthesis of amino acids carbon metabolism and two component system fig s10 and s11 we further evaluated the contribution of keystone taxa and abundant taxa to the five top abundant pathways in each bac filter using multi omics metaproteomics analysis indicated that sphingobium and hyphomicrobium were the main contributors to the five top abundant pathways in wood based bac 11 accounting for 9 4 and 6 6 respectively however hyphomicrobium contributed the most to all coal based bac filters with contributions of 9 6 9 1 9 5 and 11 1 in bac 9 bac 10 bac 12 and bac 13 respectively followed by sphingobium with contributions of 9 3 8 1 8 6 and 10 5 respectively fig 7 a and fig s10 metagenomic analysis revealed that gemmata and belnapia contributed more to the five most abundant pathways in wood based bac 11 and the contribution of species was different in coal based bac filters however in general the contribution of sphingomonas and belnapia were higher than that of the other genera fig 7a and fig s11 metaproteomics and metagenomics revealed different contributions of species to the top five abundant pathways metagenomic analysis revealed that the abundance of hyphomicrobium is low 0 4 1 3 and its potential contribution 0 8 1 7 is much lower than that of the dominant species sphingomonas 4 6 17 2 however metaproteomics analysis suggested that the contribution of hyphomicrobium 6 6 11 2 was higher than that of sphingomonas 5 1 6 4 protein expression is a reflection of specific microbial activities therefore metaproteomics could be crucial to provide insights into which functions are expressed and which species play major roles in the microbial community e g species that are less abundant but active hettich et al 2012 kirisits et al 2019 kleiner et al 2017 3 5 2 effect of gac pore size distribution on keystone species and bac performance the metaproteomics analysis revealed that hyphomicrobium accounted for an abundance of 5 9 3 7 1 1 5 9 and 6 6 in bac 9 bac 13 filters fig 6 and it produced proteins related to the five most abundant pathways with 189 192 156 199 and 208 proteins g gac fig s9 both relative abundances of keystone species hyphomicrobium and the numbers of proteins associated with the five most abundant pathways produced by hyphomicrobium showed a good linear relationship with the volume of micro level macropore a in gac with r2 0 95 and 0 68 respectively fig 7b this indicates that the micro level macropore a may affect the composition and function of keystone species in bac filters however biodegradation cannot ultimately determine the bac performance in terms of doc removal because the adsorption capacity of gac is also an important factor in this study the abundance of keystone species was higher in bac 9 than in bac 10 and the numbers of proteins were similar however the adsorption capacity parameter kf of gac 10 2 00 was higher than that of gac 9 1 33 at the steady state in bac filter the doc removal of bac 9 0 8 mg l was lower than that of bac 10 1 3 mg l with removal efficiencies of 36 3 and 54 2 respectively the gac adsorption capacity is the primary factor causing this phenomenon in our previous studies the fresh gacs mainly removed doc with molecular weight mw of 150 1600 da by gac adsorption alone and bacteria obtained by bac filters mainly degraded doc with mw of 1600 8600 da by biodegradation alone after gac adsorption saturation bacteria were added to the saturated gac there was still enough doc left in the water for microbial utilization however the microorganisms mainly degraded doc with mw of 150 1600 da followed by those with mw of 1600 8600 da fig s12 lu et al 2019 therefore it is speculated that microorganisms drive gac adsorption to maintain its function and the doc adsorbed by gac is the main nutrient source of microorganisms in the bac filters here the model was fitted to identify factors including the micropores xm micro level macropore a xa micro level macropore b xb and surface polarity xsp of gac associated with bac filter performance at steady state of which xm and xsp represents the adsorption capacity of gac xa is related to keystone species and xb is related to biomass the model that was well fitting for five bac filters could be expressed as doc removal 0 5 xm 0 3 xa 0 9 xb 8 5 xsp 2 9 r2 0 99 if only the coal based bac filters with no difference in surface polarity were considered the model that was well fitting was doc removal 0 5 xm 0 5 xa 0 8 xb 0 001 xsp 0 05 r2 0 99 the selected gac 13 in this study had a well developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b structure which ensured a higher adsorption capacity and stronger biodegradation capacity and especially promoted the abundance of keystone species therefore gac 13 is more suitable for the bac process this study proposes a method for shaping the microbial community to improve bac performance i e optimizing the pore size structure of gac to improve the abundance of keystone species however the optimal ratio between micropore and micro level macropore a and b needs to be studied in addition microbial diversity is influenced by raw water seasonal changes or various treatment processes perrin et al 2019 therefore whether the results of this study are applicable to other bac filters was not evaluated future studies will be carried out to reveal whether the full scale bac filters performance can be improved by shaping microbial communities through optimizing pore size structure independent of raw water origin 4 conclusions the results show that gac with simultaneously developed micropore and micro level macropore a and b can improve the organic matter removal efficiency in bac filters the microbial community assembly in the bac filters was shaped by deterministic factors and co occurrence network analysis indicated that the relative abundances of the identified keystone species were relatively low of which the most abundant was hyphomicrobium there were numerous differences in the bacterial community compositions in bac filters identified by dna based metagenomics and protein based metaproteomics and metaproteomics provided better insights into which species played major roles in the microbial community we conclude that gac pore size structure determines bac performance by shaping microbial community in which micropores and micro level macropores a ensure higher adsorption capacity and stronger biodegradation capacity respectively these findings may provide a theoretical basis for improving bac performance by optimizing the pore size distribution characteristics of gac to build a favorable environment for microbes however the optimal ratio between micropore and micro level macropore volume and applicability remain to be studied and should be the focus of future research declaration of competing interest the

210023 china corresponding authors microplastics contamination in the environment is a global problem but little is known about their dynamics in urban river networks an important site of microplastics occurrence and harboring complex transport pathways in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of microplastics in a typical urban river network in eastern china from december 2018 to september 2019 microplastics abundance mean standard deviation in the river network ranged from 2 3 1 2 to 104 6 5 6 particles l and was significantly higher during the wet than during the dry season the distribution of microplastics in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river network did not significantly differ nor did the abundance of microplastics in the surface water vs the bottom water however high abundances were determined in commercial and industrial areas at a wastewater treatment plant outlet in an urban canal and in an urban rural fringe area the seasonal dynamics of the overall abundance of microplastics could be explained by the hysteresis effect of urban plastic production and the variation in regional precipitation 78 2 of the microplastics were 330 µm in size the most common colors were blue and black and the most common shapes were fragments and fibers the polymer types of the microplastics were assessed using laser direct infrared ldir a novel chemical imaging system that identified silicone rubber polytetrafluoroethylene and polypropylene as the main components of the microplastics a non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on the abundance of the polymer components across samples showed aggregations of sampling sites that indicated the possible sources of the microplastics our study provides insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in an urban river network and suggests the potential of ldir in the accurate quantitative analysis of microplastics in the environment graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics urban river network dynamics laser direct infrared 1 introduction as an emerging pollutant microplastics plastic particles 5 mm in size have raised global concern because of their ubiquity and potentially adverse effects on the environment browne et al 2010 sutherland et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 and human health wu et al 2019 an estimated 80 of the microplastic particles found in the world s oceans are discharged via rivers nocon et al 2020 but the occurrence and transport of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have not been well studied consequently little is known about 1 the presence and distribution of microplastics in these systems and 2 the transport pathways and factors that affect microplastics distribution eerkes medrano et al 2015 among the few studies of microplastics in freshwater systems the majority have focused on large lakes and rivers whereas urban river networks have been largely ignored in part due to their complex hydrology however because urban river networks are highly connected to the terrestrial environment and thus to the sites of plastics production use and emission dikareva and simon 2019 they are important conduits of microplastics pollution anthropogenic activities account for the generation and discharge of microplastics baensch baltruschat et al 2020 hernandez et al 2017 in urban river networks the presence of microplastics has been traced to household and industrial sewage discharge the loss of feedstocks used to manufacture plastic products and the breakdown of larger plastic items eerkes medrano et al 2015 in addition while nearly all microplastics entering municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are removed from the influent the load remaining in the effluent is still large enough to pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems and may account for a large share of the microplastics transported by urban rivers to downstream aquatic environments sun et al 2019 studies on the temporal variation of microplastics in urban freshwater systems have been carried out in east asia choong et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 south asia napper et al 2021 europe de carvalho et al 2021 hurley et al 2018 north america baldwin et al 2016 ballent et al 2016 and africa mbedzi et al 2020 nonetheless there have been few long term investigations as such studies are both time consuming and expensive moreover due to differences in the sampling and detection methods used to assess microplastics in the environment the comparability of the data is poor including for urban freshwater systems given the importance of urban river networks in mediating the environmental distribution of microplastics in this study a typical urban river network in eastern china served as a model system for investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of microplastics in riverine waters over a 1 year period the most common techniques used to study microplastics include stereomicroscopy for visual observation and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy for polymer identification gong and xie 2020 among the more recently developed methods used to identify the components of microplastics are pyrolysis gas chromatography mass py gc ms and focal plane array based fourier transform infrared fpa ftir imaging hendrickson et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 simon et al 2018 laser direct infrared ldir a novel method for the automated detection of microplastics was introduced in 2018 and has been applied in several studies of microplastics contamination in a groundwater aquifer samandra et al 2022 at coastal sites scircle et al 2020 in agricultural soil li et al 2021 and in mammalian intestinal tissue li et al 2021 nonetheless there are no published investigations of microplastics in the urban river network as determined using ldir in this study we combined ldir with a traditional microscopy exam in order to improve the accuracy and speed of detection of microplastics polymer types 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study site was the wangyu river network wuxi china the only diversion channel linking the yangtze river the largest river in china and taihu lake the third largest freshwater lake in china the river network has an area of 500 km2 and covers the main urban urban rural fringe and rural areas of wuxi city located on the yangtze river delta wuxi is one of the most developed cities in china and its population density 2000 people km2 in 2017 is among the highest in the country the grand canal one of the busiest shipping channels in china crosses the river network previous investigations of microplastics in the surface water of taihu lake using different sampling and extraction methods determined an abundance of 3 4 25 8 particles l in august 2015 and 0 53 particles l from august to september 2018 the microplastics levels measured in plankton net samples collected from taihu lake are among the highest reported in freshwater lakes worldwide li et al 2019 su et al 2016 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the average abundance of microplastics from november to december 2017 was 4 92 105 particles km2 xiong et al 2019 2 2 sample collection the sampling sites and water flow are shown in fig 1 the 17 sampling sites consisted of 1 mainstream wangyu river sites wy 1 4 2 primary tributaries jiuli river and bodu river sites jl 1 3 and bd 1 3 2 secondary tributaries sites jl 0 and bd 0 and 5 other representative sites a commercial area site c an industrial area site i a

and w the midstream sites jl 0 jl 2 jl 3 bd 0 bd 2 bd 3 i r and jh and the downstream sites wy 1 4 water samples were collected in december 2018 and in march june and september 2019 corresponding to winter spring summer and autumn 2 l of riverine surface water and 2 l of bottom water were collected from each of the 17 sites using a standard rutter water sampler hydro bios germany and then transferred into purified glass bottles in total 136 water samples were finally collected water quality indicators total phosphorus total nitrogen chlorophyll a electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential dissolved oxygen temperature and turbidity were measured simultaneously using a multi parameter analyzer lh 3ba lianhua technology china and a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer aaq 177 jfe advantech japan local meteorological and air quality data were acquired from a local meteorological station plastic industry data were obtained from the annual report of wuxi city 2 3 microplastics extraction microplastics in the samples were extracted based on the protocol of the us noaa masura 2015 with slight modifications in detail 500 ml of a well mixed water sample was transferred in triplicate to 500 ml glass beakers which were then covered loosely with aluminum foil and placed in a 50 c drying oven for 48 h the dried samples were mixed with 20 ml of iron solution fe ii 0 05 m and 20 ml of 30 h2o2 and allowed to stand for 96 h with regular stirring to digest labile organic matter the microplastics in the samples were obtained by density separation in zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 1 8 g ml the floating layer was filtered onto a polycarbonate filter 5 µm ø 47 mm millipore using a vacuum pump the filter was covered with a clean glass petri dish and air dried for 24 h the extracted microplastics were then examined using a stereomicroscope mz62 guangzhou mshot photoelectric technology china and their size maximum length in one dimension shape and color were recorded 2 4 polymer composition identification ldir is a novel and automated approach to identifying the polymer types in microplastics it is less labor intensive than ftir and raman spectroscopy but its accuracy and efficiency in component detection are higher than either of these traditional methods nonetheless to reduce the time and economic costs associated with the analysis five key sites sites c i w wy 1 and wy 4 from the 17 sites included in the study were selected to identify the polymer composition of the collected microplastics using ldir for each sample a 10 mm 10 mm square was cut from each filter using a stainless steel blade and then transferred into a 1 5 ml glass crimp top vial perkinelmer usa the triplicate samples were pooled such that the four sampling periods and the two positions of the water column surface and bottom from the five sites resulted in 40 samples in total the samples were preserved by the addition of 0 2 ml of absolute ethyl alcohol and then analyzed in an ldir automatic chemical imaging system 8700 ldir agilent usa the polymer types of the samples were identified using attenuated total reflectance atr mode the threshold quality for polymer identification was set to 0 7 2 5 quality control and blank test quality control was run throughout the sampling extraction and identification of microplastics people handling the samples wore cotton lab coats and natural latex gloves at all times all instruments and containers used at each step were of stainless steel or glass and were rinsed three times with pre filtered milli q water 0 45 µm gf f filter paper ø 47 mm all solutions including zncl2 and fe ii solutions were prepared using the pre filtered milli q water the laboratory experiment was conducted in a fume hood all open containers were covered with aluminum foil to avoid contamination with microplastics pollution from the air triplicate procedural blanks were run from the field sampling to microplastics extraction using the pre filtered milli q water as the blank control of the water samples a plastic like fiber 482 µm in size trapped on the filter and was identified as a natural fiber using a µ ft ir microscope hyperion 2000 bruker germany accordingly the detection limit of the extraction procedure was set as 0 7 particles l and the actual sample results were corrected for the blank value recovery experiments using standard microplastics as samples were also carried out the lowest quantity recovery rate was 90 table s1 and the lowest mass recovery rate was 87 table s2 2 6 statistical analyses the data were recorded using microsoft excel and then analyzed using r ver 3 6 2 kruskal wallis and mann whitney u tests were used to compare the temporal and spatial differences in the mean abundance of microplastics α 0 05 qgis ver 3 10 was used in the cartographic visualization the ldir data were subjected to non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to explore the transport behavior of microplastics in the urban river network distances were sorted using a bray curtis distance analysis two sort axes were defined to obtain the iteration results the stress value and a shepard plot were used to evaluate the results of the nmds analysis 3 results 3 1 morphological description of microplastics in total 7763 microplastics were observed by stereomicroscopy fig 2 their morphologies are summarized in fig 3 fragments 52 4 and fibers 32 5 were the most common shapes fig 3a and blue 60 5 red 10 9 and black 10 6 the most common colors fig 3b specifically the majority of the microplastics consisted of blue fibers and blue and red fragments fig 3c most 78 2 of the microplastics were 330 µm a size commonly obtained in manta trawls the median and mean sizes were 98 and 275 9 µm respectively the size and shape distribution followed similar patterns whereas a comparison of the combined size and color distribution showed a smoother distribution of fibers than of other shapes the median and mean sizes of particles other than fibers were 73 and 112 µm respectively n 5237 with 95 1 of them 330 µm in size thus as proposed in previous studies fibers can be regarded independently as microfibers sait et al 2020 neither a power law distribution nor a logarithmic normal distribution was applicable to the size distribution of the microplastics in this study kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 3 2 spatiotemporal abundance of microplastics the spatial abundances of microplastics in the surface and bottom waters from the sample sites across the four seasons are shown in fig 4 a in the surface water samples the highest mean abundance of microplastics 159 3 particles l was detected at site jh in summer whereas no microplastics were detected in the triplicate samples from site jl 0 and site wy 3 in spring in the bottom water samples microplastics abundance reached 193 3 particles l at site jl 0 in autumn whereas no microplastics were detected at site jl 3 in winter site bd 1 in spring site i in spring and site jl 1 in summer the seasonal dynamics of microplastics abundance differed significantly between spring and summer in the water column as a whole and in all areas except the upstream bottom water mann whitney u test p 0 05 the mean abundance of microplastics was significantly higher during the wet season jun 2019 and sept 2019 than during the dry season dec 2018 and mar 2019 the spatial distribution of microplastics across the year did not significantly differ as there were no significant differences between the upstream midstream and downstream areas nor between the surface and bottom waters except the vertical difference in march 2019 fig 4b from december 2018 to september 2019 the microplastics abundance mean standard deviation for the up mid and downstream of the river network ranged from 2 3 1 2 to 104 6 5 6 particles l as anthropogenic pollutants microplastics are fundamentally derived from plastic products including the emission of primary microplastics wang et al 2019 we therefore compared the quarterly accumulated growth rate of plastics products output in wuxi city and the seasonal average microplastics abundance in the river network via 0 1 normalization fig 5 the accumulated growth rate of plastics products output significantly increased during the first quarter of 2019 22 7 such that the mean abundance of microplastics correspondingly peaked in june 2019 2019 q2 104 6 particles l the curves of both normalized indexes indicated a hysteresis effect fig 5 black arrow another factor potentially affecting the abundance of microplastics in the riverine water is the variation in the amount of regional precipitation fig 5 blue line increased surface runoff due to precipitation may carry microplastics from the atmosphere and from terrestrial systems into rivers grbic et al 2020 klein and fischer 2019 wong et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 in this study the abundance of microplastics in the wet season june 2019 and september 2019 was significantly higher than during in the dry season december 2018 and march 2019 thus correlating positively with the regional accumulated daily precipitation however the region experienced a heavy rainstorm in august 2019 113 6 mm which may have diluted the concentration of microplastics in the river resulting in a drop in the average abundance of microplastics in september 2019 compared with the previous season in summary seasonal differences in microplastics abundance in the studied urban river network could be explained by urban plastic production and regional precipitation 3 3 polymer composition of the microplastics ldir identified 22 polymer types in the microplastics samples fig 6 with respect to the proportion of polymer types the seasonal spatial and vertical distributions were roughly similar and stable with silicone polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and rubber as the most abundant polymer types by number concentration previous studies on microplastics in other urban water bodies mainly detected polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet bujaczek et al 2021 peng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the corresponding abundances were calculated based on the proportion of the polymer compositions of each sample as shown in fig 6c the industrial area site i continuously contributed ptfe microplastics and rubber microplastics were mainly emitted in june 2019 our findings thus provide information on the nature of microplastics pollution in the study area 3 4 nmds analysis data standardization following the ldir analysis was not possible due to the small number of microplastics detected in a single sample and the large differences in the quantities of the detected components instead the frequency of every microplastics component identified in the samples collected at each site across the four seasons was determined with the microplastics abundance data then subjected to an nmds analysis the results are shown in fig 7 the resulting nmds models were evaluated using a shepard plot and based on the stress value which indicated that the models were reasonable fig s1 the analysis based on the abundances of the polymer components revealed that the data from the ten sampling points could be aggregated into four categories fig 7 black circles 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics high levels of microplastics pollution have been reported in the urban river networks of several countries table 1 in china microplastics pollution in urban rivers can be explained by the fact that urban areas themselves are heavily polluted by microplastics wang et al 2019 in our study the abundances of riverine microplastics in june 2019 and september 2019 wet season were 1 2 orders of magnitudes higher than in december 2018 and march 2019 dry season a pattern was also observed in other temporal investigations eo et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2018 our study demonstrated that in the urban river network the temporal variation of microplastics abundance in riverine water could be attributed to the combined effect of the temporal variation in regional precipitation and urban plastic production the spatial distribution of microplastics abundance reflected the differences in the microplastics burden across the sampling sites the commercial area site c has the highest population density in the river network area which accounted for the high level of microplastics occurrence at this site at the wwtp effluent outlet site w and the canal site jh large volume inflows of plastics together with a busy waterway carr et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 located in the midstream of the river network results in high abundances of microplastics at the urban rural fringe area site jl 0 and bd 0 the population size is relatively small but poor environmental management may be responsible for the high level of microplastics contamination in the industrial area site i the abundance of microplastics in the water column was highly stratified fig 4 with high abundances in the surface water and low abundances in the bottom water this may reflect the placement of an effluent outlet near the surface of the water column fig s2 a common practice of the area s factories furthermore the high water flow velocity of these outlets causes microplastics within the effluent to be transported downstream before sinking however differences in the abundance of microplastics throughout the water column of the urban river network area were only slightly significant fig 6 thus illustrating the complex vertical distribution of microplastics in river waters 4 2 compositions and transport behavior of microplastics in an urban river network we used a novel detection method ldir to identify and semi quantify microplastics in the urban river network the agilent 8700 ldir chemical imaging system uses a quantum cascade laser qcl combined with a point detector and rapidly scanning optics the instrument can automatically obtain a microparticle s ir spectrum identify its polymer type within 8 s and generate a report fig s3 currently only four studies have been reported in which ldir was used to analyze microplastics in soil n 34 li et al 2021 coastal water n 20 scircle et al 2020 groundwater n 21 samandra et al 2022 and animal intestinal tissue n 3 hua et al 2021 therefore this study may be the first to employ ldir to analyze microplastics in river water and the sample scale was the largest n 40 in ldir workflow in this study 808 microplastics were detected and identified using ldir compared with 2782 determined using stereomicroscopy since the filter area used in the ldir detection 10 mm 10 mm accounted for only 8 of the whole filter ø 47 mm the abundance of microplastics determined by ldir may have been 3 63 times higher than determined by the traditional stereomicroscopy exam as this was a pilot study of a novel detection method the abundance of microplastics was also determined visually in the future ldir analysis workflow may become the preferred mode of analysis of microplastics polymer type and abundance in the environment the most abundant polymer types silicone and ptfe detected in the microplastics analyzed in this study were less commonly identified in similar studies using ftir or raman spectroscopy in polymer identification in which the ranking was pe pp ps klein et al 2015 koelmans et al 2019 lin et al 2018 mintenig et al 2020 wang et al 2020 silicone is a common component of personal care products cookware and other consumer goods and has been detected in the effluents of wwtps including in a large north american city grbic et al 2020 ptfe is widely used in electrical appliances machinery and many industrial applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance but it has a long half life in the environment moreover ptfe is a class 3 carcinogen although its effects on human and aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood ptfe cannot be detected by ftir mani et al 2019 but it can be detected by ldir which showed that it was the second most abundant polymer in the wwtp effluent thus ptfe contamination in the environment should be regularly assessed using the appropriate detection methods other parameters of the microplastics were also assessed including polymer abundance and area both of which could be estimated using the ldir data fig s4 in terms of the surface area of the particles silicone rubber pp ptfe polyethylene terephthalate pet and pe were the predominant polymer types table s3 relatively high abundances and areas were determined for silicone ptfe and rubber consistent with their being the main components of microplastics in the studied urban river network pp and pe ranked 2nd and 6th in polymer area respectively but their low abundances suggested that the individual pp or pe microplastic particles in the samples were larger allowing them to be readily detected using traditional methods based on manual sorting i e visual observation and ftir raman spectroscopy according to the nmds analysis fig 7 the coordinate distances of the surface water and bottom water at the same sampling site were close the exception was the wwtp sites w s and w b which indicated that the microplastics composition in the water column at these sites was mostly homogeneous since the effluent outlet of the wwtp was located near the surface of the water column fig s5 water samples from sampling point w s consisted mainly of wwtp effluent samples from the commercial area c s c b and w s were classified within the same group but were separated from the bottom water of the wwtp w b indicating that microplastics in the wwtp effluent mainly derived from the urban commercial area the aggregation of samples from the industrial area i s i b with those obtained downstream in the wangyu river wy 4 s wy 4 b suggested that microplastics in the latter were mainly industrial in their origin calcium stearate chlorinated polyethylene ptfe pu pet chlorinated polyethylene eva silicone and pa were the main polymer types the wy 4 site was located at the entrance of the wangyu river s mainstream towards taihu lake thus according to the nmds analysis the largest source of microplastics flowing into taihu lake via the river network is the industrial area 4 3 microplastics contamination from the wwtp effluent given the critical role of the wwtp in releasing microplastics into the river network the microplastics in its wwtp effluent were examined in greater detail the w s sampling site represented the effluent outlet of one of the largest wwtps in wuxi city microplastics in the surface water from this site were mostly blue and red fragments and fibers the mean annual abundance of microplastics was 52 2 particles l among the 14 polymer types identified in the respective samples by ldir silicone ptfe and polyurethane pu made up the largest share as pu is mainly used as foams elastomers and fibers but it is also a component of paint chips such that paint spalling may have accounted for the pu microplastics in the samples corcoran et al 2020 pu monomers have been classified as carcinogenic mutagenic or both their environmental and health effects have raised serious concern wright and kelly 2017 the shapes and colors of microplastics in the wwtp effluents analyzed in studies conducted in other regions were similar to those in our study whereas the polymer types identified using traditional methods differed table 2 raman spectroscopy and ftir of those wwtp effluent samples mostly identified pp and pe while the components detected by fpa ftir were diverse our analysis using ldir demonstrated that 1 microplastics in wwtp effluents differ in their spatial distribution and their source and 2 there is a need for unified and standardized methods of microplastics analysis to allow comparisons of the results of different studies 5 conclusions our investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in a typical urban river network in china revealed a strong temporal variability in terms of the abundance of microplastics at the different sampling sites the high abundances during the wet season and low abundances during the dry season could be explained by the hysteresis effect of urban plastic production and the variation in regional precipitation the smooth spatial variability of microplastics abundance both longitudinally and vertically was demonstrated as well according to the ldir analysis the predominant polymer types in the microplastics isolated from the urban river network were silicone ptfe rubber and pp but other unusual polymer types were identified as well in the wwtp effluent lidr detected silicone ptfe and pu as the major components of the microplastics an nmds analysis based on the abundances of microplastic polymer types suggested that microplastics released in the commercial area were mainly transported to the wwtp and microplastics from the industrial area mainly to the mainstream of the river network the process used in our analysis suggests a new approach to the study of the transport

210023 china corresponding authors microplastics contamination in the environment is a global problem but little is known about their dynamics in urban river networks an important site of microplastics occurrence and harboring complex transport pathways in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of microplastics in a typical urban river network in eastern china from december 2018 to september 2019 microplastics abundance mean standard deviation in the river network ranged from 2 3 1 2 to 104 6 5 6 particles l and was significantly higher during the wet than during the dry season the distribution of microplastics in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river network did not significantly differ nor did the abundance of microplastics in the surface water vs the bottom water however high abundances were determined in commercial and industrial areas at a wastewater treatment plant outlet in an urban canal and in an urban rural fringe area the seasonal dynamics of the overall abundance of microplastics could be explained by the hysteresis effect of urban plastic production and the variation in regional precipitation 78 2 of the microplastics were 330 µm in size the most common colors were blue and black and the most common shapes were fragments and fibers the polymer types of the microplastics were assessed using laser direct infrared ldir a novel chemical imaging system that identified silicone rubber polytetrafluoroethylene and polypropylene as the main components of the microplastics a non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on the abundance of the polymer components across samples showed aggregations of sampling sites that indicated the possible sources of the microplastics our study provides insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in an urban river network and suggests the potential of ldir in the accurate quantitative analysis of microplastics in the environment graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics urban river network dynamics laser direct infrared 1 introduction as an emerging pollutant microplastics plastic particles 5 mm in size have raised global concern because of their ubiquity and potentially adverse effects on the environment browne et al 2010 sutherland et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 and human health wu et al 2019 an estimated 80 of the microplastic particles found in the world s oceans are discharged via rivers nocon et al 2020 but the occurrence and transport of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have not been well studied consequently little is known about 1 the presence and distribution of microplastics in these systems and 2 the transport pathways and factors that affect microplastics distribution eerkes medrano et al 2015 among the few studies of microplastics in freshwater systems the majority have focused on large lakes and rivers whereas urban river networks have been largely ignored in part due to their complex hydrology however because urban river networks are highly connected to the terrestrial environment and thus to the sites of plastics production use and emission dikareva and simon 2019 they are important conduits of microplastics pollution anthropogenic activities account for the generation and discharge of microplastics baensch baltruschat et al 2020 hernandez et al 2017 in urban river networks the presence of microplastics has been traced to household and industrial sewage discharge the loss of feedstocks used to manufacture plastic products and the breakdown of larger plastic items eerkes medrano et al 2015 in addition while nearly all microplastics entering municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are removed from the influent the load remaining in the effluent is still large enough to pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems and may account for a large share of the microplastics transported by urban rivers to downstream aquatic environments sun et al 2019 studies on the temporal variation of microplastics in urban freshwater systems have been carried out in east asia choong et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 south asia napper et al 2021 europe de carvalho et al 2021 hurley et al 2018 north america baldwin et al 2016 ballent et al 2016 and africa mbedzi et al 2020 nonetheless there have been few long term investigations as such studies are both time consuming and expensive moreover due to differences in the sampling and detection methods used to assess microplastics in the environment the comparability of the data is poor including for urban freshwater systems given the importance of urban river networks in mediating the environmental distribution of microplastics in this study a typical urban river network in eastern china served as a model system for investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of microplastics in riverine waters over a 1 year period the most common techniques used to study microplastics include stereomicroscopy for visual observation and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy for polymer identification gong and xie 2020 among the more recently developed methods used to identify the components of microplastics are pyrolysis gas chromatography mass py gc ms and focal plane array based fourier transform infrared fpa ftir imaging hendrickson et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 simon et al 2018 laser direct infrared ldir a novel method for the automated detection of microplastics was introduced in 2018 and has been applied in several studies of microplastics contamination in a groundwater aquifer samandra et al 2022 at coastal sites scircle et al 2020 in agricultural soil li et al 2021 and in mammalian intestinal tissue li et al 2021 nonetheless there are no published investigations of microplastics in the urban river network as determined using ldir in this study we combined ldir with a traditional microscopy exam in order to improve the accuracy and speed of detection of microplastics polymer types 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study site was the wangyu river network wuxi china the only diversion channel linking the yangtze river the largest river in china and taihu lake the third largest freshwater lake in china the river network has an area of 500 km2 and covers the main urban urban rural fringe and rural areas of wuxi city located on the yangtze river delta wuxi is one of the most developed cities in china and its population density 2000 people km2 in 2017 is among the highest in the country the grand canal one of the busiest shipping channels in china crosses the river network previous investigations of microplastics in the surface water of taihu lake using different sampling and extraction methods determined an abundance of 3 4 25 8 particles l in august 2015 and 0 53 particles l from august to september 2018 the microplastics levels measured in plankton net samples collected from taihu lake are among the highest reported in freshwater lakes worldwide li et al 2019 su et al 2016 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the average abundance of microplastics from november to december 2017 was 4 92 105 particles km2 xiong et al 2019 2 2 sample collection the sampling sites and water flow are shown in fig 1 the 17 sampling sites consisted of 1 mainstream wangyu river sites wy 1 4 2 primary tributaries jiuli river and bodu river sites jl 1 3 and bd 1 3 2 secondary tributaries sites jl 0 and bd 0 and 5 other representative sites a commercial area site c an industrial area site i a wastewater treatment effluent outlet site w the grand canal site jh and a rural area site r the whole river network was divided into three parts according to its flows the upstream sites c jl 1 bd 1 and w the midstream sites jl 0 jl 2 jl 3 bd 0 bd 2 bd 3 i r and jh and the downstream sites wy 1 4 water samples were collected in december 2018 and in march june and september 2019 corresponding to winter spring summer and autumn 2 l of riverine surface water and 2 l of bottom water were collected from each of the 17 sites using a standard rutter water sampler hydro bios germany and then transferred into purified glass bottles in total 136 water samples were finally collected water quality indicators total phosphorus total nitrogen chlorophyll a electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential dissolved oxygen temperature and turbidity were measured simultaneously using a multi parameter analyzer lh 3ba lianhua technology china and a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer aaq 177 jfe advantech japan local meteorological and air quality data were acquired from a local meteorological station plastic industry data were obtained from the annual report of wuxi city 2 3 microplastics extraction microplastics in the samples were extracted based on the protocol of the us noaa masura 2015 with slight modifications in detail 500 ml of a well mixed water sample was transferred in triplicate to 500 ml glass beakers which were then covered loosely with aluminum foil and placed in a 50 c drying oven for 48 h the dried samples were mixed with 20 ml of iron solution fe ii 0 05 m and 20 ml of 30 h2o2 and allowed to stand for 96 h with regular stirring to digest labile organic matter the microplastics in the samples were obtained by density separation in zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 1 8 g ml the floating layer was filtered onto a polycarbonate filter 5 µm ø 47 mm millipore using a vacuum pump the filter was covered with a clean glass petri dish and air dried for 24 h the extracted microplastics were then examined using a stereomicroscope mz62 guangzhou mshot photoelectric technology china and their size maximum length in one dimension shape and color were recorded 2 4 polymer composition identification ldir is a novel and automated approach to identifying the polymer types in microplastics it is less labor intensive than ftir and raman spectroscopy but its accuracy and efficiency in component detection are higher than either of these traditional methods nonetheless to reduce the time and economic costs associated with the analysis five key sites sites c i w wy 1 and wy 4 from the 17 sites included in the study were selected to identify the polymer composition of the collected microplastics using ldir for each sample a 10 mm 10 mm square was cut from each filter using a stainless steel blade and then transferred into a 1 5 ml glass crimp top vial perkinelmer usa the triplicate samples were pooled such that the four sampling periods and the two positions of the water column surface and bottom from the five sites resulted in 40 samples in total the samples were preserved by the addition of 0 2 ml of absolute ethyl alcohol and then analyzed in an ldir automatic chemical imaging system 8700 ldir agilent usa the polymer types of the samples were identified using attenuated total reflectance atr mode the threshold quality for polymer identification was set to 0 7 2 5 quality control and blank test quality control was run throughout the sampling extraction and identification of microplastics people handling the samples wore cotton lab coats and natural latex gloves at all times all instruments and containers used at each step were of stainless steel or glass and were rinsed three times with pre filtered milli q water 0 45 µm gf f filter paper ø 47 mm all solutions including zncl2 and fe ii solutions were prepared using the pre filtered milli q water the laboratory experiment was conducted in a fume hood all open containers were covered with aluminum foil to avoid contamination with microplastics pollution from the air triplicate procedural blanks were run from the field sampling to microplastics extraction using the pre filtered milli q water as the blank control of the water samples a plastic like fiber 482 µm in size trapped on the filter and was identified as a natural fiber using a µ ft ir microscope hyperion 2000 bruker germany accordingly the detection limit of the extraction procedure was set as 0 7 particles l and the actual sample results were corrected for the blank value recovery experiments using standard microplastics as samples were also carried out the lowest quantity recovery rate was 90 table s1 and the lowest mass recovery rate was 87 table s2 2 6 statistical analyses the data were recorded using microsoft excel and then analyzed using r ver 3 6 2 kruskal wallis and mann whitney u tests were used to compare the temporal and spatial differences in the mean abundance of microplastics α 0 05 qgis ver 3 10 was used in the cartographic visualization the ldir data were subjected to non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to explore the transport behavior of microplastics in the urban river network distances were sorted using a bray curtis distance analysis two sort axes were defined to obtain the iteration results the stress value and a shepard plot were used to evaluate the results of the nmds analysis 3 results 3 1 morphological description of microplastics in total 7763 microplastics were observed by stereomicroscopy fig 2 their morphologies are summarized in fig 3 fragments 52 4 and fibers 32 5 were the most common shapes fig 3a and blue 60 5 red 10 9 and black 10 6 the most common colors fig 3b specifically the majority of the microplastics consisted of blue fibers and blue and red fragments fig 3c most 78 2 of the microplastics were 330 µm a size commonly obtained in manta trawls the median and mean sizes were 98 and 275 9 µm respectively the size and shape distribution followed similar patterns whereas a comparison of the combined size and color distribution showed a smoother distribution of fibers than of other shapes the median and mean sizes of particles other than fibers were 73 and 112 µm respectively n 5237 with 95 1 of them 330 µm in size thus as proposed in previous studies fibers can be regarded independently as microfibers sait et al 2020 neither a power law distribution nor a logarithmic normal distribution was applicable to the size distribution of the microplastics in this study kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 3 2 spatiotemporal abundance of microplastics the spatial abundances of microplastics in the surface and bottom waters from the sample sites across the four seasons are shown in fig 4 a in the surface water samples the highest mean abundance of microplastics 159 3 particles l was detected at site jh in summer whereas no microplastics were detected in the triplicate samples from site jl 0 and site wy 3 in spring in the bottom water samples microplastics abundance reached 193 3 particles l at site jl 0 in autumn whereas no microplastics were detected at site jl 3 in winter site bd 1 in spring site i in spring and site jl 1 in summer the seasonal dynamics of microplastics abundance differed significantly between spring and summer in the water column as a whole and in all areas except the upstream bottom water mann whitney u test p 0 05 the mean abundance of microplastics was significantly higher during the wet season jun 2019 and sept 2019 than during the dry season dec 2018 and mar 2019 the spatial distribution of microplastics across the year did not significantly differ as there were no significant differences between the upstream midstream and downstream areas nor between the surface and bottom waters except the vertical difference in march 2019 fig 4b from december 2018 to september 2019 the microplastics abundance mean standard deviation for the up mid and downstream of the river network ranged from 2 3 1 2 to 104 6 5 6 particles l as anthropogenic pollutants microplastics are fundamentally derived from plastic products including the emission of primary microplastics wang et al 2019 we therefore compared the quarterly accumulated growth rate of plastics products output in wuxi city and the seasonal average microplastics abundance in the river network via 0 1 normalization fig 5 the accumulated growth rate of plastics products output significantly increased during the first quarter of 2019 22 7 such that the mean abundance of microplastics correspondingly peaked in june 2019 2019 q2 104 6 particles l the curves of both normalized indexes indicated a hysteresis effect fig 5 black arrow another factor potentially affecting the abundance of microplastics in the riverine water is the variation in the amount of regional precipitation fig 5 blue line increased surface runoff due to precipitation may carry microplastics from the atmosphere and from terrestrial systems into rivers grbic et al 2020 klein and fischer 2019 wong et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 in this study the abundance of microplastics in the wet season june 2019 and september 2019 was significantly higher than during in the dry season december 2018 and march 2019 thus correlating positively with the regional accumulated daily precipitation however the region experienced a heavy rainstorm in august 2019 113 6 mm which may have diluted the concentration of microplastics in the river resulting in a drop in the average abundance of microplastics in september 2019 compared with the previous season in summary seasonal differences in microplastics abundance in the studied urban river network could be explained by urban plastic production and regional precipitation 3 3 polymer composition of the microplastics ldir identified 22 polymer types in the microplastics samples fig 6 with respect to the proportion of polymer types the seasonal spatial and vertical distributions were roughly similar and stable with silicone polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and rubber as the most abundant polymer types by number concentration previous studies on microplastics in other urban water bodies mainly detected polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet bujaczek et al 2021 peng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the corresponding abundances were calculated based on the proportion of the polymer compositions of each sample as shown in fig 6c the industrial area site i continuously contributed ptfe microplastics and rubber microplastics were mainly emitted in june 2019 our findings thus provide information on the nature of microplastics pollution in the study area 3 4 nmds analysis data standardization following the ldir analysis was not possible due to the small number of microplastics detected in a single sample and the large differences in the quantities of the detected components instead the frequency of every microplastics component identified in the samples collected at each site across the four seasons was determined with the microplastics abundance data then subjected to an nmds analysis the results are shown in fig 7 the resulting nmds models were evaluated using a shepard plot and based on the stress value which indicated that the models were reasonable fig s1 the analysis based on the abundances of the polymer components revealed that the data from the ten sampling points could be aggregated into four categories fig 7 black circles 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics high levels of microplastics pollution have been reported in the urban river networks of several countries table 1 in china microplastics pollution in urban rivers can be explained by the fact that urban areas themselves are heavily polluted by microplastics wang et al 2019 in our study the abundances of riverine microplastics in june 2019 and september 2019 wet season were 1 2 orders of magnitudes higher than in december 2018 and march 2019 dry season a pattern was also observed in other temporal investigations eo et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2018 our study demonstrated that in the urban river network the temporal variation of microplastics abundance in riverine water could be attributed to the combined effect of the temporal variation in regional precipitation and urban plastic production the spatial distribution of microplastics abundance reflected the differences in the microplastics burden across the sampling sites the commercial area site c has the highest population density in the river network area which accounted for the high level of microplastics occurrence at this site at the wwtp effluent outlet site w and the canal site jh large volume inflows of plastics together with a busy waterway carr et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 located in the midstream of the river network results in high abundances of microplastics at the urban rural fringe area site jl 0 and bd 0 the population size is relatively small but poor environmental management may be responsible for the high level of microplastics contamination in the industrial area site i the abundance of microplastics in the water column was highly stratified fig 4 with high abundances in the surface water and low abundances in the bottom water this may reflect the placement of an effluent outlet near the surface of the water column fig s2 a common practice of the area s factories furthermore the high water flow velocity of these outlets causes microplastics within the effluent to be transported downstream before sinking however differences in the abundance of microplastics throughout the water column of the urban river network area were only slightly significant fig 6 thus illustrating the complex vertical distribution of microplastics in river waters 4 2 compositions and transport behavior of microplastics in an urban river network we used a novel detection method ldir to identify and semi quantify microplastics in the urban river network the agilent 8700 ldir chemical imaging system uses a quantum cascade laser qcl combined with a point detector and rapidly scanning optics the instrument can automatically obtain a microparticle s ir spectrum identify its polymer type within 8 s and generate a report fig s3 currently only four studies have been reported in which ldir was used to analyze microplastics in soil n 34 li et al 2021 coastal water n 20 scircle et al 2020 groundwater n 21 samandra et al 2022 and animal intestinal tissue n 3 hua et al 2021 therefore this study may be the first to employ ldir to analyze microplastics in river water and the sample scale was the largest n 40 in ldir workflow in this study 808 microplastics were detected and identified using ldir compared with 2782 determined using stereomicroscopy since the filter area used in the ldir detection 10 mm 10 mm accounted for only 8 of the whole filter ø 47 mm the abundance of microplastics determined by ldir may have been 3 63 times higher than determined by the traditional stereomicroscopy exam as this was a pilot study of a novel detection method the abundance of microplastics was also determined visually in the future ldir analysis workflow may become the preferred mode of analysis of microplastics polymer type and abundance in the environment the most abundant polymer types silicone and ptfe detected in the microplastics analyzed in this study were less commonly identified in similar studies using ftir or raman spectroscopy in polymer identification in which the ranking was pe pp ps klein et al 2015 koelmans et al 2019 lin et al 2018 mintenig et al 2020 wang et al 2020 silicone is a common component of personal care products cookware and other consumer goods and has been detected in the effluents of wwtps including in a large north american city grbic et al 2020 ptfe is widely used in electrical appliances machinery and many industrial applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance but it has a long half life in the environment moreover ptfe is a class 3 carcinogen although its effects on human and aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood ptfe cannot be detected by ftir mani et al 2019 but it can be detected by ldir which showed that it was the second most abundant polymer in the wwtp effluent thus ptfe contamination in the environment should be regularly assessed using the appropriate detection methods other parameters of the microplastics were also assessed including polymer abundance and area both of which could be estimated using the ldir data fig s4 in terms of the surface area of the particles silicone rubber pp ptfe polyethylene terephthalate pet and pe were the predominant polymer types table s3 relatively high abundances and areas were determined for silicone ptfe and rubber consistent with their being the main components of microplastics in the studied urban river network pp and pe ranked 2nd and 6th in polymer area respectively but their low abundances suggested that the individual pp or pe microplastic particles in the samples were larger allowing them to be readily detected using traditional methods based on manual sorting i e visual observation and ftir raman spectroscopy according to the nmds analysis fig 7 the coordinate distances of the surface water and bottom water at the same sampling site were close the exception was the wwtp sites w s and w b which indicated that the microplastics composition in the water column at these sites was mostly homogeneous since the effluent outlet of the wwtp was located near the surface of the water column fig s5 water samples from sampling point w s consisted mainly of wwtp effluent samples from the commercial area c s c b and w s were classified within the same group but were separated from the bottom water of the wwtp w b indicating that microplastics in the wwtp effluent mainly derived from the urban commercial area the aggregation of samples from the industrial area i s i b with those obtained downstream in the wangyu river wy 4 s wy 4 b suggested that microplastics in the latter were mainly industrial in their origin calcium stearate chlorinated polyethylene ptfe pu pet chlorinated polyethylene eva silicone and pa were the main polymer types the wy 4 site was located at the entrance of the wangyu river s mainstream towards taihu lake thus according to the nmds analysis the largest source of microplastics flowing into taihu lake via the river network is the industrial area 4 3 microplastics contamination from the wwtp effluent given the critical role of the wwtp in releasing microplastics into the river network the microplastics in its wwtp effluent were examined in greater detail the w s sampling site represented the effluent outlet of one of the largest wwtps in wuxi city microplastics in the surface water from this site were mostly blue and red fragments and fibers the mean annual abundance of microplastics was 52 2 particles l among the 14 polymer types identified in the respective samples by ldir silicone ptfe and polyurethane pu made up the largest share as pu is mainly used as foams elastomers and fibers but it is also a component of paint chips such that paint spalling may have accounted for the pu microplastics in the samples corcoran et al 2020 pu monomers have been classified as carcinogenic mutagenic or both their environmental and health effects have raised serious concern wright and kelly 2017 the shapes and colors of microplastics in the wwtp effluents analyzed in studies conducted in other regions were similar to those in our study whereas the polymer types identified using traditional methods differed table 2 raman spectroscopy and ftir of those wwtp effluent samples mostly identified pp and pe while the components detected by fpa ftir were diverse our analysis using ldir demonstrated that 1 microplastics in wwtp effluents differ in their spatial distribution and their source and 2 there is a need for unified and standardized methods of microplastics analysis to allow comparisons of the results of different studies 5 conclusions our investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in a typical urban river network in china revealed a strong temporal variability in terms of the abundance of microplastics at the different sampling sites the high abundances during the wet season and low abundances during the dry season could be explained by the hysteresis effect of urban plastic production and the variation in regional precipitation the smooth spatial variability of microplastics abundance both longitudinally and vertically was demonstrated as well according to the ldir analysis the predominant polymer types in the microplastics isolated from the urban river network were silicone ptfe rubber and pp but other unusual polymer types were identified as well in the wwtp effluent lidr detected silicone ptfe and pu as the major components of the microplastics an nmds analysis based on the abundances of microplastic polymer types suggested that microplastics released in the commercial area were mainly transported to the wwtp and microplastics from the industrial area mainly to the mainstream of the river network the process used in our analysis suggests a new approach to the study of the transport
