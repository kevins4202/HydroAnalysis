2770,the salt lakes fed by the nalenggele river in the qaidam basin located on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau qtp are major brine lithium reservoirs in china the quantitative identifications of the li sources and their dynamic behavior shed light on the formation mechanism of the brine li deposits in closed basin of arid regions this study presents li and sr isotope ratios δ7li 87sr 86sr and other hydrogeochemical parameters for river waters springs spring river waters shallow groundwaters surface brines and intercrystalline brines around the nalenggele river basin nrb and its adjacent small watersheds the results indicate that the nalenggele river water is a mixing product of hot springs and regional surface meltwater and the source of dissolved li in the nrb is mainly supplied by the hot springs with multi tracer models it is confirmed that around 84 9 93 4 of dissolved li is provided by the li rich hot spring waters which account for only 3 5 of the total water input furthermore the dissolved li in the streams of different hydrological regions shows various isotopic fractionation behavior in general the lower average δ7li values average of 5 6 with more enriched li with respect to na in the waters of the piedmont gobi region indicates a significant additional input of dissolved li from bedrock and sediments the second stage alluvial fan of the nrb produces 7li enrichments and li depleted waters compared with na which can be explained by the adsorption of clay or fe mn oxide phases that fractionate li isotopes the highest average δ7li values 12 76 are observed when li is not adsorbed by the scarce fine clastic sediments in the hypersaline environment of the salt lake region it can be concluded that the continuous halite precipitation during the brine evolution not only causes the abnormal enrichment of li in the brine compared with na but also continuously sequesters the 6li from the brines resulting in a significant 7li enrichment overall these findings advance the understanding of the lithium sources of li rich brines and its enrichment and metallogenic process during water migration in hyper arid regions and have crucial indicative significance for lithium cycling under a strong evaporation environment keywords stable isotopes end member mixing analysis geochemical behavior lithium brines qaidam basin qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lithium is a critical and technologically important element used in batteries the nuclear industry ceramics glass medicine aerospace and other fields with the soaring demand for lithium resources in the global market recently the trend of resource bottleneck is highlighted kesler et al 2012 munk et al 2016 lithium rich brines are the planet s most economically recoverable li source munk et al 2016 boschetti 2022 therefore it is essential to understand the genesis of these deposits to develop exploration models for the continued discovery of new deposits however the quantitative identifications of the li sources and their dynamic behavior in the surface environment are challenging owing to the diffuse discharge from phreatic water tables and complex surface flow patterns in arid regions generally applying geochemical methods such as chemical concentrations and some light stable isotopes helps identify mixing processes of distinct water sources and hydrochemical evolutionary trends bakari et al 2013 however these may not work well in arid or super arid environments because the evapo concentration effects and the biologically mitigated processes can modify surface flow and shallow groundwater compositions thus the water chemistry and the light stable isotopes can be strongly altered in these environments bakari et al 2013 meredith et al 2013 paces and wurster 2014 recently the introduction of li and sr isotopes systematics as a tool for identifying various water sources and tracing their interactions in these complex hydrologic settings provides a new angle to examine such problems boschetti et al 2018 even in carbonate catchment lithium is mainly hosted in silicate minerals kisakurek et al 2005 millot et al 2010 and is not involved in biological turnover lemarchand et al 2010 there are two stable isotopes of 6li and 7li with natural abundances of 7 5 and 92 5 respectively isotopic variations are expressed as δ7li lithium is a mobile element that tends preferentially to go into the fluid phase during water rock interactions the relative mass difference between the two isotopes is considerable at 17 gou et al 2019 generating significant low temperature mass fractionation at the earth s surface which provides critical information on the nature of weathering processes huh et al 2004 millot et al 2010 recent studies have shown that lithium isotope fractionation is strongly affected by secondary mineral formation rather than mineral dissolution or lithology differences in the catchment huh et al 2001 ryu et al 2014 wimpenny et al 2015 gou et al 2019 based on the characteristics of significant isotopic fractionation among reservoirs and distinct fractionation mechanisms it has been suggested that lithium isotopes can be used to trace silicate weathering processes huh et al 2001 kisakurek et al 2005 vigier et al 2009 millot et al 2010 gou et al 2019 paleo weathering conditions pogge von strandmann et al 2017 and water sediments exchange processes wimpenny et al 2010 tipper et al 2012 in comparison sr isotopes have been more widely used in hydrogeochemistry because they are less affected by meteoric loading variations and biological and low temperature abiotic chemical reactions bakari et al 2013 meredith et al 2013 paces and wurster 2014 therefore the combinative analysis of the two isotopic systems can provide more and deeper insights into the origin of li rich water the regional water mixing mechanism and the genesis model of li rich brine deposits meredith et al 2013 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp in china is an important li b rich brine distribution zone and the lithium reservoir ranks third in size around the world after bolivia and chile accounting for about 30 of the total reserves on earth he et al 2020 among the qtp lithium reserves the terminal lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes of nalenggele river in qaidam basin are the most important li b rich brine deposits in china zhang 1987 in recent years along with the surging demands for lithium in batteries significant efforts have been directed toward investigating regional geology lithium sources enrichment mechanisms brines evolution processes lithium extraction technologies etc zhang 1987 zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 like other li rich brines in the world the regional tectonic analysis and geochemical data indicate that the li b in the terminal lakes of nalenggele river is fed by hydrothermal fluids from surrounding mountains i e the bugedaban mountain in the kunlun tectonic belt of hoh xil basin zhu et al 1989 munk et al 2011 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 wei et al 2014 however the quantitative identification of primary recharge sources contributing dissolved li to the discharge zone of the nalenggele river is still inadequate especially for the surface weathering sources in addition although intense evaporation has been widely recognized as the decisive factor in promoting the abnormal enrichment of lithium in saline lake brines zhang 1987 munk et al 2011 the dynamic behavior of dissolved lithium in the surface processes and its constraints are still rarely involved in this paper we performed a comprehensive study of isotopes δ7li 87sr 86sr and the chemical composition of various water bodies within different evaporation degrees around the terminal li rich salt lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes to investigate the origin of lithium and its dynamic behavior in surface processes in the nalenggele river basin nrb of the central qaidam basin this work builds upon the general ideas of previous works for the source of dissolved lithium in the nrb and further quantitatively explains the lithium source meanwhile the dynamic fractionation behavior of dissolved lithium in the migration process was also evaluated for the first time these findings are anticipated to be extensively referred to in future studies on arid zone systems with li rich features 2 general setting 2 1 geological settings the qaidam basin located in the northern qtp is the largest intermontane endorheic arid basin in qtp with an average altitude of 2800 m and a drainage area of about 250 000 km2 fig 1 a b it is enclosed by aljun mountains in the northwest east kunlun mountains in the south and qilian mountains in the northeast fig 1b the prevailing northwest wind and southwest wind intense solar radiation up to 680 kj cm2 a and dry cold climate conditions lead to extremely high evaporation precipitation ratios up to 200 in the basin which is very conducive to the formation of evaporite resources zhang 1987 and the development of clean energy industry such as solar energy and wind energy the qaidam basin contains 27 salt lakes with various salt resources including potassium lithium magnesium sodium etc many of which are linked via thick salt beds and brines fig 1b chen and bowler 1986 zhang 1987 seventy nine inland rivers of different scales including 42 seasonal and 37 perennial rivers provide many soluble materials to the qaidam basin li 2020 constrained by topography and neotectonic movements the river system in qaidam basin radiates centripetally most larger rivers are mainly distributed in the north and east of the east kunlun mountains they are primarily supplied by meltwater and meteoric water and are greatly affected by seasonal fluctuation tan et al 2020 the nalenggele river located southwest of the qaidam basin has the most considerable annual runoff of 12 9 108 m3 a and a drainage area of 21898 km2 in the qaidam basin with a length of 435 km xu 2015 the drainage area can be divided into three subzones in geomorphology fig 1b c yang et al 1993 miao et al 2016 1 mountains are present primarily on the south sides of the terminal lakes of nalenggele river which are underlain primarily by proterozoic gneiss and schist and upper paleozoic sandstone and carbonate rocks and that were widely intruded by felsic igneous rocks of the caledonian variscan indosinian and yanshanian orogenies fissures in the bedrock produce local bedrock aquifer 2 gobi zones are located primarily on the north side of the piedmont and consist of ancient alluvial pluvial fans the lithology of this region is dominated by glutenite and gravel strata which constitute the principal phreatic aquifer of the piedmont clinoplains 3 alluvial lacustrine plains are primarily distributed as nw se trending belts with widths of 80 120 km on the north side of the gobi zones moreover the terminal li rich salt lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes of nalenggele river are in the northernmost part of the plain most of these plains are used for farming and grazing and contain numerous springs sand gravelly sand clayey sand clay and evaporites are the primary lithologic types in this area 2 2 climate and hydrogeological settings the nalenggele river basin is a typical cold arid region characterized by scarce precipitation intense evaporation and wind all year round the average annual temperature and precipitation of the catchment are 3 5 and 29 8 mm respectively rainfall events mainly occur from may to september accounting for 87 of the annual precipitation and the distribution is uneven the mean annual evaporation is 1679 mm more than 56 times the yearly mean precipitation xu 2015 the west or southwest wind dominated in this area from january to september and the southwest or northwest wind from september to january of the following year with annual average wind speeds of 3 m s from march to may every year there are often gales of force eight or above data from the local weather station the nalenggele river and dazaohuo river both originated from the east kunlun mountains are the main surface water flowing through the three subzones of the drainage area fig 1c the upper reaches of the nalenggele river are formed by the mainstream which is named chulakealagan river and fed by meltwater and meteoric water and some tributaries the hongshui river is the most important tributary of the nalenggele river due to its high li and b content and more significant flow it converges with the mainstream at the end of nalenggele valley fig 1c although the li and b content in nalenggele river has decreased due to the inflow of other tributaries with meltwater and meteoric water sources in the process of river discharge to salt lakes the li and b contents of river water after the kunlun mountain pass is still higher than other surrounding rivers or world river average value in magnitude degree zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2020 the dazaohuo river has an annual runoff of 0 52 108 m3 a and a drainage area of 2500 km2 with a length of 130 km it is supplied by meltwater meteoric water and groundwater in mountain regions and discharged into senie lake fig 1c shi et al 2021 moreover after flowing out of kunlun mountain a large volume of river water infiltrates to recharge groundwater in the gobi zone then the remaining runoff converges with the re emerging groundwater at the low relief of the wetland zone in front of the alluvial lacustrine plains to form spring rivers fig 1c besides being influenced by the groundwater gushing there are a lot of springs and spring rivers in the wetland area the wutumeiren river drainage area of 6218 km2 and runoff of 1 01 108 m3 a and the east taijinaier river drainage area of 832 km2 and runoff of 8 78 106 m3 a are the larger ones among them fig 1c xu 2015 li 2020 the former originates from the upwelling groundwater influenced by the nalenggele river which mainly supplies senie lake the latter is primarily affected by meltwater and bedrock fissure water on the north slope of east kunlun mountain the runoff of the nalenggele river and a large number of spring rivers flow into the east taijinaier river in its middle reaches and then becomes the main supply river of the east tajinaier lake and the west taijinaier lake further because of the uplift of the nabei anticline a two stage alluvial fan system was developed in the nalenggele drainage area fig 1c the first stage alluvial fan fsaf is from the kunlun mountain pass to the nabei structure with an area of 1470 km2 and an elevation drop of 320 m yu et al 2013 a local groundwater circulation system is also formed here due to the obstruction of the nabei uplift fig 1d at the same time the east taijinaier river flows eastward along with the nabei structure because of the blocking effects it then turns north at the end of the structure discharging into the salt lake region and a second stage alluvial fan ssaf with an area of 1472 km2 and an altitude drop of about 50 m is formed 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and field measurements water samples from 54 sites including rivers springs shallow wells and salt lakes were collected in the nalenggele watershed fig 1c as the abundant meltwater in summer will make it difficult to go further into the alluvial lacustrine plains of nrb we conducted the fieldwork during winter of nov 2019 river water samples were taken from 4 main rivers and their tributaries at about 10 km intervals of each sample site including the nalenggele the dazaohuo the east taijinaier and the wutumeiren fig 1c meanwhile we also collected spring water samples from artesian flows in the wetland of nrb shallow groundwater samples were mainly pumped from 5 shallow drinking wells depth 10 m by water pump within the wetland fig 1c surface brine and intercrystalline brine samples were collected from the terminal salt lakes of nrb the latter is mainly from the manually excavated brine collecting ditch on the salt playa before water sample collection water temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and total dissolved solids tds were measured using a potable water quality analyzer mettler toledo sg78 at each site shallow groundwater samples were only collected after the pumped well water was stable and clear other water samples were taken at 0 2 m depth the water samples were in situ filtered on collection through 0 22 μm whatman cellulose acetate membranes to avoid the influence of suspended particles on the test results millot et al 2010 weynell et al 2017 1l of the filtered sample was collected in two 500 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles the samples for cations and trace element concentrations and isotopic measurements were acidified to ph less than 2 with ultrapure hno3 bottles for anion analysis were not acidified then the bottle was slightly wrapped by a parafilm strip around the closure to ensure no leakage all samples were kept chilled until analysis 3 2 analytical methods all the major ions were measured in the analysis department of qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences and the test processes in this study followed the procedures of the qinghai institute of salt lakes 1988 dissolved concentrations of major anions br cl and no3 were analyzed using ion chromatography ics 5000a co3 2 and hco3 were determined by potentiometric titration and so4 2 by baso4 heteromeric titration k was analyzed by flame photometer na concentrations of water samples were calculated by charge balance nco32 nhco3 nso42 ncl nk nca2 nmg2 n represents ionic equivalent value ca2 and mg2 were measured by the edta titration method the analytical precision for major cations and anions is better than 2 the trace elements of li b sr and ba were measured by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy icp oes with a precision of 10 87sr 86sr ratios of water samples were measured at the analytical laboratory of beijing research institute of uranium geology in beijing china chemical separation of sr2 was accomplished using a cation exchange column resin ag50w x8 h 100 200 mesh size usa sr isotope analyses were performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer isoprobe t from gv corporation uk the sr blank as determined by isotope mass spectrometry was 2 10 10 g the 87sr 86sr data were corrected for internal mass bias to 87sr 86sr 0 1194 the 87sr 86sr result for the reference material nbs 987 was 0 710250 0 00007 2σ n 10 its recommended value is 0 710248 the lithium isotope analysis of all samples was performed at the institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences ieecas chromatographic isolation of li was carried out using ag50w x8 cation exchange resin with 100 200 mesh size packed into customized pdf microcolumns with an internal diameter of 6 4 mm and a column length of 25 mm the column chemistry procedure was conducted twice to ensure pure li solution recovery and na li in all the samples was less than 5 the li separation procedures followed the steps described by gou et al 2019 the li isotopic ratios δ7li were measured using the sample standard bracketing ssb method on a neptune plus mc icp ms at ieecas all samples were conducted at a similar li concentration and the same procedure as standards l svec the total procedural blank of this method was less than 0 16 ng li which is negligible relative to the 300 ng of li analyzed in each sample gou et al 2019 values of δ7li are reported in standard per mil notation relative to l svec flesch et al 1973 where δ7li 7li 6li sample 7li 6li l svec 1 1000 the in house li standards ustc l yielded an average value of δ7li 19 3 0 1 2 s d n 45 and yielded as δ7li 12 2 0 2 2 s d n 78 for spex li respectively concurrently gbw li and seawater reference standard materials were repeatedly measured to be δ7li 7 93 0 2 2 s d n 10 δ7li 31 2 0 7 2 s d n 21 respectively this experiment measured δ7li of standards in agreement with previously published data dellinger et al 2014 2015 2017 gou et al 2019 moreover the long term external reproducibility is better than 0 9 2 s d for δ7li measurements gou et al 2018 detailed analytical methods for li isotopes are described by gou et al 2019 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical data physical chemical and isotopic data for the water samples are reported in table s1 water samples in the study area exhibit a wide range of salinities the ec values range from fresh 791 3 μs cm to saline 230 ms cm overall the salinity is lower in the upstream recharge rivers and spring rivers and increases towards the salt lake region indicating the influence of regional evaporation and the continuous dissolution of salt minerals along the path while the springs and shallow groundwaters generally have low salinity 791 3 5920 0 μs cm and fluctuate with the recharge rate of regional groundwater different water types are defined here using major ions in natural waters based on the principle of chemical divides according to hardie and eugster 1970 1 if parent water contains total alkalinity h c o 3 c o 3 2 ca2 after calcite precipitation then the water evolves to a na k cl hco3 co3 so4 type na hco3 so4 type 2 if parent water has total alkalinity h c o 3 c o 3 2 ca2 after calcite precipitation then the evolving path of sub water will be divided into two branches one is s o 4 2 ca2 after gypsum precipitation the sub water evolves to the na k mg cl so4 type cl so4 type otherwise the sub water has s o 4 2 ca2 after gypsum precipitation then the water evolves to the na ca k mg cl type ca cl type lowenstein et al 2017 fan et al 2018 the river waters spring river waters springs shallow groundwaters surface brines and intercrystalline brines are mainly divided into na hco3 so4 and cl so4 types based on the classification method specifically the river waters shallow groundwaters springs and spring river waters in the alluvial fan region are alkaline dominated by na hco3 so4 types with ph values ranging from 7 59 to 8 51 in comparison the water samples in the salt lake region are all characterized by cl so4 types with ph values from 6 51 to 8 66 table s1 further the mean ph of water generally decreases towards the salt lake region and reaches its lowest value for intercrystalline brines table s1 all water samples show that na and cl are the major dominant ions and with an increase of salinity along the discharge direction most ions of water samples show enrichment trends to a different extent especially in the salt lake region spatially the na k cl ca2 mg2 s o 4 2 li b3 and sr2 in waters of the salt lake region are much higher than those in the alluvial fan region moreover the waters in ganseng and dazaohuo areas with higher ec and tds values are more enriched in major ions than in the alluvial fan of nrb due to weak recharge flow and intense evaporation despite the lower ions concentration and salinity of waters in nrb the salt lake region unincluded the li and b3 contents are significantly higher than in those two regions implying that the sources of lithium and boron are different among these regions tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 in the ion correlation diagram fig 2 except for h c o 3 other major ions and trace elements are all well positively correlated with tds and cl suggesting that water geochemistry is mainly influenced by the evaporation process in parallel the positive correlation index between k and mg2 is as high as 0 99 while li and b3 is up to 0 95 furthermore a strong correlation can also be found among k mg2 li and b3 of water samples which likely indicates their common sources it is worth noting that the strong positive correlation between dissolved ca and sr compared with the relationship between ca and other ions fig 2 implies that besides the influence of evaporating process there are other essential components or processes which should be assessed such as the weathering of ca and sr bearing materials such as plagioclase amphibole sphene etc and the similar geochemical behavior between ca and sr during carbonate minerals precipitation liu et al 1984 shand et al 2009 4 2 sr and li isotopic compositions as illustrated in fig 3 a and table s2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of the studied water samples are highly scattered ranging from 0 70891 to 0 71269 the water from the chulakealagan river has the lowest 87sr 86sr ratios 0 70891 0 70949 li 2020 which is closer to the snowfall in kunlun mountain 0 71007 and the inland rivers of hoh xil basin 87sr 86sr 0 70949 0 71055 mainly fed by meltwater fig 3a zhao et al 2007 li 2020 and seems to record the expected effects of extensive dilution by local meteoric waters with relatively non radiogenic sr isotopic signatures luís et al 2019 the higher 87sr 86sr ratio and water temperature up to 92 pang 2009 of the bugedaban hot spring indicate the strong water rock interaction in the deep part of the kunlun tectonic belt fig 3a notably the 87sr 86sr value of nrb water samples concentrated distributed between the chulakealagan river and bugedaban hot spring of the nalenggele river watershed fig 3a it is believed that the sr in the water samples of nrb is affected by both sources in contrast samples taken from the dazaohuo area and ganseng area have 87sr 86sr values apparent greater than those samples in the nrb fig 3a with the highest values 0 712 located in the ganseng area within it the 87sr 86sr values of most shallow groundwaters and spring samples are greater than 0 7119 implying that the samples of these two areas may inherit the high radioactive sr isotope characteristics of the felsic bedrock of the kunlun mountain fig 1 liu et al 1984 this view is consistent with the high 87sr 86sr values of the acid insoluble matter in the surface river sediments of the main rivers in this region fig 3a measured li isotopes for water samples and regional reservoir data from previous work are reported in table s2 and fig 3b li isotopes compositions δ7li are significantly variable in the study area ranging from 3 81 shallow groundwater in nrb up to 28 66 river water in dazaohuo area spatially the δ7li values of surface waters in the nrb gradually increase from the mountains region to the salt lake region with a range of 4 44 5 25 fig 3b and accompanied by the gradual increase of lithium contents from 0 005 to 24 49 mmol l may indicating isotope fractionation at the supergene environment millot et al 2010 tomascak et al 2016 and the enhancement of regional evaporation in addition similar to water samples from the golmud river li 0 001 mmol l δ7li 18 37 he et al 2020 which also originates from the northern slope of the east kunlun mountains and is mainly recharged by meltwater the chulakealagan river sample nlg 22 has low li content 0 005 mmol l and high δ7li value 14 87 compared with the other samples in the nrb table s2 fig 3b suggesting the different sources of lithium in the nrb river waters in parallel the samples from ganseng and dazaohuo areas also have low li contents and high δ7li values with 0 007 0 2 mmol l 17 59 v 27 06 and 0 008 0 091 mmol l 20 19 28 66 respectively which is significantly different from the nrb waters fig 3b data on δ7li values of shallow groundwaters in the groundwater gushing zone of fsaf are considerably lower than other surface waters and range from 3 81 to 4 87 table s2 which is also the same as the characteristics of ganseng and zaohuo areas fig 3b suggesting the influence of relatively strong water rock interaction compared with the surface environment tomascak et al 2016 furthermore samples from the salt lake region display higher δ7li values and average at 12 76 0 1 2σ n 3 and the δ7li values are also rising with the increase of li abundances and tds implying that the transportation and salt forming process may have a specific influence on li isotope fractionation the main bedrocks of eastern kunlun mountain all show low δ7li values fig 3b which is consistent with that of the source bedrocks of other li rich brine regions in the world munk et al 2018 garcia et al 2020 meanwhile the hot spring waters often inherit the lithium isotope composition of bedrock due to sufficient water rock interaction fig 3b tomascak et al 2016 the δ7li values of the mainstream waters of nrb are highly consistent with the northern qtp hot spring waters fig 3b which may indicate the close relationship between nrb waters and regional hot springs i e the bugedaban hot spring in terms of dissolved lithium sources 5 discussion 5 1 sources of dissolved lithium potential sources of dissolved lithium to the salt lakes in nrb can be assumed to be either released by rock weathering including solubilization of the bedrock and destabilization or desorption from secondary minerals derived from the atmospheric deposition or derived from anthropogenic input palmer and edmond 1992 jin et al 2010 millot et al 2010 first of all as an area lacking industrial activity with a sparse population the anthropogenic impact of nrb is negligible besides the contribution of lithium from precipitation is also assumed to be negligible because of the low average annual precipitation 38 35 mm according to the meteorological data of the xiaozaohuo weather station near the study area from 2009 to 2018 to some extent the rarely reported data of lithium in atmospheric precipitation may reflect the extremely low li concentration in average rainfall generally 3 ppb tomascak et al 2016 furthermore no data exists for lithium in precipitation on the ne tibetan plateau but less than 0 5 of the major ions dissolved in the lake water may have been potentially added by precipitation weynell et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable to ignore the lithium input by atmospheric precipitation to the regional surface waters quantifying the origin of the solutes in the rivers is a non trivial task thus various approaches have been tried to solve the problem noh et al 2009 jin et al 2010 here we adopted the proportion results of different end members in the chulakealagan and golmud rivers which were calculated from the results of the forward model li 2020 the chulakealagan river is characterized by a high evaporite ca 60 70 and carbonate ca 11 30 contribution and low silicate ca 1 15 and rainwater ca 1 8 contribution compared with the golmud river which is respectively characterized by evaporite ca 28 60 carbonate ca 1 33 silicate ca 18 60 and rainwater ca 3 11 considering the significant difference in average lithium content between the mainstream of nalenggele river 0 61 mg l n 3 chulakealagan river 0 04 mg l n 15 and golmud river 0 05 mg l n 5 li 2020 it can be calculated that the lithium contribution of evaporite and carbonate in the chulakealagan river catchment to the nalenggele river is 3 9 4 6 and 0 7 1 9 respectively in comparison the silicate contribution through weathering is even less than 0 9 accordingly the dissolved li from each end member weathering of golmud river basin is 1 3 evaporite 0 05 1 7 carbonate and 0 9 3 0 silicate respectively furthermore because of insufficient information about the hongshui river another major tributary of the nalenggele river here we use the adjacent golmud river to replace the hongshui river to evaluate the dissolved lithium input by chemical weathering due to they share a similar climate topography lithostratigraphy and tectonic backgrounds in their watersheds the dissolved lithium from the main rock end member by surficial weathering is very low in the nrb between 84 9 and 93 4 of dissolved lithium in the nalenggele river must have another source different from regional surface weathering these estimates agree well with previous studies that have inferred that most riverine li derives from the deep hydrothermal fluids located upstream of the hongshui river fig 1 which is deeply influenced by the tectonic activity of the kunlun mountain fault zone zhu et al 1990 hu 1997 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 despite the lack of lithium isotopes data of the bugedaban hot spring the low dissolved li isotopic composition from 4 44 to 5 16 and high li concentration within the mainstream of nalenggele river relative to other adjacent rivers golmud river chulakealagan river and zaohuohe river and regional rainwater also indicate the importance of hydrothermal input to dissolved lithium in the nrb table s2 fig 3b both lithium and boron are particularly mobile elements in water rock interaction millot et al 2010 wei et al 2014 the laboratory experiments on water rock interaction of rhyolite under different temperature 150 350 and high pressure 25 mpa conditions show that the contents of na k li and b in the reacted waters increased significantly with the increase of reaction temperature and the dissolved co2 in the water enhances alkali metal cation leaching from the rhyolite cullen et al 2019 which suggests the importance of the hydrothermal system of the kunlun mountain tectonic belt to the formation of regional li rich recharge waters furthermore the strong positive correlation among k mg2 li and b3 in the water samples of the nrb fig 2 and their relatively high content of them in the nrb waters compared with other adjacent river water samples within similar evaporation degrees table s1 li 2020 which all indicate that the bedrocks of the hydrothermal systems hosted may be of rock type rich in these alkali metal elements such as biotite granite however this understanding needs further work to confirm in addition the hydrothermal fluids in donggi cona lake located at the eastern end of the kunlun mountains fault zone have the characteristics of high li contents and low δ7li values weynell et al 2017 which is also consistent with the other hydrothermal fluids and bedrock in the northern qtp fig 3b weynell et al 2017 he et al 2020 therefore we conclude that li concentrations and its isotopes composition in the dissolved load of nrb are essentially controlled by the hydrothermal fluids located upstream of the hongshui river 5 2 end member mixing analysis the calculation of mixing ratios is a critical task in hydrological research because it yields quantitative information about the origin of the water sources which is one of the ultimate goals of hydrology pelizardi et al 2017 identifying the end member waters is the primary problem usually achieved through end member mixing analysis emma then the mixing ratios of the end members in the mixtures could be calculated based on concentrations of conservative species christophersen and hooper 1992 in the nrb the determination of main water end members can be achieved by comparing the hydrochemical data and stable isotopes composition δ7li 87sr 86sr of various typical water bodies in the region bakari et al 2013 pelizardi et al 2017 since the surface water system of nrb meets the conditions for carrying out the mixing analysis these conditions consist of a sufficient number of conservative species and sufficiently different concentrations of recharge sources christophersen and hooper 1992 generally chemical components δ7li values and 87sr 86sr ratios of the waters of respective river systems within the nrb mainly reflect the mineralogy of the rocks with which they have been in contact jin et al 2010 millot and négrel 2021 the elemental concentrations of the river waters have distinct values for each tributary due to weathering in different source rocks and various water source rechange since physiography and landforms of these river systems are broadly similar in the piper diagram fig 4 the major cations that characterize the water samples are na and cl and mg2 is also impressive within intercrystalline brines in the salt lake region inheriting the dominance of the evaporite rich sedimentary strata or strongly affected by evaporation within the catchment in addition compared with the scattered data points in the ganseng area and zaohuohe area all water samples of the nrb are distributed centrally suggesting a close source connection among these water samples fig 4 furthermore the nrb data points are obviously between the bugedaban hot spring hydrothermal fluids in the upstream of hongshui river and the chulakealagan river in the diamond block and cation triangle block and closer to the side of chulakealagan river fig 4 which means that the nalenggele river water may be considered to represent a binary mixture between the hydrothermal fluids and the regional surface water and the latter may contribute the main solute to the nrb rivers especially for the major cations although li and its isotopes of surface water are sensitive to exogenic processes tomascak 2004 dellinger et al 2015 millot and négrel 2021 thus affecting the effectiveness of source tracing to a certain extent they still inherit the primary information of source rocks within a small watershed scale weynell et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the δ7li values of nrb mainstream samples are very close to the bedrocks of eastern kunlun mountain and the regional hot springs considering the lower residence time of surface water due to high altitude drops in the study area fig 1 xu 2015 it is believed that these samples inherit the li isotopes features similar with the hot springs of northern qtp i e bugedaban hot spring for regional surface waters their δ7li value continuously decreases when more dissolved li is derived from solids and increases with long distance transport pistiner and henderson 2003 millot et al 2010 without considering the evaporation during transportation the preferential incorporation of 6li in clay or oxide rich alteration products may be the key factor for significant lithium isotope fractionation due to weak chemical weathering in small watersheds of the qtp weynell et al 2017 the lower δ7li values of the nrb waters compared with the regional surface waters e g golmud river chulakealagan river and zaohuohe river fig 3b and their close distribution indicate the importance of hot spring water supply to dissolved lithium in the nrb and their genetic relationships respectively meanwhile the growth trend of δ7li values along the river discharge direction in the nrb fig 3b may suggest that the increase of secondary minerals and residence time play an essential role in li isotopes fractionation in the nrb tomascak 2004 dellinger et al 2015 xu 2015 further the δ7li values of nrb waters are between hot springs of northern qtp and the surface water of the same hydrological system chulakealagan river fig 3b which also indicates a binary mixing process strontium isotopes are powerful for constraining and testing geochemical and hydrological models sr derived from seawater and marine sediments generally has a low 87sr 86sr ratio while sr derived from dissolution of rb rich minerals i e k feldspar and mica will have a higher ratio faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 the sr isotope ratios of water samples should usually be shifted towards that of the leachates if the sr isotope ratio is governed simply by water rock interaction and mixing with recharge water although additional strontium input or output may occur at the transportation of river waters the sr isotope ratio is usually not complicated by variations in meteoric loading or by biological and low temperature abiotic chemical reactions lyons et al 1995 fakir et al 2002 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 bakari et al 2013 data on sr isotope ratios were applied to construct a mixing model to elucidate the contributions from different water sources end members and processes governing their water chemistry in the nrb considering the water supply and discharge system in nrb and the hydrochemistry analysis mentioned above the chulakealagan river and bugedaban hot springs are typical end members of regional surface water and hydrothermal fluid in the catchment here we put all sample data of the end member waters including regional snowfall regional surface waters tuotuo river and qumar river in the hoh xil basin and nrb waters in the 87sr 86sr isotopic ratio versus 10000 sr plot fig 5 it can be seen that most of the water samples plot within the triangle whose apexes represent the three end members abc except for a few samples in the adjacent area of nrb having more radiogenic sr than end member a fig 5b however if the tiny amount of sr in the regional snowfall sample is taken into account the snowfall contribution may be neglected the nrb water samples are then considered to represent broad binary mixtures between a and b consistent with the end member analysis mentioned above in addition fig 5 indicates that our mixture is a typical binary mixing of high 87sr 86sr ratios end member sources such as silicate minerals and low 87sr 86sr ratio end member sources such as carbonate or evaporite sediments besides most of the samples are plotted along the binary mixing line a b connecting the chulakealagan river a and bugedaban hot spring b while few samples along the mixing lines a c and b c fig 5a which supports this assumption and also indicates that the sr isotope contribution from the regional snowfall end member is meager the binary mixture can be expressed by end members as follows faure 1986 négrel and roy 1998 wang et al 2020 r c a r a r b 1 α c b r b r a 1 1 α c a r b 1 α c b r a 1 1 α where α is the mixing ratio of end member a ca and cb are the sr contents of end member a and b ra and rb are the 87sr 86sr isotope ratios of end member a and b and r is the presumed isotope ratio calculated using the predetermined mixing proportions of the two end member a and b we used this model to calculate the theoretical value of the sr isotope ratios of the mixture of the chulakealagan river a and bugedaban hot spring b and established the binary mixing model a theoretical mixing line was plotted according to the calculated 87sr 86sr isotopic ratios and sr concentrations of the mixing solutions fig 6 the measured values of water samples in the nrb were also plotted the river and spring river water points clustered closely around the mixing line supporting the proposed genesis of these waters discussed above which also suggests a mixing ratio of 3 5 hot spring water in the nrb water samples fig 6 implying that the major water body 95 97 of the nrb river comes from the surface water mainly supplied by meltwater combined with the sources analysis of dissolved lithium in the nrb mentioned above although only a small volume of bugedaban hydrothermal fluids is supplied to the nrb system it provides the vast majority of lithium and boron resources this view is also consistent with the abnormally high lithium and boron contents of the bugedaban hot spring li 96 mg l b 180 mg l hu 1997 and the lower δ7li values of nalenggele river fig 3b in addition the regional surface rivers qumar river and tuotuohe river with low hot spring supply less than 1 also suggest that surface water is mainly supplied by meltwater in the inland basin of the qtp and generally has similar 87sr 86sr isotopic ratios and sr concentrations however it is easy to change due to the input of hot spring water it should be noted that although we are confident in this conclusion the sparsity of the critical data such as the sr content and its isotopes composition of hongshui river and chualakealagan river may still have a certain impact on the accuracy of this understanding therefore it is necessary to carry out further supplementary work in the future moreover 87sr 86sr ratios vs sr content can also point out the possible hydro geochemical processes that may have affected the water samples and their impact on the 87sr 86sr ratios our data shows that most water samples in the nrb are more affected by silicate water interactions with high 87sr 86sr ratios and lower sr contents faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 compared with the regional surface waters end member a tuotuo river and qumar river which have low 87sr 86sr ratios and higher sr content due to the influence of carbonate or evaporite fig 5 négrel et al 2001 jin et al 2010 and such characteristics may be common within the hinterland of qtp furthermore the higher 87sr 86sr ratios and sr contents of the shallow groundwaters than most of the nrb water samples can be explained by stronger interaction between groundwater and aquifer materials due to the relatively high residence time xu 2015 while the linear correlated distribution of nrb sample points along with the water discharge direction indicates that dissolution of calcite and or regional evaporation affect the dissolved sr in nrb waters fig 5a 6 jin et al 2010 bakari et al 2013 but has little effect on sr isotope ratio which is also consistent with the geochemical features of strontium in nature faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 to corroborate the occurrence of mineral dissolution the phreeeqc geochemical program was used to compute the saturation indices si the results show that most nrb water samples are oversaturated or close to equilibrium conditions to calcite table s2 implying that significant carbonate dissolution has occurred jin et al 2010 this is also supported by a good linear relationship between sr and the carbonate system e g sr2 vs ca2 r2 0 89 in fig 2 5 3 dynamics of lithium in the nrb the li isotopic signature in the water integrates two components the signature of the bedrock and the processes that control the isotopic fractionation during water rock interaction godfrey et al 2013 munk et al 2018 as discussed in the previous section the δ7li values recorded in the nrb waters seem to reflect the mixed contributions of li from hydrothermal sources and bedrock weathering during the mixed water body reaching the salt lake area the li concentrations increase rapidly due to evaporation while δ7li values also increase along the river discharge direction fig 7 the li na ratio in the dissolved load always be used as a sensitive indicator of the extent of chemical weathering occurring in streams and groundwater reservoirs e g vigier et al 2009 millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 both elements are alkali metals thus mobile during water rock interaction as shown by numerous studies in contrast to na li is likely to be adsorbed onto the secondary minerals formed during water rock interactions thus leading to decreasing li na ratios with increasing residence time millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 millot and négrel 2021 in addition the li na ratio varies due to li adsorption and the removal of na during halite precipitation from oversaturated brines in the salt lake system millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 thus here we can define f li the enrichment degree of li remaining in solution relative to na along the discharge direction of nrb as f l i li σ ts j li σ ts i na σ ts j na σ ts i where li and na are the corresponding ion concentrations in water samples respectively σts is the sum of all ions i and j refer to consecutive sample numbers distributed in sequence along the discharge direction where j represents the following sample after i in most situations at equal environment conditions a value of 1 for f li means that the enrichment degree of li and na is congruent f li 1 means that li is more enriched than na while f li 1 means that na is more enriched than li for accurate discussion two discharge systems were divided from the nrb due to the regional hydrological conditions table s3 one is the discharge system towards the west and east taijinaier salt lakes and the other is to the senie salt lake the wutumeiren river system as expected the calculated f li in the water samples of the nrb changes regularly with different positions gradually decreases from the fsaf to the salt marsh area then increases rapidly in the salt lake region fig 8 specifically the dissolved li na is positively correlated with li in the gobi and fsaf zones fig 8 and the f li value of most samples is also great than 1 with an average value of 1 1 table s3 suggesting an abnormally enrichment of dissolved lithium in waters of this region considering these waters lower ec and tds values table s1 there must be an additional dissolved lithium source resulting in the li enrichment relative to na in the waters while the significant li isotope difference between these waters average δ7li value of 5 73 n 11 and the chulakealagan river water 14 87 one of the main tributary of the nalenggele river indicates that the dissolved lithium of gobi and fsaf zone waters is remarkably controlled by the additional input of li rich water with lower li isotope compositions this point is also consistent with the high li concentration and li enrichment factor of the hongshui river another tributary of the nalenggele river related to hydrothermal springs fig 1c table s3 besides the release of adsorbed lithium in the groundwater gushing zone of fsaf may be another important dissolved lithium source with higher li contents and lower δ7li values the rapid increase of clay content in sediments of the gushing zone leads to the sudden decrease of groundwater velocity which is believed to promote the release of early adsorbed lithium in clays li 2020 one exception is the sample wtmr 20 with higher δ7li values of 9 62 and li content of 0 125 mmol l table s3 which may be related to the slow moving of the water body in the sampling area and leads to the li isotopic fractionation by secondary minerals adsorption millot et al 2010 decarreau et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 further the residence time of water in groundwater counteracts the effect of low temperature and favors the formation of secondary minerals that fractionate li isotopes at equilibrium millot et al 2010 high residence time benefits the dissolution of aquifer minerals e g feldspar and mica and makes the solution inherit the li isotope composition of the dissolved minerals thus the low li isotopic composition of shallow groundwater samples wtmr 24 δ7li 3 81 wtmr 38 δ7li 4 37 is compatible with the estimated minerals solution li isotopic evolution at equilibrium under a relatively high residence time xu 2015 the calculated f li in the waters of the ssaf ranges between 0 6 and 0 8 average value of 0 7 with a decreasing trend along the discharge direction table s3 fig 8 implying the enrichment of na relative to li and the removal of li in this area in addition the δ7li value of water samples in the ssaf is significantly higher than that in the gobi and fsaf area from 6 93 to 9 31 with an average value of 8 34 table s2 figs 7 8 which reflects preferential partitioning of dissolved 6li into secondary minerals i e illites during incongruent weathering huh et al 2001 vigier et al 2008 weynell et al 2017 since illite is the dominant clay mineral in the sediments of qaidam basin miao et al 2016 williams and hervig 2005 suggest that illite can incorporate high amounts of li in its octahedral site resulting in li isotope fractionation and producing the higher δ7li values of solutions this view has also been verified in the relevant studies of the lake donggi cona and huanghe river catchments weynell et al 2017 sun and colin 2014 furthermore the adsorption of fe mn oxy hydroxide minerals within the ssaf sediments may also play an essential role in the li isotopic fractionation during the downstream movement of the rivers our sequential extraction experiment of li in the nrb sediments shows that higher content of dissolved li can be desorbed in the reducible fe mn oxides than other extractable forms exchangeable oxidizable organic matter and sulfides in sediments unpublished data and other researchers also declare that the fe hydr oxides could result in higher δ7li values in waters by surface adsorption pistiner and henderson 2003 vigier et al 2008 godfrey et al 2013 garcia et al 2020 in addition the higher residence time of rivers caused by the low topographic drop in this area and the more clay contents are also conducive to the preferential partitioning of dissolved 6li into secondary minerals resulting in the increase of δ7li values in the water samples the dynamics of lithium in the salt lake region are entirely different from those in the other areas the brine f li values change significantly from 0 4 in the surface brine to 7 7 in the intercrystalline brines fig 8 suggesting a strong enrichment of li relative to na with the geochemical evolution of inflow waters to brines while the δ7li value of the brines in the salt lake region also increased apparently to those in the ssaf region with 4 average isotopic shift fig 7 the general pattern of increasing li and δ7li value from inflow waters to brines is a function of evapo concentration which drives the li concentration up as well as results in the formation of secondary mineral phases and halite these secondary phases sequester 6li which increases the δ7li of fractionated water as li concentration increases munk et al 2018 lithium is known to concentrate in the clays or fe hydr oxides with increasing concentrations of li in solution temperature and time decarreau et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 as the destination of inflow waters of the nrb the li isotope fractionation caused by clays fe hydr oxides is sufficient due to the highest li concentrations and residence time of surface waters in the salt lake region xu 2015 on the other hand the halite formation is not only the direct reason for the significant increase in f li values table s3 fig 8 but is also considered another important factor for 6li removal munk et al 2018 garcia et al 2020 nevertheless the primary inducement of the increase of δ7li value in the salt lake region of nrb may be more related to the geochemical evolution of brines due to the massive precipitation of salt minerals and scarcity of clay sediments previous studies reported that the older evaporitic preserved an isotopic signature similar to their contemporaneous brines godfrey et al 2013 garcia et al 2020 the brine evolution under continuous evaporation will lead to a higher δ7li signature in the late stage halite than in the early stage thus the subsequent enrichment of 7li in the brines can be explained by the long term evolution of the brines or mixing with ancient li rich fluids trapped in the older evaporitic layers that preserved a high li isotopic signature although the insufficient sample data of the ssaf and salt lake region our data show that the li isotopes are very sensitive to the origin of lithium and its geochemical behavior in the processes of migration and enrichment and the regional hydrogeological conditions similar cases in nevada playas araoka et al 2014 and salar de olaroz of central andes garcia et al 2020 also show that the δ7li could be a valuable tracer for lithium sources and evaluating its accumulation processes in playas to precisely determine the mechanisms that result in the preferential release of 7li into solution under strong evaporation conditions future studies will be necessary to investigate the lithium isotopic heterogeneity of the bedrocks and extractable forms of river sediments and the li isotope fractionation in the process of evaporite precipitation from continuous evaporation 5 4 implications for the formation of li rich brines according to the above discussion the critical genetic factors of li rich brine deposits in the nrb are consistent with the common characteristics of continental lithium brines summarized by munk et al 2016 such as arid climate closed basin containing salt lakes associated li rich hydrothermal activity significant inflow waters sufficient time for lithium accumulation in brines however as a typical li rich brine deposit of qtp the nrb lithium brines also have unique characteristics in the formation mechanisms on the origin of lithium many lithium brine deposits are closely related to the supply of li rich hot springs such as uyuni salt lake in bolivia munk et al 2016 nevada playas in the usa araoka et al 2014 mamicuo and zhabuye lake in tibet china liu et al 2021 the recharge pattern of li rich hydrothermal fluids obviously influences the mg li ratio of the terminal salt lake in the nrb the remote recharge mode of hot springs to the salt lakes supply distance over 450 km leads to significantly higher mg li ratios in the brines of the salt lake region ca 40 90 liu et al 2021 compared with the other lithium brine deposits in the western usa and the central andes mg li less than 10 munk et al 2016 liu et al 2021 it can be explained to a certain extent by mixing a massive volume of surface water to the nalenggele river during the remote recharge of the bugedaban hot spring to the salt lakes thus brought into a large amount of dissolved magnesium from the surface weathering process moreover mg li ratio can also be used as an indicator for water mixing characteristics as the geochemical behavior of mg ions can be similar to li ions in low temperature aqueous solution munk et al 2016 by analyzing the variation of the mg li ratio in the waters of nrb from source to sink it is found that the mg li ratio of the recharge river constantly changed significantly only when the regional surface water mg li ratios range of ca 500 600 significantly flowed in fig 9 in addition the mg li ratios of the nrb system are lower than that of the golmud river system due to the recharge of the li rich hot springs in the upper reaches of the nalenggele river the tail salt lakes of each river system maintain the mg li ratio similar to that of the mainstream of the respective recharge river only slightly changes can be seen within the areas from the alluvial fan to the salt lake region due to mineral precipitation dolomite halite etc clay or fe mn oxides adsorption and other reasons fig 9 table s2 therefore without considering the special salt lake type carbonate type the low mg li ratio in the li rich salt lake may indicate a significant recharge of li rich hot springs to the salt lake it is also consistent with the previous discussion and the facts about the li rich salt lakes in the western usa and the central andes munk et al 2016 liu et al 2021 in terms of the enrichment process the loss of dissolved lithium in recharge water during migration may be an essential issue rarely involved in other li rich brine deposits and related to the size of resources yu et al 2013 has roughly calculated the theoretical size of lithium resource of salt lakes in the nrb according to the average annual runoff of the nalenggele river 10 3 108m3 a the average contents of dissolved lithium at the mountain pass of nalenggele river 0 727 mg l and the calculation yields an annual lithium input of 748 8 t considering the conclusion that the evolutionary period of hongshui river and nalenggele river in qaidam basin is not less than 10 ka zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2012 chang et al 2017 the total amount of lithium resource imported from the nalenggele river into the qaidam basin is conservatively estimated to be about 748 8 mt however it is significantly different from the size of lithium resources revealed by a geologic reconnaissance in the li rich salt lake region of nrb 230 5 mt li 2020 so what is the reason for the massive loss of dissolved lithium in migration and enrichment based on the fact that there has been no breakthrough in geological exploration of lithium brine resources in the salt lake region of nrb recently the fixation of dissolved lithium in waters by the adsorption of clays or fe mn oxides and co precipitation in evaporites may have a significant impact on it according to our study moreover this understanding was also supported by the sequential extraction experiments of bulk sediments in the clayton valley basin coffey et al 2021 and the evidence of high lithium content up to 220 mg kg in the halite samples of the salar de olaroz garcia et al 2020 although there has been a qualitative interpretation of the possible approaches resulting in the loss of dissolved lithium in nrb waters the clear evidence of mechanisms is still insufficient so it is difficult to accurately estimate the changes in lithium resources in the nrb 6 conclusions lithium rich brines are the most economically recoverable li source on the planet as one of the world s most crucial lithium brine deposits the genetic mechanisms of the li rich salt lakes in the nrb are still poorly understood in this study we suggest that the combined use of lithium and strontium isotopes is a viable method for quantitatively estimating the contributions of regional end member water bodies and their dissolved lithium to li rich salt lakes in addition li isotopes are also very sensitive to the dynamic behavior of dissolved lithium during migration and enrichment our study shows that consistent with the previous views the lithium in li rich salt lakes of nrb mainly comes from the supply of the bugedaban hot springs in the eastern kunlun mountain tectonic belt meanwhile our evidence further suggests that the contribution of regional surface meltwater and hydrothermal water bugedaban hot spring to the nrb is 95 97 and 3 5 respectively in contrast the hydrothermal water with a small supply proportion contributes 84 9 93 4 of dissolved lithium to the li rich salt lakes of nrb moreover the main control factors of lithium in dissolved load in different hydrological regions are various which could be characterized by li isotopes li na ratio and li enrichment factor relative to na of various water samples within the catchment the major conclusions include 1 the input of additional li rich water has controlled the abnormal enrichment behavior of li relative to na and the low δ7li value average δ7li value of 5 73 in the waters of gobi and fsaf zone of the nrb 2 the adsorption of clay or fe mn oxide phases play an essential role for significant li removal from the waters and the increase of δ7li value with an average value of 8 34 in the second stage alluvial fan ssaf region 3 in the salt lake region the continuous halite precipitation during the brine evolution not only causes the abnormal enrichment of li in the brine compared with na but also leading to the significant 7li enrichment in the brines thus mixing ancient li rich fluids with high δ7li values trapped in the older evaporitic layers may also have played a role to summarize the genetic model of li brines in the nrb is of great significance to the li rich salt lake brines in other parts of the world in terms of lithium source whether the dissolved lithium of salt lakes mainly comes from the hydrothermal system may be the critical factor in determining whether the lithium brine has low mg li characteristics excluding carbonate type salt lakes furthermore the loss of dissolved lithium in waters due to the adsorption of clays or fe mn oxides and co precipitation in evaporites during migration and enrichment may significantly impact the size of lithium resources in the salt lake areas however this view needs to be verified by further systematic work in the future credit authorship contribution statement weiliang miao conceptualization data curation formal

2770,the salt lakes fed by the nalenggele river in the qaidam basin located on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau qtp are major brine lithium reservoirs in china the quantitative identifications of the li sources and their dynamic behavior shed light on the formation mechanism of the brine li deposits in closed basin of arid regions this study presents li and sr isotope ratios δ7li 87sr 86sr and other hydrogeochemical parameters for river waters springs spring river waters shallow groundwaters surface brines and intercrystalline brines around the nalenggele river basin nrb and its adjacent small watersheds the results indicate that the nalenggele river water is a mixing product of hot springs and regional surface meltwater and the source of dissolved li in the nrb is mainly supplied by the hot springs with multi tracer models it is confirmed that around 84 9 93 4 of dissolved li is provided by the li rich hot spring waters which account for only 3 5 of the total water input furthermore the dissolved li in the streams of different hydrological regions shows various isotopic fractionation behavior in general the lower average δ7li values average of 5 6 with more enriched li with respect to na in the waters of the piedmont gobi region indicates a significant additional input of dissolved li from bedrock and sediments the second stage alluvial fan of the nrb produces 7li enrichments and li depleted waters compared with na which can be explained by the adsorption of clay or fe mn oxide phases that fractionate li isotopes the highest average δ7li values 12 76 are observed when li is not adsorbed by the scarce fine clastic sediments in the hypersaline environment of the salt lake region it can be concluded that the continuous halite precipitation during the brine evolution not only causes the abnormal enrichment of li in the brine compared with na but also continuously sequesters the 6li from the brines resulting in a significant 7li enrichment overall these findings advance the understanding of the lithium sources of li rich brines and its enrichment and metallogenic process during water migration in hyper arid regions and have crucial indicative significance for lithium cycling under a strong evaporation environment keywords stable isotopes end member mixing analysis geochemical behavior lithium brines qaidam basin qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lithium is a critical and technologically important element used in batteries the nuclear industry ceramics glass medicine aerospace and other fields with the soaring demand for lithium resources in the global market recently the trend of resource bottleneck is highlighted kesler et al 2012 munk et al 2016 lithium rich brines are the planet s most economically recoverable li source munk et al 2016 boschetti 2022 therefore it is essential to understand the genesis of these deposits to develop exploration models for the continued discovery of new deposits however the quantitative identifications of the li sources and their dynamic behavior in the surface environment are challenging owing to the diffuse discharge from phreatic water tables and complex surface flow patterns in arid regions generally applying geochemical methods such as chemical concentrations and some light stable isotopes helps identify mixing processes of distinct water sources and hydrochemical evolutionary trends bakari et al 2013 however these may not work well in arid or super arid environments because the evapo concentration effects and the biologically mitigated processes can modify surface flow and shallow groundwater compositions thus the water chemistry and the light stable isotopes can be strongly altered in these environments bakari et al 2013 meredith et al 2013 paces and wurster 2014 recently the introduction of li and sr isotopes systematics as a tool for identifying various water sources and tracing their interactions in these complex hydrologic settings provides a new angle to examine such problems boschetti et al 2018 even in carbonate catchment lithium is mainly hosted in silicate minerals kisakurek et al 2005 millot et al 2010 and is not involved in biological turnover lemarchand et al 2010 there are two stable isotopes of 6li and 7li with natural abundances of 7 5 and 92 5 respectively isotopic variations are expressed as δ7li lithium is a mobile element that tends preferentially to go into the fluid phase during water rock interactions the relative mass difference between the two isotopes is considerable at 17 gou et al 2019 generating significant low temperature mass fractionation at the earth s surface which provides critical information on the nature of weathering processes huh et al 2004 millot et al 2010 recent studies have shown that lithium isotope fractionation is strongly affected by secondary mineral formation rather than mineral dissolution or lithology differences in the catchment huh et al 2001 ryu et al 2014 wimpenny et al 2015 gou et al 2019 based on the characteristics of significant isotopic fractionation among reservoirs and distinct fractionation mechanisms it has been suggested that lithium isotopes can be used to trace silicate weathering processes huh et al 2001 kisakurek et al 2005 vigier et al 2009 millot et al 2010 gou et al 2019 paleo weathering conditions pogge von strandmann et al 2017 and water sediments exchange processes wimpenny et al 2010 tipper et al 2012 in comparison sr isotopes have been more widely used in hydrogeochemistry because they are less affected by meteoric loading variations and biological and low temperature abiotic chemical reactions bakari et al 2013 meredith et al 2013 paces and wurster 2014 therefore the combinative analysis of the two isotopic systems can provide more and deeper insights into the origin of li rich water the regional water mixing mechanism and the genesis model of li rich brine deposits meredith et al 2013 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp in china is an important li b rich brine distribution zone and the lithium reservoir ranks third in size around the world after bolivia and chile accounting for about 30 of the total reserves on earth he et al 2020 among the qtp lithium reserves the terminal lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes of nalenggele river in qaidam basin are the most important li b rich brine deposits in china zhang 1987 in recent years along with the surging demands for lithium in batteries significant efforts have been directed toward investigating regional geology lithium sources enrichment mechanisms brines evolution processes lithium extraction technologies etc zhang 1987 zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 like other li rich brines in the world the regional tectonic analysis and geochemical data indicate that the li b in the terminal lakes of nalenggele river is fed by hydrothermal fluids from surrounding mountains i e the bugedaban mountain in the kunlun tectonic belt of hoh xil basin zhu et al 1989 munk et al 2011 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 wei et al 2014 however the quantitative identification of primary recharge sources contributing dissolved li to the discharge zone of the nalenggele river is still inadequate especially for the surface weathering sources in addition although intense evaporation has been widely recognized as the decisive factor in promoting the abnormal enrichment of lithium in saline lake brines zhang 1987 munk et al 2011 the dynamic behavior of dissolved lithium in the surface processes and its constraints are still rarely involved in this paper we performed a comprehensive study of isotopes δ7li 87sr 86sr and the chemical composition of various water bodies within different evaporation degrees around the terminal li rich salt lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes to investigate the origin of lithium and its dynamic behavior in surface processes in the nalenggele river basin nrb of the central qaidam basin this work builds upon the general ideas of previous works for the source of dissolved lithium in the nrb and further quantitatively explains the lithium source meanwhile the dynamic fractionation behavior of dissolved lithium in the migration process was also evaluated for the first time these findings are anticipated to be extensively referred to in future studies on arid zone systems with li rich features 2 general setting 2 1 geological settings the qaidam basin located in the northern qtp is the largest intermontane endorheic arid basin in qtp with an average altitude of 2800 m and a drainage area of about 250 000 km2 fig 1 a b it is enclosed by aljun mountains in the northwest east kunlun mountains in the south and qilian mountains in the northeast fig 1b the prevailing northwest wind and southwest wind intense solar radiation up to 680 kj cm2 a and dry cold climate conditions lead to extremely high evaporation precipitation ratios up to 200 in the basin which is very conducive to the formation of evaporite resources zhang 1987 and the development of clean energy industry such as solar energy and wind energy the qaidam basin contains 27 salt lakes with various salt resources including potassium lithium magnesium sodium etc many of which are linked via thick salt beds and brines fig 1b chen and bowler 1986 zhang 1987 seventy nine inland rivers of different scales including 42 seasonal and 37 perennial rivers provide many soluble materials to the qaidam basin li 2020 constrained by topography and neotectonic movements the river system in qaidam basin radiates centripetally most larger rivers are mainly distributed in the north and east of the east kunlun mountains they are primarily supplied by meltwater and meteoric water and are greatly affected by seasonal fluctuation tan et al 2020 the nalenggele river located southwest of the qaidam basin has the most considerable annual runoff of 12 9 108 m3 a and a drainage area of 21898 km2 in the qaidam basin with a length of 435 km xu 2015 the drainage area can be divided into three subzones in geomorphology fig 1b c yang et al 1993 miao et al 2016 1 mountains are present primarily on the south sides of the terminal lakes of nalenggele river which are underlain primarily by proterozoic gneiss and schist and upper paleozoic sandstone and carbonate rocks and that were widely intruded by felsic igneous rocks of the caledonian variscan indosinian and yanshanian orogenies fissures in the bedrock produce local bedrock aquifer 2 gobi zones are located primarily on the north side of the piedmont and consist of ancient alluvial pluvial fans the lithology of this region is dominated by glutenite and gravel strata which constitute the principal phreatic aquifer of the piedmont clinoplains 3 alluvial lacustrine plains are primarily distributed as nw se trending belts with widths of 80 120 km on the north side of the gobi zones moreover the terminal li rich salt lakes yiliping playa xitai dongtai and senie salt lakes of nalenggele river are in the northernmost part of the plain most of these plains are used for farming and grazing and contain numerous springs sand gravelly sand clayey sand clay and evaporites are the primary lithologic types in this area 2 2 climate and hydrogeological settings the nalenggele river basin is a typical cold arid region characterized by scarce precipitation intense evaporation and wind all year round the average annual temperature and precipitation of the catchment are 3 5 and 29 8 mm respectively rainfall events mainly occur from may to september accounting for 87 of the annual precipitation and the distribution is uneven the mean annual evaporation is 1679 mm more than 56 times the yearly mean precipitation xu 2015 the west or southwest wind dominated in this area from january to september and the southwest or northwest wind from september to january of the following year with annual average wind speeds of 3 m s from march to may every year there are often gales of force eight or above data from the local weather station the nalenggele river and dazaohuo river both originated from the east kunlun mountains are the main surface water flowing through the three subzones of the drainage area fig 1c the upper reaches of the nalenggele river are formed by the mainstream which is named chulakealagan river and fed by meltwater and meteoric water and some tributaries the hongshui river is the most important tributary of the nalenggele river due to its high li and b content and more significant flow it converges with the mainstream at the end of nalenggele valley fig 1c although the li and b content in nalenggele river has decreased due to the inflow of other tributaries with meltwater and meteoric water sources in the process of river discharge to salt lakes the li and b contents of river water after the kunlun mountain pass is still higher than other surrounding rivers or world river average value in magnitude degree zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2020 the dazaohuo river has an annual runoff of 0 52 108 m3 a and a drainage area of 2500 km2 with a length of 130 km it is supplied by meltwater meteoric water and groundwater in mountain regions and discharged into senie lake fig 1c shi et al 2021 moreover after flowing out of kunlun mountain a large volume of river water infiltrates to recharge groundwater in the gobi zone then the remaining runoff converges with the re emerging groundwater at the low relief of the wetland zone in front of the alluvial lacustrine plains to form spring rivers fig 1c besides being influenced by the groundwater gushing there are a lot of springs and spring rivers in the wetland area the wutumeiren river drainage area of 6218 km2 and runoff of 1 01 108 m3 a and the east taijinaier river drainage area of 832 km2 and runoff of 8 78 106 m3 a are the larger ones among them fig 1c xu 2015 li 2020 the former originates from the upwelling groundwater influenced by the nalenggele river which mainly supplies senie lake the latter is primarily affected by meltwater and bedrock fissure water on the north slope of east kunlun mountain the runoff of the nalenggele river and a large number of spring rivers flow into the east taijinaier river in its middle reaches and then becomes the main supply river of the east tajinaier lake and the west taijinaier lake further because of the uplift of the nabei anticline a two stage alluvial fan system was developed in the nalenggele drainage area fig 1c the first stage alluvial fan fsaf is from the kunlun mountain pass to the nabei structure with an area of 1470 km2 and an elevation drop of 320 m yu et al 2013 a local groundwater circulation system is also formed here due to the obstruction of the nabei uplift fig 1d at the same time the east taijinaier river flows eastward along with the nabei structure because of the blocking effects it then turns north at the end of the structure discharging into the salt lake region and a second stage alluvial fan ssaf with an area of 1472 km2 and an altitude drop of about 50 m is formed 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and field measurements water samples from 54 sites including rivers springs shallow wells and salt lakes were collected in the nalenggele watershed fig 1c as the abundant meltwater in summer will make it difficult to go further into the alluvial lacustrine plains of nrb we conducted the fieldwork during winter of nov 2019 river water samples were taken from 4 main rivers and their tributaries at about 10 km intervals of each sample site including the nalenggele the dazaohuo the east taijinaier and the wutumeiren fig 1c meanwhile we also collected spring water samples from artesian flows in the wetland of nrb shallow groundwater samples were mainly pumped from 5 shallow drinking wells depth 10 m by water pump within the wetland fig 1c surface brine and intercrystalline brine samples were collected from the terminal salt lakes of nrb the latter is mainly from the manually excavated brine collecting ditch on the salt playa before water sample collection water temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and total dissolved solids tds were measured using a potable water quality analyzer mettler toledo sg78 at each site shallow groundwater samples were only collected after the pumped well water was stable and clear other water samples were taken at 0 2 m depth the water samples were in situ filtered on collection through 0 22 μm whatman cellulose acetate membranes to avoid the influence of suspended particles on the test results millot et al 2010 weynell et al 2017 1l of the filtered sample was collected in two 500 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles the samples for cations and trace element concentrations and isotopic measurements were acidified to ph less than 2 with ultrapure hno3 bottles for anion analysis were not acidified then the bottle was slightly wrapped by a parafilm strip around the closure to ensure no leakage all samples were kept chilled until analysis 3 2 analytical methods all the major ions were measured in the analysis department of qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences and the test processes in this study followed the procedures of the qinghai institute of salt lakes 1988 dissolved concentrations of major anions br cl and no3 were analyzed using ion chromatography ics 5000a co3 2 and hco3 were determined by potentiometric titration and so4 2 by baso4 heteromeric titration k was analyzed by flame photometer na concentrations of water samples were calculated by charge balance nco32 nhco3 nso42 ncl nk nca2 nmg2 n represents ionic equivalent value ca2

plasma emission spectroscopy icp oes with a precision of 10 87sr 86sr ratios of water samples were measured at the analytical laboratory of beijing research institute of uranium geology in beijing china chemical separation of sr2 was accomplished using a cation exchange column resin ag50w x8 h 100 200 mesh size usa sr isotope analyses were performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer isoprobe t from gv corporation uk the sr blank as determined by isotope mass spectrometry was 2 10 10 g the 87sr 86sr data were corrected for internal mass bias to 87sr 86sr 0 1194 the 87sr 86sr result for the reference material nbs 987 was 0 710250 0 00007 2σ n 10 its recommended value is 0 710248 the lithium isotope analysis of all samples was performed at the institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences ieecas chromatographic isolation of li was carried out using ag50w x8 cation exchange resin with 100 200 mesh size packed into customized pdf microcolumns with an internal diameter of 6 4 mm and a column length of 25 mm the column chemistry procedure was conducted twice to ensure pure li solution recovery and na li in all the samples was less than 5 the li separation procedures followed the steps described by gou et al 2019 the li isotopic ratios δ7li were measured using the sample standard bracketing ssb method on a neptune plus mc icp ms at ieecas all samples were conducted at a similar li concentration and the same procedure as standards l svec the total procedural blank of this method was less than 0 16 ng li which is negligible relative to the 300 ng of li analyzed in each sample gou et al 2019 values of δ7li are reported in standard per mil notation relative to l svec flesch et al 1973 where δ7li 7li 6li sample 7li 6li l svec 1 1000 the in house li standards ustc l yielded an average value of δ7li 19 3 0 1 2 s d n 45 and yielded as δ7li 12 2 0 2 2 s d n 78 for spex li respectively concurrently gbw li and seawater reference standard materials were repeatedly measured to be δ7li 7 93 0 2 2 s d n 10 δ7li 31 2 0 7 2 s d n 21 respectively this experiment measured δ7li of standards in agreement with previously published data dellinger et al 2014 2015 2017 gou et al 2019 moreover the long term external reproducibility is better than 0 9 2 s d for δ7li measurements gou et al 2018 detailed analytical methods for li isotopes are described by gou et al 2019 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical data physical chemical and isotopic data for the water samples are reported in table s1 water samples in the study area exhibit a wide range of salinities the ec values range from fresh 791 3 μs cm to saline 230 ms cm overall the salinity is lower in the upstream recharge rivers and spring rivers and increases towards the salt lake region indicating the influence of regional evaporation and the continuous dissolution of salt minerals along the path while the springs and shallow groundwaters generally have low salinity 791 3 5920 0 μs cm and fluctuate with the recharge rate of regional groundwater different water types are defined here using major ions in natural waters based on the principle of chemical divides according to hardie and eugster 1970 1 if parent water contains total alkalinity h c o 3 c o 3 2 ca2 after calcite precipitation then the water evolves to a na k cl hco3 co3 so4 type na hco3 so4 type 2 if parent water has total alkalinity h c o 3 c o 3 2 ca2 after calcite precipitation then the evolving path of sub water will be divided into two branches one is s o 4 2 ca2 after gypsum precipitation the sub water evolves to the na k mg cl so4 type cl so4 type otherwise the sub water has s o 4 2 ca2 after gypsum precipitation then the water evolves to the na ca k mg cl type ca cl type lowenstein et al 2017 fan et al 2018 the river waters spring river waters springs shallow groundwaters surface brines and intercrystalline brines are mainly divided into na hco3 so4 and cl so4 types based on the classification method specifically the river waters shallow groundwaters springs and spring river waters in the alluvial fan region are alkaline dominated by na hco3 so4 types with ph values ranging from 7 59 to 8 51 in comparison the water samples in the salt lake region are all characterized by cl so4 types with ph values from 6 51 to 8 66 table s1 further the mean ph of water generally decreases towards the salt lake region and reaches its lowest value for intercrystalline brines table s1 all water samples show that na and cl are the major dominant ions and with an increase of salinity along the discharge direction most ions of water samples show enrichment trends to a different extent especially in the salt lake region spatially the na k cl ca2 mg2 s o 4 2 li b3 and sr2 in waters of the salt lake region are much higher than those in the alluvial fan region moreover the waters in ganseng and dazaohuo areas with higher ec and tds values are more enriched in major ions than in the alluvial fan of nrb due to weak recharge flow and intense evaporation despite the lower ions concentration and salinity of waters in nrb the salt lake region unincluded the li and b3 contents are significantly higher than in those two regions implying that the sources of lithium and boron are different among these regions tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 in the ion correlation diagram fig 2 except for h c o 3 other major ions and trace elements are all well positively correlated with tds and cl suggesting that water geochemistry is mainly influenced by the evaporation process in parallel the positive correlation index between k and mg2 is as high as 0 99 while li and b3 is up to 0 95 furthermore a strong correlation can also be found among k mg2 li and b3 of water samples which likely indicates their common sources it is worth noting that the strong positive correlation between dissolved ca and sr compared with the relationship between ca and other ions fig 2 implies that besides the influence of evaporating process there are other essential components or processes which should be assessed such as the weathering of ca and sr bearing materials such as plagioclase amphibole sphene etc and the similar geochemical behavior between ca and sr during carbonate minerals precipitation liu et al 1984 shand et al 2009 4 2 sr and li isotopic compositions as illustrated in fig 3 a and table s2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of the studied water samples are highly scattered ranging from 0 70891 to 0 71269 the water from the chulakealagan river has the lowest 87sr 86sr ratios 0 70891 0 70949 li 2020 which is closer to the snowfall in kunlun mountain 0 71007 and the inland rivers of hoh xil basin 87sr 86sr 0 70949 0 71055 mainly fed by meltwater fig 3a zhao et al 2007 li 2020 and seems to record the expected effects of extensive dilution by local meteoric waters with relatively non radiogenic sr isotopic signatures luís et al 2019 the higher 87sr 86sr ratio and water temperature up to 92 pang 2009 of the bugedaban hot spring indicate the strong water rock interaction in the deep part of the kunlun tectonic belt fig 3a notably the 87sr 86sr value of nrb water samples concentrated distributed between the chulakealagan river and bugedaban hot spring of the nalenggele river watershed fig 3a it is believed that the sr in the water samples of nrb is affected by both sources in contrast samples taken from the dazaohuo area and ganseng area have 87sr 86sr values apparent greater than those samples in the nrb fig 3a with the highest values 0 712 located in the ganseng area within it the 87sr 86sr values of most shallow groundwaters and spring samples are greater than 0 7119 implying that the samples of these two areas may inherit the high radioactive sr isotope characteristics of the felsic bedrock of the kunlun mountain fig 1 liu et al 1984 this view is consistent with the high 87sr 86sr values of the acid insoluble matter in the surface river sediments of the main rivers in this region fig 3a measured li isotopes for water samples and regional reservoir data from previous work are reported in table s2 and fig 3b li isotopes compositions δ7li are significantly variable in the study area ranging from 3 81 shallow groundwater in nrb up to 28 66 river water in dazaohuo area spatially the δ7li values of surface waters in the nrb gradually increase from the mountains region to the salt lake region with a range of 4 44 5 25 fig 3b and accompanied by the gradual increase of lithium contents from 0 005 to 24 49 mmol l may indicating isotope fractionation at the supergene environment millot et al 2010 tomascak et al 2016 and the enhancement of regional evaporation in addition similar to water samples from the golmud river li 0 001 mmol l δ7li 18 37 he et al 2020 which also originates from the northern slope of the east kunlun mountains and is mainly recharged by meltwater the chulakealagan river sample nlg 22 has low li content 0 005 mmol l and high δ7li value 14 87 compared with the other samples in the nrb table s2 fig 3b suggesting the different sources of lithium in the nrb river waters in parallel the samples from ganseng and dazaohuo areas also have low li contents and high δ7li values with 0 007 0 2 mmol l 17 59 v 27 06 and 0 008 0 091 mmol l 20 19 28 66 respectively which is significantly different from the nrb waters fig 3b data on δ7li values of shallow groundwaters in the groundwater gushing zone of fsaf are considerably lower than other surface waters and range from 3 81 to 4 87 table s2 which is also the same as the characteristics of ganseng and zaohuo areas fig 3b suggesting the influence of relatively strong water rock interaction compared with the surface environment tomascak et al 2016 furthermore samples from the salt lake region display higher δ7li values and average at 12 76 0 1 2σ n 3 and the δ7li values are also rising with the increase of li abundances and tds implying that the transportation and salt forming process may have a specific influence on li isotope fractionation the main bedrocks of eastern kunlun mountain all show low δ7li values fig 3b which is consistent with that of the source bedrocks of other li rich brine regions in the world munk et al 2018 garcia et al 2020 meanwhile the hot spring waters often inherit the lithium isotope composition of bedrock due to sufficient water rock interaction fig 3b tomascak et al 2016 the δ7li values of the mainstream waters of nrb are highly consistent with the northern qtp hot spring waters fig 3b which may indicate the close relationship between nrb waters and regional hot springs i e the bugedaban hot spring in terms of dissolved lithium sources 5 discussion 5 1 sources of dissolved lithium potential sources of dissolved lithium to the salt lakes in nrb can be assumed to be either released by rock weathering including solubilization of the bedrock and destabilization or desorption from secondary minerals derived from the atmospheric deposition or derived from anthropogenic input palmer and edmond 1992 jin et al 2010 millot et al 2010 first of all as an area lacking industrial activity with a sparse population the anthropogenic impact of nrb is negligible besides the contribution of lithium from precipitation is also assumed to be negligible because of the low average annual precipitation 38 35 mm according to the meteorological data of the xiaozaohuo weather station near the study area from 2009 to 2018 to some extent the rarely reported data of lithium in atmospheric precipitation may reflect the extremely low li concentration in average rainfall generally 3 ppb tomascak et al 2016 furthermore no data exists for lithium in precipitation on the ne tibetan plateau but less than 0 5 of the major ions dissolved in the lake water may have been potentially added by precipitation weynell et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable to ignore the lithium input by atmospheric precipitation to the regional surface waters quantifying the origin of the solutes in the rivers is a non trivial task thus various approaches have been tried to solve the problem noh et al 2009 jin et al 2010 here we adopted the proportion results of different end members in the chulakealagan and golmud rivers which were calculated from the results of the forward model li 2020 the chulakealagan river is characterized by a high evaporite ca 60 70 and carbonate ca 11 30 contribution and low silicate ca 1 15 and rainwater ca 1 8 contribution compared with the golmud river which is respectively characterized by evaporite ca 28 60 carbonate ca 1 33 silicate ca 18 60 and rainwater ca 3 11 considering the significant difference in average lithium content between the mainstream of nalenggele river 0 61 mg l n 3 chulakealagan river 0 04 mg l n 15 and golmud river 0 05 mg l n 5 li 2020 it can be calculated that the lithium contribution of evaporite and carbonate in the chulakealagan river catchment to the nalenggele river is 3 9 4 6 and 0 7 1 9 respectively in comparison the silicate contribution through weathering is even less than 0 9 accordingly the dissolved li from each end member weathering of golmud river basin is 1 3 evaporite 0 05 1 7 carbonate and 0 9 3 0 silicate respectively furthermore because of insufficient information about the hongshui river another major tributary of the nalenggele river here we use the adjacent golmud river to replace the hongshui river to evaluate the dissolved lithium input by chemical weathering due to they share a similar climate topography lithostratigraphy and tectonic backgrounds in their watersheds the dissolved lithium from the main rock end member by surficial weathering is very low in the nrb between 84 9 and 93 4 of dissolved lithium in the nalenggele river must have another source different from regional surface weathering these estimates agree well with previous studies that have inferred that most riverine li derives from the deep hydrothermal fluids located upstream of the hongshui river fig 1 which is deeply influenced by the tectonic activity of the kunlun mountain fault zone zhu et al 1990 hu 1997 tan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 despite the lack of lithium isotopes data of the bugedaban hot spring the low dissolved li isotopic composition from 4 44 to 5 16 and high li concentration within the mainstream of nalenggele river relative to other adjacent rivers golmud river chulakealagan river and zaohuohe river and regional rainwater also indicate the importance of hydrothermal input to dissolved lithium in the nrb table s2 fig 3b both lithium and boron are particularly mobile elements in water rock interaction millot et al 2010 wei et al 2014 the laboratory experiments on water rock interaction of rhyolite under different temperature 150 350 and high pressure 25 mpa conditions show that the contents of na k li and b in the reacted waters increased significantly with the increase of reaction temperature and the dissolved co2 in the water enhances alkali metal cation leaching from the rhyolite cullen et al 2019 which suggests the importance of the hydrothermal system of the kunlun mountain tectonic belt to the formation of regional li rich recharge waters furthermore the strong positive correlation among k mg2 li and b3 in the water samples of the nrb fig 2 and their relatively high content of them in the nrb waters compared with other adjacent river water samples within similar evaporation degrees table s1 li 2020 which all indicate that the bedrocks of the hydrothermal systems hosted may be of rock type rich in these alkali metal elements such as biotite granite however this understanding needs further work to confirm in addition the hydrothermal fluids in donggi cona lake located at the eastern end of the kunlun mountains fault zone have the characteristics of high li contents and low δ7li values weynell et al 2017 which is also consistent with the other hydrothermal fluids and bedrock in the northern qtp fig 3b weynell et al 2017 he et al 2020 therefore we conclude that li concentrations and its isotopes composition in the dissolved load of nrb are essentially controlled by the hydrothermal fluids located upstream of the hongshui river 5 2 end member mixing analysis the calculation of mixing ratios is a critical task in hydrological research because it yields quantitative information about the origin of the water sources which is one of the ultimate goals of hydrology pelizardi et al 2017 identifying the end member waters is the primary problem usually achieved through end member mixing analysis emma then the mixing ratios of the end members in the mixtures could be calculated based on concentrations of conservative species christophersen and hooper 1992 in the nrb the determination of main water end members can be achieved by comparing the hydrochemical data and stable isotopes composition δ7li 87sr 86sr of various typical water bodies in the region bakari et al 2013 pelizardi et al 2017 since the surface water system of nrb meets the conditions for carrying out the mixing analysis these conditions consist of a sufficient number of conservative species and sufficiently different concentrations of recharge sources christophersen and hooper 1992 generally chemical components δ7li values and 87sr 86sr ratios of the waters of respective river systems within the nrb mainly reflect the mineralogy of the rocks with which they have been in contact jin et al 2010 millot and négrel 2021 the elemental concentrations of the river waters have distinct values for each tributary due to weathering in different source rocks and various water source rechange since physiography and landforms of these river systems are broadly similar in the piper diagram fig 4 the major cations that characterize the water samples are na and cl and mg2 is also impressive within intercrystalline brines in the salt lake region inheriting the dominance of the evaporite rich sedimentary strata or strongly affected by evaporation within the catchment in addition compared with the scattered data points in the ganseng area and zaohuohe area all water samples of the nrb are distributed centrally suggesting a close source connection among these water samples fig 4 furthermore the nrb data points are obviously between the bugedaban hot spring hydrothermal fluids in the upstream of hongshui river and the chulakealagan river in the diamond block and cation triangle block and closer to the side of chulakealagan river fig 4 which means that the nalenggele river water may be considered to represent a binary mixture between the hydrothermal fluids and the regional surface water and the latter may contribute the main solute to the nrb rivers especially for the major cations although li and its isotopes of surface water are sensitive to exogenic processes tomascak 2004 dellinger et al 2015 millot and négrel 2021 thus affecting the effectiveness of source tracing to a certain extent they still inherit the primary information of source rocks within a small watershed scale weynell et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the δ7li values of nrb mainstream samples are very close to the bedrocks of eastern kunlun mountain and the regional hot springs considering the lower residence time of surface water due to high altitude drops in the study area fig 1 xu 2015 it is believed that these samples inherit the li isotopes features similar with the hot springs of northern qtp i e bugedaban hot spring for regional surface waters their δ7li value continuously decreases when more dissolved li is derived from solids and increases with long distance transport pistiner and henderson 2003 millot et al 2010 without considering the evaporation during transportation the preferential incorporation of 6li in clay or oxide rich alteration products may be the key factor for significant lithium isotope fractionation due to weak chemical weathering in small watersheds of the qtp weynell et al 2017 the lower δ7li values of the nrb waters compared with the regional surface waters e g golmud river chulakealagan river and zaohuohe river fig 3b and their close distribution indicate the importance of hot spring water supply to dissolved lithium in the nrb and their genetic relationships respectively meanwhile the growth trend of δ7li values along the river discharge direction in the nrb fig 3b may suggest that the increase of secondary minerals and residence time play an essential role in li isotopes fractionation in the nrb tomascak 2004 dellinger et al 2015 xu 2015 further the δ7li values of nrb waters are between hot springs of northern qtp and the surface water of the same hydrological system chulakealagan river fig 3b which also indicates a binary mixing process strontium isotopes are powerful for constraining and testing geochemical and hydrological models sr derived from seawater and marine sediments generally has a low 87sr 86sr ratio while sr derived from dissolution of rb rich minerals i e k feldspar and mica will have a higher ratio faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 the sr isotope ratios of water samples should usually be shifted towards that of the leachates if the sr isotope ratio is governed simply by water rock interaction and mixing with recharge water although additional strontium input or output may occur at the transportation of river waters the sr isotope ratio is usually not complicated by variations in meteoric loading or by biological and low temperature abiotic chemical reactions lyons et al 1995 fakir et al 2002 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 bakari et al 2013 data on sr isotope ratios were applied to construct a mixing model to elucidate the contributions from different water sources end members and processes governing their water chemistry in the nrb considering the water supply and discharge system in nrb and the hydrochemistry analysis mentioned above the chulakealagan river and bugedaban hot springs are typical end members of regional surface water and hydrothermal fluid in the catchment here we put all sample data of the end member waters including regional snowfall regional surface waters tuotuo river and qumar river in the hoh xil basin and nrb waters in the 87sr 86sr isotopic ratio versus 10000 sr plot fig 5 it can be seen that most of the water samples plot within the triangle whose apexes represent the three end members abc except for a few samples in the adjacent area of nrb having more radiogenic sr than end member a fig 5b however if the tiny amount of sr in the regional snowfall sample is taken into account the snowfall contribution may be neglected the nrb water samples are then considered to represent broad binary mixtures between a and b consistent with the end member analysis mentioned above in addition fig 5 indicates that our mixture is a typical binary mixing of high 87sr 86sr ratios end member sources such as silicate minerals and low 87sr 86sr ratio end member sources such as carbonate or evaporite sediments besides most of the samples are plotted along the binary mixing line a b connecting the chulakealagan river a and bugedaban hot spring b while few samples along the mixing lines a c and b c fig 5a which supports this assumption and also indicates that the sr isotope contribution from the regional snowfall end member is meager the binary mixture can be expressed by end members as follows faure 1986 négrel and roy 1998 wang et al 2020 r c a r a r b 1 α c b r b r a 1 1 α c a r b 1 α c b r a 1 1 α where α is the mixing ratio of end member a ca and cb are the sr contents of end member a and b ra and rb are the 87sr 86sr isotope ratios of end member a and b and r is the presumed isotope ratio calculated using the predetermined mixing proportions of the two end member a and b we used this model to calculate the theoretical value of the sr isotope ratios of the mixture of the chulakealagan river a and bugedaban hot spring b and established the binary mixing model a theoretical mixing line was plotted according to the calculated 87sr 86sr isotopic ratios and sr concentrations of the mixing solutions fig 6 the measured values of water samples in the nrb were also plotted the river and spring river water points clustered closely around the mixing line supporting the proposed genesis of these waters discussed above which also suggests a mixing ratio of 3 5 hot spring water in the nrb water samples fig 6 implying that the major water body 95 97 of the nrb river comes from the surface water mainly supplied by meltwater combined with the sources analysis of dissolved lithium in the nrb mentioned above although only a small volume of bugedaban hydrothermal fluids is supplied to the nrb system it provides the vast majority of lithium and boron resources this view is also consistent with the abnormally high lithium and boron contents of the bugedaban hot spring li 96 mg l b 180 mg l hu 1997 and the lower δ7li values of nalenggele river fig 3b in addition the regional surface rivers qumar river and tuotuohe river with low hot spring supply less than 1 also suggest that surface water is mainly supplied by meltwater in the inland basin of the qtp and generally has similar 87sr 86sr isotopic ratios and sr concentrations however it is easy to change due to the input of hot spring water it should be noted that although we are confident in this conclusion the sparsity of the critical data such as the sr content and its isotopes composition of hongshui river and chualakealagan river may still have a certain impact on the accuracy of this understanding therefore it is necessary to carry out further supplementary work in the future moreover 87sr 86sr ratios vs sr content can also point out the possible hydro geochemical processes that may have affected the water samples and their impact on the 87sr 86sr ratios our data shows that most water samples in the nrb are more affected by silicate water interactions with high 87sr 86sr ratios and lower sr contents faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 compared with the regional surface waters end member a tuotuo river and qumar river which have low 87sr 86sr ratios and higher sr content due to the influence of carbonate or evaporite fig 5 négrel et al 2001 jin et al 2010 and such characteristics may be common within the hinterland of qtp furthermore the higher 87sr 86sr ratios and sr contents of the shallow groundwaters than most of the nrb water samples can be explained by stronger interaction between groundwater and aquifer materials due to the relatively high residence time xu 2015 while the linear correlated distribution of nrb sample points along with the water discharge direction indicates that dissolution of calcite and or regional evaporation affect the dissolved sr in nrb waters fig 5a 6 jin et al 2010 bakari et al 2013 but has little effect on sr isotope ratio which is also consistent with the geochemical features of strontium in nature faure 1986 bakari et al 2013 to corroborate the occurrence of mineral dissolution the phreeeqc geochemical program was used to compute the saturation indices si the results show that most nrb water samples are oversaturated or close to equilibrium conditions to calcite table s2 implying that significant carbonate dissolution has occurred jin et al 2010 this is also supported by a good linear relationship between sr and the carbonate system e g sr2 vs ca2 r2 0 89 in fig 2 5 3 dynamics of lithium in the nrb the li isotopic signature in the water integrates two components the signature of the bedrock and the processes that control the isotopic fractionation during water rock interaction godfrey et al 2013 munk et al 2018 as discussed in the previous section the δ7li values recorded in the nrb waters seem to reflect the mixed contributions of li from hydrothermal sources and bedrock weathering during the mixed water body reaching the salt lake area the li concentrations increase rapidly due to evaporation while δ7li values also increase along the river discharge direction fig 7 the li na ratio in the dissolved load always be used as a sensitive indicator of the extent of chemical weathering occurring in streams and groundwater reservoirs e g vigier et al 2009 millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 both elements are alkali metals thus mobile during water rock interaction as shown by numerous studies in contrast to na li is likely to be adsorbed onto the secondary minerals formed during water rock interactions thus leading to decreasing li na ratios with increasing residence time millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 millot and négrel 2021 in addition the li na ratio varies due to li adsorption and the removal of na during halite precipitation from oversaturated brines in the salt lake system millot et al 2010 garcia et al 2020 thus here we can define f li the enrichment degree of li remaining in solution relative to na along the discharge direction of nrb as f l i li σ ts j li σ ts i na σ ts j na σ ts i where li and na are the corresponding ion concentrations in water samples respectively σts is the sum of all ions i and j refer to consecutive sample numbers distributed in sequence along the discharge direction where j represents the following sample after i in most situations at equal environment conditions a value of 1 for f li means that the enrichment degree of li and na is congruent f li 1 means that li is more enriched than na while f li 1 means that na is more enriched than li for accurate discussion two discharge systems were divided from the nrb due to the regional hydrological conditions table s3 one is the discharge system towards the west and east taijinaier salt lakes and the other is to the senie salt lake the wutumeiren river system as expected the calculated f li in the water samples of the nrb changes regularly with different positions gradually decreases from the fsaf to the salt marsh area then increases rapidly in the salt lake region fig 8 specifically the dissolved li na is positively correlated with li in the gobi and fsaf zones fig 8 and the f li value of most samples is also great than 1 with an average value of 1 1 table s3 suggesting an abnormally enrichment of dissolved lithium in waters of this region considering these waters lower ec and tds values table s1 there must be an additional dissolved lithium source resulting in the li enrichment relative to na in the waters while the significant li isotope difference between these waters average δ7li value of 5 73 n 11 and the chulakealagan river water 14 87 one of the main tributary of the nalenggele river indicates that the dissolved lithium of gobi and fsaf zone waters is remarkably controlled by the additional input of li rich water with lower li isotope compositions this point is also consistent with the high li concentration and li enrichment factor of the hongshui river another tributary of the nalenggele river related to hydrothermal springs fig 1c table s3 besides the release of adsorbed lithium in the groundwater gushing zone of fsaf may be another important dissolved lithium source with higher li contents and lower δ7li values the rapid increase of clay content in sediments of the gushing zone leads to the sudden decrease of groundwater velocity which is believed to promote the release of early adsorbed lithium in clays li 2020 one exception is the sample wtmr 20 with higher δ7li values of 9 62 and li content of 0 125 mmol l table s3 which may be related to the slow moving of the water body in the sampling area and leads to the li isotopic fractionation by secondary minerals adsorption millot et al 2010 decarreau et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 further the residence time of water in groundwater counteracts the effect of low temperature and favors the formation of secondary minerals that fractionate li isotopes at equilibrium millot et al 2010 high residence time benefits the dissolution of aquifer minerals e g feldspar and mica and makes the solution inherit the li isotope composition of the dissolved minerals thus the low li isotopic composition of shallow groundwater samples wtmr 24 δ7li 3 81 wtmr 38 δ7li 4 37 is compatible with the estimated minerals solution li isotopic evolution at equilibrium under a relatively high residence time xu 2015 the calculated f li in the waters of the ssaf ranges between 0 6 and 0 8 average value of 0 7 with a decreasing trend along the discharge direction table s3 fig 8 implying the enrichment of na relative to li and the removal of li in this area in addition the δ7li value of water samples in the ssaf is significantly higher than that in the gobi and fsaf area from 6 93 to 9 31 with an average value of 8 34 table s2 figs 7 8 which reflects preferential partitioning of dissolved 6li into secondary minerals i e illites during incongruent weathering huh et al 2001 vigier et al 2008 weynell et al 2017 since illite is the dominant clay mineral in the sediments of qaidam basin miao et al 2016 williams and hervig 2005 suggest that illite can incorporate high amounts of li in its octahedral site resulting in li isotope fractionation and producing the higher δ7li values of solutions this view has also been verified in the relevant studies of the lake donggi cona and huanghe river catchments weynell et al 2017 sun and colin 2014 furthermore the adsorption of fe mn oxy hydroxide minerals within the ssaf sediments may also play an essential role in the li isotopic fractionation during the downstream movement of the rivers our sequential extraction experiment of li in the nrb sediments shows that higher content of dissolved li can be desorbed in the reducible fe mn oxides than other extractable forms exchangeable oxidizable organic matter and sulfides in sediments unpublished data and other researchers also declare that the fe hydr oxides could result in higher δ7li values in waters by surface adsorption pistiner and henderson 2003 vigier et al 2008 godfrey et al 2013 garcia et al 2020 in addition the higher residence time of rivers caused by the low topographic drop in this area and the more clay contents are also conducive to the preferential partitioning of dissolved 6li into secondary minerals resulting in the increase of δ7li values in the water samples the dynamics of lithium in the salt lake region are entirely different from those in the other areas the brine f li values change significantly from 0 4 in the surface brine to 7 7 in the intercrystalline brines fig 8 suggesting a strong enrichment of li relative to na with the geochemical evolution of inflow waters to brines while the δ7li value of the brines in the salt lake region also increased apparently to those in the ssaf region with 4 average isotopic shift fig 7 the general pattern of increasing li and δ7li value from inflow waters to brines is a function of evapo concentration which drives the li concentration up as well as results in the formation of secondary mineral phases and halite these secondary phases sequester 6li which increases the δ7li of fractionated water as li concentration increases munk et al 2018 lithium is known to concentrate in the clays or fe hydr oxides with increasing concentrations of li in solution temperature and time decarreau et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 as the destination of inflow waters of the nrb the li isotope fractionation caused by clays fe hydr oxides is sufficient due to the highest li concentrations and residence time of surface waters in the salt lake region xu 2015 on the other hand the halite formation is not only the direct reason for the significant increase in f li values table s3 fig 8 but is also considered another important factor for 6li removal munk et al 2018 garcia et al 2020 nevertheless the primary inducement of the increase of δ7li value in the salt lake region of nrb may be more related to the geochemical evolution of brines due to the massive precipitation of salt minerals and scarcity of clay sediments previous studies reported that the older evaporitic preserved an isotopic signature similar to their contemporaneous brines godfrey et al 2013 garcia et al 2020 the brine evolution under continuous evaporation will lead to a higher δ7li signature in the late stage halite than in the early stage thus the subsequent enrichment of 7li in the brines can be explained by the long term evolution of the brines or mixing with ancient li rich fluids trapped in the older evaporitic layers that preserved a high li isotopic signature although the insufficient sample data of the ssaf and salt lake region our data show that the li isotopes are very sensitive to the origin of lithium and its geochemical behavior in the processes of migration and enrichment and the regional hydrogeological conditions similar cases in nevada playas araoka et al 2014 and salar de olaroz of central andes garcia et al 2020 also show that the δ7li could be a valuable tracer for lithium sources and evaluating its accumulation processes in playas to precisely determine the mechanisms that result in the preferential release of 7li into solution under strong evaporation conditions future studies will be necessary to investigate the lithium isotopic heterogeneity of the bedrocks and extractable forms of river sediments and the li isotope fractionation in the process of evaporite precipitation from continuous evaporation 5 4 implications for the formation of li rich brines according to the above discussion the critical genetic factors of li rich brine deposits in the nrb are consistent with the common characteristics of continental lithium brines summarized by munk et al 2016 such as arid climate closed basin containing salt lakes associated li rich hydrothermal activity significant inflow waters sufficient time for lithium accumulation in brines however as a typical li rich brine deposit of qtp the nrb lithium brines also have unique characteristics in the formation mechanisms on the origin of lithium many lithium brine deposits are closely related to the supply of li rich hot springs such as uyuni salt lake in bolivia munk et al 2016 nevada playas in the usa araoka et al 2014 mamicuo and zhabuye lake in tibet china liu et al 2021 the recharge pattern of li rich hydrothermal fluids obviously influences the mg li ratio of the terminal salt lake in the nrb the remote recharge mode of hot springs to the salt lakes supply distance over 450 km leads to significantly higher mg li ratios in the brines of the salt lake region ca 40 90 liu et al 2021 compared with the other lithium brine deposits in the western usa and the central andes mg li less than 10 munk et al 2016 liu et al 2021 it can be explained to a certain extent by mixing a massive volume of surface water to the nalenggele river during the remote recharge of the bugedaban hot spring to the salt lakes thus brought into a large amount of dissolved magnesium from the surface weathering process moreover mg li ratio can also be used as an indicator for water mixing characteristics as the geochemical behavior of mg ions can be similar to li ions in low temperature aqueous solution munk et al 2016 by analyzing the variation of the mg li ratio in the waters of nrb from source to sink it is found that the mg li ratio of the recharge river constantly changed significantly only when the regional surface water mg li ratios range of ca 500 600 significantly flowed in fig 9 in addition the mg li ratios of the nrb system are lower than that of the golmud river system due to the recharge of the li rich hot springs in the upper reaches of the nalenggele river the tail salt lakes of each river system maintain the mg li ratio similar to that of the mainstream of the respective recharge river only slightly changes can be seen within the areas from the alluvial fan to the salt lake region due to mineral precipitation dolomite halite etc clay or fe mn oxides adsorption and other reasons fig 9 table s2 therefore without considering the special salt lake type carbonate type the low mg li ratio in the li rich salt lake may indicate a significant recharge of li rich hot springs to the salt lake it is also consistent with the previous discussion and the facts about the li rich salt lakes in the western usa and the central andes munk et al 2016 liu et al 2021 in terms of the enrichment process the loss of dissolved lithium in recharge water during migration may be an essential issue rarely involved in other li rich brine deposits and related to the size of resources yu et al 2013 has roughly calculated the theoretical size of lithium resource of salt lakes in the nrb according to the average annual runoff of the nalenggele river 10 3 108m3 a the average contents of dissolved lithium at the mountain pass of nalenggele river 0 727 mg l and the calculation yields an annual lithium input of 748 8 t considering the conclusion that the evolutionary period of hongshui river and nalenggele river in qaidam basin is not less than 10 ka zhu et al 1989 tan et al 2012 chang et al 2017 the total amount of lithium resource imported from the nalenggele river into the qaidam basin is conservatively estimated to be about 748 8 mt however it is significantly different from the size of lithium resources revealed by a geologic reconnaissance in the li rich salt lake region of nrb 230 5 mt li 2020 so what is the reason for the massive loss of dissolved lithium in migration and enrichment based on the fact that there has been no breakthrough in geological exploration of lithium brine resources in the salt lake region of nrb recently the fixation of dissolved lithium in waters by the adsorption of clays or fe mn oxides and co precipitation in evaporites may have a significant impact on it according to our study moreover this understanding was also supported by the sequential extraction experiments of bulk sediments in the clayton valley basin coffey et al 2021 and the evidence of high lithium content up to 220 mg kg in the halite samples of the salar de olaroz garcia et al 2020 although there has been a qualitative interpretation of the possible approaches resulting in the loss of dissolved lithium in nrb waters the clear evidence of mechanisms is still insufficient so it is difficult to accurately estimate the changes in lithium resources in the nrb 6 conclusions lithium rich brines are the most economically recoverable li source on the planet as one of the world s most crucial lithium brine deposits the genetic mechanisms of the li rich salt lakes in the nrb are still poorly understood in this study we suggest that the combined use of lithium and strontium isotopes is a viable method for quantitatively estimating the contributions of regional end member water bodies and their dissolved lithium to li rich salt lakes in addition li isotopes are also very sensitive to the dynamic behavior of dissolved lithium during migration and enrichment our study shows that consistent with the previous views the lithium in li rich salt lakes of nrb mainly comes from the supply of the bugedaban hot springs in the eastern kunlun mountain tectonic belt meanwhile our evidence further suggests that the contribution of regional surface meltwater and hydrothermal water bugedaban hot spring to the nrb is 95 97 and 3 5 respectively in contrast the hydrothermal water with a small supply proportion contributes 84 9 93 4 of dissolved lithium to the li rich salt lakes of nrb moreover the main control factors of lithium in dissolved load in different hydrological regions are various which could be characterized by li isotopes li na ratio and li enrichment factor relative to na of various water samples within the catchment the major conclusions include 1 the input of additional li rich water has controlled the abnormal enrichment behavior of li relative to na and the low δ7li value average δ7li value of 5 73 in the waters of gobi and fsaf zone of the nrb 2 the adsorption of clay or fe mn oxide phases play an essential role for significant li removal from the waters and the increase of δ7li value with an average value of 8 34 in the second stage alluvial fan ssaf region 3 in the salt lake region the continuous halite precipitation during the brine evolution not only causes the abnormal enrichment of li in the brine compared with na but also leading to the significant 7li enrichment in the brines thus mixing ancient li rich fluids with high δ7li values trapped in the older evaporitic layers may also have played a role to summarize the genetic model of li brines in the nrb is of great significance to the li rich salt lake brines in other parts of the world in terms of lithium source whether the dissolved lithium of salt lakes mainly comes from the hydrothermal system may be the critical factor in determining whether the lithium brine has low mg li characteristics excluding carbonate type salt lakes furthermore the loss of dissolved lithium in waters due to the adsorption of clays or fe mn oxides and co precipitation in evaporites during migration and enrichment may significantly impact the size of lithium resources in the salt lake areas however this view needs to be verified by further systematic work in the future credit authorship contribution statement weiliang miao conceptualization data curation formal

2771,reliable and accurate flood forecasting is a complex and challenging problem that is essential for the creation of disaster preparedness plans to protect life and reduce economic losses this study suggests a novel hybrid model for real time multi steps ahead flood forecasting within the saint lawrence river in quebec by integrating the discrete wavelet transform dwt and improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm models the dwtiorelm model was constructed with three main novelties i consider the sparsity characteristics of the outliers to enhance the performance of the elm based model in the presence of outliers ii introduce an iterative process to overcome the random definition of the two main matrices in the elm based approaches iii integrate iorelm with dwt as a preprocessing technique to decompose the main input signals to high scale and low frequency signals the performance of the individual iorelm is compared with the original version of elm regularized elm relm and weighted relm wrelm in terms of global accuracy and accuracy in peak flow forecasting the results indicated that the iorelm outperformed other models however there was a need for a model that could perform better for peak flow detection iorelm as the best individual model was integrated with dwt and the dwtiorelm model was developed to overcome this limitation in addition the comparison results of the hybrid dwtiorelm and individual iorelm models in terms of accuracy and simplicity as well as peak flow forecasting indicate that the introduced hybrid model r 0 99 nse 0 99 rmse 0 234 nrmse 0 021 mare 0 02 in the current study not only overcomes all limitations of the existing elm based methods but also could be applied in multi steps ahead flood forecasting the optimum values of the number of hidden neurons decomposition level and iteration number were found to be 200 1 and 500 respectively furthermore the sigmoid function and discrete meyer dm were selected as the best activation function and mother wavelet respectively the developed hybrid model was applied to check its performance in multi steps ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead the results showed that it could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 keywords discrete wavelet transform flood severity detection multi steps ahead forecasting outlier robust extreme learning machine real time flood forecasting water resource management 1 introduction natural catastrophes such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods can result in massive losses on a national and regional level and have the potential to influence financial markets because of the societal economic and financial ramifications among natural catastrophes from 1994 to 2013 2937 flood events were recorded with more than 2 4 billion affected people unisdr cred 2015 indeed the greatest substantial impact globally in terms of people affected about 55 of people and the number of events 43 of all events has been caused by floods with lost assets totaling over 636 billion usd serinaldi et al 2018 indeed flooding has been ranked by some researchers as the third most deadly disaster following earthquakes and tsunamis zaji et al 2018 according to the department of public safety of canada 1 1 https www canada ca en services policing emergencies hazards html floods are the most common natural disaster in canada in terms of frequency and property damages as a result of the increasing anthropogenic activity that emits greenhouse gases gges the fact that the earth is warming is universally recognized the average worldwide temperature has increased by 0 89 c through 1901 2012 ipcc 2013 the trend of global warming is projected to continue with the mean global temperature forecasted to by

anticipated to rise by 2 0 6 0 c over the next 80 years as the temperature rises the capacity of the atmosphere to store water vapor rises changing the precipitation regime rouhani and leconte 2018 ostad ali askar et al 2018 and as a result the hydrologic cycle of watersheds rain on snow snowmelts ice jam heavy rainfall thunderstorms riverine flooding and coastal flooding are the most common sources of flooding in canada zahmatkesh et al 2019 according to environmental and natural resources canada 2 2 https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity causes of flooding html the most prevalent type of flooding in canada is snowmelt runoff floods for snowmelt dominated areas variations in precipitation will alter snow accumulation and thus streamflow while temperature variations will almost certainly alter the timing of snowmelt more frequent intense precipitation and rapid snowmelt conditions are becoming more common as a result of urbanization and global warming s effect on rainfall patterns increasing the risk of floods in canada awareness and reaction of different disaster management entities are extremely dependent on the accessibility of precise and timely hydrological and meteorological predictions effective practical flood forecasting is favorable in helping the public and authorities create short and long term precautionary measures plan evacuation and rescue missions and provide relief to flood victims consequently the use of modern methods that can precisely predict this complex phenomenon is of considerable importance flood forecasting is more successful and beneficial when done hourly and with enough lead time since it may be used to devise and conduct emergency evacuation plans alexander et al 2018 according to the dynamic nature of the climatic circumstance predicting flood lead time and occurrence is challenging flood forecasting approaches are categorized into two main groups physically based hydrological pbh and machine learning ml methods today s leading flood forecasting models are primarily data driven and based on several simplified suppositions lohani e al 2014 therefore particular methodologies including continuous deterministic stochastic empirical black box and event driven are developed to imitate the problematic mathematical representations of basin behavior and physical processes moosavi et al 2018 pbh models on the other hand have been demonstrated to be quite good at forecasting a wide range of flooding events however they also have some drawbacks which make them difficult to use the main limitations of these types of models are 1 to apply them a substantial quantity of professional knowledge and expertise concerning hydrological parameters is necessary kim et al 2015 2 they frequently demand a variety of geomorphological and hydrological datasets which necessitate expensive calculation yu et al 2006 and prevent short term forecasting nayak et al 2005 van den honert and mcaneney 2011 3 data collection is primarily manual and storage is unorganized resulting in a shortage of hydrological data and making data even more challenging to access in some remote regions zhang et al 2021 4 over parameterization beven 2006 might result in a high level of prediction uncertainty uhlenbrook et al 1999 5 these models are inapplicable for real time flood forecasting flood forecasting is based on complicated and frequently unobtainable information including hydrologic and physical site specific elements such as storm severity precipitation runoff coefficient and catchment physical properties such as land use and soil type etc resulting in looking towards simpler techniques in addition to pbh models data driven techniques have a long history in flood forecasting and have recently increased in popularity to give improved insight these techniques of prediction use historical recorded values of the hydro meteorological variables the classical stochastic models including the autoregressive moving average and its extensions moeeni et al 2017a bonakdari et al 2020a lotfi et al 2021 are the first statistical tools for flood frequency forecasting the main limitation of these models is their linear based structure to overcome this limitation recently various studies have been performed in hydrology based on different preprocessing techniques moeeni et al 2017b eslamian et al 2018 lotfi et al 2019 the proposing methodology based on the preprocessing techniques is very complicated and requires in depth knowledge in hydrology time series and different statistical tests to overcome the linear structure of the classical statistical based models the nonlinear based ml algorithms have been implemented by scholars in the hydrology field these models only require historical values of the hydrological parameter from the basin noymanee et al 2017 le et al 2019 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 and use a self learning function to complete flood forecasting hou and tang 2013 preventing the time consuming process of parameter selection a complex modeling process and long prediction times associated with pbh methods as a result it is becoming increasingly popular among scholars table 1 briefly reviews individual and hybrid ml based approaches in short term flood forecasting that have been employed over the last ten years it can be seen that more than forty different ml based techniques including adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis artificial neural network ann nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx reduced error pruning trees rept random forest rf etc have been applied in the thirty eight different published papers demonstrating the extent of ml techniques in flood forecasting the methods presented in this table are divided into two general categories individual and hybrid the flood resource variables considered by the scholars have been categorized into different groups such as rainfall runoff rainfall runoff water level river flow flood extreme flood extreme rainfall events river flow etc additionally the forecasting types of floods are categorized into four different groups including daily hourly rainfall runoff and real time the feedforward neural network ffnn is one of the most well known ml based techniques in flood forecasting ebtehaj et al 2020 with over 60 of the studies in table 1 considering it as the modeling technique although this model has been widely implemented in flood forecasting several important limitations have made its use a challenge the time consuming iterative process of tuning ffnn parameters through the training phase results in slow convergence bonakdari and ebtehaj 2016 bonakdari et al 2019 2020b furthermore the learning rate overfitting and low generalization ability are other significant drawbacks of the classical ffnn ebtehaj et al 2018 bonakdari et al 2019 to overcome these limitations huang et al 2006 introduced extreme learning machine elm as a non tuned rapid machine learning model based on the ffnn elm is a developed version of the ffnn that has only one hidden layer the modeling phase in elm consists of adjusting the parameters of three matrices input weights the bias of hidden neurons and output weights the first two matrices are randomly initiated while the third one is determined analytically by solving a linear system the most significant advantage of the elm is its high generalizability obtained by avoiding becoming trapped in local minima besides the limited number of user interventions high accuracy fast learning rates and robustness are other advantages of the elm huang et al 2015 despite all these advantages this method also has limitations that lead to significant challenges related to flood prediction the biggest problem associated with this method is the random determination of two main matrices i e initial weights and bias of hidden neurons their lack of precise determination can affect the generalizability of the elm while global accuracy of this method has been confirmed in a number of studies the peak forecasting accuracy which is critical for flood forecasting has been observed to be unacceptable in some cases fig 1 indicates the observed and predicted discharge of the white river where it can be seen that the global accuracy only reached a correlation coefficient of 0 89 such predictive performance does not provide acceptable results in estimating the large discharges associated with flood events the percentage of peak flows is generally very small compared to all flows and are therefore considered as outliers compared to flows observed under normal conditions the existence of outliers may result in an untrustworthy elm model zhang and luo 2015 and it is therefore crucial to develop a model capable of overcoming this drawback the main objective of the current study is to develop a hybrid model for the flood warning system within the saint lawrence river in quebec canada the novelty of the present study is threefold first the definition of a new loss function for an elm based model based on the sparsity feature of outliers to increase the robustness of the model in terms of peak flow forecasting that results in the outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm second improving the first scheme of orelm by combining this model with an intelligence iterative based process to overcome random adjusting of the two main matrices in the first generation of elm i e the bias of hidden neurons and input weights third integration of iorelm with the discrete wavelet transform dwt to introduce the hybrid dwtiorelm model the developed dwtiorelm will be evaluated based on its capability to forecast various timesteps in advance as well as its proficiency to forecast flows related to different levels of projected riverine flooding intensity multi timesteps in advance 2 study area the data

persons live on its shores in the regional county municipality of la jacques cartier and quebec it is known as the most thickly populated drainage basin in any river in quebec with the majority of the population inhabited in the latter third of its length the dataset was collected hourly from 1998 to 2021 with 70 of all samples being applied for model calibration and the remaining 30 to validate the performance of the developed model s the minimum maximum and mean discharges of the collected data samples are 0 04 m3s 1 97 8 m3s 1 and 10 12 m3s 1 respectively indeed the ratio of the maximum flow rate to the average value exceeds 9 66 2 1 the importance of flood forecasting in quebec one of the most frequent commons of natural disasters in canada especially in quebec is flooding due to intense rainfall being one of the main flooding reasons in canada the distribution of heavy rainfall events in different provinces is shown in fig 3 from this figure it can be seen that the province of quebec is subjected to the greatest proportion of all extreme rainfall events across canada at 23 89 additionally more than 70 of all extreme rainfalls occurred in only three provinces quebec ontario and british columbia who ranked first second and third respectively in addition to the study of heavy rainfalls the history of floods in canada and the resulting damage by provinces also shows the importance of flood forecasting in quebec fig 4 provides the history of floods in different provinces and territories in canada based obtained from the canadian disaster database cdd over the period from 1900 to 2021 from this figure the minimum and the maximum number of floods are seen in nunavut and ontario respectively with one and sixty two recorded flood s during this period due to this figure more than 11 of the total recorded floods in canada occurred in quebec i e 35 recorded floods in both the province of quebec and canada as a whole the number of floods over this period is three times greater than wildfires the second most common natural disaster in canada from the period reported by the cdd different incredible floods have been recorded in the province of quebec in july 1966 over 290 mm of rainfall led to the saguenay flood resulting in at least ten deaths the evacuation of more than 15 825 persons and an estimated cost of over 300 million cad the convergence of intense rainfall following a cold and snowy winter resulted in the 2019 quebec flood due to this flooding 6681 residents in quebec province were flooded the estimated cost of this flood in the city of montreal alone was 17 million cad as shown in fig 4 the average estimated cost per flood in quebec province is about 49 million cad which is more than 5 of all estimated costs of flooding in canada based on the above discussion accurate real time flood forecasting with adequate lead time in quebec is an essential tool for decision and policymakers such a tool will enhance preparation and permit rapid response in the adoption of suitable flood mitigation strategies and rehabilitation actions reducing infrastructure damages and decreasing the economic and social influences of the floods on communities 3 methods a diagram demonstrating the methods applied in the current study is provided in fig 5 from this figure the ffnn based models are categorized into two main groups classical ones trained with the back propagation algorithm and elm based methods that are non tuned rapid ffnn the non tuned rapid term is applied because there is only one parameter that needs to be adjusted in elm and the training time of this model is very fast the main weakness of the classical ffn is overfitting slow convergence and time consuming training due to the mentioned limitations of the elm and its weakness in outlier forecasting such as floods that are considered as outliers compared to other samples the outlier robust elm orelm is developed based on the sparsity feature of outliers yet this model still possesses a limitation in the random tuning of two main matrices in the structure of the elm based model i e input weights and bias of hidden neurons which must be overcome by the use of an iterative version of the orelm known as the improved orelm iorelm finally to decompose the input signals to high scale and low frequency signals the iorelm is integrated with the discrete wavelet transform dwt and introduced dwtiorelm for flood forecasting the details of each method are provided in the following sections 3 1 improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm 3 1 1 extreme learning machine elm extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2006 is a single layer ffnn indeed in addition to the input and output layers it has only one hidden layer that maps the independent input variables to the dependent output variable before modeling the activation function type and the number of hidden neurons nhn should be defined by the user different activation functions that are often considered include hard limit radial basis triangular basis sigmoid sine and hyperbolic tangent the details of each one were presented in bonakdari et al 2020b there is no specific method for determining the nhn before modeling generally the value of this parameter is obtained through a trial and error process the minimum value of this parameter can be considered as one while the maximum value of this parameter should be determined so that the number of optimized parameters during the training process is less than training samples ebtehaj and bonakdari 2021 the maximum allowable nhn is calculated as follows ebtehaj et al 2021 1 max n h n trsa inv 2 where nhn trsa and inv are the number of hidden neurons training samples and the number of input variables respectively a schematic of the modeling process using elm is provided in fig 6 the elm training process is commenced by the random definition of the input weights and bias of hidden neurons the structures of these two matrices are defined and tuned randomly using the user defined nhn using the activation function and these two matrices the output of the hidden layer is calculated finally through a linear process the output weight is determined let consider a problem with s arbitrary training samples and one output variable x i y i i 1 s x i r n y i r to map the input variables to the output one the mathematical definition of the elm model with activation function f x and nhn hidden neurons is as follows 2 i 1 nhn γ i f inw i x j b h n i j 1 2 s where γi is the matrix of the output weights that links the ith hidden neuron of the hidden layer to the target variable that located in the output layer f x is the activation function inw i inw i1 inwi2 inwin t is the matrix of the input weights that links the input layer to the ith hidden neuron of the hidden layer nhn is the number of hidden neurons s is the number of training samples and bhni is the bias of the ith hidden neuron it should be noted that the inw i x j is the inner product of the inw i and x j and the output node is selected as linear the simple form of the eq 2 is as s equations in the compact form of the following linear system 3 o γ y where y y 1 y 1 y s t is the output variable γ γ 1 γ 1 γ s t is the matrix of the output weights and o is the output of the hidden layer which is defined as follows 4 o i n w 1 i n w s x 1 x s b h n 1 b h n s f inw 1 x 1 b h n 1 f inw nhn x 1 b h n nhn f inw 1 x s b h n 1 f inw nhn x s b h n nhn s n h n the o matrix depends on three variables inw x and bhn two variables inw and bhn are randomly determined and x is the matrix of input variables meaning that the o matrix can be readily computed in addition the variable y in eq 3 is the values of the target parameters and its values are known so the only variable whose value is not known is the output weight γ given that in most cases the nhn and s are not equal the o matrix is non square therefore calculating the output weight γ the only unknown matrix in eq 3 is not easy huang et al 2006 huang et al 2006 tried to solve this problem by minimizing the corresponding loss function to find the optimal least square solution olss of the output weight the mentioned loss function is defined as follows 5 l f elm min y o γ 2 2 the results of the finding olss of the γ through minimizing the l2 norm of the loss function is as follows huang et al 2006 6 γ o y the o denotes the moore penrose generalized inverse of the o rao and mitra 1971 due to the number of training samples s being generally higher than the nhn the simple form of the eq 6 for s nhn is as follow 7 γ o t o 1 o t y 3 1 2 regularized extreme learning machine relm as observed in the discussion of elm above in addition to two randomly calculated matrices the matrix of the output weights is obtained using the minimization of the loss function to find olss the loss function defined in eq 5 considers only the training error in order to obtain the best generalizability in the ffnn not only the training error must be minimized but also the norm of weights must be as low as possible bartlett 1998 by defining the regularization term r the loss function presented in eq 5 is modified and a new scheme of the elm known as regularized elm relm is provided the modified loss function in the relm is defined as follows 8 l f relm min γ r y o γ 2 2 γ 2 2 the defined loss function for the relm can be rewritten as a constrained optimization problem 9 l f relm min r γ e 2 2 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e 10 l γ e α r e 2 2 γ 2 2 α t y o γ e where l γ e α is the corresponding lagrangian of the lfrelm α is a vector related to the lagrangian multiplier and e e 1 e s t includes of s training errors the optimal condition of the above mentioned equation is achieved kuhn and tucker 1951 as follows 11 l e 0 2 r e α 0 l γ 0 2 γ o t α 0 l α 0 y o γ e 0 through solving this equation the γ is calculated as follows 12 γ o t o i r 1 o t y s n h n o t oo t i r 1 y otherwise 3 1 3 weighted regularized extreme learning machine wrelm in order to reduce the negative effects of outliers the weighted relm wrelm method was developed deng et al 2009 the wrelm training process includes three main phases 1 modeling using the provided training process in relm 2 considering the weighting scheme on the defined loss function in the relm 3 implementation of the relm with the gathered information from weighting process in the second phase to update the output weight indeed the main difference of this method is considering the weighting scheme in the modeling process provided by relm so that the samples with the least error are assigned the most weight and vice versa according to the provided explanations the loss function of the wrelm is defined as follows 13 l f wrelm r min γ we 2 2 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e where w d i a g w 1 w s it is clear that the difference between the lfrelm and lfwrelm is substituting of the e 2 2 with we 2 2 the w is calculated as follows suykens et al 2002 deng et al 2009 14 w i 1 1 349 e i i q r 2 5 5 2 1 349 e i i q r 2 5 1 349 e i i q r 3 10 4 otherwise where the iqr is the inter quartile range which is the difference between the third and first quartile the result of eq 13 in the calculation of the output weight is as follows deng et al 2009 15 γ o t w 2 o i r 1 o t w 2 y the wrelm modeling process is presented based on eliminating the effects of outliers to counteract performance reduction of the relm in the presence of outliers although this method seems to have the ability to provide exemplary performance in the presence of outliers there are some limitations in this method that may affect its performance the first drawback is related to the relm performance due to that the wrelm is defined based on the initial results of the relm modeling the successful performance of the wrelm is highly dependent on acceptable initial performance of the relm this is known to be a primary challenge facing the wrelm the second limitation is related to the performance of the wrelm when the impact of outliers is decreased in such a situation some samples which are not outliers may be considered as such with the program assigning small weights to them as a result consequently they harm the training performance to overcome these limitations iteratively reweighted methods can be used however these significantly increase computational time which deviates from the primary purpose of elm based methods in fast learning 3 1 4 outlier robust extreme learning machine orelm given that outliers contain a small percentage of all data their effect can be expressed with sparsity the use of l0 norm has been observed to reflect the sparsity better than l2 norm zhang and luo 2015 therefore the training process attempts to find the output weight which is the only matrix estimated during the training process not only with a small l2 norm but also with sparse training error therefore the loss function in the orelm is defined as follows 16 l f orelm min r γ e 0 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e to solve the above equation in finding the output weight a non convex programming problem must be solved to solve this problem it must be converted to a tractable convex relaxation form while retaining the sparsity the sparse term can be achieved with the l1 norm zhang and luo 2015 substituting the l0 norm with l1 norm in eq 16 results in overall minimization convex and guarantees sparsity thus the convex relaxation of this equation is written as follows 17 l f orelm min γ e 1 1 r γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e the above relation a constrained convex problem can be flawlessly fitted with the appropriate range of the augmented lagrange multiplier alm approach subsequently the alm function is defined as follows zhang and luo 2015 18 l β e γ α e 1 1 r γ 2 2 α t y o γ e β 2 y o γ e 2 2 where β r n and α are the penalty parameter and lagrange multiplier vector respectively by considering the β 2 s y 1 yang and zhang 2011 the e γ and α are estimated using the alm algorithms through an iterative minimization process of the following equation 19 α z 1 α z β y o γ z 1 e z 1 a e z 1 γ z 1 arg min e γ l β e γ α z b 3 1 5 improved orelm iorelm the orelm tried to overcome the limitation of the existing elm based approaches i e elm relm and wrelm in the presence of outliers using the sparsity characteristics although orelm solves this problem there is another critical issue faced by elm based methods failure of which to overcome can negatively impact the performance of models this problem is related to the random definition of the input weights inw and bias of hidden neurons bhn as two main matrices in elm based models indeed all the corrections expressed in the previous sub sections were related to the calculation of the output weight outw and no suggestion has been made to overcome the random determination of the values of these two matrices after the modeling process in elm based methods is completed the target variable could be estimated using the tuned values for three main matrices including inw bhn and outw and an activation function to link these matrices together indeed the modeling target is finding the values of these matrices the bhn and outw are column based matrices with nhn rows while the inw is a matrix with nhn row and inv number of input variables columns the percentage of the randomly tuned parameters i e parameters of the inw and bhn to all tuned parameters through the training phase is calculated as 20 ratio size inw size bhn size inw size bhn size outw i n v n h n 1 n h n i n v n h n 1 n h n 1 n h n nhn i n v 1 nhn i n v 2 i n v 1 i n v 2 due to eq 20 we can see that at least inv 1 66 of all parameters are set randomly while more than 90 of parameters are randomly assigned when the number of input variables reaches 10 consequently a modification of the existing elm approaches is required to overcome this problem and reduce the number of randomly assigned parameters to overcome the weakness of the orelm and other elm based techniques in the random definition of two main matrices a simple iterative based process is defined by taking advantage of the training time of the elm based methods the flowchart of the proposed iorelm model is shown in fig 7 before starting the main loop the user needs to define some initial parameters and functions the parameters include the iteration number for the defined iterative process as the iorelm iteration number iorelmin iteration number for solving augmented lagrange multiplier alm as alm iteration number almin regularization parameter defined in eq 16 r number of hidden neurons nhn and number of training samples s in addition to these parameters the activation function also needs to be defined different types of this function were described in the elm section after the definition of these parameters the main loop is started at the first step of this loop the input weight matrix inwi i 1 s and bias of hidden neurons bhni i 1 s matrices are randomly initiated using these two matrices the hidden layer output o i n w 1 i n w s x 1 x s b h n 1 b h n s is calculated after this the penalty parameter β r n is defined based on the yang and zhang 2011 recommendation as β 2 s y 1 where s is the number of samples and y is the target variable the output weight matrix γ is calculated using the defined penalty parameter through the iterative process of solving the alm algorithm the input weight the bias of hidden neurons and output weights i e inw bhn outw are stored at each iteration after comparing the objective function of all iterations at both training and testing stages the model with the optimum objective function is selected as the best one and the corresponding inw bhn outw matrices are reported as the final model 3 2 discrete wavelet transform dwt the wavelet transform wt is applied as a preprocessing technique in different fields of science especially water sciences campozano et al 2020 it analyzes the input signals and decomposes them into different frequency domains indeed it is applied for compression de nosing and decomposition of the time series based input variables rajaee et al 2019 wt is a time dependent spectral analysis applied to decompose each input time series into time frequency space to offer a time scale depiction of procedures daubechies 1990 the mean of the wavelet function is zero and it decays suddenly in an oscillatory manner a superposition of translated and expanded versions of the pre assign wavelet is used to represent the data daubechies 1990 the wt is capable of extracting information from a function in the time domain the best combination of the details a certain aim could be found by wt daubechies 1990 it has appealing properties that make it a helpful approach for time series with characteristics that change in frequency or scale and time two main groups of the wt are continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt which are defined based on the basic definitions of the wavelet with unique mathematical characteristics that are described as integrable squares in functional space the cwt not only requires significant time but also produces a large amount of data while the dwt utilizes only a subset of positions and scales for its computations in this case different families of the functions ψ σ ϒ t σ and ϒ denote the scale and translation factor respectively are defined based on the translation and dilations of the mother function ψ t in the current study to decompose the time series in two different scales the dwt which is applied for data compression santoso et al 1997 is adopted a multi resolution analysis mallat 1999 includes a series of approximation spaces w i i z of v 2 r that satisfies the following constraints 1 there is a χ w 0 such that χ x i i z is an orthonormal basis of w 0 2 f x w i f x 2 i k w i k z 3 f x w i f 2 x w i 1 4 i z w i 0 5 lim i w i i z w i is dense in v 2 r 6 w i w i 1 the χ denotes the scaling function that produces a multi resolution analysis with the defined six specifications for the sub space w i v 2 r the riesz basis χ i k x k z is achieved through dilation and translation of χ and using the specifications 2 and 3 21 χ i k x 2 i 2 χ 2 i x k j i z this equation could be rewritten in the following form 22 χ m n x a m 2 χ x n b a m due to specification 6 i e w i w i 1 there is a set of coefficients as a k k z so that χ met the two scale or refinement equation 23 χ x k a k χ 2 x k identify li as an orthonormal complement of w i in wi 1 24 w i 1 w i l i 25 l i l i i f i i therefore for i i 26 w i 1 w i k 0 i i 1 l i k by considering specifications 4 and 5 the decomposition of the v 2 r into mutually orthogonal subspaces is defined as follows 27 v 2 r j z w i the basis for v0 is known as the mother wavelet ψ where 28 ψ x k b k χ 2 x k where 29 b k 1 k a k 1 finally the dwt is defined as follows 30 d ω ψ x n a b n z x n g j k n k z j n b k 2 i a 2 i using discrete convolution of the x the coefficients of the dwt i e gi k are approximated and the mother wavelet ψ produces the suitable scaling filters 3 3 integration of the iorelm with dwt dwtorelm in the previous sub section the iorelm as a novel scheme of the elm based models was introduced not only can it perform well in modeling a real world problem in the presence of the outliers but also it can easily overcome the random definition of a large number of parameters in the classical schemes in this section an integrated version of the iorelm with the discrete wavelet transform dwt as a well known decomposition technique is introduced ebtehaj et al 2016 the dwt is applied to decompose the original time series into two main signals approximation a and details d through low and high pass filters respectively indeed the summation of the approximation and details are equal to the main signal fig 8 if the decomposition level is more than one the generated approximate signal in the first level of decomposition a1 is decomposed to the two new signals including d2 and a2 indeed after the two decomposition levels the main signal is converted to the summation of the d1 d2 a3 therefore for the q level of decomposition the main signal is equal to the summation of the d1 d2 dq aq indeed for q level of decompositions there are q low frequency signals d1 d2 dq as the details and one high scale signal as the approximation generated in the qth level of the decomposition consequently one input signal is converted to the q 1 signals after that qth level of the decomposition the maximum number of decomposition levels is a function of the number of training samples nourani et al 2014 31 dl int log s where dl s and int x are the maximum number of decomposition levels samples and integer part of x 4 performance evaluation criteria to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the different models a set of quantitative indices are applied the statistical indices applied in the current study are categorized into three main groups 1 correlation based indices including correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 2 absolute indices including root mean square error rmse and normalized rmse nrmse and 3 relative indices including mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre the mathematical definition of these indices are as follows 32 r t 1 s q a t q a q p t q p i 1 n q a t q a 2 i 1 n q p t q p 2 33 nse 1 t 1 s q a t q p t 2 t 1 s q a t q a 2 34

are the actual and predicted respectively flow discharge at tth time q a is the average of the actual flow discharge the range of r and nse is 1 1 and the range of the other indices is 0 the best value of the r and nse is obtained at r nse 1 while the best value of the other indices is zero the mentioned indices through eq 32 37 only consider the model s accuracy to compare the accuracy of two models without the same structure it is highly recommended to compare them based on the accuracy and simplicity simultaneously to do that the corrected akaike information criteria aicc should be considered zeynoddin et al 2020 and is defined below 38 aicc s l n σ ε 2 2 k s s k 1 where the σε 2 is the standard deviation of the residuals k is the number of tuned parameters through the training phase and s is the number of samples the first term of this equation is the error term while the second one is related to the complexity of the developed model to provide a more favorable and detailed comparison of the existing and developed models in the current study the f test which is assessed the statistical reliability of these models is applied the f test is applied to check the hypothesis claiming that the value of variation derived from using averages is lower than the one estimated using the recommended model to do that the f test is calculated as follows 39 f 0 msr mse 40 msr ssr inv 41 mse sse s p 42 ssr t 1 s q p t q a 2 43 sse t 1 s q p t q a t 2 where s is the number of samples inv is the number of input variables and p inv 1 the null hypothesis of the f test is accepted in the case of f0 fα inv s p the fα inv s p for the significant level of 5 α 0 05 is 2 6049 a reliability analysis is employed to measure the total coherence of different introduced models in the current study it assesses the acceptability of a model at different performance levels the reliability of a model is calculated as follows 44 reliability 100 s t 1 s g t to calculate the gt the relative error of each sample should be calculated as follows 45 ra e t q a t q p t q a t where q a t and q p t are actual and predicted respectively flow discharge of the tth sample using this equation the gt is calculated as follows 46 ra e t δ g t 1 o t h e r w i s e g t 0 the δ in eq 46 is different based on the desired target parameter for example it is considered 20 by chinese standards saberi movahed et al 2020 in the current study the δ is considered as 2 5 10 15 and 20 to compare the performance of all models across different ranges of reliability uncertainty analysis is used to examine the expected range of a model or experiment this estimation range the uncertainty interval ui approximates the difference between estimated and actual values one of the well known techniques to calculate the ui is u95 the value of u95 obtained using the error of a model can be interpreted as by repeatedly experimenting the true value of the test result is within the ui presented for approximately 95 times per 100 experiments the u95 is defined as follows 47 u 95 1 96 s t 1 s q a t q a 2 t 1 s q a t q p t 2 5 results and discussions in this section the performance of the developed hybrid model is compared with the classical and improved elm models in terms of global accuracy simplicity and accuracy in peak flow forecasting this section includes four main sub sections fig 9 which focus on 1 comparing the developed iorelm with the classical elm based models in terms of global accuracy and peak flow performance 2 comparing the individual and hybrid models iorelm vs dwtiorelm for one to three steps ahead 3 optimizing the best model to find the optimum value of the iteration number decomposition level number of hidden neurons and optimum mother wavelet and activation function 4 checking the performance of the optimum model for multi step ahead forecasting 5 1 comparison of different individual models in this subsection the performance of the improved versions of the different elm based techniques i e ielm irelm iwrelm iorelm are compared for a fair comparison of different models the value of all parameters in the desired models and input variables should be the same therefore the iteration number and number of hidden neurons were considered as 200 and 50 respectively besides the activation function is considered as sigmoid these parameters are employed in all methods another parameter is applied only in the irelm iwrelm and iorelm known as the regularization parameter the value of this parameter was considered as 0 0001 the number of all samples in the current study is 137 063 categorized into training and testing samples with the ratio of 70 and 30 respectively the considered input combinations for all models are as q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 fig 10 shows the scatter plots of the developed iorelm as well as for the improved versions of the other elm based models from this figure the ielm method can be seen to perform poorly at small discharges as well as at peak flow so that for flow discharges higher than 80 m3s 1 it underestimates discharge this pattern is also observed during the testing phase indeed although the model has acceptable generalizability its performance during the testing phase for which it predicts discharge samples not previously seen is nearly identical to the training phase it can be concluded that its performance is unreliable especially in peak flows which is important in flood forecasting like ielm irelm has good generalizability so that the results of the training and testing stages are close although it can be clearly seen that the use of irelm has not been able to solve the problem of inaccuracy in flow discharge forecasting it has a better performance at peak flows so that the peak flow estimation error in irelm compared to ielm is significantly reduced indeed it can be said that the use of the norm of weights in the defined loss function for the relm along with training error eq 8 has led to an increase in model performance in peak flow forecasting similar to the previous two methods the performance of iwrelm and iorelm models is not acceptable in small flow discharge however the critical point is the high performance of these methods in peak flow forecasting these models especially iorelm performed well in this range of flow discharge that has vital importance in flood forecasting comparison of ielm and irelm methods showed that the use of norm of weights significantly affects the model s accuracy in peak flow forecasting in the iwrelm method using the weighting process and the loss function presented in irelm eq 8 the model s performance is significantly increased in peak flows in addition the results presented by iorelm also showed that the use of small l2 norm along with sparse training errors in finding output weights leads to the best performance of elm based models in peak flow forecasting fig 11 demonstrates the statistical indices and training time of the developed iorelm and improved versions of the other elm based models the training time of the ielm and irelm with 200 iterations is about 130 s while it is higher for iwrelm and especially iorelm with 179 and 313 s respectively the reason for an increased training time in iwrelm compared to the irelm is due to the use of an additional step when applying the weights obtained during the weighting process the high training times of the iorelm which is more than 2 5 times greater than the ielm and irelm is also due to an iterative process to find output weights using eq 19 code 1 the r and nse indicators show an outstanding value for all of the studied models are more than 0 99 however the scatter plots presented in fig 10 showed that the performance of the models is significantly different from each other therefore it should be noted that using only correlation based indices especially for problems where the number of samples is high is not an excellent way to compare different models the results of mare and rmsre as two relative indices and rmse and nrmse as two absolute indices show that the best performance among these models is related to the iorelm r 0 999 nse 0 998 rmse 0 614 nrmse 0 056 mare 0 027 rmsre 0 063 while the weakest one is related to ielm indeed the success of the proposed modifications to the elm algorithm to achieve better peak flow predictions can be seen for the irelm iwrelm and iorelm it should be noted that irelm has the highest value of rmsre which demonstrates the importance of the modifying concepts presented to calculate output weights by the iwrelm and iorelm table 2 indicates the results of the reliability analysis uncertainty analysis and f test for iorelm and other elm based models for the f test the null hypothesis is accepted in the case of f0 fα inv s p the fα inv s p for the significant level of 5 α 0 05 is 2 6049 the status of the hypothesis for all models is accept besides the uncertainty analysis results calculated using u95 are almost equal for all models u95 0 133 from the reliability results in different values of δ it can be seen that the iwrelm outperformed the iorelm for δ 2 and 5 while for δ 10 15 and 20 the opposite is true it should be noted that the difference between the value of the reliability for the iwrelm and the iorelm at δ 2 and δ 5 is less than 8 and 2 respectively these models have relatively good global accuracy but their performance at peak flows needs further investigation 5 1 1 peak flow comparison of different elm based models table 3 indicates the mape of different models in peak flow forecasting using q 1 max 0 99 qmax q 1 max qmax q 5 max 0 95 qmax q 5 max qmax q 10 max 0 9 qmax q 5 max qmax the q 1 max q 5 max q 10 max are defined as for q 1 max the mape s of the iwrelm irelm ielm are 2 37 4 03 5 31 times the mape of the iorelm this ratio is significantly increased for q 5 max and q 10 max so that the mape of the iwrelm which has the lowest difference with iorelm is 2 37 times higher than the mape of the iorelm as a result it can be said that the use of the norm of weights in irelm and its combination with a weighting process in iwrelm has a better performance in predicting peak flow than ielm which achieves output weights only by minimizing the training error 5 2 comparison of the individual and hybrid models global accuracy fig 12 indicates the statistical indices of the individual iorelm model and improved version of the other elm based models in this figure there are nine models based on the one to three lags to forecast one to three time s ahead these models are defined as m1 to m9 the target variable in all these models is qt which indicates the flow discharge at time t in m1 to m3 qt 1 is considered as one of the input variables for one time ahead forecasting similar to these models the qt 2 for m4 to m6 and qt 3 for m7 to m9 are for two and three times ahead forecasting respectively one time ahead 1ta m 1 q t q t 1 m 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 m 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 two times ahead 2ta m 4 q t q t 2 m 5 q t q t 2 q t 3 m 6 q t q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 three times ahead 3ta m 7 q t q t 3 m 8 q t q t 3 q t 4 m 9 q t q t 3 q t 4 q t 5 as shown in fig 12 increasing the number of input variables for both individual and hybrid models results in a more precise model than a model with fewer inputs this is true for all employed indices in fig 12 except the rmse nrmse and mare of m3 compared to m2 for the hybrid model indeed it can be said that increasing the number of lags from two to three has not been effective and this model has experienced its maximum ability with two lags comparison of the individual and hybrid models for all nine defined models indicates that the integration of the dwt with the iorelm results in a more accurate model compared to the individual model i e iorelm the difference between the correlation based indices in individual and hybrid models is minimal in nature the maximum relative difference is related to the nse of m2 with a relative error of 0 16 for the absolute based indices i e rmse and nrmse application of the hybrid methods instead of individual one s results in a decrease in modeling errors in the range of 2 5 93 with the lowest and highest reductions related to the m2 and m7 respectively for the relative based indices i e mare and rmsre application of the hybrid methods instead of individual one s results in a reduction in modeling errors in the range of 4 26 where the lowest and highest decreases are seen in m1 and m6 respectively it was noted that the changes in performance of the hybrid model compared to the individual models were not proportional for all indices so that the largest changes in r nse rmse nrmse mare and rmsre were seen in m5 m5 m2 m2 m7 m9 respectively as can be seen in this figure the difference between the correlative based indices is shallow so that the r and nse of m1 to m9 for both individual and hybrid models are more than 0 99 which is a good value for these indices indeed due to a large number of samples the difference in the performance of these models using these indices is not visible the applied hybrid model is an integration of the dwt and iorelm the decomposition level of the developed models for flood forecasting is equal to one indeed using the developed hybrid model one input variable is decomposed into two new variables including the approximated and detailed terms fig 8 therefore the number of input variables and consequently the number of tuned parameters in dwtiorelm and iorelm are not the same eq 20 the provided statistical indices in fig 12 a b c d are error based indices therefore for a fair comparison the performance of these two methods needs to be compared in terms of accuracy and simplicity simultaneously to do that the aicc is applied as presented in fig 12 e the lowest value of this model indicates the most optimum model in flood forecasting according to fig 12 e it could be seen that the aicc of all models i e m1 to m9 for dwtiorelm is lower than the iorelm the greatest difference between the aicc values of the iorelm and the dwtiorelm can be seen for the case where forecasting is performed for one time ahead while the smallest difference is seen when forecasting is performed for three periods ahead consequently integration of the dwt with iorelm has well increased flood forecasting accuracy now these two models must be evaluated in peak flow forecasting using different input combinations 5 2 1 comparison of the individual and hybrid modes peak flow forecasting fig 13 compares the performance of both individual and hybrid models for peak flow forecasting for this the performance of both individual and hybrid models is evaluated for three different ranges the defined ranges are q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max as indicated in fig 13 a as seen in this figure q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max are flow discharges higher than 96 82 92 91 and 88 02 m3 s respectively from figs 123 b 13 c and 13 d it can be seen that the maximum mape for one two and three steps ahead forecasting for all individual and hybrid models is less than 2 3 and 4 respectively the dwtiorelm model outperformed iorelm in all models with one to three times ahead forecasting except in m3 of two times ahead forecasting for this model the difference between the mape of the individual and hybrid models was less than 0 3 which is considered to be insignificant due to provided explanations for comparing the developed hybrid model i e dwtiorelm with individual iorelm it could be concluded that this model outperformed iorelm now that the performance of this model is compared with the individual one it is necessary to apply a comprehensive review to the parameters of this model to provide the most optimal model possible for flood forecasting 5 3 optimization of the best model the developed dwtiorelm model applied in flow discharge forecasting requires some parameters i e iteration number decomposition level number of hidden neurons mother wavelet and activation function and the failure to select them correctly can affect the results of the model hence in this section we aim to obtain their optimal values indeed by constantly considering the value of all parameters except one parameter for example iteration number different values are checked for this parameter to find the optimum one it should be noted that the considered values are selected so that if the value of this parameter is considered outside this range it will not increase the performance of the model fig 14 presents the statistical indices of the dwtiorelm model during the optimization process of its user defined input parameters the inputs of all models provided in this figure are similar to m 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 it should be noted that since the values of correlation based indices i e r and nse do not show significant changes they have been omitted the first parameter to be considered is the iteration number in the in parameter was first introduced during the modification process of the initial version of elm based methods to overcome the random tuning of input weights and bias of hidden neurons given that the implementation time of elm based methods is considerably rapid selecting large values for this parameter is not problematic since the initial modeling was performed using in 200 two larger iteration number values of in 500 1000 are also evaluated increasing the number of iterations from 200 to 500 improves rmse performance by about 10 so that rmse decreases from 0 34 to 0 307 and nrmse from 0 028 to 0 021 when in 500 is selected the mare and the rmsre were seen to be reduced by about 4 and less than 1 respectively increasing the in beyond 500 iterations not only increases the modeling time but was also seen to slightly reduce the modeling accuracy therefore in 500 is selected as the optimal iteration number fixing in 500 the performance of the dwtiorelm is evaluated for different mother wavelets mws including discrete meyer dm daubechies d coiflets c fejer korovkin fk symlets s biorthogonal b and reverse biorthogonal rb the results of the dwtiorelm with different mws can be seen in fig 14 b from the figure the change of mw from dm to other mws significantly increases the error values calculated by different indices the smallest values of the rmse nrmse mare and rmsre corresponding to the d c fk s b and rb mw s have a relative error of about 256 256 149 and 110 respectively compared to the index values obtained when mw dm consequently the dm is selected as the best mother wavelet for the current study using in 500 and mw dm the effect of the decomposition level dl on the performance of the dwtiorelm in flood forecasting is evaluated the dl is considered in the range of 1 5 it is observed that increasing the dl not only worsens the performance of the model but also leads to the generation of a more complex model for example for a model with dl 5 and three initial inputs the number of final inputs is equal to 18 while for a model with dl 1 and three initial inputs the number of final inputs is equal to 9 excessive increase in the number of inputs not only hindered model performance but also reduced its accuracy as seen in fig 13 a 13 b 13 c 13 e using in 500 mw dm and dl 1 the effect of different activation functions af on flood forecasting using dwtiorelm was assessed numerous commonly employed af types were assessed including the hyperbolic tangent bt triangular basis tb radial basis rb hard limit hl sigmoid and sine for all statistical indices evaluated in this study the sigmoid af rmse 0 34 nrmse 0 031 mare 0 023 rmsre 0 054 outperformed all other functions following the sigmoid af the sin af ranked second for the absolute based indices i e rmse nrmse while the ht af ranked second for the relative based indices i e mare rmsre the rb tb and hl afs performed poorly and are ranked fourth to sixth respectively therefore the sigmoid function is selected as the optimum activation function in flood forecasting using in 500 mw dm dl 1 and af sig the effect of the number of hidden neurons nhn on flood forecasting using dwtiorelm is evaluated increasing nhn from 50 to 250 enhanced the accuracy of the dwtiorelm in flood forecasting while decreasing the nhn from 50 to 25 led to an increase in modeling error varying the nhn was seen to cause the formation of different model structures which had differing levels of complexity thus the accuracy and simplicity of the model must be considered simultaneously to obtain the optimal value for nhn for this reason the aicc index is used to evaluate the combined effect of variation in the nhn in fig 14 f it can be seen that the value of this index from nhn 25 to nhn 100 declines sharply while this decreasing trend continues for nhn 100 to nhn 200 but at a greatly reduced rate increasing the nhn from 200 to 250 leads to the beginning of the upward trend so that the value of aicc in nhn 200 is equal to 116 101 5 while the value of this index for nhn 150 and 250 is equal to 115 119 85 and 115 331 85 respectively consequently the nhn 200 was selected as the optimum value of the nhn fig 15 shows the scatter plot and error distribution of the optimum dwtiorelm according to the provided scatter plot all flow discharges greater than 20 m3s 1 were estimated with a relative error of less than 20 therefore it overcomes the existing weakness of the iorelm provided in fig 9 where a significant number of erroneous predictions were observed at flows greater than 20 m3s 1 the cumulative frequency of the threshold of the relative absolute error indicates that more than 55 of all samples are forecasted with a relative error of less than 1 this percentage is 91 for forecasted samples with a relative error of less than 5 besides only around 1 of all samples were forecasted with a relative error exceeding 20 this is to be expected as about 7 5 of all samples have a discharge less than 1 m3s 1 and calculating the relative error for significant low discharge samples provides high values to verify the performance of the optimum model the mape of the three different categories i e q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max are calculated these calculations indicated that the mape of all categories and is less than 1 proving the high capability of the introduced model in the current study for flood forecasting the statistical indices of the iorelm in fig 9 were acceptable however there were a small number of samples that presented high relative errors the incorrect prediction of these samples potentially may have resulted in significant damage to infrastructure as well as humans as a result of the excellent performance of the optimized dwtiorelm model in flood forecasting it is employed for multi step ahead flood forecasting 5 4 multi step ahead flood forecasting in this section to verify the performance of the developed model for multi step ahead forecasting cheng et al 2006 the optimum dwtiorelm is evaluated for up to nine hours ahead in peak flow forecasting the mape of the dwtiorelm for one to nine steps ahead through two main categories is provided in fig 16 it provides the mape of the dwtiorelm model for samples with discharges higher than 96 82 92 91 and 88 02 m3 s as q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max respectively the q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max defined in this figure are entirely expressed in fig 13 a in this figure m1 to m9 are used to represent one to nine times ahead forecasting for all models q 1 max outperformed the others with q 5 max and q 10 max ranked second and third respectively for all categories i e q 1 max q 5 max q 10 max and forecast steps greater than two i e m2 the mape is more than 2 5 times the value of this index for m1 as the forecast time increased the value of this ratio also increased so that for nine times ahead forecasting the mape value for m9 was more than ten times this value for m1 of course this ratio is lower in q 5 max and q 10 max which can be due to the ability of the developed model in the presence of outlier data indeed the use of sparsity characteristics in this model has led to the fact that even for nine steps ahead forecasting and q 10 max the model can forecast the peak flow values with an average relative error of less than 5 considering the level of acceptable error in forecasting the defined hybrid model in the current study can be applied in multi step ahead flood forecasting 6 advantages limitations and future improvements in the current study the newly developed hybrid dwtiorelm was successfully applied in flood forecasting to a station located upstream of the saint charles river quebec canada the proposed hybrid model was developed using three main concepts 1 generalizable development of the elm based model in the presence of outliers by considering the sparsity characteristics of outliers in the defined loss function 2 improvement of the elm based methods through an iterative process to overcome their limitations associated with the random definition of the two main matrices i e input weights and bias of hidden neurons and 3 integration of the discrete wavelet transforms with the improved outlier robust extreme learning machine dwtiorelm for multi steps ahead flood forecasting the peak flows are not only remarkably higher than other samples but also the number of them compared to the total samples is not significant considering that the sparsity characteristics overcome the limitation of the classical elm based methods i e elm relm wrelm in the presence of outliers i e peak flows which is the main objective of the current study the main advantages of the developed hybrid models are threefold firstly the model has been shown to have a high performance in the presence of the outliers a requirement of the current study for flood forecasting as the number of peak flows in comparison to all samples is very low and is considered as outliers by the classical elm based models second the developed model considers an iterative process to overcome the random definition of more than 66 of parameters in classical elm based models the iterative process implemented not only improved the modeling performance but also preserved the rapid training time of modeling for 200 iterations the modeling time is about 313 s which is low compared to well known ml based models such as ann and anfis especially considering that the current study uses more than 95 000 training samples the reason for the high modeling speed in this method is that the nonlinear problem is first converted to a linear system and then the optimal output weights are obtained through solving a linear problem in contrast for ann and anfis the biases weights and membership functions are quantified and optimized through the training phase leading to a lengthy modeling process third the dwtiorelm model for flood forecasting is introduced by integrating the dwt and iorelm the application of this hybrid model overcomes the limitation of the individual models in peak flows forecasting in the current study an iterative process was recommended to improve the limitation of the random initialization of the bias of hidden neurons and input weights the robustness of the developed model could be tested under different climatic conditions however a follow up study should be conducted to introduce an optimization scheme of the iorem using well known evolutionary optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 particle swarm optimization pso ebtehaj et al 2019 or a combination of them such as psoga gharabaghi et al 2018 gholami et al 2018 additionally newly introduced optimization algorithms such as grey wolf optimizer mirjalili et al 2014 and grasshopper optimization algorithm saremi et al 2020 could also be studied and compared moreover to decompose the input signals an alternative approach is the application of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and comparing the performance of dwt and eemd besides the developed hybrid model applied the historical values of the current station to forecast the flow discharge an alternative approach could be the application of the adjacent stations upstream of this station for flood forecasting without the historical values of saint charles station it is essential that future work continues to study the challenges that prevent machine learning from being applied and developed in flood forecasting the current issues facing ml for flood forecasting applications can be summarized into two main points first data challenges the number of all samples applied in the current study was large at more than 137 000 to handle such a large number of data efficiently the elm based approaches were applied to benefit from their rapid training process if more advanced ml modeling techniques are to be implemented for flood forecasting the modeling time may be significantly increased a way to overcome this challenge is converting hourly data to composite daily values second the developed models for flood forecasting in the current study considered only three lags according to that there is no particular method for finding the input combinations in hourly flood forecasting the development of a ml based method integrated with evolutionary algorithms can be helpful to find optimum input combinations in flood forecasting 7 conclusions floods which are common events globally are one of the most catastrophic natural hazards flood forecasting in the province of quebec using powerful ml techniques is inevitable due to its susceptibility to flood events most recently in 2019 thousands of people were displaced with significant damage to private and public infrastructure in the current study a new hybrid machine learning model is introduced for multi steps ahead hourly flood forecasting the developed model known as dwtiorelm is an integration of the improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm and discrete wavelet transform dwt using the hourly data collected from saint charles station located upstream of quebec and considering only three lags the flow discharge of multi steps ahead was forecasted before integrating the iorelm with the dwt the performance of this model was compared with the improved version of the existing techniques such as improved extreme learning machine ielm improved regularized extreme learning machine irelm improved weighted regularized extreme learning machine iwrelm the results indicated that iorelm outperformed other approaches r 0 999 nse 0 998 rmse 0 614 nrmse 0 056 mare 0 027 rmsre 0 063 although the correlation coefficient of individual models showed good values the performance of these models in peak flow discharge was not acceptable iorelm as the best individual model was integrated with dwt and the dwtiorelm model was developed to overcome this limitation a comprehensive study was performed to find the optimum input parameters of the introduced hybrid model rmse 0 234 nrmse 0 021 mare 0 02 finally the optimum values of the iteration number decomposition level and the number of hidden neurons were found to be 500 1 and 200 respectively moreover the mother wavelet and activation function of the optimum model was discrete meyer dm and sigmoid function respectively the performance of the hybrid model with optimum values of different parameters was evaluated for multi steps ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead the results demonstrated that the developed model could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 the modeling results demonstrated that the developed model has global accuracy and performed well in estimating the peak flows that are of considerable importance in

2771,reliable and accurate flood forecasting is a complex and challenging problem that is essential for the creation of disaster preparedness plans to protect life and reduce economic losses this study suggests a novel hybrid model for real time multi steps ahead flood forecasting within the saint lawrence river in quebec by integrating the discrete wavelet transform dwt and improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm models the dwtiorelm model was constructed with three main novelties i consider the sparsity characteristics of the outliers to enhance the performance of the elm based model in the presence of outliers ii introduce an iterative process to overcome the random definition of the two main matrices in the elm based approaches iii integrate iorelm with dwt as a preprocessing technique to decompose the main input signals to high scale and low frequency signals the performance of the individual iorelm is compared with the original version of elm regularized elm relm and weighted relm wrelm in terms of global accuracy and accuracy in peak flow forecasting the results indicated that the iorelm outperformed other models however there was a need for a model that could perform better for peak flow detection iorelm as the best individual model was integrated with dwt and the dwtiorelm model was developed to overcome this limitation in addition the comparison results of the hybrid dwtiorelm and individual iorelm models in terms of accuracy and simplicity as well as peak flow forecasting indicate that the introduced hybrid model r 0 99 nse 0 99 rmse 0 234 nrmse 0 021 mare 0 02 in the current study not only overcomes all limitations of the existing elm based methods but also could be applied in multi steps ahead flood forecasting the optimum values of the number of hidden neurons decomposition level and iteration number were found to be 200 1 and 500 respectively furthermore the sigmoid function and discrete meyer dm were selected as the best activation function and mother wavelet respectively the developed hybrid model was applied to check its performance in multi steps ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead the results showed that it could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 keywords discrete wavelet transform flood severity detection multi steps ahead forecasting outlier robust extreme learning machine real time flood forecasting water resource management 1 introduction natural catastrophes such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods can result in massive losses on a national and regional level and have the potential to influence financial markets because of the societal economic and financial ramifications among natural catastrophes from 1994 to 2013 2937 flood events were recorded with more than 2 4 billion affected people unisdr cred 2015 indeed the greatest substantial impact globally in terms of people affected about 55 of people and the number of events 43 of all events has been caused by floods with lost assets totaling over 636 billion usd serinaldi et al 2018 indeed flooding has been ranked by some researchers as the third most deadly disaster following earthquakes and tsunamis zaji et al 2018 according to the department of public safety of canada 1 1 https www canada ca en services policing emergencies hazards html floods are the most common natural disaster in canada in terms of frequency and property damages as a result of the increasing anthropogenic activity that emits greenhouse gases gges the fact that the earth is warming is universally

anticipated to rise by 2 0 6 0 c over the next 80 years as the temperature rises the capacity of the atmosphere to store water vapor rises changing the precipitation regime rouhani and leconte 2018 ostad ali askar et al 2018 and as a result the hydrologic cycle of watersheds rain on snow snowmelts ice jam heavy rainfall thunderstorms riverine flooding and coastal flooding are the most common sources of flooding in canada zahmatkesh et al 2019 according to environmental and natural resources canada 2 2 https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity causes of flooding html the most prevalent type of flooding in canada is snowmelt runoff floods for snowmelt dominated areas variations in precipitation will alter snow accumulation and thus streamflow while temperature variations will almost certainly alter the timing of snowmelt more frequent intense precipitation and rapid snowmelt conditions are becoming more common as a result of urbanization and global warming s effect on rainfall patterns increasing the risk of floods in canada awareness and reaction of different disaster management entities are extremely dependent on the accessibility of precise and timely hydrological and meteorological predictions effective practical flood forecasting is favorable in helping the public and authorities create short and long term precautionary measures plan evacuation and rescue missions and provide relief to flood victims consequently the use of modern methods that can precisely predict this complex phenomenon is of considerable importance flood forecasting is more successful and beneficial when done hourly and with enough lead time since it may be used to devise and conduct emergency evacuation plans alexander et al 2018 according to the dynamic nature of the climatic circumstance predicting flood lead time and occurrence is challenging flood forecasting approaches are categorized into two main groups physically based hydrological pbh and machine learning ml methods today s leading flood forecasting models are primarily data driven and based on several simplified suppositions lohani e al 2014 therefore particular methodologies including continuous deterministic stochastic empirical black box and event driven are developed to imitate the problematic mathematical representations of basin behavior and physical processes moosavi et al 2018 pbh models on the other hand have been demonstrated to be quite good at forecasting a wide range of flooding events however they also have some drawbacks which make them difficult to use the main limitations of these types of models are 1 to apply them a substantial quantity of professional knowledge and expertise concerning hydrological parameters is necessary kim et al 2015 2 they frequently demand a variety of geomorphological and hydrological datasets which necessitate expensive calculation yu et al 2006 and prevent short term forecasting nayak et al 2005 van den honert and mcaneney 2011 3 data collection is primarily manual and storage is unorganized resulting in a shortage of hydrological data and making data even more challenging to access in some remote regions zhang et al 2021 4 over parameterization beven 2006 might result in a high level of prediction uncertainty uhlenbrook et al 1999 5 these models are inapplicable for real time flood forecasting flood forecasting is based on complicated and frequently unobtainable information including hydrologic and physical site specific elements such as storm severity precipitation runoff coefficient and catchment physical properties such as land use and soil type etc resulting in looking towards simpler techniques in addition to pbh models data driven techniques have a long history in flood forecasting and have recently increased in popularity to give improved insight these techniques of prediction use historical recorded values of the hydro meteorological variables the classical stochastic models including the autoregressive moving average and its extensions moeeni et al 2017a bonakdari et al 2020a lotfi et al 2021 are the first statistical tools for flood frequency forecasting the main limitation of these models is their linear based structure to overcome this limitation recently various studies have been performed in hydrology based on different preprocessing techniques moeeni et al 2017b eslamian et al 2018 lotfi et al 2019 the proposing methodology based on the preprocessing techniques is very complicated and requires in depth knowledge in hydrology time series and different statistical tests to overcome the linear structure of the classical statistical based models the nonlinear based ml algorithms have been implemented by scholars in the hydrology field these models only require historical values of the hydrological parameter from the basin noymanee et al 2017 le et al 2019 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 and use a self learning function to complete flood forecasting hou and tang 2013 preventing the time consuming process of parameter selection a complex modeling process and long prediction times associated with pbh methods as a result it is becoming increasingly popular among scholars table 1 briefly reviews individual and hybrid ml based approaches in short term flood forecasting that have been employed over the last ten years it can be seen that more than forty different ml based techniques including adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis artificial neural network ann nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx reduced error pruning trees rept random forest rf etc have been applied in the thirty eight different published papers demonstrating the extent of ml techniques in flood forecasting the methods presented in this table are divided into two general categories individual and hybrid the flood resource variables considered by the scholars have been categorized into different groups such as rainfall runoff rainfall runoff water level river flow flood extreme flood extreme rainfall events river flow etc additionally the forecasting types of floods are categorized into four different groups including daily hourly rainfall runoff and real time the feedforward neural network ffnn is one of the most well known ml based techniques in flood forecasting ebtehaj et al 2020 with over 60 of the studies in table 1 considering it as the modeling technique although this model has been widely implemented in flood forecasting several important limitations have made its use a challenge the time consuming iterative process of tuning ffnn parameters through the training phase results in slow convergence bonakdari and ebtehaj 2016 bonakdari et al 2019 2020b furthermore the learning rate overfitting and low generalization ability are other significant drawbacks of the classical ffnn ebtehaj et al 2018 bonakdari et al 2019 to overcome these limitations huang et al 2006 introduced extreme learning machine elm as a non tuned rapid machine learning model based on the ffnn elm is a developed version of the ffnn that has only one hidden layer the modeling phase in elm consists of adjusting the parameters of three matrices input weights the bias of hidden neurons and output weights the first two matrices are randomly initiated while the third one is determined analytically by solving a linear system the most significant advantage of the elm is its high generalizability obtained by avoiding becoming trapped in local minima besides the limited number of user interventions high accuracy fast learning rates and robustness are other advantages of the elm huang et al 2015 despite all these advantages this method also has limitations that lead to significant challenges related to flood prediction the biggest problem associated with this method is the random determination of two main matrices i e initial weights and bias of hidden neurons their lack of precise determination can affect the generalizability of the elm while global accuracy of this method has been confirmed in a number of studies the peak forecasting accuracy which is critical for flood forecasting has been observed to be unacceptable in some cases fig 1 indicates the observed and predicted discharge of the white river where it can be seen that the global accuracy only reached a correlation coefficient of 0 89 such predictive performance does not provide acceptable results in estimating the large discharges associated with flood events the percentage of peak flows is generally very small compared to all flows and are therefore considered as outliers compared to flows observed under normal conditions the existence of outliers may result in an untrustworthy elm model zhang and luo 2015 and it is therefore crucial to develop a model capable of overcoming this drawback the main objective of the current study is to develop a hybrid model for the flood warning system within the saint lawrence river in quebec canada the novelty of the present study is threefold first the definition of a new loss function for an elm based model based on the sparsity feature of outliers to increase the robustness of the model in terms of peak flow forecasting that results in the outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm second improving the first scheme of orelm by combining this model with an intelligence iterative based process to overcome random adjusting of the two main matrices in the first generation of elm i e the bias of hidden neurons and input weights third integration of iorelm with the discrete wavelet transform dwt to introduce the hybrid dwtiorelm model the developed dwtiorelm will be evaluated based on its capability to forecast various timesteps in advance as well as its proficiency to forecast flows related to different levels of projected riverine flooding intensity multi timesteps in advance 2 study area the data set considered for the current study was gathered from the ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 3 3 ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change this dataset includes the historical flow discharge values of the saint charles station coordinates 46 48 58 71 19 11 situated 0 8 km upstream from lorette and just upstream of the saint charles river quebec qc canada the hydrographic region of this station is saint laurent northwest and the area of the watershed associated with the station is 365 km2 the geographical location of the saint charles station is presented in fig 2 the saint charles river originates from saint charles lake and after a distance of about 33 km it flows into the saint lawrence river about 350 thousand persons live on its shores in the regional county municipality of la jacques cartier and quebec it is known as the most thickly populated drainage basin in any river in quebec with the majority of the population inhabited in the latter third of its length the dataset was collected hourly from 1998 to 2021 with 70 of all samples being applied for model calibration and the remaining 30 to validate the performance of the developed model s the minimum maximum and mean discharges of the collected data samples are 0 04 m3s 1 97 8 m3s 1 and 10 12 m3s 1 respectively indeed the ratio of the maximum flow rate to the average value exceeds 9 66 2 1 the importance of flood forecasting in quebec one of the most frequent commons of natural disasters in canada especially in quebec is flooding due to intense rainfall being one of the main flooding reasons in canada the distribution of heavy rainfall events in different provinces is shown in fig 3 from this figure it can be seen that the province of quebec is subjected to the greatest proportion of all extreme rainfall events across canada at 23 89 additionally more than 70 of all extreme rainfalls occurred in only three provinces quebec ontario and british columbia who ranked first second and third respectively in addition to the study of heavy rainfalls the history of floods in canada and the resulting damage by provinces also shows the importance of flood forecasting in quebec fig 4 provides the history of floods in different provinces and territories in canada based obtained from the canadian disaster database cdd over the period from 1900 to 2021 from this figure the minimum and the maximum number of floods are seen in nunavut and ontario respectively with one and sixty two recorded flood s during this period due to this figure more than 11 of the total recorded floods in canada occurred in quebec i e 35 recorded floods in both the province of quebec and canada as a whole the number of floods over this period is three times greater than wildfires the second most common natural disaster in canada from the period reported by the cdd different incredible floods have been recorded in the province of quebec in july 1966 over 290 mm of rainfall led to the saguenay flood resulting in at least ten deaths the evacuation of more than 15 825 persons and an estimated cost of over 300 million cad the convergence of intense rainfall following a cold and snowy winter resulted in the 2019 quebec flood due to this flooding 6681 residents in quebec province were flooded the estimated cost of this flood in the city of montreal alone was 17 million cad as shown in fig 4 the average estimated cost per flood in quebec province is about 49 million cad which is more than 5 of all estimated costs of flooding in canada based on the above discussion accurate real time flood forecasting with adequate lead time in quebec is an essential tool for decision and policymakers such a tool will enhance preparation and permit rapid response in the adoption of suitable flood mitigation strategies and rehabilitation actions reducing infrastructure damages and decreasing the economic and social influences of the floods on communities 3 methods a diagram demonstrating the methods applied in the current study is provided in fig 5 from this figure the ffnn based models are categorized into two main groups classical ones trained with the back propagation algorithm and elm based methods that are non tuned rapid ffnn the non tuned rapid term is applied because there is only one parameter that needs to be adjusted in elm and the training time of this model is very fast the main weakness of the classical ffn is overfitting slow convergence and time consuming training due to the mentioned limitations of the elm and its weakness in outlier forecasting such as floods that are considered as outliers compared to other samples the outlier robust elm orelm is developed based on the sparsity feature of outliers yet this model still possesses a limitation in the random tuning of two main matrices in the structure of the elm based model i e input weights and bias of hidden neurons which must be overcome by the use of an iterative version of the orelm known as the improved orelm iorelm finally to decompose the input signals to high scale and low frequency signals the iorelm is integrated with the discrete wavelet transform dwt and introduced dwtiorelm for flood forecasting the details of each method are provided in the following sections 3 1 improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm 3 1 1 extreme learning machine elm extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2006 is a single layer ffnn indeed in addition to the input and output layers it has only one hidden layer that maps the independent input variables to the dependent output variable before modeling the activation function type and the number of hidden neurons nhn should be defined by the user different activation functions that are often considered include hard limit radial basis triangular basis sigmoid sine and hyperbolic tangent the details of each one were presented in bonakdari et al 2020b there is no specific method for determining the nhn before modeling generally the value of this parameter is obtained through a trial and error process the minimum value of this parameter can be considered as one while the maximum value of this parameter should be determined so that the number of optimized parameters during the training process is less than training samples ebtehaj and bonakdari 2021 the maximum allowable nhn is calculated as follows ebtehaj et al 2021 1 max n h n trsa inv 2 where nhn trsa and inv are the number of hidden neurons training samples and the number of input variables respectively a schematic of the modeling process using elm is provided in fig 6 the elm training process is commenced by the random definition of the input weights and bias of hidden neurons the structures of these two matrices are defined and tuned randomly using the user defined nhn using the activation function and these two matrices the output of the hidden layer is calculated finally through a linear process the output weight is determined let consider a problem with s arbitrary training samples and one output variable x i y i i 1 s x i r n y i r to map the input variables to the output one the mathematical definition of the elm model with activation function f x and nhn hidden neurons is as follows 2 i 1 nhn γ i f inw i x j b h n i j 1 2 s where γi is the matrix of the output weights that links the ith hidden neuron of the hidden layer to the target variable that located in the output layer f x is the activation function inw i inw i1 inwi2 inwin t is the matrix of the input weights that links the input layer to the ith hidden neuron of the hidden layer nhn is the number of hidden neurons s is the number of training samples and bhni is the bias of the ith hidden neuron it should be noted that the inw i x j is the inner product of the inw i and x j and the output node is selected as linear the simple form of the eq 2 is as s equations in the compact form of the following linear system 3 o γ y where y y 1 y 1 y s t is the output variable γ γ 1 γ 1 γ s t is the matrix of the output weights and o is the output of the hidden layer which is defined as follows 4 o i n w 1 i n w s x 1 x s b h n 1 b h n s f inw 1 x 1 b h n 1 f inw nhn x 1 b h n nhn f inw 1 x s b h n 1 f inw nhn x s b h n nhn s n h n the o matrix depends on three variables inw x and bhn two variables inw and bhn are randomly determined and x is the matrix of input variables meaning that the o matrix can be readily computed in addition the variable y in eq 3 is the values of the target parameters and its values are known so the only variable whose value is not known is the output weight γ given that in most cases the nhn and s are not equal the o matrix is non square therefore calculating the output weight γ the only unknown matrix in eq 3 is not easy huang et al 2006 huang et al 2006 tried to solve this problem by minimizing the corresponding loss function to find the optimal least square solution olss of the output weight the mentioned loss function is defined as follows 5 l f elm min y o γ 2 2 the results of the finding olss of the γ through minimizing the l2 norm of the loss function is as follows huang et al 2006 6 γ o y the o denotes the moore penrose generalized inverse of the o rao and mitra 1971 due to the number of training samples s being generally higher than the nhn the simple form of the eq 6 for s nhn is as follow 7 γ o t o 1 o t y 3 1 2 regularized extreme learning machine relm as observed in the discussion of elm above in addition to two randomly calculated matrices the matrix of the output weights is obtained using the minimization of the loss function to find olss the loss function defined in eq 5 considers only the training error in order to obtain the best generalizability in the ffnn not only the training error must be minimized but also the norm of weights must be as low as possible bartlett 1998 by defining the regularization term r the loss function presented in eq 5 is modified and a new scheme of the elm known as regularized elm relm is provided the modified loss function in the relm is defined as follows 8 l f relm min γ r y o γ 2 2 γ 2 2 the defined loss function for the relm can be rewritten as a constrained optimization problem 9 l f relm min r γ e 2 2 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e 10 l γ e α r e 2 2 γ 2 2 α t y o γ e where l γ e α is the corresponding lagrangian of the lfrelm α is a vector related to the lagrangian multiplier and e e 1 e s t includes of s training errors the optimal condition of the above mentioned equation is achieved kuhn and tucker 1951 as follows 11 l e 0 2 r e α 0 l γ 0 2 γ o t α 0 l α 0 y o γ e 0 through solving this equation the γ is calculated as follows 12 γ o t o i r 1 o t y s n h n o t oo t i r 1 y otherwise 3 1 3 weighted regularized extreme learning machine wrelm in order to reduce the negative effects of outliers the weighted relm wrelm method was developed deng et al 2009 the wrelm training process includes three main phases 1 modeling using the provided training process in relm 2 considering the weighting scheme on the defined loss function in the relm 3 implementation of the relm with the gathered information from weighting process in the second phase to update the output weight indeed the main difference of this method is considering the weighting scheme in the modeling process provided by relm so that the samples with the least error are assigned the most weight and vice versa according to the provided explanations the loss function of the wrelm is defined as follows 13 l f wrelm r min γ we 2 2 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e where w d i a g w 1 w s it is clear that the difference between the lfrelm and lfwrelm is substituting of the e 2 2 with we 2 2 the w is calculated as follows suykens et al 2002 deng et al 2009 14 w i 1 1 349 e i i q r 2 5 5 2 1 349 e i i q r 2 5 1 349 e i i q r 3 10 4 otherwise where the iqr is the inter quartile range which is the difference between the third and first quartile the result of eq 13 in the calculation of the output weight is as follows deng et al 2009 15 γ o t w 2 o i r 1 o t w 2 y the wrelm modeling process is presented based on eliminating the effects of outliers to counteract performance reduction of the relm in the presence of outliers although this method seems to have the ability to provide exemplary performance in the presence of outliers there are some limitations in this method that may affect its performance the first drawback is related to the relm performance due to that the wrelm is defined based on the initial results of the relm modeling the successful performance of the wrelm is highly dependent on acceptable initial performance of the relm this is known to be a primary challenge facing the wrelm the second limitation is related to the performance of the wrelm when the impact of outliers is decreased in such a situation some samples which are not outliers may be considered as such with the program assigning small weights to them as a result consequently they harm the training performance to overcome these limitations iteratively reweighted methods can be used however these significantly increase computational time which deviates from the primary purpose of elm based methods in fast learning 3 1 4 outlier robust extreme learning machine orelm given that outliers contain a small percentage of all data their effect can be expressed with sparsity the use of l0 norm has been observed to reflect the sparsity better than l2 norm zhang and luo 2015 therefore the training process attempts to find the output weight which is the only matrix estimated during the training process not only with a small l2 norm but also with sparse training error therefore the loss function in the orelm is defined as follows 16 l f orelm min r γ e 0 γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e to solve the above equation in finding the output weight a non convex programming problem must be solved to solve this problem it must be converted to a tractable convex relaxation form while retaining the sparsity the sparse term can be achieved with the l1 norm zhang and luo 2015 substituting the l0 norm with l1 norm in eq 16 results in overall minimization convex and guarantees sparsity thus the convex relaxation of this equation is written as follows 17 l f orelm min γ e 1 1 r γ 2 2 subject to y o γ e the above relation a constrained convex problem can be flawlessly fitted with the appropriate range of the augmented lagrange multiplier alm approach subsequently the alm function is defined as follows zhang and luo 2015 18 l β e γ α e 1 1 r γ 2 2 α t y o γ e β 2 y o γ e 2 2 where β r n and α are the penalty parameter and lagrange multiplier vector respectively by considering the β 2 s y 1 yang and zhang 2011 the e γ and α are estimated using the alm algorithms through an iterative minimization process of the following equation 19 α z 1 α z β y o γ z 1 e z 1 a e z 1 γ z 1 arg min e γ l β e γ α z b 3 1 5 improved orelm iorelm the orelm tried to overcome the limitation of the existing elm based approaches i e elm relm and wrelm in the presence of outliers using the sparsity characteristics although orelm solves this problem there is another critical issue faced by elm based methods failure of which to overcome can negatively impact the performance of models this problem is related to the random definition of the input weights inw and bias of hidden neurons bhn as two main matrices in elm based models indeed all the corrections expressed in the previous sub sections were related to the calculation of the output weight outw and no suggestion has been made to overcome the random determination of the values of these two matrices after the modeling process in elm based methods is completed the target variable could be estimated using the tuned values for three main matrices including inw bhn and outw and an activation function to link these matrices together indeed the modeling target is finding the values of these matrices the bhn and outw are column based matrices with nhn rows while the inw is a matrix with nhn row and inv number of input variables columns the percentage of the randomly tuned parameters i e parameters of the inw and bhn to all tuned parameters through the training phase is calculated as 20 ratio size inw size bhn size inw size bhn size outw i n v n h n 1 n h n i n v n h n 1 n h n 1 n h n nhn i n v 1 nhn i n v 2 i n v 1 i n v 2 due to eq 20 we can see that at least inv 1 66 of all parameters are set randomly while more than 90 of parameters are randomly assigned when the number of input variables reaches 10 consequently a modification of the existing elm approaches is required to overcome this problem and reduce the number of randomly assigned parameters to overcome the weakness of the orelm and other elm based techniques in the random definition of two main matrices a simple iterative based process is defined by taking advantage of the training time of the elm based methods the flowchart of the proposed iorelm model is shown in fig 7 before starting the main loop the user needs to define some initial parameters and functions the parameters include the iteration number for the defined iterative process as the iorelm iteration number iorelmin iteration number for solving augmented lagrange multiplier alm as alm iteration number almin regularization parameter defined in eq 16 r number of hidden neurons nhn and number of training samples s in addition to these parameters the activation function also needs to be defined different types of this function were described in the elm section after the definition of these parameters the main loop is started at the first step of this loop the input weight matrix inwi i 1 s and bias of hidden neurons bhni i 1 s matrices are randomly initiated using these two matrices the hidden layer output o i n w 1 i n w s x 1 x s b h n 1 b h n s is calculated after this the penalty parameter β r n is defined based on the yang and zhang 2011 recommendation as β 2 s y 1 where s is the number of samples and y is the target variable the output weight matrix γ is calculated using the defined penalty parameter through the iterative process of solving the alm algorithm the input weight the bias of hidden neurons and output weights i e inw bhn outw are stored at each iteration after comparing the objective function of all iterations at both training and testing stages the model with the optimum objective function is selected as the best one and the corresponding inw bhn outw matrices are reported as the final model 3 2 discrete wavelet transform dwt the wavelet transform wt is applied as a preprocessing technique in different fields of science especially water sciences campozano et al 2020 it analyzes the input signals and decomposes them into different frequency domains indeed it is applied for compression de nosing and decomposition of the time series based input variables rajaee et al 2019 wt is a time dependent spectral analysis applied to decompose each input time series into time frequency space to offer a time scale depiction of procedures daubechies 1990 the mean of the wavelet function is zero and it decays suddenly in an oscillatory manner a superposition of translated and expanded versions of the pre assign wavelet is used to represent the data daubechies 1990 the wt is capable of extracting information from a function in the time domain the best combination of the details a certain aim could be found by wt daubechies 1990 it has appealing properties that make it a helpful approach for time series with characteristics that change in frequency or scale and time two main groups of the wt are continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt which are defined based on the basic definitions of the wavelet with unique mathematical characteristics that are described as integrable squares in functional space the cwt not only requires significant time but also produces a large amount of data while the dwt utilizes only a subset of positions and scales for its computations in this case different families of the functions ψ σ ϒ t σ and ϒ denote the scale and translation factor respectively are defined based on the translation and dilations of the mother function ψ t in the current study to decompose the time series in two different scales the dwt which is applied for data compression santoso et al 1997 is adopted a multi resolution analysis mallat 1999 includes a series of approximation spaces w i i z of v 2 r that satisfies the following constraints 1 there is a χ w 0 such that χ x i i z is an orthonormal basis of w 0 2 f x w i f x 2 i k w i k z 3 f x w i f 2 x w i 1 4 i z w i 0 5 lim i w i i z w i is dense in v 2 r 6 w i w i 1 the χ denotes the scaling function that produces a multi resolution analysis with the defined six specifications for the sub space w i v 2 r the riesz basis χ i k x k z is achieved through dilation and translation of χ and using the specifications 2 and 3 21 χ i k x 2 i 2 χ 2 i x k j i z this equation could be rewritten in the following form 22 χ m n x a m 2 χ x n b a m due to specification 6 i e w i w i 1 there is a set of coefficients as a k k z so that χ met the two scale or refinement equation 23 χ x k a k χ 2 x k identify li as an orthonormal complement of w i in wi 1 24 w i 1 w i l i 25 l i l i i f i i therefore for i i 26 w i 1 w i k 0 i i 1 l i k by considering specifications 4 and 5 the decomposition of the v 2 r into mutually orthogonal subspaces is defined as follows 27 v 2 r j z w i the basis for v0 is known as the mother wavelet ψ where 28 ψ x k b k χ 2 x k where 29 b k 1 k a k 1 finally the dwt is defined as follows 30 d ω ψ x n a b n z x n g j k n k z j n b k 2 i a 2 i using discrete convolution of the x the coefficients of the dwt i e gi k are approximated and the mother wavelet ψ produces the suitable scaling filters 3 3 integration of the iorelm with dwt dwtorelm in the previous sub section the iorelm as a novel scheme of the elm based models was introduced not only can it perform well in modeling a real world problem in the presence of the outliers but also it can easily overcome the random definition of a large number of parameters in the classical schemes in this section an integrated version of the iorelm with the discrete wavelet transform dwt as a well known decomposition technique is introduced ebtehaj et al 2016 the dwt is applied to decompose the original time series into two main signals approximation a and details d through low and high pass filters respectively indeed the summation of the approximation and details are equal to the main signal fig 8 if the decomposition level is more than one the generated approximate signal in the first level of decomposition a1 is decomposed to the two new signals including d2 and a2 indeed after the two decomposition levels the main signal is converted to the summation of the d1 d2 a3 therefore for the q level of decomposition the main signal is equal to the summation of the d1 d2 dq aq indeed for q level of decompositions there are q low frequency signals d1 d2 dq as the details and one high scale signal as the approximation generated in the qth level of the decomposition consequently one input signal is converted to the q 1 signals after that qth level of the decomposition the maximum number of decomposition levels is a function of the number of training samples nourani et al 2014 31 dl int log s where dl s and int x are the maximum number of decomposition levels samples and integer part of x 4 performance evaluation criteria to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the different models a set of quantitative indices are applied the statistical indices applied in the current study are categorized into three main groups 1 correlation based indices including correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 2 absolute indices including root mean square error rmse and normalized rmse nrmse and 3 relative indices including mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre the mathematical definition of these indices are as follows 32 r t 1 s q a t q a q p t q p i 1 n q a t q a 2 i 1 n q p t q p 2 33 nse 1 t 1 s q a t q p t 2 t 1 s q a t q a 2 34

are the actual and predicted respectively flow discharge at tth time q a is the average of the actual flow discharge the range of r and nse is 1 1 and the range of the other indices is 0 the best value of the r and nse is obtained at r nse 1 while the best value of the other indices is zero the mentioned indices through eq 32 37 only consider the model s accuracy to compare the accuracy of two models without the same structure it is highly recommended to compare them based on the accuracy and simplicity simultaneously to do that the corrected akaike information criteria aicc should be considered zeynoddin et al 2020 and is defined below 38 aicc s l n σ ε 2 2 k s s k 1 where the σε 2 is the standard deviation of the residuals k is the number of tuned parameters through the training phase and s is the number of samples the first term of this equation is the error term while the second one is related to the complexity of the developed model to provide a more favorable and detailed comparison of the existing and developed models in the current study the f test which is assessed the statistical reliability of these models is applied the f test is applied to check the hypothesis claiming that the value of variation derived from using averages is lower than the one estimated using the recommended model to do that the f test is calculated as follows 39 f 0 msr mse 40 msr ssr inv 41 mse sse s p 42 ssr t 1 s q p t q a 2 43 sse t 1 s q p t q a t 2 where s is the number of samples inv is the number of input variables and p inv 1 the null hypothesis of the f test is accepted in the case of f0 fα inv s p the fα inv s p for the significant level of 5 α 0 05 is 2 6049 a reliability analysis is employed to measure the total coherence of different introduced models in the current study it assesses the acceptability of a model at different performance levels the reliability of a model is calculated as follows 44 reliability 100 s t 1 s g t to calculate the gt the relative error of each sample should be calculated as follows 45 ra e t q a t q p t q a t where q a t and q p t are actual and predicted respectively flow discharge of the tth sample using this equation the gt is calculated as follows 46 ra e t δ g t 1 o t h e r w i s e g t 0 the δ in eq 46 is different based on the desired target parameter for example it is considered 20 by chinese standards saberi movahed et al 2020 in the current study the δ is considered as 2 5 10 15 and 20 to compare the performance of all models across different ranges of reliability uncertainty analysis is used to examine the expected range of a model or experiment this estimation range the uncertainty interval ui approximates the difference between estimated and actual values one of the well known techniques to calculate the ui is u95 the value of u95 obtained using the error of a model can be interpreted as by repeatedly experimenting the true value of the test result is within the ui presented for approximately 95 times per 100 experiments the u95 is defined as follows 47 u 95 1 96 s t 1 s q a t q a 2 t 1 s q a t q p t 2 5 results and discussions in this section the performance of the developed hybrid model is compared with the classical and improved elm models in terms of global accuracy simplicity and accuracy in peak flow forecasting this section includes four main sub sections fig 9 which focus on 1 comparing the developed iorelm with the classical elm based models in terms of global accuracy and peak flow performance 2 comparing the individual and hybrid models iorelm vs dwtiorelm for one to three steps ahead 3 optimizing the best model to find the optimum value of the iteration number decomposition level number of hidden neurons and optimum mother wavelet and activation function 4 checking the performance of the optimum model for multi step ahead forecasting 5 1 comparison of different individual models in this subsection the performance of the improved versions of the different elm based techniques i e ielm irelm iwrelm iorelm are compared for a fair comparison of different models the value of all parameters in the desired models and input variables should be the same therefore the iteration number and number of hidden neurons were considered as 200 and 50 respectively besides the activation function is considered as sigmoid these parameters are employed in all methods another parameter is applied only in the irelm iwrelm and iorelm known as the regularization parameter the value of this parameter was considered as 0 0001 the number of all samples in the current study is 137 063 categorized into training and testing samples with the ratio of 70 and 30 respectively the considered input combinations for all models are as q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 fig 10 shows the scatter plots of the developed iorelm as well as for the improved versions of the other elm based models from this figure the ielm method can be seen to perform poorly at small discharges as well as at peak flow so that for flow discharges higher than 80 m3s 1 it underestimates discharge this pattern is also observed during the testing phase indeed although the model has acceptable generalizability its performance during the testing phase for which it predicts discharge samples not previously seen is nearly identical to the training phase it can be concluded that its performance is unreliable especially in peak flows which is important in flood forecasting like ielm irelm has good generalizability so that the results of the training and testing stages are close although it can be clearly seen that the use of irelm has not been able to solve the problem of inaccuracy in flow discharge forecasting it has a better performance at peak flows so that the peak flow estimation error in irelm compared to ielm is significantly reduced indeed it can be said that the use of the norm of weights in the defined loss function for the relm along with training error eq 8 has led to an increase in model performance in peak flow forecasting similar to the previous two methods the performance of iwrelm and iorelm models is not acceptable in small flow discharge however the critical point is the high performance of these methods in peak flow forecasting these models especially iorelm performed well in this range of flow discharge that has vital importance in flood forecasting comparison of ielm and irelm methods showed that the use of norm of weights significantly affects the model s accuracy in peak flow forecasting in the iwrelm method using the weighting process and the loss function presented in irelm eq 8 the model s performance is significantly increased in peak flows in addition the results presented by iorelm also showed that the use of small l2 norm along with sparse training errors in finding output weights leads to the best performance of elm based models in peak flow forecasting fig 11 demonstrates the statistical indices and training time of the developed iorelm and improved versions of the other elm based models the training time of the ielm and irelm with 200 iterations is about 130 s while it is higher for iwrelm and especially iorelm with 179 and 313 s respectively the reason for an increased training time in iwrelm compared to the irelm is due to the use of an additional step when applying the weights obtained during the weighting process the high training times of the iorelm which is more than 2 5 times greater than the ielm and irelm is also due to an iterative process to find output weights using eq 19 code 1 the r and nse indicators show an outstanding value for all of the studied models are more than 0 99 however the scatter plots presented in fig 10 showed that the performance of the models is significantly different from each other therefore it should be noted that using only correlation based indices especially for problems where the number of samples is high is not an excellent way to compare different models the results of mare and rmsre as two relative indices and rmse and nrmse as two absolute indices show that the best performance among these models is related to the iorelm r 0 999 nse 0 998 rmse 0 614 nrmse 0 056 mare 0 027 rmsre 0 063 while the weakest one is related to ielm indeed the success of the proposed modifications to the elm algorithm to achieve better peak flow predictions can be seen for the irelm iwrelm and iorelm it should be noted that irelm has the highest value of rmsre which demonstrates the importance of the modifying concepts presented to calculate output weights by the iwrelm and iorelm table 2 indicates the results of the reliability analysis uncertainty analysis and f test for iorelm and other elm based models for the f test the null hypothesis is accepted in the case of f0 fα inv s p the fα inv s p for the significant level of 5 α 0 05 is 2 6049 the status of the hypothesis for all models is accept besides the uncertainty analysis results calculated using u95 are almost equal for all models u95 0 133 from the reliability results in different values of δ it can be seen that the iwrelm outperformed the iorelm for δ 2 and 5 while for δ 10 15 and 20 the opposite is true it should be noted that the difference between the value of the reliability for the iwrelm and the iorelm at δ 2 and δ 5 is less than 8 and 2 respectively these models have relatively good global accuracy but their performance at peak flows needs further investigation 5 1 1 peak flow comparison of different elm based models table 3 indicates the mape of different models in peak flow forecasting using q 1 max 0 99 qmax q 1 max qmax q 5 max 0 95 qmax q 5 max qmax q 10 max 0 9 qmax q 5 max qmax the q 1 max q 5 max q 10 max are defined as for q 1 max the mape s of the iwrelm irelm ielm are 2 37 4 03 5 31 times the mape of the iorelm this ratio is significantly increased for q 5 max and q 10 max so that the mape of the iwrelm which has the lowest difference with iorelm is 2 37 times higher than the mape of the iorelm as a result it can be said that the use of the norm of weights in irelm and its combination with a weighting process in iwrelm has a better performance in predicting peak flow than ielm which achieves output weights only by minimizing the training error 5 2 comparison of the individual and hybrid models global accuracy fig 12 indicates the statistical indices of the individual iorelm model and improved version of the other elm based models in this figure there are nine models based on the one to three lags to forecast one to three time s ahead these models are defined as m1 to m9 the target variable in all these models is qt which indicates the flow discharge at time t in m1 to m3 qt 1 is considered as one of the input variables for one time ahead forecasting similar to these models the qt 2 for m4 to m6 and qt 3 for m7 to m9 are for two and three times ahead forecasting respectively one time ahead 1ta m 1 q t q t 1 m 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 m 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 two times ahead 2ta m 4 q t q t 2 m 5 q t q t 2 q t 3 m 6 q t q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 three times ahead 3ta m 7 q t q t 3 m 8 q t q t 3 q t 4 m 9 q t q t 3 q t 4 q t 5 as shown in fig 12 increasing the number of input variables for both individual and hybrid models results in a more precise model than a model with fewer inputs this is true for all employed indices in fig 12 except the rmse nrmse and mare of m3 compared to m2 for the hybrid model indeed it can be said that increasing the number of lags from two to three has not been effective and this model has experienced its maximum ability with two lags comparison of the individual and hybrid models for all nine defined models indicates that the integration of the dwt with the iorelm results in a more accurate model compared to the individual model i e iorelm the difference between the correlation based indices in individual and hybrid models is minimal in nature the maximum relative difference is related to the nse of m2 with a relative error of 0 16 for the absolute based indices i e rmse and nrmse application of the hybrid methods instead of individual one s results in a decrease in modeling errors in the range of 2 5 93 with the lowest and highest reductions related to the m2 and m7 respectively for the relative based indices i e mare and rmsre application of the hybrid methods instead of individual one s results in a reduction in modeling errors in the range of 4 26 where the lowest and highest decreases are seen in m1 and m6 respectively it was noted that the changes in performance of the hybrid model compared to the individual models were not proportional for all indices so that the largest changes in r nse rmse nrmse mare and rmsre were seen in m5 m5 m2 m2 m7 m9 respectively as can be seen in this figure the difference between the correlative based indices is shallow so that the r and nse of m1 to m9 for both individual and hybrid models are more than 0 99 which is a good value for these indices indeed due to a large number of samples the difference in the performance of these models using these indices is not visible the applied hybrid model is an integration of the dwt and iorelm the decomposition level of the developed models for flood forecasting is equal to one indeed using the developed hybrid model one input variable is decomposed into two new variables including the approximated and detailed terms fig 8 therefore the number of input variables and consequently the number of tuned parameters in dwtiorelm and iorelm are not the same eq 20 the provided statistical indices in fig 12 a b c d are error based indices therefore for a fair comparison the performance of these two methods needs to be compared in terms of accuracy and simplicity simultaneously to do that the aicc is applied as presented in fig 12 e the lowest value of this model indicates the most optimum model in flood forecasting according to fig 12 e it could be seen that the aicc of all models i e m1 to m9 for dwtiorelm is lower than the iorelm the greatest difference between the aicc values of the iorelm and the dwtiorelm can be seen for the case where forecasting is performed for one time ahead while the smallest difference is seen when forecasting is performed for three periods ahead consequently integration of the dwt with iorelm has well increased flood forecasting accuracy now these two models must be evaluated in peak flow forecasting using different input combinations 5 2 1 comparison of the individual and hybrid modes peak flow forecasting fig 13 compares the performance of both individual and hybrid models for peak flow forecasting for this the performance of both individual and hybrid models is evaluated for three different ranges the defined ranges are q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max as indicated in fig 13 a as seen in this figure q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max are flow discharges higher than 96 82 92 91 and 88 02 m3 s respectively from figs 123 b 13 c and 13 d it can be seen that the maximum mape for one two and three steps ahead forecasting for all individual and hybrid models is less than 2 3 and 4 respectively the dwtiorelm model outperformed iorelm in all models with one to three times ahead forecasting except in m3 of two times ahead forecasting for this model the difference between the mape of the individual and hybrid models was less than 0 3 which is considered to be insignificant due to provided explanations for comparing the developed hybrid model i e dwtiorelm with individual iorelm it could be concluded that this model outperformed iorelm now that the performance of this model is compared with the individual one it is necessary to apply a comprehensive review to the parameters of this model to provide the most optimal model possible for flood forecasting 5 3 optimization of the best model the developed dwtiorelm model applied in flow discharge forecasting requires some parameters i e iteration number decomposition level number of hidden neurons mother wavelet and activation function and the failure to select them correctly can affect the results of the model hence in this section we aim to obtain their optimal values indeed by constantly considering the value of all parameters except one parameter for example iteration number different values are checked for this parameter to find the optimum one it should be noted that the considered values are selected so that if the value of this parameter is considered outside this range it will not increase the performance of the model fig 14 presents the statistical indices of the dwtiorelm model during the optimization process of its user defined input parameters the inputs of all models provided in this figure are similar to m 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 it should be noted that since the values of correlation based indices i e r and nse do not show significant changes they have been omitted the first parameter to be considered is the iteration number in the in parameter was first introduced during the modification process of the initial version of elm based methods to overcome the random tuning of input weights and bias of hidden neurons given that the implementation time of elm based methods is considerably rapid selecting large values for this parameter is not problematic since the initial modeling was performed using in 200 two larger iteration number values of in 500 1000 are also evaluated increasing the number of iterations from 200 to 500 improves rmse performance by about 10 so that rmse decreases from 0 34 to 0 307 and nrmse from 0 028 to 0 021 when in 500 is selected the mare and the rmsre were seen to be reduced by about 4 and less than 1 respectively increasing the in beyond 500 iterations not only increases the modeling time but was also seen to slightly reduce the modeling accuracy therefore in 500 is selected as the optimal iteration number fixing in 500 the performance of the dwtiorelm is evaluated for different mother wavelets mws including discrete meyer dm daubechies d coiflets c fejer korovkin fk symlets s biorthogonal b and reverse biorthogonal rb the results of the dwtiorelm with different mws can be seen in fig 14 b from the figure the change of mw from dm to other mws significantly increases the error values calculated by different indices the smallest values of the rmse nrmse mare and rmsre corresponding to the d c fk s b and rb mw s have a relative error of about 256 256 149 and 110 respectively compared to the index values obtained when mw dm consequently the dm is selected as the best mother wavelet for the current study using in 500 and mw dm the effect of the decomposition level dl on the performance of the dwtiorelm in flood forecasting is evaluated the dl is considered in the range of 1 5 it is observed that increasing the dl not only worsens the performance of the model but also leads to the generation of a more complex model for example for a model with dl 5 and three initial inputs the number of final inputs is equal to 18 while for a model with dl 1 and three initial inputs the number of final inputs is equal to 9 excessive increase in the number of inputs not only hindered model performance but also reduced its accuracy as seen in fig 13 a 13 b 13 c 13 e using in 500 mw dm and dl 1 the effect of different activation functions af on flood forecasting using dwtiorelm was assessed numerous commonly employed af types were assessed including the hyperbolic tangent bt triangular basis tb radial basis rb hard limit hl sigmoid and sine for all statistical indices evaluated in this study the sigmoid af rmse 0 34 nrmse 0 031 mare 0 023 rmsre 0 054 outperformed all other functions following the sigmoid af the sin af ranked second for the absolute based indices i e rmse nrmse while the ht af ranked second for the relative based indices i e mare rmsre the rb tb and hl afs performed poorly and are ranked fourth to sixth respectively therefore the sigmoid function is selected as the optimum activation function in flood forecasting using in 500 mw dm dl 1 and af sig the effect of the number of hidden neurons nhn on flood forecasting using dwtiorelm is evaluated increasing nhn from 50 to 250 enhanced the accuracy of the dwtiorelm in flood forecasting while decreasing the nhn from 50 to 25 led to an increase in modeling error varying the nhn was seen to cause the formation of different model structures which had differing levels of complexity thus the accuracy and simplicity of the model must be considered simultaneously to obtain the optimal value for nhn for this reason the aicc index is used to evaluate the combined effect of variation in the nhn in fig 14 f it can be seen that the value of this index from nhn 25 to nhn 100 declines sharply while this decreasing trend continues for nhn 100 to nhn 200 but at a greatly reduced rate increasing the nhn from 200 to 250 leads to the beginning of the upward trend so that the value of aicc in nhn 200 is equal to 116 101 5 while the value of this index for nhn 150 and 250 is equal to 115 119 85 and 115 331 85 respectively consequently the nhn 200 was selected as the optimum value of the nhn fig 15 shows the scatter plot and error distribution of the optimum dwtiorelm according to the provided scatter plot all flow discharges greater than 20 m3s 1 were estimated with a relative error of less than 20 therefore it overcomes the existing weakness of the iorelm provided in fig 9 where a significant number of erroneous predictions were observed at flows greater than 20 m3s 1 the cumulative frequency of the threshold of the relative absolute error indicates that more than 55 of all samples are forecasted with a relative error of less than 1 this percentage is 91 for forecasted samples with a relative error of less than 5 besides only around 1 of all samples were forecasted with a relative error exceeding 20 this is to be expected as about 7 5 of all samples have a discharge less than 1 m3s 1 and calculating the relative error for significant low discharge samples provides high values to verify the performance of the optimum model the mape of the three different categories i e q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max are calculated these calculations indicated that the mape of all categories and is less than 1 proving the high capability of the introduced model in the current study for flood forecasting the statistical indices of the iorelm in fig 9 were acceptable however there were a small number of samples that presented high relative errors the incorrect prediction of these samples potentially may have resulted in significant damage to infrastructure as well as humans as a result of the excellent performance of the optimized dwtiorelm model in flood forecasting it is employed for multi step ahead flood forecasting 5 4 multi step ahead flood forecasting in this section to verify the performance of the developed model for multi step ahead forecasting cheng et al 2006 the optimum dwtiorelm is evaluated for up to nine hours ahead in peak flow forecasting the mape of the dwtiorelm for one to nine steps ahead through two main categories is provided in fig 16 it provides the mape of the dwtiorelm model for samples with discharges higher than 96 82 92 91 and 88 02 m3 s as q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max respectively the q 1 max q 5 max and q 10 max defined in this figure are entirely expressed in fig 13 a in this figure m1 to m9 are used to represent one to nine times ahead forecasting for all models q 1 max outperformed the others with q 5 max and q 10 max ranked second and third respectively for all categories i e q 1 max q 5 max q 10 max and forecast steps greater than two i e m2 the mape is more than 2 5 times the value of this index for m1 as the forecast time increased the value of this ratio also increased so that for nine times ahead forecasting the mape value for m9 was more than ten times this value for m1 of course this ratio is lower in q 5 max and q 10 max which can be due to the ability of the developed model in the presence of outlier data indeed the use of sparsity characteristics in this model has led to the fact that even for nine steps ahead forecasting and q 10 max the model can forecast the peak flow values with an average relative error of less than 5 considering the level of acceptable error in forecasting the defined hybrid model in the current study can be applied in multi step ahead flood forecasting 6 advantages limitations and future improvements in the current study the newly developed hybrid dwtiorelm was successfully applied in flood forecasting to a station located upstream of the saint charles river quebec canada the proposed hybrid model was developed using three main concepts 1 generalizable development of the elm based model in the presence of outliers by considering the sparsity characteristics of outliers in the defined loss function 2 improvement of the elm based methods through an iterative process to overcome their limitations associated with the random definition of the two main matrices i e input weights and bias of hidden neurons and 3 integration of the discrete wavelet transforms with the improved outlier robust extreme learning machine dwtiorelm for multi steps ahead flood forecasting the peak flows are not only remarkably higher than other samples but also the number of them compared to the total samples is not significant considering that the sparsity characteristics overcome the limitation of the classical elm based methods i e elm relm wrelm in the presence of outliers i e peak flows which is the main objective of the current study the main advantages of the developed hybrid models are threefold firstly the model has been shown to have a high performance in the presence of the outliers a requirement of the current study for flood forecasting as the number of peak flows in comparison to all samples is very low and is considered as outliers by the classical elm based models second the developed model considers an iterative process to overcome the random definition of more than 66 of parameters in classical elm based models the iterative process implemented not only improved the modeling performance but also preserved the rapid training time of modeling for 200 iterations the modeling time is about 313 s which is low compared to well known ml based models such as ann and anfis especially considering that the current study uses more than 95 000 training samples the reason for the high modeling speed in this method is that the nonlinear problem is first converted to a linear system and then the optimal output weights are obtained through solving a linear problem in contrast for ann and anfis the biases weights and membership functions are quantified and optimized through the training phase leading to a lengthy modeling process third the dwtiorelm model for flood forecasting is introduced by integrating the dwt and iorelm the application of this hybrid model overcomes the limitation of the individual models in peak flows forecasting in the current study an iterative process was recommended to improve the limitation of the random initialization of the bias of hidden neurons and input weights the robustness of the developed model could be tested under different climatic conditions however a follow up study should be conducted to introduce an optimization scheme of the iorem using well known evolutionary optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 particle swarm optimization pso ebtehaj et al 2019 or a combination of them such as psoga gharabaghi et al 2018 gholami et al 2018 additionally newly introduced optimization algorithms such as grey wolf optimizer mirjalili et al 2014 and grasshopper optimization algorithm saremi et al 2020 could also be studied and compared moreover to decompose the input signals an alternative approach is the application of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and comparing the performance of dwt and eemd besides the developed hybrid model applied the historical values of the current station to forecast the flow discharge an alternative approach could be the application of the adjacent stations upstream of this station for flood forecasting without the historical values of saint charles station it is essential that future work continues to study the challenges that prevent machine learning from being applied and developed in flood forecasting the current issues facing ml for flood forecasting applications can be summarized into two main points first data challenges the number of all samples applied in the current study was large at more than 137 000 to handle such a large number of data efficiently the elm based approaches were applied to benefit from their rapid training process if more advanced ml modeling techniques are to be implemented for flood forecasting the modeling time may be significantly increased a way to overcome this challenge is converting hourly data to composite daily values second the developed models for flood forecasting in the current study considered only three lags according to that there is no particular method for finding the input combinations in hourly flood forecasting the development of a ml based method integrated with evolutionary algorithms can be helpful to find optimum input combinations in flood forecasting 7 conclusions floods which are common events globally are one of the most catastrophic natural hazards flood forecasting in the province of quebec using powerful ml techniques is inevitable due to its susceptibility to flood events most recently in 2019 thousands of people were displaced with significant damage to private and public infrastructure in the current study a new hybrid machine learning model is introduced for multi steps ahead hourly flood forecasting the developed model known as dwtiorelm is an integration of the improved outlier robust extreme learning machine iorelm and discrete wavelet transform dwt using the hourly data collected from saint charles station located upstream of quebec and considering only three lags the flow discharge of multi steps ahead was forecasted before integrating the iorelm with the dwt the performance of this model was compared with the improved version of the existing techniques such as improved extreme learning machine ielm improved regularized extreme learning machine irelm improved weighted regularized extreme learning machine iwrelm the results indicated that iorelm outperformed other approaches r 0 999 nse 0 998 rmse 0 614 nrmse 0 056 mare 0 027 rmsre 0 063 although the correlation coefficient of individual models showed good values the performance of these models in peak flow discharge was not acceptable iorelm as the best individual model was integrated with dwt and the dwtiorelm model was developed to overcome this limitation a comprehensive study was performed to find the optimum input parameters of the introduced hybrid model rmse 0 234 nrmse 0 021 mare 0 02 finally the optimum values of the iteration number decomposition level and the number of hidden neurons were found to be 500 1 and 200 respectively moreover the mother wavelet and activation function of the optimum model was discrete meyer dm and sigmoid function respectively the performance of the hybrid model with optimum values of different parameters was evaluated for multi steps ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead the results demonstrated that the developed model could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 the modeling results demonstrated that the developed model has global accuracy and performed well in estimating the peak flows that are of considerable importance in

2772,an accurate prediction of sediment yield at the watershed scale is critical not only for sustainable watershed management but also for improving knowledge regarding the relationship between sediment yield and its determinant factors which often rely on the varying model complexity in this study a modified sediment yield formula based on the modified universal soil loss equation musle model was developed by introducing a channel factor into the original formula the reliability of the proposed method was tested using data from 1 341 storm events in 38 watersheds and was applied to 256 storm events in five application watersheds using the optimized parameters results indicated that the proposed method is very accurate as demonstrated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 88 18 85 72 and 85 51 during calibration validation and application respectively the performance of the proposed model was superior to that of the original musle model subsequently the proposed method was used to predict sediment yield from the last five typical watersheds this prediction utilized the parameters derived from the initial 38 watersheds the peak discharge predicted by the modified chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams and the runoff estimated by the modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method elevated nse 61 88 81 42 and low root mean square error values 2 35 11 40 t ha 1 were calculated for the five watersheds from the results the proposed sediment yield model combined with the modified scs cn method and creams was found to accurately predict the event based sediment yield peak discharge and runoff in the loess plateau region under varying hydrological and geomorphic conditions keywords modified universal soil loss equation sediment yield peak discharge surface runoff channel factor data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil erosion which reduces not only the storage capacity of downstream reservoirs but also deteriorates the productivity of a watershed is an important consideration in the planning of watershed development shi and huang 2021 watershed management for soil and water conservation can reduce sediment transfer to channels and sediment loads in rivers by increasing sediment storage and reducing sediment mobilization thus increasing the probability of achieving clean water provisioning and sustainable livelihoods walling and fang 2003 chen et al 2007 quantifying sediment yield and identifying the major contributing factors are important for the effective and sustainable management of watersheds sediment yield prediction at the watershed scale is the scientific basis for land management decision making and is an important basis for accurately assessing control effects it is also a vibrant research field for conducting soil erosion studies nearing et al 2017 therefore it is critical to develop an effective sediment yield prediction model and reasonable and scientific soil conservation strategies on a watershed basis many process based and empirical models have been proposed to predict sediment yield process based models including the water erosion prediction project flanagan et al 2007 the griffith university erosion system template rose et al 1998 and the european soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 are characterized by different levels of complexity and require several parameter inputs however empirical models have advantages regarding the ease of application and simplified parameterization which have had an important role in predicting sediment yield shi et al 2021 the most widely used empirical models are the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised versions including the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard 1997 and the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 the usle was developed to estimate soil erosion at the plot and annual time scales therefore its application to storm wise sediment yields at the watershed scale may lead to substantial errors alewell et al 2019 the musle was developed as a watershed based model to estimate the sediment yield produced by each individual storm event replacing the rainfall factor from the traditional usle with a runoff factor as a function of runoff volume q and peak discharge qp williams 1975 many studies have evaluated musle globally under varying conditions sadeghi and mizuyama 2007 arekhi et al 2012 gwapedza et al 2018 2021 musle is also used as a sub model within established models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 the agricultural catchments research unit schulze and horan 2007 and the water quality systems assessment model hughes 2013 slaughter et al 2015 sediment yield is determined by geomorphologic and hydrological factors that can affect sediment detachment transport and deposition processes geomorphological research may have an important role regarding the development and implementation of sediment yield assessment tools and soil conservation measures renschler and harbor 2002 the geomorphological characteristics of watersheds may affect energy fluxes mass movement and sediment and water dispersion in watersheds zhang et al 2015 recently during the last few decades various studies and methodologies have been applied to investigate the correlation between geomorphological characteristics and sediment discharge numerous indices such as soil property topography land use and land cover support practice watershed and channel characteristics have been proposed to represent the geomorphologic characteristics of the watershed some researchers have used statistical methods and mathematical models to describe correlations between geomorphology and soil erosion cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in the original musle model the soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover management factor cm and support practice factor ps were adopted to reflect the effects of geomorphologic characteristics of soil properties topography such as slope length and steepness land use and land cover and support practice regarding sediment yield however few studies have considered channel characteristics that may reflect the sediment transport capacity in the musle model for sediment yield prediction this will be the focus of this study for the hydrological factors the product of runoff volume q and peak discharge qp is used in the musle model it is necessary to consider runoff and peak discharge models as components of the sediment yield model to study the sediment yield in ungauged or poorly gauged watersheds the natural resources conservation service formerly known as the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method scs 1972 is one of the most widely used models for estimating surface runoff during the past four decades many modified versions of the original scs cn model have been developed for various applications mishra et al 2008 sahu et al 2010 babu and mishra 2012 singh et al 2015 walega et al 2019 shi and wang 2020 for example lian et al 2020 adjusted the cn value by using observational data of rainfall runoff events from 55 research sites in china the results indicated that the revised cn value had better reference and guidance significance and was suitable for most natural conditions in china shi et al 2021 developed a revised cn value incorporating the impact of the temporal variability of key factors to improve the runoff prediction accuracy in small watersheds on the loess plateau many studies regarding the prediction of peak discharges have been conducted using the peak discharge equation of the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel 1980 fu et al 2008 liu et al 2017 shi et al 2022 similar to the scs cn model the peak discharge equation of the creams model was modified for example fu et al 2008 considered watershed area runoff and rainfall depth as variables based on 331 rainstorm data points from 20 small watersheds on the loess plateau in china shi et al 2022 modified the peak discharge formula based on the creams model by introducing rainfall intensity and soil moisture factors based on data from 1720 storm events within 45 watersheds to improve the accuracy of peak discharge prediction in small watersheds on the loess plateau to date no study has determined if the integration of these models into a framework can be used to improve the accuracy of storm based sediment yield prediction at the watershed scale for the loess plateau therefore the present study aimed to 1 modify the musle by exploring a new channel factor 2 compare the performance of the proposed method with the original musle model in terms of sediment yield prediction and 3 combine the modified musle model with the modified scs cn and creams models to predict runoff peak discharge and sediment yield in the loess plateau of china 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment yield models 2 1 1 the original musle model the general form of the sediment yield equation

reaches of the yellow river and is one of the most erodible areas in the world fu et al 2004 tian et al 2016 fig 1 the loess plateau has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 4 3 c in the northwest and 14 3 c in the southeast the average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 600 mm and gradually increases from the northwest to the southeast fig 1 furthermore approximately 60 70 of annual precipitation occurs during rainy season from june to september which frequently occurs in form of heavy rain causing flooding and severe soil erosion intense erosion has formed many gullies fragmented landforms and unique geomorphic features of the loess plateau such as the tableland yuan ridges liang and hills mao based on existing sediment yield monitoring data for

hydrological data from 43 watersheds were used to test the performance of the musle algorithm and the proposed method the two test models were calibrated and validated using data collected from 38 of 43 experimental watersheds and the calibrated and validated methods were then applied to the five application watersheds to calibrate and validate the two methods the event based observed sediment yield dataset of each watershed was randomly divided into two subsets one for calibration and the other for validation the measured and estimated runoff and peak discharge were used in this study the measured surface runoff and peak discharge for each event were used along with eqs 1 3 to test the sediment yield prediction performance of the two methods during calibration validation and application the estimated surface runoff using the modified scs cn of shi et al 2021 and the predicted peak discharge using the modified creams method of shi et al 2022 were combined with the newly developed method to test the reliability of the coupled model for runoff peak discharge and sediment yield predictions in the five application watersheds in addition five parameters c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5

after processing were used to calculate ls in the gis raster calculator using the following equation gwapedza et al 2021 10 ls fa c e l l s i z e 22 13 0 4 sin φ 0 0896 1 3 where fa is the flow accumulation cellsize is the dem resolution and φ is the slope gradient 2 6 3 cover factor cm the cm factor was calculated by extracting land cover attributes assigning cm factor values according to look up tables wischmeier smith 1978 and weighting the cm factor values for each land cover category with the total area the sum of the weighted cm factor values was used as the average vegetation cover value for each watershed 2 6 4 support practice factor ps supporting practices usually affect erosion by reducing runoff around slopes thereby reducing erosivity or by mitigating runoff that causes deposition such as on concave slopes or barriers such as vegetation strips and terraced fields the lower the ps value the more effective the conservation practice is in reducing soil erosion in the absence of support practices the ps factor was 1 0 ps values can be obtained by image classification using remote sensing data previous studies and even expert knowledge in this study the ps factor was derived based on previous studies of similar watersheds on the loess plateau by qin et al 2009 and was weighted with the total area to obtain the average ps factor input for the musle model 2 7 data analyses the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 risse et al 1994 and root mean square error rmse values were used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the measured and estimated data in this study the calculation formulas can be expressed as follows 11 nse 1 j 1 n y j y j 2 j 1 n y j y 2 100 12 rmse 1 n j 1 n y j y j 2 where y is the mean value of the measured events y j and y j are the jth measured value and estimated value respectively and n is the total number of events the value of nse ranges from to 100 wherein the high nse and low rmse values indicate good consistency between the predicted and observed values 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation a total of 670 and 671 sediment yield events in the 38 watersheds were used for calibration and validation respectively for the calibration dataset optimization parameters of the test method and their 95 confidence interval values are listed in table 3 table 4 compares the performance of the original musle and the proposed method using indices and regression analysis the estimated sediment yields using the two tested models and the corresponding measured values during calibration are plotted in fig 2 the original musle consistently underestimated the magnitude of large sediment yield events and overestimated the magnitude of most small sediment yield events with nse value of 78 45 and rmse value of 13 39 t ha 1 however compared with those of the original musle model most of the data points of the proposed model are closer to the 1 1 line where the estimated sediment yield is in good agreement with the measured sediment yield fig 2a b although the determination coefficients r2 of the two models were similar 0 88 for the proposed model and 0 86 for the original musle model the proposed model presented a superior performance thus yielding a larger nse value of 88 18 and a lower rmse value of 9 92 t ha 1 when compared with those of the musle model table 4 fig 3 verifies the superiority of the proposed method during the validation period with a higher slope of 0 65 compared with that of the musle model 0 51 moreover the proposed model still outperformed the original musle nse 73 00 in the validation period and its nse value was as high as 85 72 in general the proposed method was superior to the original musle method during the calibration and verification periods 3 2 model application 3 2 1 sediment yield model with measured runoff and peak discharge the two tested methods with the parameters optimized during calibration and validation were applied to the prediction of sediment yield in the remaining five typical watersheds the sediment yields predicted by the original musle model and the proposed model were plotted with the corresponding measured values of the five watersheds as shown in fig 4 table 5 shows the performance of the two tested methods in predicting sediment yield events for each watershed the original musle model continued to substantially underestimate the large and overestimated small sediment yield events table 5 however the proposed method s performance was superior to that of the original musle model for all five watersheds with increased nse values varying from 77 84 to 91 89 and most of the former data points were reasonably close to the 1 1 line fig 4b 3 2 2 sediment yield model with estimated runoff and peak discharge in the present study the runoff depths estimated by the modified scs cn method of shi et al 2021 and the peak discharge estimated by the modified creams model of shi et al 2022 were also incorporated into the proposed method to simulate event based sediment yield in the five application watersheds see table 6 fig 5 a shows a comparison of the measured and estimated runoff for the modified scs cn of shi et al s 2021 method although the rainfall runoff model underestimated some small runoff values most of the data points were near the 1 1 line and reasonable nse value of 71 21 and an rmse value of 1 78 mm resulted table 6 fig 5b compares the measured and estimated peak discharges using the coupled model of the peak discharge method of shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 although the peak discharge model also underestimated some small runoff values most of the data points were near the 1 1 line and reasonable nse value of 78 04 and an rmse value of 14 54 m3 s 1 resulted fig 5b these results indicate that the runoff predicted by the modified scs cn method and peak discharge predicted by the modified creams method can be combined with the newly developed model in this study to predict sediment yield events fig 5c compares the measured and estimated sediment yields using the coupled model of the proposed sediment yield method the creams method modified by shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 although most of the data points measured and predicted by the coupled model are not as close to the 1 1 line as those by the proposed method with a measured runoff and peak discharge the former still achieves an acceptable nse value varying from 61 88 to 81 42 and slightly less than the latter s range of 77 84 91 89 fig 5c these results show that the proposed sediment yield method combined with the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 and the creams method modified by shi et al 2022 can accurately predict the sediment yield when the measured runoff and peak discharge are unavailable 3 3 sensitivity analyses these results show that the newly developed method for sediment yield prediction is more accurate than the original musle model a proposed model sensitivity analysis is required to better identify the influence of the model parameters on model performance therefore the parameters a b and m were optimized using the full dataset of 43 watersheds and a sensitivity analysis was conducted by observing the influence of optimized parameter changes on the prediction of sediment yield by the model with nse value fig 6 shows the sensitivity of each parameter of the proposed method for sediment yield prediction the introduction in datasets did not substantially affect the fitting of the model which proved the robustness of the model n 1597 a 8 73 b 0 552 m 0 364 nse 86 12 in sensitivity analysis the sensitive parameter refers to the parameter whose model efficiency changes significantly when the parameter value changes around the calibration value from the sensitivity analysis of the results b was the parameter with the greatest sensitivity varying between 105 and 90 of the calibration value whereas the nse value decreased significantly from 86 12 to 57 90 the parameter a appeared to be the least sensitive in general the sensitivity of the model parameters from high to low was b a m fig 6 4 discussion an accurate prediction of sediment yield at watershed scales is critical not only for sustainable watershed management and effective implementation of beneficial management practices but also for improving knowledge regarding the relationship between sediment yield and its potential determinant factors which often rely on sediment yield models of varying complexity a total of 1597 events from 43 watersheds with varying hydrological and geomorphic factors within the loess plateau were used to verify the reliability of the proposed method for calibration validation and application the method achieved great success in all periods and showed good agreement between the estimated and measured sediment yield events when compared with the original musle model 4 1 impact factors of sediment yield at the watershed scale sediment yield is the integrated result of all erosion sediment transport and deposition processes operating in a watershed vanmaercke et al 2014 it detaches soil particles from its primary location and then transports these materials from the hillslope into the channel and propagates the sediments through the channel network toward the watershed outlet successful watershed management relies on understanding key sediment transport processes and their linkages beyond the channel reach as sediment transport varies both spatially and temporally at the watershed scale spatial variations in watershed environmental factors and the complexity of their combined patterns result in deposition and temporary or permanent storage of eroded sediment during the transport process shi et al 2014 sediment yield is determined by geomorphologic factors such as soil topography land use and land cover support practices and hydrological factors such as rainfall runoff and peak flow characteristics these phenomenon may affect sediment detachment transport and deposition processes de vente et al 2011 fryirs 2013 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 gonzález et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 therefore to improve sediment yield prediction accuracy the main control factors affecting the variability of the sediment yield should be considered 4 1 1 hydrological factors in terms of hydrological factors the most influential variables on sediment yield were the runoff and peak discharge characteristics there is a significant and positive correlation between sediment yield with the product of runoff volume in addition a significant and positive correlation was observed for and peak discharge with the exponents b and b varied from 0 42 to 0 55 for the two tested methods the exponent b and b values of 0 42 0 55 is less than the original value of the musle model 0 56 which may be related to the high sediment concentration in the loess plateau region indicating that the same runoff volume produces a higher sediment yield hou et al 2021 the 95 confidence intervals for the exponents b and b are equal to 0 41 0 43 and 0 54 0 56 respectively indicating that b and b are significantly lower than unity peak discharge qp is directly adopted to reflect the energy of flow necessary to detach and transport sediment which is an important runoff factor in the musle model whereas the runoff volume is directly used to represent the transport of sediments because of its large contribution to sediment transport by thin overland and channel flows gonzález et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 consequently the runoff factor represents the energy of the flow necessary to detach and transport the sediment 4 1 2 geomorphologic factors the geomorphologic factors which include soil properties topography land use and land cover support practices that might influence the dispersion splashing abrasion and transporting forces of rainfall and runoff have been accounted for by the soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover management factor cm and support practice factor ps in the musle model soil susceptibility to erosion agents is referred to as the soil erodibility factor k which indicates the vulnerability of the soil to detachment and transport driven by raindrops and runoff topographic factors ls influence the runoff characteristics and transport processes of sediment cover management factors cm control soil detachment and transport and vegetation cover may drastically reduce erosion rates by reducing the velocity of runoff and trapping sediment particles fang et al 2016 the support practice factor ps usually affects erosion by redirecting runoff around slopes thereby reducing erosivity or by mitigating runoff that causes deposition however the above factors assume that the entire basin is considered as a hillslope because the musle model is a modified version of the usle model based on hillslope erosion the usle model does not consider channel flow and sediment transport in the watershed and ignores the sediment transport rates to specify how much of the detached soil is transported to the catchment outlet for the proposed sediment yield method channel slope and length are the principal factors that reflect the influence of watershed characteristics on channel flow and sediment transport the exponents m of the t factor in the term of cs ms cl vary from 0 33 to 0 39 which indicated that the cs is positively and the ms and channel length l are negatively correlated with sediment yield table 3 the ratio of cs to ms can be explained by the degree of channel slope relative to the average watershed slope and the reason that ms is negatively correlated with sediment yield is that the slope gradient factor has been considered as a topographic factor the results indicate that sediment routing through channels depends on both the channel length from the most remote watershed location to the watershed outlet and the cs the contribution from stream channels might be expected to increase transport capacity therefore watersheds with steep css and short channel lengths may have a higher transport capacity and less routing time thus they can transport more eroded soil in the upstream areas through the channels and be delivered out of the watershed ouyang et al 2010 other research also confirmed these results for example de vente et al 2011 indicated that the cs had the most significant correlation with area specific sediment yield williams and berndt 1977 found that the average cs is more significant than other parameters in estimating the sediment delivery ratio which is expressed as a function of the percent slope of the mainstream channel onderka et al 2012 confirmed that the williams and berndt 1977 method of mainstream cs gradient based sediment delivery ratio estimation provides reasonable results in the case of adequate data 4 2 advantages and future perspectives the proposed sediment yield model integrated with the modified scs cn and creams methods has many advantages first the characteristics of the channel slope and length were considered in the musle model which can reflect the influence of watershed characteristics on channel flow and sediment transport second it meaningfully incorporates the temporal variability of antecedent soil moisture runoff and rainfall intensity which have a significant impact on runoff or peak discharge thereby eliminating the major shortcomings of the original scs cn and peak discharge models third a quantitative assessment of runoff and peak discharge is not trivial because of the scarcity of runoff and peak discharge records in ungauged watersheds pilgrim et al 1988 the proposed method the peak discharge method of shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method of shi et al 2021 could accurately predict event based sediment yield peak discharge and runoff respectively whereas the reasonable accuracy of the combined method was verified using the optimized parameters these enhancements would ensure that the combined method is useful for general applications under different hydrological and geomorphic conditions in the loess plateau region however there were several issues that require further investigation first recent developments in remote sensing dem and gis technology can help determine channel geometry and watershed geomorphology which can be used to apply simple and complex hydrological methods el hames 2012 al ahmadi and el hames 2009 second the proposed model can be applied to small ungauged watersheds in regions with similar hydrological and geomorphic conditions however large basins may need to be adjusted because channel characteristics and watershed geomorphology may differ from the experimental results in this study therefore it could be used as a sub model within comprehensive models such as the swat model 5 conclusions in this study a modified formula for determining sediment yield was developed by introducing a channel factor based on the musle model the reliability of the proposed method in sediment yield prediction was verified using datasets from 38 watersheds on the loess plateau and it was applied to the remaining five typical watersheds the results show that the proposed method exhibits significantly superior performance compared to the original musle model during calibration validation and application subsequently the proposed method was used to predict the sediment yield for the remaining five typical watersheds using the parameters resulting from the analysis of the initial 38 basins together with the runoff and peak discharge values estimated using the modified scs cn method and creams respectively large nse and rmse values were obtained for all five watersheds from the overall results the proposed sediment yield model combined with the modified scs cn method and creams was found to accurately predict the event based sediment yield runoff and peak discharge in the loess plateau region under various hydrological and geomorphic conditions credit authorship

2772,an accurate prediction of sediment yield at the watershed scale is critical not only for sustainable watershed management but also for improving knowledge regarding the relationship between sediment yield and its determinant factors which often rely on the varying model complexity in this study a modified sediment yield formula based on the modified universal soil loss equation musle model was developed by introducing a channel factor into the original formula the reliability of the proposed method was tested using data from 1 341 storm events in 38 watersheds and was applied to 256 storm events in five application watersheds using the optimized parameters results indicated that the proposed method is very accurate as demonstrated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 88 18 85 72 and 85 51 during calibration validation and application respectively the performance of the proposed model was superior to that of the original musle model subsequently the proposed

storage capacity of downstream reservoirs but also deteriorates the productivity of a watershed is an important consideration in the planning of watershed development shi and huang 2021 watershed management for soil and water conservation can reduce sediment transfer to channels and sediment loads in rivers by increasing sediment storage and reducing sediment mobilization thus increasing the probability of achieving clean water provisioning and sustainable livelihoods walling and fang 2003 chen et al 2007 quantifying sediment yield and identifying the major contributing factors are important for the effective and sustainable management of watersheds sediment yield prediction at the watershed scale is the scientific basis for land management decision making and is an important basis for accurately assessing control effects it is also a vibrant research field for conducting soil erosion studies nearing et al 2017 therefore it is critical to develop an effective sediment yield prediction model and reasonable and scientific soil conservation strategies on a watershed basis many process based and empirical models have been proposed to predict sediment yield process based models including the water erosion prediction project flanagan et al 2007 the griffith university erosion system template rose et al 1998 and the european soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 are characterized by different levels of complexity and require several parameter inputs however empirical models have advantages regarding the ease of application and simplified parameterization which have had an important role in predicting sediment yield shi et al 2021 the most widely used empirical models are the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised versions including the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard 1997 and the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 the usle was developed to estimate soil erosion at the plot and annual time scales therefore its application to storm wise sediment yields at the watershed scale may lead to substantial errors alewell et al 2019 the musle was developed as a watershed based model to estimate the sediment yield produced by each individual storm event replacing the rainfall factor from the traditional usle with a runoff factor as a function of runoff volume q and peak discharge qp williams 1975 many studies have evaluated musle globally under varying conditions sadeghi and mizuyama 2007 arekhi et al 2012 gwapedza et al 2018 2021 musle is also used as a sub model within established models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 the agricultural catchments research unit schulze and horan 2007 and the water quality systems assessment model hughes 2013 slaughter et al 2015 sediment yield is determined by geomorphologic and hydrological factors that can affect sediment detachment transport and deposition processes geomorphological research may have an important role regarding the development and implementation of sediment yield assessment tools and soil conservation measures renschler and harbor 2002 the geomorphological characteristics of watersheds may affect energy fluxes mass movement and sediment and water dispersion in watersheds zhang et al 2015 recently during the last few decades various studies and methodologies have been applied to investigate the correlation between geomorphological characteristics and sediment discharge numerous indices such as soil property topography land use and land cover support practice watershed and channel characteristics have been proposed to represent the geomorphologic characteristics of the watershed some researchers have used statistical methods and mathematical models to describe correlations between geomorphology and soil erosion cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in the original musle model the soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover management factor cm and support practice factor ps were adopted to reflect the effects of geomorphologic characteristics of soil properties topography such as slope length and steepness land use and land cover and support practice regarding sediment yield however few studies have considered channel characteristics that may reflect the sediment transport capacity in the musle model for sediment yield prediction this will be the focus of this study for the hydrological factors the product of runoff volume q and peak discharge qp is used in the musle model it is necessary to consider runoff and peak discharge models as components of the sediment yield model to study the sediment yield in ungauged or poorly gauged watersheds the natural resources conservation service formerly known as the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method scs 1972 is one of the most widely used models for estimating surface runoff during the past four decades many modified versions of the original scs cn model have been developed for various applications mishra et al 2008 sahu et al 2010 babu and mishra 2012 singh et al 2015 walega et al 2019 shi and wang 2020 for example lian et al 2020 adjusted the cn value by using observational data of rainfall runoff events from 55 research sites in china the results indicated that the revised cn value had better reference and guidance significance and was suitable for most natural conditions in china shi et al 2021 developed a revised cn value incorporating the impact of the temporal variability of key factors to improve the runoff prediction accuracy in small watersheds on the loess plateau many studies regarding the prediction of peak discharges have been conducted using the peak discharge equation of the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel 1980 fu et al 2008 liu et al 2017 shi et al 2022 similar to the scs cn model the peak discharge equation of the creams model was modified for example fu et al 2008 considered watershed area runoff and rainfall depth as variables based on 331 rainstorm data points from 20 small watersheds on the loess plateau in china shi et al 2022 modified the peak discharge formula based on the creams model by introducing rainfall intensity and soil moisture factors based on data from 1720 storm events within 45 watersheds to improve the accuracy of peak discharge prediction in small watersheds on the loess plateau to date no study has determined if the integration of these models into a framework can be used to improve the accuracy of storm based sediment yield prediction at the watershed scale for the loess plateau therefore the present study aimed to 1 modify the musle by exploring a new channel factor 2 compare the performance of the proposed method with the original musle model in terms of sediment yield prediction and 3 combine the modified musle model with the modified scs cn and creams models to predict

reaches of the yellow river and is one of the most erodible areas in the world fu et al 2004 tian et al 2016 fig 1 the loess plateau has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of

approximately 60 70 of annual precipitation occurs during rainy season from june to september which frequently occurs in form of heavy rain causing flooding and severe soil erosion intense erosion has formed many gullies fragmented landforms and unique geomorphic features of the loess plateau such as the tableland yuan ridges liang and hills mao based on existing sediment yield monitoring data for

43 experimental watersheds and the calibrated and validated methods were then applied to the five application watersheds to calibrate and validate the two methods the event based observed sediment yield dataset of each watershed was randomly divided into two subsets one for calibration and the other for validation the measured and estimated runoff and peak discharge were used in this study the measured surface runoff and peak discharge for each event were used along with eqs 1 3 to test the sediment yield prediction performance of the two methods during calibration validation and application the estimated surface runoff using the modified scs cn of shi et al 2021 and the predicted peak discharge using the modified creams method of shi et al 2022 were combined with the newly developed method to test the reliability of the coupled model for runoff peak discharge and sediment yield predictions in the five application watersheds in addition five parameters c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 of the modified peak discharge method and two parameters α and β of the modified scs cn method were determined using methods proposed by shi et al 2022 and shi et al 2021 respectively marquardt s 1963 algorithm was used to solve the constrained least squares problem for two parameters a and b of the original musle model and three parameters a b and m of the proposed model whereas the other parameters k ls cm ps in the two tested models were determined using the methods described below 2 6 1 soil erodibility factor k the mathematical approximation of the nomograph developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 was used to estimate the k factor which can be expressed as follows 9 k 2 1 10 4 m 1 14 12 o m 3 25 s t 2 2 5 perm 3 100 where m om st and perm represent the particle size parameter soil organic matter soil structure and permeability class respectively 2 6 2 topographic factor ls the topographic ls factor consists of the slope length and steepness factor the ls factor was determined using a dem in a geographic information system gis environment arcmap10 7 1 the raw data were considered as non depression and the slope and flow accumulation values obtained from the dem

look up tables wischmeier smith 1978 and weighting the cm factor values for each land cover category with the total area the sum of the weighted cm factor values was used as the average vegetation cover value for each watershed 2 6 4 support practice factor ps supporting practices usually affect erosion by reducing runoff around slopes thereby reducing erosivity or by mitigating runoff that causes deposition such as on concave slopes or barriers such as vegetation strips and terraced fields the lower the ps value the more effective the conservation practice is in reducing soil erosion in the absence of support practices the ps factor was 1 0 ps values can be obtained by image classification using remote sensing data previous studies and even expert knowledge in this study the ps factor was derived based on previous studies of similar watersheds on the loess plateau by qin et al 2009 and was weighted with the total area to obtain the average ps factor input for the musle model

plotted in fig 2 the original musle consistently underestimated the magnitude of large sediment yield events and overestimated the magnitude of most small sediment yield events with nse value of 78 45 and rmse value of 13 39 t ha 1 however compared with those of the original musle model most of the data points of the proposed model are closer to the 1 1 line where the estimated sediment yield is in good agreement with the measured sediment yield fig 2a b although the determination coefficients r2 of the two models were similar 0 88 for the proposed model and 0 86 for the original musle model the proposed model presented a superior performance thus yielding a larger nse value of 88 18 and a lower rmse value of 9 92 t ha 1 when compared with those of the musle model table 4 fig 3 verifies the superiority of the proposed method during the validation period with a higher slope of 0 65 compared with that of the musle model 0 51 moreover the proposed model still outperformed the original musle nse 73 00 in the validation period and its nse value was as high as 85 72 in general the proposed method was superior to the original musle method during the calibration and verification periods 3 2 model application 3 2 1 sediment yield model with measured runoff and peak discharge the two tested methods with the parameters optimized during calibration and validation were applied to the prediction of sediment yield in the remaining five typical watersheds the sediment yields predicted by the original musle model and the proposed model were plotted with the corresponding measured values of the five watersheds as shown in fig 4 table 5 shows the performance of the two tested methods in predicting sediment yield events for each watershed the original musle model continued to substantially underestimate the large and overestimated small sediment yield events table 5 however the proposed method s performance was superior to that of the original musle model for all five watersheds with increased nse values varying from 77 84 to 91 89 and most of the former data points were reasonably close to the 1 1 line fig 4b 3 2 2 sediment yield model with estimated runoff and peak discharge in the present study the runoff depths estimated by the modified scs cn method of shi et al 2021 and the peak discharge estimated by the modified creams model of shi et al 2022 were also incorporated into the proposed method to simulate event based sediment yield in the five application watersheds see table 6 fig 5 a shows a comparison of the measured and estimated runoff for the modified scs cn of shi et al s 2021 method although the rainfall runoff model underestimated some small runoff values most of the data points were near the 1 1 line and reasonable nse value of 71 21 and an rmse value of 1 78 mm resulted table 6 fig 5b compares the measured and estimated peak discharges using the coupled model of the peak discharge method of shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 although the peak discharge model also underestimated some small runoff values most of the data points were near the 1 1 line and reasonable nse value of 78 04 and an rmse value of 14 54 m3 s 1 resulted fig 5b these results indicate that the runoff predicted by the modified scs cn method and peak discharge predicted by the modified creams method can be combined with the newly developed model in this study to predict sediment yield events fig 5c compares the measured and estimated sediment yields using the coupled model of the proposed sediment yield method the creams method modified by shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 although most of the data points measured and predicted by the coupled model are not as close to the 1 1 line as those by the proposed method with a measured runoff and peak discharge the former still achieves an acceptable nse value varying from 61 88 to 81 42 and slightly less than the latter s range of 77 84 91 89 fig 5c these results show that the proposed sediment yield method combined with the scs cn method modified by shi et al 2021 and the creams method modified by shi et al 2022 can accurately predict the sediment yield when the measured runoff and peak discharge are unavailable 3 3 sensitivity analyses these results show that the newly developed method for sediment yield prediction is more accurate than the original musle model a proposed model sensitivity analysis is required to better identify the influence of the model parameters on model performance therefore the parameters a b and m were optimized using the full dataset of 43 watersheds and a sensitivity analysis was conducted by observing the influence of optimized parameter changes on the prediction of sediment yield by the model with nse value fig 6 shows the sensitivity of each parameter of the proposed method for sediment yield prediction the introduction in datasets did not substantially affect the fitting of the model which proved the robustness of the model n 1597 a 8 73 b 0 552 m 0 364 nse 86 12 in sensitivity analysis the sensitive parameter refers to the parameter whose model efficiency changes significantly when the parameter value changes around the calibration value from the sensitivity analysis of the results b was the parameter with the greatest sensitivity varying between 105 and 90 of the calibration value whereas the nse value decreased significantly from 86 12 to 57 90 the parameter a appeared to be the least sensitive in general the sensitivity of the model parameters from high to low was b a m fig 6 4 discussion an accurate prediction of sediment yield at watershed scales is critical not only for sustainable watershed management and effective implementation of beneficial management practices but also for improving knowledge regarding the relationship between sediment yield and its potential determinant factors which often rely on sediment yield models of varying complexity a total of 1597 events from 43 watersheds with varying hydrological and geomorphic factors within the loess plateau were used to verify the reliability of the proposed method for calibration validation and application the method achieved great success in all periods and showed good agreement between the estimated and measured sediment yield events when compared with the original musle model 4 1 impact factors of sediment yield at the watershed scale sediment yield is the integrated result of all erosion sediment transport and deposition processes operating in a watershed vanmaercke et al 2014 it detaches soil particles from its primary location and then transports these materials from the hillslope into the channel and propagates the sediments through the channel network toward the watershed outlet successful watershed management relies on understanding key sediment transport processes and their linkages beyond the channel reach as sediment transport varies both spatially and temporally at the watershed scale spatial variations in watershed environmental factors and the complexity of their combined patterns result in deposition and temporary or permanent storage of eroded sediment during the transport process shi et al 2014 sediment yield is determined by geomorphologic factors such as soil topography land use and land cover support practices and hydrological factors such as rainfall runoff and peak flow characteristics these phenomenon may affect sediment detachment transport and deposition processes de vente et al 2011 fryirs 2013 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 gonzález et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 therefore to improve sediment yield prediction accuracy the main control factors affecting the variability of the sediment yield should be considered 4 1 1 hydrological factors in terms of hydrological factors the most influential variables on sediment yield were the runoff and peak discharge characteristics there is a significant and positive correlation between sediment yield with the product of runoff volume in addition a significant and positive correlation was observed for and peak discharge with the exponents b and b varied from 0 42 to 0 55 for the two tested methods the exponent b and b values of 0 42 0 55 is less than the original value of the musle model 0 56 which may be related to the high sediment concentration in the loess plateau region indicating that the same runoff volume produces a higher sediment yield hou et al 2021 the 95 confidence intervals for the exponents b and b are equal to 0 41 0 43 and 0 54 0 56 respectively indicating that b and b are significantly lower than unity peak discharge qp is directly adopted to reflect the energy of flow necessary to detach and transport sediment which is an important runoff factor in the musle model whereas the runoff volume is directly used to represent the transport of sediments because of its large contribution to sediment transport by thin overland and channel flows gonzález et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 consequently the runoff factor represents the energy of the flow necessary to detach and transport the sediment 4 1 2 geomorphologic factors the geomorphologic factors which include soil properties topography land use and land cover support practices that might influence the dispersion splashing abrasion and transporting forces of rainfall and runoff have been accounted for by the soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover management factor cm and support practice factor ps in the musle model soil susceptibility to erosion agents is referred to as the soil erodibility factor k which indicates the vulnerability of the soil to detachment and transport driven by raindrops and runoff topographic factors ls influence the runoff characteristics and transport processes of sediment cover management factors cm control soil detachment and transport and vegetation cover may drastically reduce erosion rates by reducing the velocity of runoff and trapping sediment particles fang et al 2016 the support practice factor ps usually affects erosion by redirecting runoff around slopes thereby reducing erosivity or by mitigating runoff that causes deposition however the above factors assume that the entire basin is considered as a hillslope because the musle model is a modified version of the usle model based on hillslope erosion the usle model does not consider channel flow and sediment transport in the watershed and ignores the sediment transport rates to specify how much of the detached soil is transported to the catchment outlet for the proposed sediment yield method channel slope and length are the principal factors that reflect the influence of watershed characteristics on channel flow and sediment transport the exponents m of the t factor in the term of cs ms cl vary from 0 33 to 0 39 which indicated that the cs is positively and the ms and channel length l are negatively correlated with sediment yield table 3 the ratio of cs to ms can be explained by the degree of channel slope relative to the average watershed slope and the reason that ms is negatively correlated with sediment yield is that the slope gradient factor has been considered as a topographic factor the results indicate that sediment routing through channels depends on both the channel length from the most remote watershed location to the watershed outlet and the cs the contribution from stream channels might be expected to increase transport capacity therefore watersheds with steep css and short channel lengths may have a higher transport capacity and less routing time thus they can transport more eroded soil in the upstream areas through the channels and be delivered out of the watershed ouyang et al 2010 other research also confirmed these results for example de vente et al 2011 indicated that the cs had the most significant correlation with area specific sediment yield williams and berndt 1977 found that the average cs is more significant than other parameters in estimating the sediment delivery ratio which is expressed as a function of the percent slope of the mainstream channel onderka et al 2012 confirmed that the williams and berndt 1977 method of mainstream cs gradient based sediment delivery ratio estimation provides reasonable results in the case of adequate data 4 2 advantages and future perspectives the proposed sediment yield model integrated with the modified scs cn and creams methods has many advantages first the characteristics of the channel slope and length were considered in the musle model which can reflect the influence of watershed characteristics on channel flow and sediment transport second it meaningfully incorporates the temporal variability of antecedent soil moisture runoff and rainfall intensity which have a significant impact on runoff or peak discharge thereby eliminating the major shortcomings of the original scs cn and peak discharge models third a quantitative assessment of runoff and peak discharge is not trivial because of the scarcity of runoff and peak discharge records in ungauged watersheds pilgrim et al 1988 the proposed method the peak discharge method of shi et al 2022 and the scs cn method of shi et al 2021 could accurately predict event based sediment yield peak discharge and runoff respectively whereas the reasonable accuracy of the combined method was verified using the optimized parameters these enhancements would ensure that the combined method is useful for general applications under different hydrological and geomorphic conditions in the loess plateau region however there were several issues that require further investigation first recent developments in remote sensing dem and gis technology can help determine channel geometry and watershed geomorphology which can be used to apply simple and complex hydrological methods el hames 2012 al ahmadi and el hames 2009 second the proposed model can be applied to small ungauged watersheds in regions with similar hydrological and geomorphic conditions however large basins may need to be adjusted because channel characteristics and watershed geomorphology may differ from the experimental results in this study therefore it could be used as a sub model within comprehensive models such as the swat model 5 conclusions in this study a modified formula for determining sediment yield was developed by introducing a channel factor based on the musle model the reliability of the proposed method in sediment yield prediction was verified using datasets from 38 watersheds on the loess plateau and it was applied to the remaining five typical watersheds the results show that the proposed method exhibits significantly superior performance compared to the original musle model during calibration validation and application subsequently the proposed method was used to predict the sediment yield for the remaining five typical watersheds using the parameters resulting from the analysis of the initial 38 basins together with the runoff and peak discharge values estimated using the modified scs cn method and creams respectively large nse and rmse values were obtained for all five watersheds from the overall results the proposed sediment yield model combined with the modified scs cn method and creams was found to accurately predict the event based sediment yield runoff and peak discharge in the loess plateau region under various hydrological and geomorphic conditions credit authorship

2773,determining the maximum pumping rate i e the maximum allowable pumping rate that does not cause seawater intrusion into the well under the steady state condition of a well is the key for sustainable management of coastal aquifers as overexploitation of coastal aquifers could lead to the widespread occurrence of aquifer salinization i e seawater intrusion in this study we develop steady state analytical solutions to describe seawater intrusion and the maximum pumping rate of a well located in unconfined coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines rectangular coastal aquifers bounded by two orthogonal constant head boundaries i e two coastlines and two orthogonal no flow inland boundaries are assumed in conceptual models where replenishment of aquifers is via surface recharge analytical solutions are derived by the potential theory and the conformal mapping method and validated by variable density flow numerical simulations it is found that analytical solutions based on the sharp interface approximation overestimate seawater intrusion and underestimate the maximum pumping rate an acceptable conservative maximum pumping rate is obtained by using the correction factor proposed by lu and werner 2013 moreover the sensitivity of the well location on the maximum pumping rate is investigated showing that an optimal well location exists analytical solutions developed in the current study provide a convenient tool for assessing pumping effects in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines servicing to various management objectives keywords well pumping analytical solution l shaped coastal boundary maximum pumping rate data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the impact of groundwater pumping on seawater intrusion in coastal areas has received increasing attention in recent decades as overexploitation of coastal aquifers could lead to the widespread occurrence of aquifer salinization i e seawater intrusion various management strategies such as the injection extraction well system optimization of well placement and pumping rates and subsurface barriers have been proposed to enhance groundwater pumping under the threats of seawater intrusion park et al 2009 cheng et al 2000 lu et al 2013 shi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 determination of the freshwater seawater interface position requires that the flows in freshwater and interface zones are solved simultaneously to satisfy the continuity of pressure and flux though variable density flow numerical simulations are capable for exploring various complex scenarios the analytical method based on the sharp interface approximation has been widely employed to explore how groundwater pumping affect seawater intrusion for simplified coastal settings cheng et al 2000 koussis et al 2012 analytical solutions for seawater intrusion based on the density dependent system are only available for some simplified cases without pumping dentz et al 2006 bolster et al 2007 the benefit of the analytical method lies in the simplicity and speediness and hence it can serve as the first order assessment tool in addition the analytical method is a useful tool for theoretical studies as it can more easily reveal the underlying relationship between various variables the potential theory proposed by strack 1976 gives a simple analytical tool to calculate the maximum safe pumping rate i e the maximum allowable pumping rate that does not cause seawater intrusion into the well under the steady state condition of a single well in a semi infinite homogeneous coastal aquifer later on the analytical approach of strack 1976 has been extended to explore multiple well scenarios park et al 2009 derived the approximate maximum pumping rates or minimum injection rates to limit seawater intrusion to a prespecified distance from the coastline lu et al 2013 developed an analytical solution of the maximum net groundwater extraction rate for their proposed injection extraction well pair system in coastal aquifers recently shi et al 2020 explored analytically the performance of multiple well hydraulic barriers on enhancing groundwater extraction in a coastal aquifer where one extraction well and two or three injection wells are considered in addition to multiple well scenarios the analytical method has been employed to investigate the effect of boundary conditions on coastal groundwater pumping mantoglou 2003 developed analytical models of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers of finite size which are then used to determine the maximum pumping rates by means of an optimization methodology lu et al 2012 derived an analytical solution for evaluating maximum pumping rates in a domain with a constant head inland boundary condition where two lateral boundaries are considered at an infinite distance lu and luo 2014 extended the study of lu et al 2012 by assessing additionally the role of lateral boundaries using the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method together with complex variable techniques lu et al 2015 derived steady state analytical solutions for pumping in a rectangular aquifer with four different combinations of impermeable and constant head boundaries and the usefulness of their developed analytical solutions was demonstrated by an application to well pumping in a finite coastal aquifer despite these analytical studies mentioned above they exclusively consider a straight coastline in reality however a large number of bays promontories and estuaries constitute a colorful shape of coastline fig 1 shows the greek island of kalymnos which can be approximated as an l shape coastline aquifer actually l shaped coastline aquifers have been studied analytically to explore groundwater fluctuations under the tidal effects e g li et al 2000 li and jiao 2002 li et al 2002 nevertheless the analytical study on how groundwater pumping affects seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines is currently unavailable it is expected that this type of the coastal boundary would give rise to a significant effect on groundwater pumping in this study we aim to derive the steady state analytical solutions for the maximum pumping rate of a pumping well located in unconfined coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines analytical solutions are developed based on the potential theory together with our previous analytical solutions derived for pumping in a rectangular aquifer lu et al 2015 variable density flow numerical simulations are employed to validate the accuracy of developed analytical solutions 2 conceptual model we consider an isotropic homogeneous rectangular unconfined coastal aquifer with the hydraulic conductivity k l t the seaward boundaries constant head are two coastlines perpendicular to each other and the inland boundaries are two no flow boundaries e g groundwater divide bedrock or upthrown fault block of relatively impervious rock as shown in fig 2 a the x y axes have an origin at the horizontal impermeable basement of the aquifer where two coastlines meet with positive x and y along both coastlines the z axis is pointing upwards and the sea level is h 0 l above the aquifer basement a constant pumping rate qw l3 t from a fully penetrating well occurs at distances xw l and yw l from the two coastlines while spatially and temporally uniform recharge w l t occurs over the whole domain with length l l and width w l the densities of seawater and freshwater are ρs ml 3 and ρf ml 3 respectively to identify the region taking the density effect from the sea the section from the coastline to the pumping well is divided into zone 1 and zone 2 as shown in fig 2b freshwater flows to the sea above the seawater wedge in zone 1 also called interface flow while only freshwater can be found in zone 2 i e freshwater flow 3 derivation of analytical solution 3 1 potential theory for l shaped coastline aquifers the analytical solution for the water head in an l shaped coastline aquifer with pumping and uniform recharge can be solved by the superposition principle combining with the potential theory proposed by strack 1976 to apply the potential theory the following assumptions should be made 1 the mixing between seawater and freshwater is neglected leading to the sharp interface to separate both fluids in zone 1 see fig 2b 2 the toe location where the seawater freshwater interface intersects the impermeable boundary is given by employing ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 and 3 the freshwater flow is essentially horizontal and the vertical flow is negligible according to dupuit forchheimer assumption dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 employing the potential theory of unconfined aquifer the relation between the groundwater head h and the potential φ l3 t in this unconfined coastal aquifer can be expressed as equations 29 and 30 in strack 1976 1 φ 1 1 2 k 1 α h h 0 2 2 φ 2 1 2 k h 2 1 2 k 1 1 α h 0 2 where φ1 is the potential in zone 1 and φ2 in zone 2 α is the ratio of the freshwater density to the density difference between seawater and freshwater normally a value of 40 is taken h and h 0 are the piezometric head at x y and at the coastal boundary respectively therefore the groundwater head at the seawater wedge toe is given as 1 1 α h 0 obtained from the ghyben herzberg relation according to the superposition principle the potential φ is related to the head boundary well pumping and constant recharge koussis et al 2012 strack and ausk 2015 written as φ φ h φ q φ r where φ h l3 t φ q l3 t and φ r l3 t are the potentials corresponding to the three parts as mentioned obviously the constant head boundary in this conceptual model leads to φ h 0 the potential caused by recharge in such an l shaped coastline aquifer obeys the following governing equation 3 2 φ r w 0 x l 0 y w where 2 is the laplace operator this governing equation is a nonhomogeneous linear equation the corresponding boundary conditions are given by 4 φ r 0 y φ r x 0 0 5 φ r x x l φ r y y w 0 equations 4 and 5 indicate that they are linear boundary conditions the application of the double finite fourier sine transform is considered based on the governing equation and boundary conditions leading to the following expression for the solution 6 φ r m n 0 a mn sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w substituting equation 6 into 3 produces 7 m n 0 a mn λ mn 2 sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w w where λ mn 2 π 2 m π 2 l 2 π 2 n π 2 w 2 using the orthogonality of sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w in 0 l 0 w leads to 8 a mn 4 lw λ mn 2 0 l 0 w w sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w d x d y 16 w π 2 m π π 2 n π λ mn 2 substituting equation 8 into 6 derives the function of φ r lu et al 2015 has developed steady state analytical solutions for the discharge potential where a pumping well located in a fully bounded rectangular confined aquifer with no recharge using the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method according to this method the discharge potential φ q at x y in z plane for an l shaped coastline aquifer equals to the discharge potential ω l3 t at u v in conformal mapping w plane expressed as 9 ω q w 4 π ln u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 where uw and vw are the coordinates of the well location in w plane corresponding to the well location xw and yw in z plane the relation between point u v in w plane and x y in z plane can be given by 10 m s n x c m d n y c 1 m c n 2 y c 1 m m

cn and dn are the three kinds of jacobi elliptic functions representing sine cosine and delta amplitude elliptic functions and they can be evaluated by the built in functions of matlab m and c depend on the ratio of l to w it should be noted that the limitation of crowding problem needs l w varying between 1 10 9 and 10 9 1 howell and trefethen 1990 lu et al 2015 the derivation for this mapping method is shown in appendix a therefore substituting equations 10 11 12 and 13 into 9 the potential φ q equal to ω at x y in z plane can be given the potential φ for the l shaped coastline aquifer is now obtained since φ h φ r and φ q have been developed substituting the value of φ into equations 1 and 2 produces the groundwater head distribution h in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively 3 2 maximum pumping rate since the stagnation point of the extraction well is the critical location to distinguish the capture zone e g water in this zone will be extracted by the well the maximum pumping rate occurs when the seawater wedge toe coincides with this point theoretically strack 1976 an infinitesimal increase of pumping rate causes saltwater up coning to determine the maximum pumping rate the coordinates of the stagnation point should be found first for a given pumping rate qw the partial differentials of the total potential φ with respect to x and y equal to zero at the stagnation point that is 14 φ x x x s 0 15 φ y y y s 0 where xs and ys are the coordinates of the stagnation point note that multiple stagnation points may occur depending on the well location and extraction rate and when the well is close to the no flow boundary the stagnation point may occur at the no flow boundary the derivations of φ x and φ y are given in appendix b at the same time the potential at the stagnation point φ s xs ys is obtained by using the solution in section 3 1 substituting the head 1 1 α h 0 at the seawater wedge toe into equation 1 the potential at the toe location can be written as 16 φ toe 1 α k 2 α 2 h 0 2 using an iterative procedure with an increasing value of qw φ s gradually increases and finally the maximum pumping rate q max is determined when φ s φtoe 3 3 correction factor in reality a mixing zone develops between freshwater and seawater which leads to the analytical non dispersive solutions inconsistent with variable density flow numerical simulation results an empirical factor is proposed by pool and carrera 2011 to correct the density factor α and to overcome this issue the corrected density factor α is given as 17 1 α 1 α 1 α t b c where αt l is the transverse dispersivity and b l is the aquifer thickness the empirical exponent c proposed by pool and carrera 2011 is 1 6 which is based on the pumping situation in flux controlled confined aquifer systems and the corrected analytical result matches the saline portion between 50 and 75 contour lines lu and werner 2013 found that c of 1 4 is better for locating 10 seawater concentration in head controlled coastal aquifers for the comparison purpose both values of correction factors are considered in our study 4 numerical validation 4 1 description of case setup fig 3 shows three l shaped coastline aquifers with different domain sizes which are used to validate developed analytical solutions besides the square domain i e fig 3a l w 2000 m 2000 m named case s larger width domain i e fig 3b l w 1600 m 2000 m named case w and larger length domain i e fig 3c l w 2000 m 1600 m named case l are also considered to ensure the generalization of a rectangular model domain each case has six pumping locations with coordinates of location 1 604 606 location 2 500 500 location 3 604 500 location 4 404 404 location 5 500 404 and location 6 604 404 note that only one pumping well is considered at a time thus there are six pumping situations for each model domain resulting in that the total number of situations is eighteen the sea level h 0 in all cases is set to 30 m and the hydraulic conductivity k 5 m d is accepted seawater and freshwater densities ρs and ρf are 1025 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively the recharge rate w is set as 0 0005 m d which is a common precipitation recharge in many coastal areas e g guo and jiao 2007 werner et al 2013 4 2 numerical simulation setting analytical solutions developed are validated by numerical simulations using seawat 2000 langevin and guo 2006 to ensure the accuracy in simulation the grid péclet criterion voss and souza 1987 brovelli et al 2007 should be satisfied given as 18 pe v δ l d m α l v δ l α l 4 where dm l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient δl l the grid spacing and v l t the magnitude of the local seepage velocity the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity αl l and αt l are set as 4 m and 0 4 m respectively the grid size is 8 m long 8 m width and 3 m high resulting in an acceptable pe value of 2 92 considering that the porosity does not affect the steady state simulation e g robinson and werner 2017 it is set as 0 4 a typical value for unconfined aquifers in other numerical experiments lu et al 2009 bakhtyar et al 2013 the simulation scenario is divided into two steps including 100 000 days for the model running to a steady state without pumping and then pumping 150 000 days to reach a new steady state the salt concentration of seawater is constant and assigned as 35 kg m3 during the simulation head and salinity distributions are monitored to ensure that the steady state is achieved to find the maximum pumping rate various pumping rates are simulated until the steady average salinity in the extraction well is about 0 1 i e 35 mg l pool and carrera 2011 4 3 comparison of analytical and numerical results case s is taken as an example to show the comparison between numerical concentration contour lines and the analytical toe location as shown in fig 4 before pumping the toe location calculated by the uncorrected analytical solution i e the blue line overestimates significantly the seawater extent obtained by the numerical simulation see fig 4a owing to the neglect of seawater energy loss resulting from the convection process between seawater and freshwater cooper 1959 dausman et al 2010 as expected the improved analytical toe location with a dispersion corrected factor of 1 4 lu and werner 2013 and 1 6 pool and carrera 2011 are nearly match the 10 and 75 of seawater contour lines respectively after pumping the corrected analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 6 approaches 50 and 75 contour lines see fig 4b the analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 4 has a discernible difference in the toe location comparing with the 10 seawater contour line obviously the 10 contour line of the numerical result is closer to the well than the analytical result using the correction factor of 1 4 particularly at locations near the pumping well moreover we find that other simulation and analytical results for cases with different domain sizes and well locations have the similar tendency not shown here the maximum pumping rates from analytical and numerical methods for eighteen scenarios are shown in fig 5 a 5c the relative difference of the maximum pumping rate between the analytical q ana and numerical q num results is calculated by ηa n q ana q num q num and shown in fig 5d it is show that the corrected analytical solutions with either a factor of 1 4 or 1 6 improve the prediction accuracy in comparison with the uncorrected analytical solution for all cases analytical solutions with the correction factor of 1 6 overestimate the maximum pumping rates the overestimation of the maximum pumping rate using the correction factor of 1 6 has also been found by kopsiaftis et al 2019 by contrast uncorrected analytical solutions and analytical solutions based on the correction factor of 1 4 underestimate the maximum pumping rates from the angle of coastal groundwater management a conservative value is often taken in other words the correction factor of 1 4 is more acceptable 4 4 sensitivity analysis we choose the analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 4 to evaluate the maximum pumping rate of a well at different locations since case w and case l are symmetric with respect to x y the maximum pumping rates for the two cases are symmetric with respect to x y therefore we only show the results of case s and case w see fig 6 the red part in fig 6 indicates the initial seawater extent and thus no freshwater can be pumped at the location in this region it is found that the largest values of the maximum pumping rates are 1243 6 m3 d and 920 3 m3 d for case s and case w respectively indicating the significance of the domain size impact the larger domain size yields more abundant groundwater recharge hence leading to higher exploitation potential the sensitivity of the maximum pumping rate to the recharge for wells in case s is illustrated in fig 7 similar increasing tendencies are found for cases w and l not shown here as shown the maximum pumping rate is smaller for the well closer to the coastline decreasing from the symmetry axis to the coastline if the distance between the well and one no flow boundary is fixed see locations 1 3 and 6 in the y axis direction and locations 6 5 and 4 in the x axis direction a larger recharge rate results in a larger maximum pumping rate as expected 5 discussion the analytical solution proposed by strack 1976 provided a convenient approach for estimating the maximum pumping rate of a well in coastal aquifers with a straight coastline this analytical solution has been extended to assess the maximum pumping rate in coastal aquifers with either multiple wells injection and extraction wells or complex boundary conditions lu et al 2013 lu and luo 2014 lu et al 2015 shi et al 2020 l shaped coastlines are ubiquitous in real world coastal aquifers while the maximum pumping rate of a well in such aquifers is previously not available the analytical solution presented in the current study provides a simple tool for quantifying seawater intrusion and the maximum pumping rate in coastal aquifers with l shaped coastlines due to the dispersion effect there is a significant discrepancy between the uncorrected analytical solutions and numerical results however the empirical correction factor can greatly improve the accuracy of the analytical solution the developed analytical solution can be extended to estimate the maximum pumping rate of a well in a multiple well system by the superposition method given that the pumping rates of other wells are known for the optimization of the pumping rates of multiple wells optimization methods such as genetic algorithm and artificial neural network are required cheng et al 2000 for a given coastal aquifer setting the number and location of stagnation points caused by well pumping depend on the well location and the pumping rate the stagnation point can occur within the aquifer domain or and at the no flow boundary the critical stagnation point that first approaches the interface toe is either within the aquifer domain or at the no flow boundary leading to that the contour lines of the maximum pumping rate for a square aquifer domain are curvous see fig 6a while the corrected analytical solutions well agree with the numerical results there are a number of limitations that surround the model assumption first the heterogeneity of the aquifer is neglected while it exists in all real world aquifer systems second the aquifer is assumed to be recharged and extracted constantly and uniformly in reality however the temporospatial patterns of recharge and pumping occur third other transient factors such as tides waves and evapotranspiration are not considered despite these limitations the analytical solution developed offers a rapid assessment tool for first pass estimation of pumping effects in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines 6 conclusions analytical solutions of the maximum pumping rate for a pumping well located in an l shaped coastline aquifer have been derived in this study relying on the potential theory and previous analytical solutions derived for pumping in a rectangular aquifer variable density flow numerical simulations are carried out to validate the developed analytical solutions the results indicate that analytical solutions based on a sharp interface approximation generally overestimate seawater intrusion and underestimate the maximum pumping rate a more acceptable and conservative maximum pumping rate is obtained by using a correction factor proposed by lu and werner 2013 corrected analytical solutions provide a convenient tool for evaluating seawater intrusion and the maximum

2773,determining the maximum pumping rate i e the maximum allowable pumping rate that does not cause seawater intrusion into the well under the steady state condition of a well is the key for sustainable management of coastal aquifers as overexploitation of coastal aquifers could lead to the widespread occurrence of aquifer salinization i e seawater intrusion in this study we develop steady state analytical solutions to describe seawater intrusion and the maximum pumping rate of a well located in unconfined coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines rectangular coastal aquifers bounded by two orthogonal constant head boundaries i e two coastlines and two orthogonal no flow inland boundaries are assumed in conceptual models where replenishment of aquifers is via surface recharge analytical solutions are derived by the potential theory and the conformal mapping method and validated by variable density flow numerical simulations it is found that analytical solutions based on the sharp interface approximation overestimate seawater intrusion and underestimate the maximum pumping rate an acceptable conservative maximum pumping rate is obtained by using the correction factor proposed by lu and werner 2013 moreover the sensitivity of the well location on the maximum pumping rate is investigated showing that an optimal well location exists analytical solutions developed in the current study provide a convenient tool for assessing pumping effects in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines servicing to various management objectives keywords well pumping analytical solution l shaped coastal boundary maximum pumping rate data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the impact of groundwater pumping on seawater intrusion in coastal areas has received increasing attention in recent decades as overexploitation of coastal aquifers could lead to the widespread occurrence of aquifer salinization i e seawater intrusion various management strategies such as the injection extraction well system optimization of well placement and pumping rates and subsurface barriers have been proposed to enhance groundwater pumping under the threats of seawater intrusion park et al 2009 cheng et al 2000 lu et al 2013 shi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 determination of the freshwater seawater interface position requires that the flows in freshwater and interface zones are solved simultaneously to satisfy the continuity of pressure and flux though variable density flow numerical simulations are capable for exploring various complex scenarios the analytical method based on the sharp interface approximation has been widely employed to explore how groundwater pumping affect seawater intrusion for simplified coastal settings cheng et al 2000 koussis et al 2012 analytical solutions for seawater intrusion based on the density dependent system are only available for some simplified cases without pumping dentz et al 2006 bolster et al 2007 the benefit of the analytical method lies in the simplicity and speediness and hence it can serve as the first order assessment tool in addition the analytical method is a useful tool for theoretical studies as it can more easily reveal the underlying relationship between various variables the potential theory proposed by strack 1976 gives a simple analytical tool to calculate the maximum safe pumping rate i e the maximum allowable pumping rate that does not cause seawater intrusion into the well under the steady state condition of a single well in a semi infinite homogeneous coastal aquifer later on the analytical approach of strack 1976 has been extended to explore multiple well scenarios park et al 2009 derived the approximate maximum pumping rates or minimum injection rates to limit seawater intrusion to a prespecified distance from the coastline lu et al 2013 developed an analytical solution of the maximum net groundwater extraction rate for their proposed injection extraction well pair system in coastal aquifers recently shi et al 2020 explored analytically the performance of multiple well hydraulic barriers on enhancing groundwater extraction in a coastal aquifer where one extraction well and two or three injection wells are considered in addition to multiple well scenarios the analytical method has been employed to investigate the effect of boundary conditions on coastal groundwater pumping mantoglou 2003 developed analytical models of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers of finite size which are then used to determine the maximum pumping rates by means of an optimization methodology lu et al 2012 derived an analytical solution for evaluating maximum pumping rates in a domain with a constant head inland boundary condition where two lateral boundaries are considered at an infinite distance lu and luo 2014 extended the study of lu et al 2012 by assessing additionally the role of lateral boundaries using the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method together with complex variable techniques lu et al 2015 derived steady state analytical solutions for pumping in a rectangular aquifer with four different combinations of impermeable and constant head boundaries and the usefulness of their developed analytical solutions was demonstrated by an application to well pumping in a finite coastal aquifer despite these analytical studies mentioned above they exclusively consider a straight coastline in reality however a large number of bays promontories and estuaries constitute a colorful shape of coastline fig 1 shows the greek island of kalymnos which can be approximated as an l shape coastline aquifer actually l shaped coastline aquifers have been studied analytically to explore groundwater fluctuations under the tidal effects e g li et al 2000 li and jiao 2002 li et al 2002 nevertheless the analytical study on how groundwater pumping affects seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines is currently unavailable it is expected that this type of the coastal boundary would give rise to a significant effect on groundwater pumping in this study we aim to derive the steady state analytical solutions for the maximum pumping rate of a pumping well located in unconfined coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines analytical solutions are developed based on the potential theory together with our previous analytical solutions derived for pumping in a rectangular aquifer lu et al 2015 variable density flow numerical simulations are employed to validate the accuracy of developed analytical solutions 2 conceptual model we consider an isotropic homogeneous rectangular unconfined coastal aquifer with the hydraulic conductivity k l t the seaward boundaries constant head are two coastlines perpendicular to each other and the inland boundaries are two no flow boundaries e g groundwater divide bedrock or upthrown fault block of relatively impervious rock as shown in fig 2 a the x y axes have an origin at the horizontal impermeable basement of the aquifer where two coastlines meet with positive x and y along both coastlines the z axis is pointing upwards and the sea level is h 0 l above the aquifer basement a constant pumping rate qw l3 t from a fully penetrating well occurs at distances xw l and yw l from the two coastlines while spatially and temporally uniform recharge w l t occurs over the whole domain with length l l and width w l the densities of seawater and freshwater are ρs ml 3 and ρf ml 3 respectively to identify the region taking the density effect from the sea the section from the coastline to the pumping well is divided into zone 1 and zone 2 as shown in fig 2b freshwater flows to the sea above the seawater wedge in zone 1 also called interface flow while only freshwater can be found in zone 2 i e freshwater flow 3 derivation of analytical solution 3 1 potential theory for l shaped coastline aquifers the analytical solution for the water head in an l shaped coastline aquifer with pumping and uniform recharge can be solved by the superposition principle combining with the potential theory proposed by strack 1976 to apply the potential theory the following assumptions should be made 1 the mixing between seawater and freshwater is neglected leading to the sharp interface to separate both fluids in zone 1 see fig 2b 2 the toe location where the seawater freshwater interface intersects the impermeable boundary is given by employing ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 and 3 the freshwater flow is essentially horizontal and the vertical flow is negligible according to dupuit forchheimer assumption dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 employing the potential theory of unconfined aquifer the relation between the groundwater head h and the potential φ l3 t in this unconfined coastal aquifer can be expressed as equations 29 and 30 in strack 1976 1 φ 1 1 2 k 1 α h h 0 2 2 φ 2 1 2 k h 2 1 2 k 1 1 α h 0 2 where φ1 is the potential in zone 1 and φ2 in zone 2 α is the ratio of the freshwater density to the density difference between seawater and freshwater normally a value of 40 is taken h and h 0 are the piezometric head at x y and at the coastal boundary respectively therefore the groundwater head at the seawater wedge toe is given as 1 1 α h 0 obtained from the ghyben herzberg relation according to the superposition principle the potential φ is related to the head boundary well pumping and constant recharge koussis et al 2012 strack and ausk 2015 written as φ φ h φ q φ r where φ h l3 t φ q l3 t and φ r l3 t are the potentials corresponding to the three parts as mentioned obviously the constant head boundary in this conceptual model leads to φ h 0 the potential caused by recharge in such an l shaped coastline aquifer obeys the following governing equation 3 2 φ r w 0 x l 0 y w where 2 is the laplace operator this governing equation is a nonhomogeneous linear equation the corresponding boundary conditions are given by 4 φ r 0 y φ r x 0 0 5 φ r x x l φ r y y w 0 equations 4 and 5 indicate that they are linear boundary conditions the application of the double finite fourier sine transform is considered based on the governing equation and boundary conditions leading to the following expression for the solution 6 φ r m n 0 a mn sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w substituting equation 6 into 3 produces 7 m n 0 a mn λ mn 2 sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w w where λ mn 2 π 2 m π 2 l 2 π 2 n π 2 w 2 using the orthogonality of sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w in 0 l 0 w leads to 8 a mn 4 lw λ mn 2 0 l 0 w w sin π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w d x d y 16 w π 2 m π π 2 n π λ mn 2 substituting equation 8 into 6 derives the function of φ r lu et al 2015 has developed steady state analytical solutions for the discharge potential where a pumping well located in a fully bounded rectangular confined aquifer with no recharge using the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method according to this method the discharge potential φ q at x y in z plane for an l shaped coastline aquifer equals to the discharge potential ω l3 t at u v in conformal mapping w plane expressed as 9 ω q w 4 π ln u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 u u w 2 v v w 2 where uw and vw are the coordinates of the well location in w plane corresponding to the well location xw and yw in z plane the relation between point u v in w plane and x y in z plane can be given by 10 m s n x c m d n y c 1 m c n 2 y c 1 m m s n 2 x c m s n 2 y c 1 m 11 n c n x c m d n x c m s n y c 1 m c n y c 1 m c n 2 y c 1 m m s n 2 x c m s n 2 y c 1 m 12 u m 2 n 2 1 2 2 m n 2 m 2 n 2 1 2 13 v m 2 n 2 1 2 2 m n 2 m 2 n 2 1 2 where sn cn and dn are the three kinds of jacobi elliptic functions representing sine cosine and delta amplitude elliptic functions and they can be evaluated by the built in functions of matlab m and c depend on the ratio of l to w it should be noted that the limitation of crowding problem needs l w varying between 1 10 9 and 10 9 1 howell and trefethen 1990 lu et al 2015 the derivation for this mapping method is shown in appendix a therefore substituting equations 10 11 12 and 13 into 9 the potential φ q equal to ω at x y in z plane can be given the potential φ for the l shaped coastline aquifer is now obtained since φ h φ r and φ q have been developed substituting the value of φ into equations 1 and 2 produces the groundwater head distribution h in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively 3 2 maximum pumping rate since the stagnation point of the extraction well is the critical location to distinguish the capture zone e g water in this zone will be extracted by the well the maximum pumping rate occurs when the seawater wedge toe coincides with this point theoretically strack 1976 an infinitesimal increase of pumping rate causes saltwater up coning to determine the maximum pumping rate the coordinates of the stagnation point should be found first for a given pumping rate qw the partial differentials of the total potential φ with respect to x and y equal to zero at the stagnation point that is 14 φ x x x s 0 15 φ y y y s 0 where xs and ys are the coordinates of the stagnation point note that multiple stagnation points may occur depending on the well location and extraction rate and when the well is close to the no flow boundary the stagnation point may occur at the no flow boundary the derivations of φ x and φ y are given in appendix b at the same time the potential at the stagnation point φ s xs ys is obtained by using the solution in section 3 1 substituting the head 1 1 α h 0 at the seawater wedge toe into equation 1 the potential at the toe location can be written as 16 φ toe 1 α k 2 α 2 h 0 2 using an iterative procedure with an increasing value of qw φ s gradually increases and finally the maximum pumping rate q max is determined when φ s φtoe 3 3 correction factor in reality a mixing zone develops between freshwater and seawater which leads to the analytical non dispersive solutions inconsistent with variable density flow numerical simulation results an empirical factor is proposed by pool and carrera 2011 to correct the density factor α and to overcome this issue the corrected density factor α is given as 17 1 α 1 α 1 α t b c where αt l is the transverse dispersivity and b l is the aquifer thickness the empirical exponent c proposed by pool and carrera 2011 is 1 6 which is based on the pumping situation in flux controlled confined aquifer systems and the corrected analytical result matches the saline portion between 50 and 75 contour lines lu and werner 2013 found that c of 1 4 is better for locating 10 seawater concentration in head controlled coastal aquifers for the comparison purpose both values of correction factors are considered in our study 4 numerical validation 4 1 description of case setup fig 3 shows three l shaped coastline aquifers with different domain sizes which are used to validate developed analytical solutions besides the square domain i e fig 3a l w 2000 m 2000 m named case s larger width domain i e fig 3b l w 1600 m 2000 m named case w and larger length domain i e fig 3c l w 2000 m 1600 m named case l are also considered to ensure the generalization of a rectangular model domain each case has six pumping locations with coordinates of location 1 604 606 location 2 500 500 location 3 604 500 location 4 404 404 location 5 500 404 and location 6 604 404 note that only one pumping well is considered at a time thus there are six pumping situations for each model domain resulting in that the total number of situations is eighteen the sea level h 0 in all cases is set to 30 m and the hydraulic conductivity k 5 m d is accepted seawater and freshwater densities ρs and ρf are 1025 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively the recharge rate w is set as 0 0005 m d which is a common precipitation recharge in many coastal areas e g guo and jiao 2007 werner et al 2013 4 2 numerical simulation setting analytical solutions developed are validated by numerical simulations using seawat 2000 langevin and guo 2006 to ensure the accuracy in simulation the grid péclet criterion voss and souza 1987 brovelli et al 2007 should be satisfied given as 18 pe v δ l d m α l v δ l α l 4 where dm l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient δl l the grid spacing and v l t the magnitude of the local seepage velocity the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity αl l and αt l are set as 4 m and 0 4 m respectively the grid size is 8 m long 8 m width and 3 m high resulting in an acceptable pe value of 2 92 considering that the porosity does not affect the steady state simulation e g robinson and werner 2017 it is set as 0 4 a typical value for unconfined aquifers in other numerical experiments lu et al 2009 bakhtyar et al 2013 the simulation scenario is divided into two steps including 100 000 days for the model running to a steady state without pumping and then pumping 150 000 days to reach a new steady state the salt concentration of seawater is constant and assigned as 35 kg m3 during the simulation head and salinity distributions are monitored to ensure that the steady state is achieved to find the maximum pumping rate various pumping rates are simulated until the steady average salinity in the extraction well is about 0 1 i e 35 mg l pool and carrera 2011 4 3 comparison of analytical and numerical results case s is taken as an example to show the comparison between numerical concentration contour lines and the analytical toe location as shown in fig 4 before pumping the toe location calculated by the uncorrected analytical solution i e the blue line overestimates significantly the seawater extent obtained by the numerical simulation see fig 4a owing to the neglect of seawater energy loss resulting from the convection process between seawater and freshwater cooper 1959 dausman et al 2010 as expected the improved analytical toe location with a dispersion corrected factor of 1 4 lu and werner 2013 and 1 6 pool and carrera 2011 are nearly match the 10 and 75 of seawater contour lines respectively after pumping the corrected analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 6 approaches 50 and 75 contour lines see fig 4b the analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 4 has a discernible difference in the toe location comparing with the 10 seawater contour line obviously the 10 contour line of the numerical result is closer to the well than the analytical result using the correction factor of 1 4 particularly at locations near the pumping well moreover we find that other simulation and analytical results for cases with different domain sizes and well locations have the similar tendency not shown here the maximum pumping rates from analytical and numerical methods for eighteen scenarios are shown in fig 5 a 5c the relative difference of the maximum pumping rate between the analytical q ana and numerical q num results is calculated by ηa n q ana q num q num and shown in fig 5d it is show that the corrected analytical solutions with either a factor of 1 4 or 1 6 improve the prediction accuracy in comparison with the uncorrected analytical solution for all cases analytical solutions with the correction factor of 1 6 overestimate the maximum pumping rates the overestimation of the maximum pumping rate using the correction factor of 1 6 has also been found by kopsiaftis et al 2019 by contrast uncorrected analytical solutions and analytical solutions based on the correction factor of 1 4 underestimate the maximum pumping rates from the angle of coastal groundwater management a conservative value is often taken in other words the correction factor of 1 4 is more acceptable 4 4 sensitivity analysis we choose the analytical solution with the correction factor of 1 4 to evaluate the maximum pumping rate of a well at different locations since case w and case l are symmetric with respect to x y the maximum pumping rates for the two cases are symmetric with respect to x y therefore we only show the results of case s and case w see fig 6 the red part in fig 6 indicates the initial seawater extent and thus no freshwater can be pumped at the location in this region it is found that the largest values of the maximum pumping rates are 1243 6 m3 d and 920 3 m3 d for case s and case w respectively indicating the significance of the domain size impact the larger domain size yields more abundant groundwater recharge hence leading to higher exploitation potential the sensitivity of the maximum pumping rate to the recharge for wells in case s is illustrated in fig 7 similar increasing tendencies are found for cases w and l not shown here as shown the maximum pumping rate is smaller for the well closer to the coastline decreasing from the symmetry axis to the coastline if the distance between the well and one no flow boundary is fixed see locations 1 3 and 6 in the y axis direction and locations 6 5 and 4 in the x axis direction a larger recharge rate results in a larger maximum pumping rate as expected 5 discussion the analytical solution proposed by strack 1976 provided a convenient approach for estimating the maximum pumping rate of a well in coastal aquifers with a straight coastline this analytical solution has been extended to assess the maximum pumping rate in coastal aquifers with either multiple wells injection and extraction wells or complex boundary conditions lu et al 2013 lu and luo 2014 lu et al 2015 shi et al 2020 l shaped coastlines are ubiquitous in real world coastal aquifers while the maximum pumping rate of a well in such aquifers is previously not available the analytical solution presented in the current study provides a simple tool for quantifying seawater intrusion and the maximum pumping rate in coastal aquifers with l shaped coastlines due to the dispersion effect there is a significant discrepancy between the uncorrected analytical solutions and numerical results however the empirical correction factor can greatly improve the accuracy of the analytical solution the developed analytical solution can be extended to estimate the maximum pumping rate of a well in a multiple well system by the superposition method given that the pumping rates of other wells are known for the optimization of the pumping rates of multiple wells optimization methods such as genetic algorithm and artificial neural network are required cheng et al 2000 for a given coastal aquifer setting the number and location of stagnation points caused by well pumping depend on the well location and the pumping rate the stagnation point can occur within the aquifer domain or and at the no flow boundary the critical stagnation point that first approaches the interface toe is either within the aquifer domain or at the no flow boundary leading to that the contour lines of the maximum pumping rate for a square aquifer domain are curvous see fig 6a while the corrected analytical solutions well agree with the numerical results there are a number of limitations that surround the model assumption first the heterogeneity of the aquifer is neglected while it exists in all real world aquifer systems second the aquifer is assumed to be recharged and extracted constantly and uniformly in reality however the temporospatial patterns of recharge and pumping occur third other transient factors such as tides waves and evapotranspiration are not considered despite these limitations the analytical solution developed offers a rapid assessment tool for first pass estimation of pumping effects in coastal aquifers bounded by l shaped coastlines 6 conclusions analytical solutions of the maximum pumping rate for a pumping well located in an l shaped coastline aquifer have been derived in this study relying on the potential theory and previous analytical solutions derived for pumping in a rectangular aquifer variable density flow numerical simulations are carried out to validate the developed analytical solutions the results indicate that analytical solutions based on a sharp interface approximation generally overestimate seawater intrusion and underestimate the maximum pumping rate a more acceptable and conservative maximum pumping rate is obtained by using a correction factor proposed by lu and werner 2013 corrected analytical solutions provide a convenient tool for evaluating seawater intrusion and the maximum

upper half of ζ plane fig a1b and the vertex a is signed as infinity on the real axis the coordinates of the four vertices a b c and d in the ζ plane are ζ a ζ b 0 ζ c 1 and ζ d 1 m 0 m 1 the transformation equation is given by a1 z ζ c 1 1 ζ ζ 1 ζ 1 m d ζ c 2 where c 1 relates to the size of the rectangle and c 2 equals to zero when the vertex b is set as the origin in both plane i e z b 0 and ζ b 0 secondly the ζ plane is transformed onto the s plane fig a1c by letting ζ s 2 this transformation leads to the upper half of the ζ plane mapped to the quarter of the s plane the coordinates of the vertices are s a s b 0 s c 1 and s d 1 m 1 2 thus the transformation from z plane to s plane can be described as the following equation which is an incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind a2 z s c 1 1 s 2 1 m s 2 d s the distance between the vertices b z b 0 s b 0 and c z c l s c 1 is written as a3 l z c z b c 0 1 1 1 s 2 1 m s 2 d s similarly the distance between the vertices c z c l s c 1 and d z d l iw s d 1 m 1 2 is produced a4 iw z d z c c 1 1 m 1 1 s 2 1 m s 2 d s i c 1 1 m 1 s 2 1 1 m s 2 d s assuming that ms 2 1 m t 2 1 which leads to 0 t 1 when 1 s 1 m 1 2 equation a4 can be modified as a5 w c 1 1 m 1 s 2 1 1 m s 2 d s c 0 1 1 1 t 2 1 1 m t 2 d t thus parameters m and c subject to the following equations a6 0 1 1 1 s 2 1 m s 2 d s 0 1 1 1 t 2 1 1 m t 2 d t l w a7 c l 0 1 1 1 s 2 1 m s 2 d s the relation between the s plane and the z plane follows the inverse function of jacobi elliptic integrals that is a8 s s n z c where s m in and z x iy sn is the sine amplitude elliptic function thus the relation between m n in s plane and x y in z plane is obtained as a9 m s n x c m d n y c 1 m c n 2 y c 1 m m s n 2 x c m s n 2 y c 1 m a10 n c n x c m d n x c m s n y c 1 m c n y c 1 m c n 2 y c 1 m m s n 2 x c m s n 2 y c 1 m in which cn and dn are the cosine and delta amplitude elliptic functions respectively finally the s plane is mapped onto the w plane fig a1d to ensure the applicability of the superposition principle through the transformation equation w s 2 1 1 2 that is the constant head boundary and impermeable boundary are on the v axis and u axis of w plane respectively the coordinates of the vertices are w a w b i w c 0 and w d 1 m 1 1 2 the relation between m n in s plane and u v in w plane is a11 u m 2 n 2 1 2 2 m n 2 m 2 n 2 1 2 a12 v m 2 n 2 1 2 2 m n 2 m 2 n 2 1 2 appendix b derivation of the partials of φ with respect to x and y the potential φ for l shaped coastline aquifer considered is written as φ φ r φ q φ h φ h 0 thus the partial of φ with respect to x is given as b1 φ x φ r x φ q x where φ r x and φ q x have the following expressions b2 φ r x m n 0 8 w π 2 n π l λ mn 2 cos π 2 m π x 2 l sin π 2 n π y 2 w b3 φ q x q w

equations a11 and a12 u x and v x are expressed as b4 u x 1 4 γ 1 1 2 β β x α x b5 v x 1 4 γ 2 1 2 β β x α x where α m 2 n 2 1 β α 2 4m 2 n 2 γ 1 α β 1 2 2 and γ 2 α β 1 2 2 α x and β x are obtained from following two equations b6 α x 2 m m x 2 n n x b7 β x 2 α α x 8 m n 2 m x 8 m 2 n n x m x and n x are given by using jacobi elliptic functions b8 m x c n x c m d n x c m d n y c 1 m c c n 2 x c m

2774,river damming alters biogeochemical cycles in river continuum yet its effect on the biogeochemical behavior of riverine strontium sr is still unclear here we measured riverine 87sr 86sr in both dissolved and particulate phases and relevant parameters in karst cascade reservoirs of southwest china and simulated 87sr 86sr fractionation during biological processes through experimental incubation of model phytoplankton the results showed that the dissolved 87sr 86sr was rather homogeneous across the water body and nearly identical to inorganic particulate bound 87sr 86sr and reservoir sr mainly sourced from carbonate weathering however the dissolved sr concentrations were stratified and increased with depths of the reservoir water columns this stratification was likely caused by phytoplankton and the precipitation and dissolution of calcite with the stratified strength controlled by reservoir hydraulic loads a long term loads along cascade reservoirs thus could result in a significant increase in dissolved sr concentrations rather than 87sr 86sr the culture experiment indicated that the dissolved sr was massively captured by the phytoplankton during which insignificant 87sr 86sr fractionation occurred thus the 87sr 86sr of reservoir phytoplankton would conserve the dissolved 87sr 86sr the distinctly lower 87sr 86sr of phytoplankton than terrestrial organic particulates highlights its potential to distinguish autochthonous and allochthonous sources of reservoir particulate matter this study demonstrated that damming largely alters the elemental

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction strontium sr has four natural stable isotopes 84sr 86sr 87sr and 88sr in which 87sr is formed by radioactive 87rb after β decay yokoyama et al 2015 the 87sr 86sr ratio has been shown as a robust tracer of weathering processes blum and erel 1997 during the water rock interaction sr2 is released from the rock minerals into water imparting their 87sr 86sr values to the dissolved phases of water therefore the dissolved 87sr 86sr of rivers can be used to resolve weathering intensity types of source rocks e g carbonates and silicates climate and other factors affecting rock weathering in the basins galy et al 1999 négrel et al 2000 boral et al 2021 hydropower construction has developed rapidly since the industrial revolution and currently about 70 of the worldwide rivers are affected by damming grill et al 2019 as compared to natural rivers the dammed rivers are often characterized by clearer water higher temperature longer water retention time deeper channel larger phytoplankton biomass and stronger physical and chemical stratification of water columns thornton et al 1991 matzinger et al 2007 wang et al 2022 the damming thus has profoundly changed the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon in rivers syvitski et al 2005 poff et al 2007 xiao et al 2021 however it is unclear whether the cascade damming in rivers affects the geochemical behavior of sr here we hypothesized that the cascade damming could affect sr geochemical behaviors although previous studies showed that the dissolved 87sr 86sr of dammed rivers such as the la grande and nelson rivers had insignificant seasonality as compared with the undammed rivers such as the great whale river stevenson et al 2018 of particular notice phytoplankton play a critical role in driving the nutrient cycles of reservoirs han et al 2018 cui et al 2021 yi et al 2021 the incubation of marine brown algae showed that the assimilated sr in the algal extracts increased firstly and then recovered over time skipnes et al 1975 experiments on the coccolith cultures revealed a difference of up to 0 000294 for 87sr 86sr between 400 and 812 pco2 μatm müller et al 2018 however it is unclear whether 87sr 86sr fractionation occurs during the metabolic activity of freshwater phytoplankton in this study sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in dissolved and particulate phases carbon isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon δ13c poc and other relevant environmental parameters were measured in cascade reservoirs in the wujiang river and the xijiang river southwest china in addition a culture experiment with chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii a model freshwater phytoplankton is designed to understand the sr isotopic fractionation during biological adsorption and absorption of sr the main aims of this study are to evaluate the 87sr 86sr fractionation during biological processes and to understand the sources migration and transformation of different forms of sr in the reservoirs our insights on sr behaviors from these dammed rivers have important implications for understanding

parameters the average values of wt do concentration ph and chl a concentration of the surface waters were 19 56 c 8 40 mg l 8 00 and 7 68 μg l respectively table 1 generally wt do concentration and ph in the reservoirs showed similar average values to those in the inflowing waters whereas chl a concentration exhibited higher values in the former than in the latter the stratification of wt do ph and chl a occurred in the reservoirs except yt and dh and their stratified intensities varied among the reservoirs fig 2 the stratification generally began in spring got most intense in summer and disappeared in winter the average values of wt do concentration and ph of the wujiang main stream during the dry season were 14 90 c 9 24 mg l and 7 15 respectively although the average ph in 2019 was lower than that in 1999 average ph 8 29 there was no significant difference between 2019 and 1999 for the other basic parameters p 0 05 table 2 3 2 dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio the dissolved sr concentrations ranged from 0 48 to 16 10 μmol l with an average of 5 00 μmol l dissolved 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70704 to 0 71244 with an average of 0 70831 table 1 the dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr of reservoir surface waters were not significantly different from the inflowing river waters p 0 05 fig 3 a and b taken together dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr did not exhibit strong seasonality in a hydrological year however large seasonal variation occurred in the river waters i e in s4 s8 m4 p14 fig 3c and d the dissolved sr concentration showed seasonal stratification in the reservoirs typically being lower in the surface and higher in the bottom but the seasons of stratification varied among the reservoirs fig 3e 3f and 4a the reservoirs generally had low dissolved sr concentrations in wet season among all the reservoirs only the reservoir cst showed a weak stratification of 87sr 86sr in autumn fig 4 b the dissolved sr concentrations in the mainstream of the wujiang river during the dry season varied from 4 38 to 5 45 μmol l with an average of 5 00 μmol l the dissolved 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70778 to 0 70841 with an average of 0 70796 the current sr concentrations were significantly higher than those in 1999 p 0 05 whereas the difference in 87sr 86sr was no significant p 0 05 fig 5 b and table 2 3 3 the culture experiment the cell abundance of c reinhardtii and ph increased but dissolved sr concentrations decreased with the incubation time table s3 the removal efficiency of dissolved sr by c reinhardtii after 17 days were 87 89 92 89 and 82 respectively for different dissolved sr concentration treatments and a sharp decline of dissolved sr concentrations occurred at about the 15th day fig 6 according to the change of dissolved sr concentrations 87sr 86sr were determined at 0 9 and 17 days the dissolved 87sr 86sr was 0 70776 1 2sd n 45 and the algal 87sr 86sr was 0 70776 2 2sd n 45 3 4 sr and carbon isotopic compositions of suspended matter in the maotiao river the particulate bound inorganic 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70712 to 0 70838 with an average of 0 70784 table 3 the pim 87sr 86sr had no obvious seasonal variations in the reservoir profiles and showed similar values to the released waters but were different from the inflowing waters in the same season fig 7 a and c the pom 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70840 to 0 71448 with an average of 0 71082 the pom 87sr 86sr of the hf reservoir was significantly lower than those of the inflowing and released waters generally pom 87sr 86sr increased with water depths and was the lowest in spring and highest in summer fig 7a and d the poc concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 20 26 mg l with an average of 0 97 mg l table 3 the poc concentrations were significantly higher in the hf reservoir than those in the inflowing and released waters and decreased with water depths in spring and summer fig 7b and e the δ13c poc had a range from 28 76 to 39 55 with an average of 30 17 the δ13c poc of the inflowing waters was higher than those of the hf reservoir and released waters the δ13c poc in the reservoir was more positive in summer than in other seasons fig 7b and f 3 5 correlation analyses for the reservoir profiles the dissolved δsr was positively correlated with δsic and δph fig 8 a and c the dissolved δsr in summer was negatively correlated with the reservoir hydraulic load fig 8b the pim 87sr 86sr was significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 87sr 86sr in the maotiao river fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 migration of sr in dam reservoirs the dissolved load in the studied waters were mainly controlled by carbonate weathering based on the dissolved 87sr 86sr versus ca sr and dissolved 87sr 86sr versus hco3 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio fig 9 a and b the sancha river was mainly controlled by limestone dissolution whereas the upper reaches of the xijiang river was mainly influenced by dolomite dissolution fig 9b after river damming dam reservoirs develop and gradually exhibit limnological characteristics with a decrease of water flow and an increase in water depth kasper et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in the reservoir profiles the positive correlation between δsr and δsic indicated that crystallization in the surface and partial dissolution in the bottom affected dissolved sr stratification fig 4a and 7a this is consistent with the previous studies showing that calcite s behavior controls the transport of dissolved sr from surface to bottom in the lake profiles boehrer and schultze 2008 katz and nishri 2013 in the culture experiment the dissolved sr concentration in the se medium began to decrease dramatically when ph increased to 7 5 at the 12th day implying the capture of a lot of dissolved sr by phytoplankton in addition phytoplankton could provide nucleation sites for calcite stabel 1986 dupraz et al 2009 and photosynthesis can increase do concentration and ph in euphotic layer and thus enhance their stratifications in the reservoir profiles kotut et al 1999 yang et al 2020 these processes can enhance the difference in crystallization and dissolution of calcite in water profiles and finally create dissolved sr stratification generally the dissolved 87sr 86sr did not show stratification in the reservoir profiles however this is not the case for the cst reservoir in summer the constant values of dissolved sr concentration sr cl and sr na in the profile suggested that groundwater did not affect the reservoir dissolved 87sr 86sr fig s1 the carbonate dissolution has a great influence on dissolved 87sr 86sr tipper et al 2006 and the rapid dissolution of limestone could be the reason of decreasing dissolved 87sr 86sr at the reservoir bottom in summer however this abnormality in the cst reservoir had a limited impact on the dissolved 87sr 86sr at a river basin scale the significant positive correlation between pim 87sr 86sr and dissolved 87sr 86sr in the hf reservoir r2 0 82 p 0 01 suggests that pim sr was controlled by autogenous carbonate precipitation fig 8d therefore differences in dissolved 87sr 86sr between the inflowing and released waters can result in the corresponding differences in their pim 87sr 86sr fig 7a table 3 this is supported by the observation that reservoir particulate inorganic carbon is derived from autogenous inorganic carbon li et al 2021 riverine pom can be divided into exogenous and autogenous pom the former is from terrestrial soil and plant residue while the latter from phytoplankton bird et al 1998 han et al 2018 the culture experiment demonstrated that there is no fractionation during phytoplankton metabolic activity table s3 therefore phytoplankton 87sr 86sr will inherit ambient dissolved 87sr 86sr value phytoplankton can obtain dissolved sr by absorption and adsorption rice 1956 he and chen 2014 niedermeier et al 2018 in the hf reservoir the negative δ13c poc and high poc concentration indicated that phytoplankton were the dominant sources of pom fig 7 keil et al 1997 xiao et al 2021 correspondingly pom 87sr 86sr usually showed similar values to the dissolved 87sr 86sr which is consistent with the result of culture experiment in summer phytoplankton biomass increases considerably in the euphotic layer of reservoir and phytoplankton operate co2 concentrating mechanism to offset the lack of co2 and thus have comparatively positive δ13c wang et al 2018 in response pom 87sr 86sr showed an obvious stratification and was constrained by phytoplankton in the upper euphotic layer and by terrestrial pom in the lower layer in the hf reservoir fig 7a and d all these evidences demonstrated that phytoplankton play an important role in reservoir sr migration 4 2 effect of damming on riverine sr geochemical behavior damming first alters riverine hydrological conditions and ensures a relatively stable water level for dam reservoirs by artificial regulation of runoffs reservoir hydrological conditions are a prerequisite for the formation of their ecosystems and hydraulic load a parameter involving water retention time and depth is a key factor controlling reservoir physical chemical and biological stratifications wang et al 2022 similarly reservoir hydraulic load regulates the stratification of dissolved sr concentration and a reservoir with a longer retention time has a larger difference in dissolved sr concentration in the water profile in summer table s1 and fig 7c and 8b river damming decreases the seasonal variation in dissolved sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios table 2 or fig 3 however the dissolved sr tends to exhibit non conservative behavior in dam reservoirs and the 87sr 86sr ca sr relationship indicates that the reservoir and released waters deviated somewhat from the inflowing waters fig 9a the non conservative behavior of ca after river damming has been reported dill and henjes kunst 2007 gao et al 2013 therefore interpretations regarding on rock weathering at a river basin scale using 87sr 86sr and concentrations of dissolved sr ca and bicarbonate from dam reservoirs should be treated with caution in addition dam reservoirs can impound dissolved sr and this causes higher dissolved sr concentrations at present than ten years before in the wujiang river fig 5 therefore the long term cumulative effect of dam reservoirs on riverine dissolved sr should not be ignored the dissolved sr has higher concentrations than sr contained in particulate matter in rivers douglas et al 1995 jones et al 2012 and the dissolved 87sr 86sr is thus not affected by pom 87sr 86sr river pom 87sr 86sr was usually high and positively correlated with δ13c poc fig 5c implying a constraint from different sources of terrigenous plant residues and phytoplankton after river damming the contribution of phytoplankton to total pom increases dramatically and has a seasonal variation since phytoplankton 87sr 86sr inherited the lower values of dissolved 87sr 86sr the pom 87sr 86sr showed a seasonal change more surface runoffs with terrigenous pom into the reservoirs can cause higher pom 87sr 86sr in summer whereas in winter the dominant contribution of phytoplankton to reservoir pom makes pom 87sr 86sr lower and closer to the dissolved 87sr 86sr fig 5c this finding provides a potential to trace the contribution of phytoplankton to the total pom as the overlap of signals from different organic matter cannot be avoided when using δ13c and c n techniques lamb et al 2006 brodie et al 2011 5 conclusions damming can affect the riverine sr geochemical distribution generally the dissolved sr concentrations showed seasonal stratification and increased with depths during stratification but dissolved 87sr 86sr did not in the studied reservoirs the reservoir hydraulic loads controlled the difference in dissolved sr concentrations in the reservoir profiles dam reservoirs can impound dissolved sr and the long term cumulative effect on riverine dissolved sr should not be ignored the culture experiment indicated that large amounts of dissolved sr were captured by phytoplankton during which insignificant 87sr 86sr fractionation occurred reservoir phytoplankton 87sr 86sr would inherit dissolved 87sr 86sr value and differ from terrestrial particulate organic 87sr 86sr which provides a potential to trace the

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction strontium sr has four natural stable isotopes 84sr 86sr 87sr and 88sr in which 87sr is formed by radioactive 87rb after β decay yokoyama et al 2015 the 87sr 86sr ratio has been shown as a robust tracer of weathering processes blum and erel 1997 during the water rock interaction sr2 is released from the rock minerals into water imparting their 87sr 86sr values to the dissolved phases of water therefore the dissolved 87sr 86sr of rivers can be used to resolve weathering intensity types of source rocks e g carbonates and silicates climate and other factors affecting rock weathering in the basins galy et al 1999 négrel et al 2000 boral et al 2021 hydropower construction has developed rapidly since the industrial revolution and currently about 70 of the worldwide rivers are affected by damming grill et al 2019 as compared to natural rivers the dammed rivers are often characterized by clearer water higher temperature longer water retention time deeper channel larger phytoplankton biomass and stronger physical and chemical stratification of water columns thornton et al 1991 matzinger et al 2007 wang et al 2022 the damming thus has profoundly changed the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon in rivers syvitski et al 2005 poff et al 2007 xiao et al 2021 however it is unclear whether the cascade damming in rivers affects the geochemical behavior of sr here we hypothesized that the cascade damming could affect sr geochemical behaviors although previous studies showed that the dissolved 87sr 86sr of dammed rivers such as the la grande and nelson rivers had insignificant seasonality as compared with the undammed rivers such as the great whale river stevenson et al 2018 of particular notice phytoplankton play a critical role in driving the nutrient cycles of reservoirs han et al 2018 cui et al 2021 yi et al 2021 the incubation of marine brown algae showed that the assimilated sr in the algal extracts increased firstly and then recovered over time skipnes et al 1975 experiments on the coccolith cultures revealed a difference of up to 0 000294 for 87sr 86sr between 400 and 812 pco2 μatm müller et al 2018 however it is unclear whether 87sr 86sr fractionation occurs during the metabolic activity of freshwater phytoplankton in this study sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in dissolved and particulate phases carbon isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon δ13c poc and other relevant environmental parameters were measured in cascade reservoirs in the wujiang river and the xijiang river southwest china in addition a culture experiment with chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii a model freshwater phytoplankton is designed to understand the sr isotopic fractionation during biological adsorption and absorption of sr the main aims of this study are to evaluate the 87sr 86sr fractionation during biological processes and to understand the sources migration and transformation of different forms of sr in the reservoirs our insights on sr behaviors from these dammed rivers have important implications for understanding

ph in the reservoirs showed similar average values to those in the inflowing waters whereas chl a concentration exhibited higher values in the former than in the latter the stratification of wt do ph

disappeared in winter the average values of wt do concentration and ph of the wujiang main stream during the dry season were 14 90 c 9 24 mg l and 7 15 respectively although the average ph in 2019 was lower than that in 1999 average ph 8 29 there was no significant difference between 2019 and 1999 for the other basic parameters p 0 05 table 2 3 2 dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio the dissolved sr concentrations ranged from 0 48 to 16 10 μmol l with an average of 5 00 μmol l dissolved 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70704 to 0 71244 with an average of 0 70831 table 1 the dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr of reservoir surface waters were not significantly different from the inflowing river waters p 0 05 fig 3 a and b taken together dissolved sr concentration and 87sr 86sr did not exhibit strong seasonality in a hydrological year however large seasonal variation occurred in the river waters i e in s4 s8 m4 p14 fig 3c and d the dissolved sr concentration showed seasonal stratification in the reservoirs typically being lower in the surface and higher in the bottom but the seasons of stratification varied among the reservoirs fig 3e 3f and 4a the reservoirs generally had low dissolved sr concentrations in wet season among all the reservoirs only the reservoir cst showed a weak stratification of 87sr 86sr in autumn fig 4 b the dissolved sr concentrations in the mainstream of the wujiang river during the dry season varied from 4 38 to 5 45 μmol l with an average of 5 00 μmol l the dissolved 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70778 to 0 70841 with an average of 0 70796 the current sr concentrations were significantly higher than those in 1999 p 0 05 whereas the difference in 87sr 86sr was no significant p 0 05 fig 5 b and table 2 3 3 the culture experiment the cell abundance of c reinhardtii and ph increased but dissolved sr concentrations decreased with the incubation time table s3 the removal efficiency of dissolved sr by c reinhardtii after 17 days were 87 89 92 89 and 82 respectively for different dissolved sr concentration treatments and a sharp decline of dissolved sr concentrations occurred at about the 15th day fig 6 according to the change of dissolved sr concentrations 87sr 86sr were determined at 0 9 and 17 days the dissolved 87sr 86sr was 0 70776 1 2sd n 45 and the algal 87sr 86sr was 0 70776 2 2sd n 45 3 4 sr and carbon isotopic compositions of suspended matter in the maotiao river the particulate bound inorganic 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70712 to 0 70838 with an average of 0 70784 table 3 the pim 87sr 86sr had no obvious seasonal variations in the reservoir profiles and showed similar values to the released waters but were different from the inflowing waters in the same season fig 7 a and c the pom 87sr 86sr ranged from 0 70840 to 0 71448 with an average of 0 71082 the pom 87sr 86sr of the hf reservoir was significantly lower than those of the inflowing and released waters generally pom 87sr 86sr increased with water depths and was the lowest in spring and highest in summer fig 7a and d the poc concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 20 26 mg l with an average of 0 97 mg l table 3 the poc concentrations were significantly higher in the hf reservoir than those in the inflowing and released waters and decreased with water depths in spring and summer fig 7b and e the δ13c poc had a range from 28 76 to 39 55 with an average of 30 17 the δ13c poc of the inflowing waters was higher than those of the hf reservoir and released waters the δ13c poc in the reservoir was more positive in summer than in other seasons fig 7b and f 3 5 correlation analyses for the reservoir profiles the dissolved δsr was positively correlated with δsic and δph fig 8 a and c the dissolved δsr in summer was negatively correlated with the reservoir hydraulic load fig 8b the pim 87sr 86sr was significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 87sr 86sr in the maotiao river fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 migration of sr in dam reservoirs the dissolved load in the studied waters were mainly controlled by carbonate weathering based on the dissolved 87sr 86sr versus ca sr and dissolved 87sr 86sr versus hco3 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio fig 9 a and b the sancha river was mainly controlled by limestone dissolution whereas the upper reaches of the xijiang river was mainly influenced by dolomite dissolution fig 9b after river damming dam reservoirs develop and gradually exhibit limnological characteristics with a decrease of water flow and an increase in water depth kasper et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in the reservoir profiles the positive correlation between δsr and δsic indicated that crystallization in the surface and partial dissolution in the bottom affected dissolved sr stratification fig 4a and 7a this is consistent with the previous studies showing that calcite s behavior controls the transport of dissolved sr from surface to bottom in the lake profiles boehrer and schultze 2008 katz and nishri 2013 in the culture experiment the dissolved sr concentration in the se medium began to decrease dramatically when ph increased to 7 5 at the 12th day implying the capture of a lot of dissolved sr by phytoplankton in addition phytoplankton could provide nucleation sites for calcite stabel 1986 dupraz et al 2009 and photosynthesis can increase do concentration and ph in euphotic layer and thus enhance their stratifications in the reservoir profiles kotut et al 1999 yang et al 2020 these processes can enhance the difference in crystallization and dissolution of calcite in water profiles and finally create dissolved sr stratification generally the dissolved 87sr 86sr did not show stratification in the reservoir profiles however this is not the case for the cst reservoir in summer the constant values of dissolved sr concentration sr cl and sr na in the profile suggested that groundwater did not affect the reservoir dissolved 87sr 86sr fig s1 the carbonate dissolution has a great influence on dissolved 87sr 86sr tipper et al 2006 and the rapid dissolution of limestone could be the reason of decreasing dissolved 87sr 86sr at the reservoir bottom in summer however this abnormality in the cst reservoir had a limited impact on the dissolved 87sr 86sr at a river basin scale the significant positive correlation between pim 87sr 86sr and dissolved 87sr 86sr in the hf reservoir r2 0 82 p 0 01 suggests that pim sr was controlled by autogenous carbonate precipitation fig 8d therefore differences in dissolved 87sr 86sr between the inflowing and released waters can result in the corresponding differences in their pim 87sr 86sr fig 7a table 3 this is supported by the observation that reservoir particulate inorganic carbon is derived from autogenous inorganic carbon li et al 2021 riverine pom can be divided into exogenous and autogenous pom the former is from terrestrial soil and plant residue while the latter from phytoplankton bird et al 1998 han et al 2018 the culture experiment demonstrated that there is no fractionation during phytoplankton metabolic activity table s3 therefore phytoplankton 87sr 86sr will inherit ambient dissolved 87sr 86sr value phytoplankton can obtain dissolved sr by absorption and adsorption rice 1956 he and chen 2014 niedermeier et al 2018 in the hf reservoir the negative δ13c poc and high poc concentration indicated that phytoplankton were the dominant sources of pom fig 7 keil et al 1997 xiao et al 2021 correspondingly pom 87sr 86sr usually showed similar values to the dissolved 87sr 86sr which is consistent with the result of culture experiment in summer phytoplankton biomass increases considerably in the euphotic layer of reservoir and phytoplankton operate co2 concentrating mechanism to offset the lack of co2 and thus have comparatively positive δ13c wang et al 2018 in response pom 87sr 86sr showed an obvious stratification and was constrained by phytoplankton in the upper euphotic layer and by terrestrial pom in the lower layer in the hf reservoir fig 7a and d all these evidences demonstrated that phytoplankton play an important role in reservoir sr migration 4 2 effect of damming on riverine sr geochemical behavior damming first alters riverine hydrological conditions and ensures a relatively stable water level for dam reservoirs by artificial regulation of runoffs reservoir hydrological conditions are a prerequisite for the formation of their ecosystems and hydraulic load a parameter involving water retention time and depth is a key factor controlling reservoir physical chemical and biological stratifications wang et al 2022 similarly reservoir hydraulic load regulates the stratification of dissolved sr concentration and a reservoir with a longer retention time has a larger difference in dissolved sr concentration in the water profile in summer table s1 and fig 7c and 8b river damming decreases the seasonal variation in dissolved sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios table 2 or fig 3 however the dissolved sr tends to exhibit non conservative behavior in dam reservoirs and the 87sr 86sr ca sr relationship indicates that the reservoir and released waters deviated somewhat from the inflowing waters fig 9a the non conservative behavior of ca after river damming has been reported dill and henjes kunst 2007 gao et al 2013 therefore interpretations regarding on rock weathering at a river basin scale using 87sr 86sr and concentrations of dissolved sr ca and bicarbonate from dam reservoirs should be treated with caution in addition dam reservoirs can impound dissolved sr and this causes higher dissolved sr concentrations at present than ten years before in the wujiang river fig 5 therefore the long term cumulative effect of dam reservoirs on riverine dissolved sr should not be ignored the dissolved sr has higher concentrations than sr contained in particulate matter in rivers douglas et al 1995 jones et al 2012 and the dissolved 87sr 86sr is thus not affected by pom 87sr 86sr river pom 87sr 86sr was usually high and positively correlated with δ13c poc fig 5c implying a constraint from different sources of terrigenous plant residues and phytoplankton after river damming the contribution of phytoplankton to total pom increases dramatically and has a seasonal variation since phytoplankton 87sr 86sr inherited the lower values of dissolved 87sr 86sr the pom 87sr 86sr showed a seasonal change more surface runoffs with terrigenous pom into the reservoirs can cause higher pom 87sr 86sr in summer whereas in winter the dominant contribution of phytoplankton to reservoir pom makes pom 87sr 86sr lower and closer to the dissolved 87sr 86sr fig 5c this finding provides a potential to trace the contribution of phytoplankton to the total pom as the overlap of signals from different organic matter cannot be avoided when using δ13c and c n techniques lamb et al 2006 brodie et al 2011 5 conclusions damming can affect the riverine sr geochemical distribution generally the dissolved sr concentrations showed seasonal stratification and increased with depths during stratification but dissolved 87sr 86sr did not in the studied reservoirs the reservoir hydraulic loads controlled the difference in dissolved sr concentrations in the reservoir profiles dam reservoirs can impound dissolved sr and the long term cumulative effect on riverine dissolved sr should not be ignored the culture experiment indicated that large amounts of dissolved sr were captured by phytoplankton during which insignificant 87sr 86sr fractionation occurred reservoir phytoplankton 87sr 86sr would inherit dissolved 87sr 86sr value and differ from terrestrial particulate organic 87sr 86sr which provides a potential to trace the contribution of phytoplankton to the total pom in dam reservoirs this study deepens the understanding of sr biogeochemistry in dammed rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
