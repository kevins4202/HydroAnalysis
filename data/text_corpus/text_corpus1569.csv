7845,study region the santa ana river middle reach a small coastal urban catchment in southern california usa experiences a mediterranean climate and lowflows dominated by wastewater effluent study focus river macroplastic flux can inform watershed management of plastic pollution however continuous macroplastic monitoring is not possible so concentrations must be predicted during unobserved periods we monitored macroplastic concentration and aimed to improve macroplastic flux estimation using strategies commonly employed in estimating mineral sediment flux new hydrological insights for the region floating macroplastic size distributions were statistically equivalent between lowflow and stormflow samples evidence that channel processes controlled macroplastic size distribution or macroplastic size distributions outside the channel were the same as inside concentrations fell during the falling limb of one hydrograph and rose during the rising limb of another hydrograph a generalized additive model gam revealed that macroplastic concentration increased in response to small discharge increases but decreased for the largest discharges macroplasitc depletion relative to discharge occurs at high flow magnitudes or during the falling limb the annual mass flux of floating macroplastic was 27 4 2 8 84 8 tonnes1yr 1 or 18 2 2 9 222 2 tonnes1yr 1 as predicted using mean concentration or the gam respectively with little data the mean concentration approach may be appropriate but likely underestimates uncertainty which will require extensive monitoring to reduce

io mrey8 1 introduction rivers are highly contaminated by plastic pollution and are the major conveyance of plastic from land to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 river plastic flux plastic quantity discharged per unit time is a key variable in interpreting the magnitude of plastic transport to downriver ecosystems the pollution at the study location and changes in the magnitude of upriver plastic sources schmidt et al 2017 watkins et al 2019 macroplastic 5 mm is known to make up most of the mass of plastic in the environment and break down to form many more abundant microplastics particles 5 mm lebreton et al 2018 moore et al 2011 rigorous estimates of river macroplastic flux are critical for addressing the global crisis of plastic pollution bai et al 2021 but has been much less studied than microplastic flux van emmerik 2021 river macroplastic flux is typically quantified by multiplying river discharge m3s 1 by macroplastic concentrations count or mass1m 3 continuous river stage m measurements are available in many locations within the united states and are periodically calibrated to discharge m3s 1 velocity m1s 1 depth m and other river flow characteristics by the united states geological survey usgs however no methods to continuously monitor river macroplastic concentration are currently in use one needs to make predictions about unobserved macroplastic concentrations to quantify macroplastic flux mineral sediment transport has a long history of research and can inform strategies for studying plastic transport waldschl√§ger et al 2022 unobserved concentrations of fluvial particulate matter are often predicted using discharge regime hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and rating curves fit to river discharge gray 2018 rose et al 2018 walling 1977 changes in discharge reflect combined changes in the supply and transport of water to the monitoring stations and affect changes in the river s transport properties e g turbulence velocity depth the ratio between the flux of water and the flux of particulates at any moment is reflected in the average concentration of the particulate in the flow multiple orders of magnitude of variability around the concentration discharge rating curves are typical particularly in the small mountainous rivers characteristic of coastal california gray 2018 this variability is due in part to stochastic processes like storm sequence east et al 2018 spatio temporal characteristics aguilera and melack 2018 and antecedent watershed conditions fisher et al 2021 gray et al 2015 warrick and rubin 2007 which can cause changes in the processes controlling water and sediment delivery and routing gray et al 2014 temporal structure to this variability can manifest in concentration discharge relationships from hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior williams 1989 i e different rising vs falling limb concentration discharge relationships to interdecadal scale trends gray 2018 warrick et al 2013 a first flush event is common for sediment whereby high concentrations are flushed during the first large storm event of the year sansalone john j and cristina chad m 2004 the particle size distribution of the suspended load may shift with hydrologic mode stormflow lowflow and can be diagnostic of sources and transport pathways of mineral sediment li yingxia et al 2005 slattery and burt 1997 investigating temporal patterns in concentration discharge relationships can provide insight into transport and supply processes and be used to refine flux estimation farnsworth and milliman 2003 gray et al 2014 warrick and rubin 2007 we build from these foundations of fluvial sediment concentration discharge relationships to advance the fundamentals of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships early research on plastic pollution suggested that macroplastic concentration discharge relationships should be considered in estimating plastic discharge from rivers river macroplastic count to mass ratios were assumed constant in literature van emmerik et al 2019 despite changes in hydrological mode suggesting stable particle size distributions but changes in macroplastic size distributions have not been tested our first aim was to test the hypothesis that macroplastic size distributions were stable regardless of hydrologic mode stormflow events have been observed to increase macroplastic concentration compared to lowflow van emmerik et al 2019 but macroplastic concentration discharge rising and falling limb behavior has not been tested in the literature our second objective was to test whether rising and falling limb behavior or storm timing play a role in these event to seasonal scale concentration discharge relationships rating curves have been observed between plastic concentration and discharge as decreasing van emmerik et al 2018 watkins et al 2019 increasing moore et al 2011 stable wagner et al 2019 and nonmonotonic haberstroh et al 2021 reflecting a similar diversity of rating curves that can be watershed or even event specific as seen in other particulate transport studies this underscores the need for more regional studies on plastic concentration discharge rating curves and resultant flux estimation our third goal was to assess the macroplastic concentration discharge rating relationship in the santa ana river and evaluate its use to estimate the annual flux of macroplastic at our study location during the study year in total these objectives serve to inform science about transport processes of macroplastic in rivers and inform society about how to best manage macroplastic pollution 2 study location the santa ana river drains a small mountainous watershed total area 6900 km2 area at survey location 2341 km2 and experiences a hot dry summer mediterranean climate regime with 90 of its 61 cm of average annual precipitation occurring between october april fig 1 the study location on the santa ana river was monitored where the river crosses the van buren bridge in riverside ca which was 1 8 km downriver from usgs gage 11066460 the bridge above the stream was used during stormflow sampling and sampling was conducted in the stream during lowflow the main stem of the santa ana river in the vicinity of sample collection displays two major hydrologic regimes low magnitude mean daily discharge usgs codes par 60 stat 00003 1 8 m3 s 1 flows supported entirely by wastewater discharge and flashy storm flows mean daily discharge 14 0 m3 s 1 and 2 year recurrence interval daily flow of 64 3 m3 s 1 fig s1 most of the time the santa ana middle reach is a losing river with discharge decreasing downriver unless fed by a stormflow event or at wastewater input points naturally the study location would have no or little flow without wastewater input for most of the year wastewater systems are separated from stormwater in the watershed so the wastewater treatment plant does not treat stormwater the sampled reach is low gradient slope 0 004 sandy fine gravel bedded and includes a vegetated riparian corridor that persists between flood control levees these characteristics are typical of interior trunk streams in southern california and thus the study location is a suitable representative of streams draining highly urbanized watersheds in this region pathways and fate of macroplastic at the study reach depend on water and trash management within the watershed and channel a large amount of accumulated trash exists as standing stock within the channel riparian area moore et al 2016 but there have not been previous studies on trash flux through the santa ana river potential sources of macroplastic to the channel are suspected to be runoff from upstream urban areas direct dumping within the river and unmanaged waste from populations of unhoused people that live within the riparian area cowger et al 2019 moore et al 2016 urban trash runoff is mitigated through street sweeping and trash capture devices in storm drains cowger et al 2022 riverside city 2021 riverside county 2010 however to our knowledge there are no systematic mitigation measures for removing the trash within the channel the watershed upriver of the sample location includes 31 developed land use immediately adjacent and upriver of the sample location is the central inland empire metropolitan area including riverside and san bernardino cities wastewater facilities that input to the santa ana have secondary or tertiary treatment before the wastewater is transferred to the channel they are suspected to be a negligible source of macroplastic due to the filtration used during the treatment processes near the watershed s headwaters are mountains with primarily rural populations but these sections are generally disconnected from the sampling reach due to dams at the foothills of many mountain tributaries and the losing nature of the river channel most of the year downriver of the study location is the prado dam which likely prevents most trash flux from the study reach from reaching the ocean due to cleanup activities at the dam 3 methods methodological descriptions were written to ensure the reproducibility and interpretability of the study methodology following best practices for microplastics research recognizing that there were no recommendations for macroplastic cowger et al 2020 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 macroplastic measurements river macroplastic samples were collected in the santa ana river from the downriver side of the van buren bridge in riverside california fig 2 3 4 a steel box trawl designed by dr marcus eriksen of 5 gyres with a square 0 16 m2 intake and 5 mm polyester rope net was lowered from a bridge to the thalweg of the river using a portable crane usgs type a crane with 3 wheel truck attached to the trawl with rope and a boat shackle as the thalweg moved locations we followed it with the sampler on average half of the net was submerged if the net was not resting on the river bed to sample lowflows we waded into the river and set the net in the thalweg of the channel on the river bed the total number of samples collected was limited to 20 throughout 5 sampling events fig 4 due to southern california s highly episodic and fast moving river flow our goal was to sample multiple time points during all 2018 water year october 1st 2018 september 30th 2019 stormflow events and during three lowflow events however stormflow in southern california is highly episodic making it challenging to collect stormwater samples since three field technicians were required to be available during a 24 h window of potential operations with only 1 2 day notice additionally southern california stormflow can be fast moving 3 m s forcing sampling to stop when conditions become too dangerous due to large objects e g trees dumpsters tires beds flowing down the river or the sampling equipment violently jumping out of the water because of these issues we could only sample during 2 of 5 stormflows in water year 2018 3 1 2 hydrologic measurements all river hydrologic data were obtained from the usgs river gage 11066460 located 1 8 km upriver from the macroplastic sampling location usgs 2016b the river gage was inspected flow conditions and morphological characteristics were similar to the survey location continuous stage data 15 min gage height usgs parameter 65 were acquired along with measurements of channel discharge usgs parameter 61 river velocity usgs parameter 55 channel cross sectional area usgs parameter 82632 and channel width usgs parameter 4 from 2018 to 01 10 to 2020 04 21 measurements were taken by usgs staff using their standard protocols for each measurement the channel cross section shape was generally rectangular at both the survey and gage locations the river cross sectional area was divided by width to estimate the average river depth usgs measurements were used to create rating curves using linear regression on log10 transformed stage and measured variables log10 transformation bias log10 correction was corrected using the approach of ferguson ferguson 1986 the adjusted r squared adjrsq value was derived for each regression in r to describe the amount of variability around the regression the discharge rating curve was log10 discharge 5 1 log10 gage height 1 49 adjrsq 0 76 log10 correction 1 09 p value 10 16 the velocity rating curve was log10 velocity 1 24 log10 gage height 0 58 adjrsq 0 44 log10 correction 1 02 p value 10 9 the depth rating curve was log10 depth 2 67 log10 gage height 2 03 adjrsq 0 73 log10 correction 1 03 p value 10 16 uncertainty in usgs rating curves was propagated using bootstrap simulation resampling with replacement n 10 000 of the usgs measurements river slope was estimated using the 1 9th arc second digital elevation model from the national elevation dataset usgs 2017 and google earth river shear velocity u was estimated as 1 u ghs where h is the average river depth g is the acceleration due to gravity and s is the river slope de leeuw et al 2020 daily precipitation fig 4 was downloaded from midwestern regional climate center s cli mate application midwestern regional climate center 2021 for the kral airport weather station near the sample location fig 1 3 2 plastic particle characterization macroplastics were visually sorted from the samples and photographed with a scale in the image fig 5a we used image j schindelin et al 2012 to quantify particle projected area fig 5b for each particle using image j s color thresholding manual tracing and particle size analysis routines fig 5a b particle projected area is the area of the image which contains the particle the particle projected area contains no information about the particles third dimension the height we did not account for the third dimension of the particles in this analysis instead we standardized the smallest dimension to be out of view by laying the largest dimensions facing upward to the camera view and in our opinion the advantages of the high throughput reproducible approach outweighed the loss of measuring the third dimension small artifact particles visible at the fringes of particles fig 5b were removed by restricting the minimum particle size to 1 mm2 nominal particle size was estimated as the square root of the particle projected area particles are well separated by this technique and outlined precisely our suspected error in particle size measurement using this technique is less than 1 mm all suspected plastic particles were subjected to a sink swim test by placing them in fresh water from the lab de ionized water faucet agitating the particle until no surface bubbles were visible and assessing if the particle floated or sank all particles were labeled as settling or buoyant a subset of 88 out of 944 particle identities were validated using fourier transformed infrared ftir spectroscopy and 30 particles with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gcms the smallest particles of the samples were chosen for validation because they were the most likely to be misidentified kroon et al 2018 for ftir a thermo nicolet 6700 attenuated total reflectance atr ftir was used at 4 cm spectral resolution with daily background recording for the spectral range from 400 to 4000 wavenumbers 1 cm spectral analysis was done in open specy cowger et al 2021a with smoothing conducted with a savitzky golay filter with a window size of 12 points and a 3rd order polynomial baseline correction conducted with the imodpolyfit routine using an 8th order polynomial and a min max normalization before identification identification was conducted using pearson correlation and a 0 5 uncertainty threshold using the entire spectral range in pyrolysis gcms the plastic sample was pyrolyzed in a quartz tube at a temperature of 750 c by using the cds 2000 pyroprobe the agilent 6890 n gc used a cds 1500 valved gc interface held at 320 c and the hydrogen gas flow rate was 1 2 ml min 1 in constant flow mode the column characteristics were db 5 0 25 mm od x 60 m l 0 25 ¬µ film thickness fused silica capillary column the cds 1500 gc interface valve was closed after one min the column oven temperature was initially held at 45 c for 2 min and then ramped to 320 c at 20 c min 1 rate the column oven was held at 320 c for 19 min resulting in a total run time of 34 75 min the ms electron multiplier em auto tune voltage was adjusted by 200 v above the auto tune voltage data acquisition was performed in full scan mode from 29 to 600 amu by using the agilent chemstation software the injector and the mass spectrometer transfer line heater were maintained at 320 c the mass spectrometer quadruple and source temperatures were held at 150 c and 230 c results from spectral analysis demonstrated highly accurate visual differentiation of plastic from the samples pyrolysis gcms identified 28 of the 30 particles as plastic 1 particle as non plastic and 1 particle as unknown ftir identified 67 as plastic and 3 particles as non plastics with 18 that could not be identified pyrolysis gcms utilized a two tier approach comprising of peak fingerprinting and mass spectra of marker peaks the two tier confirmation approach provided increased confidence in the quality of the polymer identification data pyrolysis gcms was used to further validate our ftir analysis by comparing 8 particles with both techniques resulting in 6 particles having the same identity with both techniques 1 particle being identified as a different polymer polyethylene instead of polypropylene and 1 particle not being able to be identified by either pyrolysis or ftir si thirteen macroplastics from these samples with rising velocities positively buoyant were randomly chosen to measure rising velocities and reported in another publication waldschl√§ger et al 2020 they were composed of expanded polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene and had powers roundness ranges from 2 2 to 5 9 corey shape factor from 0 07 to 0 88 dimensionless diameter of 2 5 30 81 and rising velocities ranging from 0 221 to 1 69 m s 3 3 estimating macroplastic concentrations and uncertainties three types of macroplastic concentrations count1 projected area1 or mass1 meter 3 were estimated along with their uncertainties all three calculations required an estimate of sample water volume submerged net depth was set to 0 2 m half of the net height or the average river depth whichever was smaller we multiplied the depth of the submerged net by the width of the net 0 4 m to get the submerged cross section of the net uncertainty of submerged depth was incorporated by simulation for each sample using a uniform probability density function from 0 1 to 0 3 m the average river velocity see section 3 1 2 hydrologic measurements from the usgs rating curve linear model on log10 transformed data with log10 bias correction was multiplied by the submerged cross sectional area and the sample duration to quantify the sample s water volume river velocity rating curve uncertainties were incorporated into sample size uncertainty using bootstrap simulation of the model fit resampling with replacement n 10 000 we removed a subset of macroplastics from our observations that would have biased our results settling particles and particles 5 mm microplastic particles can be transported in surface load wash load bed load and rising or settling suspended load cowger et al 2021b surface sampling conducted in this study best measures surface load because bed load and settling suspended load particles will preferentially pass beneath the sampler uncollected therefore we limited this study to particles with a high likelihood of being in surface load transport positively buoyant particles we compared the freshwater settling plastics with the positively buoyant particles by size and count for all samples fig 6 we found that positively buoyant plastics were the most common plastic type in the samples 98 the spectral analysis also corroborated that the vast majority of plastic materials were polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene expanded foam which are more likely to float in water muthuvairavasamy 2022 we removed the 17 settling particles from further analysis we also noticed that the particle size distribution decreased in abundance around 5 mm in size which corresponded to the net s mesh size all particles smaller than 5 mm were removed from further analysis we permuted all estimated shear velocities and all observed rising velocities of the particles to derive rouse numbers 2 p w s Œ≤ k u the rouse number p is derived by dividing the particle settling velocity w s by the multiple of Œ≤ a parameter that adjusts the assumption of parabolic eddy diffusivity set to 1 k the von karmen constant set to 0 4 and u the shear velocity the largest mean rouse number was 2 5 suggesting that most particles observed were in surface load transport cowger et al 2021b therefore we assumed that all particles in this study were transported at the surface of the water column we used the depth integrated average concentration estimate introduced by lebreton et al 2017 and cowger et al 2021b to have a small bias for surface sampling of particles in surface transport count area and mass concentrations were calculated by dividing the abundance by sample volume count concentration was calculated by counting the number of particles in the sample after removing bias causing particles described in 3 2 and dividing it by the total sample water volume count uncertainty due to fragmentation from handling missing particles and inadequate sampling of particle counts estimated as up to 10 of the sample count and was propagated using a uniform probability density function from 0 to 10 area concentration mm2m 3 was calculated by summing the projected surface area from all particles in the samples and dividing it by the sample volume area uncertainty was estimated in the same way as count uncertainty we measured the mass of 124 of the suspected macroplastics imaged for particle size measurement we derived a linear regression on log10 transformed data between the particle projected area and the mass of the particle log10 particle mass g 1 13 log10 particle area mm2 4 adjrsq 0 63 log10 correction 1 36 p value 10 16 fig 7 and corrected for log10 transformation bias ferguson 1986 then we used the regression to estimate the mass of all particles from our samples mass concentrations g1m 3 were computed by dividing the total mass of macroplastic by the sample volume mass uncertainty was computed in the same way as area and count uncertainties uncertainties were propagated using 10 000 simulations of the observed values for macroplastic and river variables the 95 quantiles from the simulations was used as the confidence interval for each value 3 4 lowflow and stormflow particle size distribution stormflow samples were visually separated from lowflow samples using the hydrograph s slope change inflection points all particles from stormflow and lowflow samples were pooled to make two particle size distributions empirical cumulative density function we used the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test to assess the null hypothesis that the particle size distributions of stormflow and lowflow were from the same distribution 3 5 hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing we tested for hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing effects on the macroplastic concentration discharge relationship to assess rising and falling limb behavior we connected the sample concentration discharge values for each sampling day with a line and drew an arrow indicating the relationship s direction through time stormflow periods were determined using the description in 3 5 the rising limb was separated from the falling limb by assessing whether the discharge increased rising limb or decreased falling limb at the sample time storm timing was assessed by plotting the 2018 water year discharge time series october 1st 2018 september 30th 2019 plus the month of october 2019 to include the final sample in the study we described the likely relationships between the timing and magnitude of the stormflows and the concentration discharge relationships observed since only two stormflow events were sampled we did not compute statistics on these trends and used them as a heuristic tool to identify future areas of study 3 6 macroplastic concentration discharge rating curve we assessed the concentration discharge rating curve for count and mass concentrations using generalized additive modeling with a smoothing spline this model allows the variety of concentration discharge rating curves non monotonic and monotonic to be fit gray 2018 we tested the assumption of normality for log10 transformed concentrations using the shapiro wilk test and decided that we would use the assumption of normality for the model count concentration w 0 92 p value 0 08 mass concentration w 0 97 p value 0 82 we fit the generalized additive model to log10 transformed macroplastic concentrations and discharge using a smoothing spline k 7 a gaussian distribution and restricted maximum likelihood estimation for reduced bias in parameter estimates with the mgcv package wood 2011 we assessed our confidence in the model fit probability of null hypotheses that the smoothing spline parameter 0 using the p value alpha 0 05 and percent deviance explained similar to r squared for goodness of fit 3 7 estimating annual mass flux to estimate the macroplastic mass flux in the 2018 water year and assess the importance of uncertainties and concentration discharge rating curves we tested two commonly employed techniques mean concentration extrapolation and a concentration discharge rating curve gray 2018 continuous discharge 15 min interval discharge of the 2018 water year was estimated from the continuous stage using a rating curve section 3 1 2 using mean concentration extrapolation we estimated mass flux by assuming steady mean concentration using the mean mass concentration observed from our dataset total discharge from summing continuous discharge for the water year 2018 was multiplied by the mean mass concentration to predict the annual flux using the generalized additive model rating curve see 3 6 we predicted macroplastic concentration for every continuous discharge time point total mass flux was computed by multiplying macroplastic concentration by discharge and summed for the entire year for both methods confidence intervals were derived using 10 000 simulations during simulations we resampled our observed data for macroplastics and river variables added in other uncertainty metrics and reran each model described throughout all methods sections with confidence intervals representing the 95 quantiles of the simulations 3 8 statistical libraries all statistical tests and plots were written in reproducible r code starting from raw data and ending with the outputs the packages dataretrieval de cicco et al 2021 dplyr wickham et al 2020 ggplot2 wickham 2016 mgcv wood 2011 readxl wickham and bryan 2019 data table dowle and srinivasan 2020 stringr wickham 2019 viridis garnier 2018 tidyr wickham and henry 2020 mass venables and ripley 2002 and matrixstats bengtsson 2021 were used 4 results and discussion 4 1 lowflow and stormflow particle size distribution we tested for differences in the macroplastic size distributions during lowflow and stormflow smaller size classes were exponentially more abundant than larger sizes for both hydrologic regimes fig 8 a similar particle size distribution has been observed for microplastic particles kooi and koelmans 2019 the maximum distance between the two cumulative distribution functions was 0 080 p value 0 66 the particle size distributions of macroplastics in stormflow and lowflow samples were statistically indistinguishable based on the kolmogorov smirnov test there was also high goodness of fit adjrsq 0 63 between particle mass and particle projected area observed in our study fig 7 van emmerik et al 2018 assumed a constant count mass ratio for macroplastic floating in rivers which would be suspected if the particle size distribution were also stable there assuming this stability continues in the future and is widespread mean count mass area conversion ratios common conversions in the field should be constant regardless of discharge at a given site future work should compare our particle size distribution to distributions elsewhere to look for spatial variability what can the uniform particle size distributions of macroplastics in riverflow tell us about watershed macroplastic pollution pathways and transport processes the particle size distribution of macroplastics in riverflow expresses the macroplastic source s particle size distribution and the channel s hydrologic transport characteristics large positively buoyant particles only need a minimum water depth of 25 50 of their particle size to become mobilized braudrick and grant 2000 from a transportability perspective it is unsurprising that we did not see a particle size preference because the river has an average depth of 0 16 m during lowflow conditions which could mobilize the largest particle 0 4 m that can fit in the opening of the sampling net from a source fingerprint perspective the water at the site is nearly 100 wastewater effluent during lowflow conditions macroplastic during these lowflow conditions can only be sourced from the channel a predominant control of macroplastic size distributions during stormflow may have occurred in the river channel or the particle size distribution of macroplastic outside the channel was the same as inside the channel future inquiry into particle size distributions of surface transportable macroplastics in the channel bed riparian area and watershed would help us better understand differences in the particle size distributions between regions other quantifiable macroplastic fingerprints like probability density functions of shapes colors and polymer type may also assist pathway description in future studies 4 2 hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing we assessed the impact of rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing on macroplastic concentration count concentrations ranged from 0 034 to 24 num1m 3 and had a median concentration of 0 25 num1m 3 and a mean of 1 89 num1m 3 mass concentrations ranged from 0 00047 to 2 99 g1m 3 and had a mean concentration of 0 22 g1m 3 and a median of 0 016 g1m 3 macroplastic concentrations rose during the rising limb of one hydrograph 2019 2 2 and fell during the falling limb of another hydrograph 2019 1 17 fig 9 the same phenomenon was observed for mass concentrations fig 10 although we did not have adequate data to assess hysteresis in this study these results point toward likely hysteretic patterns assuming that macroplastic has stable hysteretic patterns clockwise hysteresis would explain this trend clockwise hysteresis is also commonly found for natural mineral sediment rose et al 2018 another macroplastic hydrograph sampling event in northern california also observed clockwise hysteresis with macroplastic with the largest macroplastic concentration transporting during the very beginning of the stormflow 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 stenstrom and kayhanian 2005 also found that greater than 50 of litter flushes from roadsides in southern california during the first 2 hr of stormflow although rising and falling limb behavior can be stable at stream reaches which would allow us to combine rising and falling limbs of different hydrographs it has proven to be unstable for sediment in the santa ana river warrick and rubin 2007 we have learned from this study that count and mass macroplastic concentrations were depleted relative to discharge for the falling limb of one hydrograph compared to the rising limb of another hydrograph to fully characterize a hysteretic pattern a follow up study is needed to collect data throughout a complete hydrograph on both sides of the peak discharge a first flush event is common for many pollutants in southern california whereby high sediment concentrations are flushed during the first large storm event of the year we found that an earlier storm event 1 17 2019 did not have higher concentrations than the later storm 2 2 2019 it is possible that we missed the first flush event since two stormflow events occurred before 1 17 2019 fig 4 it is also possible that the first flush event coincided with the 2 2 2019 event that we sampled first flush events require a minimum storm magnitude threshold before they initiate kim et al 2004 future inquiry into first flush events for macroplastic should survey the first few hours of each stormflow of the year to better assess the role of storm timing 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 4 3 macroplastic concentration discharge rating curve our results show a statistically significant p value 0 05 rating curve between discharge and concentration log10 count concentration s log10 discharge 0 47 log10 correction 1 18 de 70 5 n 20 p value 0 00027 fig 11 the p value is the probability that the smoothing spline for the generalized additive model is zero the same relationship was observed for mass concentrations fig 12 the rating curve was nonmonotonic with the highest macroplastic concentration in the center of the observed discharges and the lowest concentrations at the highest and lowest discharges one explanation for this observed phenomenon is that as discharge increased it could tap into additional sources of macroplastic at a rate of supply higher than that of water however water increased more rapidly than plastic at the highest discharges resulting in lower concentrations in the santa ana river the flow covers a larger region of the channel corridor between levees during higher flows and can access all available macroplastics on the channel bed surface increases in discharge after that increase the flow depth in the channel but do not access additional channel bed surface storage which would result in a decrease in concentration if channel surface storage is a primary storage location of buoyant plastic pollution in the sampled flows the only other study of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships in southern california moore et al 2011 found generally higher concentrations by mass and count during wet weather flows but did not relate that to discharge magnitudes interestingly the concentration ranges observed for surface floating macroplastic in the los angeles river in 2004 by moore et al 2011 0 81 g1m 3 0 18 num1m 3 overlaps with the concentration ranges observed in this study 0 00047 2 99 g1m 3 0 034 24 num1m 3 a recent study also observed a nonmonotonic trend with the highest plastic concentrations at small increases in discharge haberstroh et al 2021 however concentration discharge rating curves with a positive slope 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 negative slope van emmerik et al 2018 and no trend wagner et al 2019 have been observed in other regions we still do not know what the primary driving force of variability is in concentration discharge rating curves between watersheds 4 4 estimating annual macroplastic flux we used two flux estimation strategies to assess the impact of accounting for the concentration discharge rating curves described in 3 3 the annual flux estimate based solely on mean concentration was 27 2 82 84 8 metric tonnes and the concentration discharge rating curve estimate fig 12 was 18 2 2 9 222 2 metric tonnes fig 13 there is considerable overlap in the confidence intervals between the estimates there was more uncertainty resulting from the concentration discharge model fit because we introduced the uncertainty of the generalized additive model into the estimate this underscores the importance of robust uncertainty assessment in flux estimation strategies which can change the interpretation of the suitability differences between models at this time we would recommend using the mean concentration to estimate flux since it is a simpler model but it likely underestimates uncertainty because systematic dependence on discharge and time is not included more data is required to assess the differences between these estimates future work should pursue the processes behind our preliminary findings of hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and nonmonotonic concentration discharge relationships to decrease the uncertainty in those relationships for the santa ana river the particle mass conversion from particle projected area could be improved by including morphological characteristics in the model or estimating particle density and the third dimension fig s2 shows particle size to mass relationships split up by particle morphologies some of the variability in the trend appears to be due to these morphological characteristics which likely correlate to both the third dimension and particle density studies investigating fluxes elsewhere should assess whether similar relationships exist and account for them in their flux estimates accordingly 5 conclusions this study was based on limited data 20 data points at one site and should be considered as initial evidence toward a process based understanding of macroplastic fate and transport processes in urban southern california watersheds lowflow and stormflow samples had the same particle size distribution suggesting that the channel is a critical location where particle size distributions are propagated or that the particle size distribution outside of the channel is the same as in the channel all relationships observed held in terms of macroplastic mass concentration and count concentration likely due in part to the stable particle size distributions higher macroplastic concentrations were observed during the rising limb of a storm and lower concentrations observed during a near peak falling limb suggesting macroplastic source depletion early in storms or rapid mobility of macroplastic however future studies should measure macroplastic concentrations over the full range of a single hydrograph to fully investigate hysteretic patterns macroplastic concentrations were nonmonotonically related to discharge water year macroplastic flux estimates made using mean concentration and the concentration discharge rating curve were not statistically distinguishable mean concentration may be appropriate to estimate flux when data availability is very low but future studies should follow up on the findings revealed here to decrease uncertainty and further investigate the dependence of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships on time at the event to seasonal scale a deeper analysis of sources and transport processes outside of the channel in the watershed would greatly advance our current understanding of how macroplastic is transported in this system these phenomena may be particularly important in small mountainous semi arid systems such as the santa ana river where in channel

7845,study region the santa ana river middle reach a small coastal urban catchment in southern california usa experiences a mediterranean climate and lowflows dominated by wastewater effluent study focus river macroplastic flux can inform watershed management of plastic pollution however continuous macroplastic monitoring is not possible so concentrations must be predicted during unobserved periods we monitored macroplastic concentration and aimed to improve macroplastic flux estimation using strategies commonly employed in estimating mineral sediment flux new hydrological insights for the region floating macroplastic size distributions were statistically equivalent between lowflow and stormflow samples evidence that channel processes controlled macroplastic size distribution or macroplastic size distributions outside the channel were the same as inside concentrations fell during the falling limb of one hydrograph and rose during the rising limb of another hydrograph a generalized additive model gam revealed that macroplastic concentration increased in response to small discharge increases but decreased for the largest discharges macroplasitc depletion relative to discharge occurs at high flow magnitudes or during the falling limb the annual mass flux of floating macroplastic was 27 4 2 8 84 8 tonnes1yr 1 or 18 2 2 9 222 2 tonnes1yr 1 as predicted using mean

io mrey8 1 introduction rivers are highly contaminated by plastic pollution and are the major conveyance of plastic from land to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 river plastic flux plastic quantity discharged per unit time is a key variable in interpreting the magnitude of plastic transport to downriver ecosystems the pollution at the study location and changes in the magnitude of upriver plastic sources schmidt et al 2017 watkins et al 2019 macroplastic 5 mm is known to make up most of the mass of plastic in the environment and break down to form many more abundant microplastics particles 5 mm lebreton et al 2018 moore et al 2011 rigorous estimates of river macroplastic flux are critical for addressing the global crisis of plastic pollution bai et al 2021 but has been much less studied than microplastic flux van emmerik 2021 river macroplastic flux is typically quantified by multiplying river discharge m3s 1 by macroplastic concentrations count or mass1m 3 continuous river stage m measurements are available in many locations within the united states and are periodically calibrated to discharge m3s 1 velocity m1s 1 depth m and other river flow characteristics by the united states geological survey usgs however no methods to continuously monitor river macroplastic concentration are currently in use one needs to make predictions about unobserved macroplastic concentrations to quantify macroplastic flux mineral sediment transport has a long history of research and can inform strategies for studying plastic transport waldschl√§ger et al 2022 unobserved concentrations of fluvial particulate matter are often predicted using discharge regime hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and rating curves fit to river discharge gray 2018 rose et al 2018 walling 1977 changes in discharge reflect combined changes in the supply and transport of water to the monitoring stations and affect changes in the river s transport properties e g turbulence velocity depth the ratio between the flux of water and the flux of particulates at any moment is reflected in the average concentration of the particulate in the flow multiple orders of magnitude of variability around the concentration discharge rating curves are typical particularly in the small mountainous rivers characteristic of coastal california gray 2018 this variability is due in part to stochastic processes like storm sequence east et al 2018 spatio temporal characteristics aguilera and melack 2018 and antecedent watershed conditions fisher et al 2021 gray et al 2015 warrick and rubin 2007 which can cause changes in the processes controlling water and sediment delivery and routing gray et al 2014 temporal structure to this variability can manifest in concentration discharge relationships from hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior williams 1989 i e different rising vs falling limb concentration discharge relationships to interdecadal scale trends gray 2018 warrick et al 2013 a first flush event is common for sediment whereby high concentrations are flushed during the first large storm event of the year sansalone john j and cristina chad m 2004 the particle size distribution of the suspended load may shift with hydrologic mode stormflow lowflow and can be diagnostic of sources and transport pathways of mineral sediment li yingxia et al 2005 slattery and burt 1997 investigating temporal patterns in concentration discharge relationships can provide insight into transport and supply processes and be used to refine flux estimation farnsworth and milliman 2003 gray et al 2014 warrick and rubin 2007 we build from these foundations of fluvial sediment concentration discharge relationships to advance the fundamentals of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships early research on plastic pollution suggested that macroplastic concentration discharge relationships should be considered in estimating plastic discharge from rivers river macroplastic count to mass ratios were assumed constant in literature van emmerik et al 2019 despite changes in hydrological mode suggesting stable particle size distributions but changes in macroplastic size distributions have not been tested our first aim was to test the hypothesis that macroplastic size distributions were stable regardless of hydrologic mode stormflow events have been observed to increase macroplastic concentration compared to lowflow van emmerik et al 2019 but macroplastic concentration discharge rising and falling limb behavior has not been tested in the literature our second objective was to test whether rising and falling limb behavior or storm timing play a role in these event to seasonal scale concentration discharge relationships rating curves have been observed between plastic concentration and discharge as decreasing van emmerik et al 2018 watkins et al 2019 increasing moore et al 2011 stable wagner et al 2019 and nonmonotonic haberstroh et al 2021 reflecting a similar diversity of rating curves that can be watershed or even event specific as seen in other particulate transport studies this underscores the need for more regional studies on plastic concentration discharge rating curves and resultant flux estimation our third goal was to assess the macroplastic concentration discharge rating relationship in the santa ana river and evaluate its use to estimate the annual flux of macroplastic at our study location during the study year in total these objectives serve to inform science about transport processes of macroplastic in rivers and inform society about how to best manage macroplastic pollution 2 study location the santa ana river drains a small mountainous watershed total area 6900 km2 area at survey location 2341 km2 and experiences a hot dry summer mediterranean climate regime with 90 of its 61 cm of average annual precipitation occurring between october april fig 1 the study location on the santa ana river was monitored where the river crosses the van buren bridge in riverside ca which was 1 8 km downriver from usgs gage 11066460 the bridge above the stream was used during stormflow sampling and sampling was conducted in the stream during lowflow the main stem of the santa ana river in the vicinity of sample collection displays two major hydrologic regimes low magnitude mean daily discharge usgs codes par 60 stat 00003 1 8 m3 s 1 flows supported entirely by wastewater discharge and flashy storm flows mean daily discharge 14 0 m3 s 1 and 2 year recurrence interval daily flow of 64 3 m3 s 1 fig s1 most of the time the santa ana middle reach is a losing river with discharge decreasing downriver unless fed by a stormflow event or at wastewater input points naturally the study location would have no or little flow without wastewater input for most of the year wastewater systems are separated from stormwater in the watershed so the wastewater treatment plant does not treat stormwater the sampled reach is low gradient slope 0 004 sandy fine gravel bedded and includes a vegetated riparian corridor that persists between flood control levees these characteristics are typical of interior trunk streams in southern california and thus the study location is a suitable representative of streams draining highly urbanized watersheds in this region pathways and fate of macroplastic at the study reach depend on water and trash management within the watershed and channel a large amount of accumulated trash exists as standing stock within the channel riparian area moore et al 2016 but there have not been previous studies on trash flux through the santa ana river potential sources of macroplastic to the channel are suspected to be runoff from upstream urban areas direct dumping within the river and unmanaged waste from populations of unhoused people that live within the riparian area cowger et al 2019 moore et al 2016 urban trash runoff is mitigated through street sweeping and trash capture devices in storm drains cowger et al 2022 riverside city 2021 riverside county 2010 however to our knowledge there are no systematic mitigation measures for removing the trash within the channel the watershed upriver of the sample location includes 31 developed land use immediately adjacent and upriver of the sample location is the central inland empire metropolitan area including riverside and san bernardino cities wastewater facilities that input to the santa ana have secondary or tertiary treatment before the wastewater is transferred to the channel they are suspected to be a negligible source of macroplastic due to the filtration used during the treatment processes near the watershed s headwaters are mountains with primarily rural populations but these sections are generally disconnected from the sampling reach due to dams at the foothills of many mountain tributaries and the losing nature of the river channel most of the year downriver of the study location is the prado dam which likely prevents most trash flux from the study reach from reaching the ocean due to cleanup activities at the dam 3 methods methodological descriptions were written to ensure the reproducibility and interpretability of the study methodology following best practices for microplastics research recognizing that there were no recommendations for macroplastic cowger et al 2020 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 macroplastic measurements river macroplastic samples were collected in the santa ana river from the downriver side of the van buren bridge in riverside california fig 2 3 4 a steel box trawl designed by dr marcus eriksen of 5 gyres with a square 0 16 m2 intake and 5 mm polyester rope net was lowered from a bridge to the thalweg of the river using a portable crane usgs type a crane with 3 wheel truck attached to the trawl with rope and a boat shackle as the thalweg moved locations we followed it with the sampler on average half of the net was submerged if the net was not resting on the river bed to sample lowflows we waded into the river and set the net in the thalweg of the channel on the river bed the total number of samples collected was limited to 20 throughout 5 sampling events fig 4 due to southern california s highly episodic and fast moving river flow our goal was to sample multiple time points during all 2018 water year october 1st 2018 september 30th 2019 stormflow events and during three lowflow events however stormflow in southern california is highly episodic making it challenging to collect stormwater samples since three field technicians were required to be available during a 24 h window of potential operations with only 1 2 day notice additionally southern california stormflow can be fast moving 3 m s forcing sampling to stop when conditions become too dangerous due to large objects e g trees dumpsters tires beds flowing down the river or the sampling equipment violently jumping out of the water because of these issues we could only sample during 2 of 5 stormflows in water year 2018 3 1 2 hydrologic measurements all river hydrologic data were obtained from the usgs river gage 11066460 located 1 8 km upriver from the macroplastic sampling location usgs 2016b the river gage was inspected flow conditions and morphological characteristics were similar to the survey location continuous stage data 15 min gage height usgs parameter 65 were acquired along with measurements of channel discharge usgs parameter 61 river velocity usgs parameter 55 channel cross sectional area usgs parameter 82632 and channel width usgs parameter 4 from 2018 to 01 10 to 2020 04 21 measurements were taken by usgs staff using their standard protocols for each measurement the channel cross section shape was generally rectangular at both the survey and gage locations the river cross sectional area was divided by width to estimate the average river depth usgs measurements were used to create rating curves using linear regression on log10 transformed stage and measured variables log10 transformation bias log10 correction was corrected using the approach of ferguson ferguson 1986 the adjusted r squared adjrsq value was derived for each regression in r to describe the amount of variability around the regression the discharge rating curve was log10 discharge 5 1 log10 gage height 1 49 adjrsq 0 76 log10 correction 1 09 p value 10 16 the velocity rating curve was log10 velocity 1 24 log10 gage height 0 58 adjrsq 0 44 log10 correction 1 02 p value 10 9 the depth rating curve was log10 depth 2 67 log10 gage height 2 03 adjrsq 0 73 log10 correction 1 03 p value 10 16 uncertainty in usgs rating curves was propagated using bootstrap simulation resampling with replacement n 10 000 of the usgs measurements river slope was estimated using the 1 9th arc second digital elevation model from the national elevation dataset usgs 2017 and google earth river shear velocity u was estimated as 1 u ghs where h is the average river depth g is the acceleration due to gravity and s is the river slope de leeuw et al 2020 daily precipitation fig 4 was downloaded from midwestern regional climate center s cli mate application midwestern regional climate center 2021 for the kral airport weather station near the sample location fig 1 3 2 plastic particle characterization macroplastics were visually sorted from the samples and photographed with a scale in the image fig 5a we used image j schindelin et al 2012 to quantify particle projected area fig 5b for each particle using image j s color thresholding manual tracing and particle size analysis routines fig 5a b particle projected area is the area of the image which contains the particle the particle projected area contains no information about the particles third dimension the height we did not account for the third dimension of the particles in this analysis instead we standardized the smallest dimension to be out of view by laying the largest dimensions facing upward to the camera view and in our opinion the advantages of the high throughput reproducible approach outweighed the loss of measuring the third dimension small artifact particles visible at the fringes of particles fig 5b were removed by restricting the minimum particle size to 1 mm2 nominal particle size was estimated as the square root of the particle projected area particles are well separated by this technique and outlined precisely our suspected error in particle size measurement using this technique is less than 1 mm all suspected plastic particles were subjected to a sink swim test by placing them in fresh water from the lab de ionized water faucet agitating the particle until no surface bubbles were visible and assessing if the particle floated or sank all particles were labeled as settling or buoyant a subset of 88 out of 944 particle identities were validated using fourier transformed infrared ftir spectroscopy and 30 particles with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gcms the smallest particles of the samples were chosen for validation because they were the most likely to be misidentified kroon et al 2018 for ftir a thermo nicolet 6700 attenuated total reflectance atr ftir was used at 4 cm spectral resolution with daily background recording for the spectral range from 400 to 4000 wavenumbers 1 cm spectral analysis was done in open specy cowger et al 2021a with smoothing conducted with a savitzky golay filter with a window size of 12 points and a 3rd order polynomial baseline correction conducted with the imodpolyfit routine using an 8th order polynomial and a min max normalization before identification identification was conducted using pearson correlation and a 0 5 uncertainty threshold using the entire spectral range in pyrolysis gcms the plastic sample was pyrolyzed in a quartz tube at a temperature of 750 c by using the cds 2000 pyroprobe the agilent 6890 n gc used a cds 1500 valved gc interface held at 320 c and the hydrogen gas flow rate was 1 2 ml min 1 in constant flow mode the column characteristics were db 5 0 25 mm od x 60 m l 0 25 ¬µ film thickness fused silica capillary column the cds 1500 gc interface valve was closed after one min the column oven temperature was initially held at 45 c for 2 min and then ramped to 320 c at 20 c min 1 rate the column oven was held at 320 c for 19 min resulting in a total run time of 34 75 min the ms electron multiplier em auto tune voltage was adjusted by 200 v above the auto tune voltage data acquisition was performed in full scan mode from 29 to 600 amu by using the agilent chemstation software the injector and the mass spectrometer transfer line heater were maintained at 320 c the mass spectrometer quadruple and source temperatures were held at 150 c and 230 c results from spectral analysis demonstrated highly accurate visual differentiation of plastic from the samples pyrolysis gcms identified 28 of the 30 particles as plastic 1 particle as non plastic and 1 particle as unknown ftir identified 67 as plastic and 3 particles as non plastics with 18 that could not be identified pyrolysis gcms utilized a two tier approach comprising of peak fingerprinting and mass spectra of marker peaks the two tier confirmation approach provided increased confidence in the quality of the polymer identification data pyrolysis gcms was used to further validate our ftir analysis by comparing 8 particles with both techniques resulting in 6 particles having the same identity with both techniques 1 particle being identified as a different polymer polyethylene instead of polypropylene and 1 particle not being able to be identified by either pyrolysis or ftir si thirteen macroplastics from these samples with rising velocities positively buoyant were randomly chosen to measure rising velocities and reported in another publication waldschl√§ger et al 2020 they were composed of expanded polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene and had powers roundness ranges from 2 2 to 5 9 corey shape factor from 0 07 to 0 88 dimensionless diameter of 2 5 30 81 and rising velocities ranging from 0 221 to 1 69 m s 3 3 estimating macroplastic concentrations and uncertainties three types of macroplastic concentrations count1 projected area1 or mass1 meter 3 were estimated along with their uncertainties all three calculations required an estimate of sample water volume submerged net depth was set to 0 2 m half of the net height or the average river depth whichever was smaller we multiplied the depth of the submerged net by the width of the net 0 4 m to get the submerged cross section of the net uncertainty of submerged depth was incorporated by simulation for each sample using a uniform probability density function from 0 1 to 0 3 m the average river velocity see section 3 1 2 hydrologic measurements from the usgs rating curve linear model on log10 transformed data with log10 bias correction was multiplied by the submerged cross sectional area and the sample duration to quantify the sample s water volume river velocity rating curve uncertainties were incorporated into sample size uncertainty using bootstrap simulation of the model fit resampling with replacement n 10 000 we removed a subset of macroplastics from our observations that would have biased our results settling particles and particles 5 mm microplastic particles can be transported in surface load wash load bed load and rising or settling suspended load cowger et al 2021b surface sampling conducted in this study best measures surface load because bed load and settling suspended load particles will preferentially pass beneath the sampler uncollected therefore we limited this study to particles with a high likelihood of being in surface load transport positively buoyant particles we compared the freshwater settling plastics with the positively buoyant particles by size and count for all samples fig 6 we found that positively buoyant plastics were the most common plastic type in the samples 98 the spectral analysis also corroborated that the vast majority of plastic materials were polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene expanded foam which are more likely to float in water muthuvairavasamy 2022 we removed the 17 settling particles from further analysis we also noticed that the particle size distribution decreased in abundance around 5 mm in size which corresponded to the net s mesh size all particles smaller than 5 mm were removed from further analysis we permuted all estimated shear velocities and all observed rising velocities of the particles to derive rouse numbers 2 p w s Œ≤ k u the rouse number p is derived by dividing the particle settling velocity w s by the multiple of Œ≤ a parameter that adjusts the assumption of parabolic eddy diffusivity set to 1 k the von karmen constant set to 0 4 and u the shear velocity the largest mean rouse number was 2 5 suggesting that most particles observed were in surface load transport cowger et al 2021b therefore we assumed that all particles in this study were transported at the surface of the water column we used the depth integrated average concentration estimate introduced by lebreton et al 2017 and cowger et al 2021b to have a small bias for surface sampling of particles in surface transport count area and mass concentrations were calculated by dividing the abundance by sample volume count concentration was calculated by counting the number of particles in the sample after removing bias causing particles described in 3 2 and dividing it by the total sample water volume count uncertainty due to fragmentation from handling missing particles and inadequate sampling of particle counts estimated as up to 10 of the sample count and was propagated using a uniform probability density function from 0 to 10 area concentration mm2m 3 was calculated by summing the projected surface area from all particles in the samples and dividing it by the sample volume area uncertainty was estimated in the same way as count uncertainty we measured the mass of 124 of the suspected macroplastics imaged for particle size measurement we derived a linear regression on log10 transformed data between the particle projected area and the mass of the particle log10 particle mass g 1 13 log10 particle area mm2 4 adjrsq 0 63 log10 correction 1 36 p value 10 16 fig 7 and corrected for log10 transformation bias ferguson 1986 then we used the regression to estimate the mass of all particles from our samples mass concentrations g1m 3 were computed by dividing the total mass of macroplastic by the sample volume mass uncertainty was computed in the same way as area and count uncertainties uncertainties were propagated using 10 000 simulations of the observed values for macroplastic and river variables the 95 quantiles from the simulations was used as the confidence interval for each value 3 4 lowflow and stormflow particle size distribution stormflow samples were visually separated from lowflow samples using the hydrograph s slope change inflection points all particles from stormflow and lowflow samples were pooled to make two particle size distributions empirical cumulative density function we used the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test to assess the null hypothesis that the particle size distributions of stormflow and lowflow were from the same distribution 3 5 hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing we tested for hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing effects on the macroplastic concentration discharge relationship to assess rising and falling limb behavior we connected the sample concentration discharge values for each sampling day with a line and drew an arrow indicating the relationship s direction through time stormflow periods were determined using the description in 3 5 the rising limb was separated from the falling limb by assessing whether the discharge increased rising limb or decreased falling limb at the sample time storm timing was assessed by plotting the 2018 water year discharge time series october 1st 2018 september 30th 2019 plus the month of october 2019 to include the final sample in the study we described the likely relationships between the timing and magnitude of the stormflows and the concentration discharge relationships observed since only two stormflow events were sampled we did not compute statistics on these trends and used them as a heuristic tool to identify future areas of study 3 6 macroplastic concentration discharge rating curve we assessed the concentration discharge rating curve for count and mass concentrations using generalized additive modeling with a smoothing spline this model allows the variety of concentration discharge rating curves non monotonic and monotonic to be fit gray 2018 we tested the assumption of normality for log10 transformed concentrations using the shapiro wilk test and decided that we would use the assumption of normality for the model count concentration w 0 92 p value 0 08 mass concentration w 0 97 p value 0 82 we fit the generalized additive model to log10 transformed macroplastic concentrations and discharge using a smoothing spline k 7 a gaussian distribution and restricted maximum likelihood estimation for reduced bias in parameter estimates with the mgcv package wood 2011 we assessed our confidence in the model fit probability of null hypotheses that the smoothing spline parameter 0 using the p value alpha 0 05 and percent deviance explained similar to r squared for goodness of fit 3 7 estimating annual mass flux to estimate the macroplastic mass flux in the 2018 water year and assess the importance of uncertainties and concentration discharge rating curves we tested two commonly employed techniques mean concentration extrapolation and a concentration discharge rating curve gray 2018 continuous discharge 15 min interval discharge of the 2018 water year was estimated from the continuous stage using a rating curve section 3 1 2 using mean concentration extrapolation we estimated mass flux by assuming steady mean concentration using the mean mass concentration observed from our dataset total discharge from summing continuous discharge for the water year 2018 was multiplied by the mean mass concentration to predict the annual flux using the generalized additive model rating curve see 3 6 we predicted macroplastic concentration for every continuous discharge time point total mass flux was computed by multiplying macroplastic concentration by discharge and summed for the entire year for both methods confidence intervals were derived using 10 000 simulations during simulations we resampled our observed data for macroplastics and river variables added in other uncertainty metrics and reran each model described throughout all methods sections with confidence intervals representing the 95 quantiles of the simulations 3 8 statistical libraries all statistical tests and plots were written in reproducible r code starting from raw data and ending with the outputs the packages dataretrieval de cicco et al 2021 dplyr wickham et al 2020 ggplot2 wickham 2016 mgcv wood 2011 readxl wickham and bryan 2019 data table dowle and srinivasan 2020 stringr wickham 2019 viridis garnier 2018 tidyr wickham and henry 2020 mass venables and ripley 2002 and matrixstats bengtsson 2021 were used 4 results and discussion 4 1 lowflow and stormflow particle size distribution we tested for differences in the macroplastic size distributions during lowflow and stormflow smaller size classes were exponentially more abundant than larger sizes for both hydrologic regimes fig 8 a similar particle size distribution has been observed for microplastic particles kooi and koelmans 2019 the maximum distance between the two cumulative distribution functions was 0 080 p value 0 66 the particle size distributions of macroplastics in stormflow and lowflow samples were statistically indistinguishable based on the kolmogorov smirnov test there was also high goodness of fit adjrsq 0 63 between particle mass and particle projected area observed in our study fig 7 van emmerik et al 2018 assumed a constant count mass ratio for macroplastic floating in rivers which would be suspected if the particle size distribution were also stable there assuming this stability continues in the future and is widespread mean count mass area conversion ratios common conversions in the field should be constant regardless of discharge at a given site future work should compare our particle size distribution to distributions elsewhere to look for spatial variability what can the uniform particle size distributions of macroplastics in riverflow tell us about watershed macroplastic pollution pathways and transport processes the particle size distribution of macroplastics in riverflow expresses the macroplastic source s particle size distribution and the channel s hydrologic transport characteristics large positively buoyant particles only need a minimum water depth of 25 50 of their particle size to become mobilized braudrick and grant 2000 from a transportability perspective it is unsurprising that we did not see a particle size preference because the river has an average depth of 0 16 m during lowflow conditions which could mobilize the largest particle 0 4 m that can fit in the opening of the sampling net from a source fingerprint perspective the water at the site is nearly 100 wastewater effluent during lowflow conditions macroplastic during these lowflow conditions can only be sourced from the channel a predominant control of macroplastic size distributions during stormflow may have occurred in the river channel or the particle size distribution of macroplastic outside the channel was the same as inside the channel future inquiry into particle size distributions of surface transportable macroplastics in the channel bed riparian area and watershed would help us better understand differences in the particle size distributions between regions other quantifiable macroplastic fingerprints like probability density functions of shapes colors and polymer type may also assist pathway description in future studies 4 2 hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing we assessed the impact of rising and falling limb behavior and storm timing on macroplastic concentration count concentrations ranged from 0 034 to 24 num1m 3 and had a median concentration of 0 25 num1m 3 and a mean of 1 89 num1m 3 mass concentrations ranged from 0 00047 to 2 99 g1m 3 and had a mean concentration of 0 22 g1m 3 and a median of 0 016 g1m 3 macroplastic concentrations rose during the rising limb of one hydrograph 2019 2 2 and fell during the falling limb of another hydrograph 2019 1 17 fig 9 the same phenomenon was observed for mass concentrations fig 10 although we did not have adequate data to assess hysteresis in this study these results point toward likely hysteretic patterns assuming that macroplastic has stable hysteretic patterns clockwise hysteresis would explain this trend clockwise hysteresis is also commonly found for natural mineral sediment rose et al 2018 another macroplastic hydrograph sampling event in northern california also observed clockwise hysteresis with macroplastic with the largest macroplastic concentration transporting during the very beginning of the stormflow 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 stenstrom and kayhanian 2005 also found that greater than 50 of litter flushes from roadsides in southern california during the first 2 hr of stormflow although rising and falling limb behavior can be stable at stream reaches which would allow us to combine rising and falling limbs of different hydrographs it has proven to be unstable for sediment in the santa ana river warrick and rubin 2007 we have learned from this study that count and mass macroplastic concentrations were depleted relative to discharge for the falling limb of one hydrograph compared to the rising limb of another hydrograph to fully characterize a hysteretic pattern a follow up study is needed to collect data throughout a complete hydrograph on both sides of the peak discharge a first flush event is common for many pollutants in southern california whereby high sediment concentrations are flushed during the first large storm event of the year we found that an earlier storm event 1 17 2019 did not have higher concentrations than the later storm 2 2 2019 it is possible that we missed the first flush event since two stormflow events occurred before 1 17 2019 fig 4 it is also possible that the first flush event coincided with the 2 2 2019 event that we sampled first flush events require a minimum storm magnitude threshold before they initiate kim et al 2004 future inquiry into first flush events for macroplastic should survey the first few hours of each stormflow of the year to better assess the role of storm timing 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 4 3 macroplastic concentration discharge rating curve our results show a statistically significant p value 0 05 rating curve between discharge and concentration log10 count concentration s log10 discharge 0 47 log10 correction 1 18 de 70 5 n 20 p value 0 00027 fig 11 the p value is the probability that the smoothing spline for the generalized additive model is zero the same relationship was observed for mass concentrations fig 12 the rating curve was nonmonotonic with the highest macroplastic concentration in the center of the observed discharges and the lowest concentrations at the highest and lowest discharges one explanation for this observed phenomenon is that as discharge increased it could tap into additional sources of macroplastic at a rate of supply higher than that of water however water increased more rapidly than plastic at the highest discharges resulting in lower concentrations in the santa ana river the flow covers a larger region of the channel corridor between levees during higher flows and can access all available macroplastics on the channel bed surface increases in discharge after that increase the flow depth in the channel but do not access additional channel bed surface storage which would result in a decrease in concentration if channel surface storage is a primary storage location of buoyant plastic pollution in the sampled flows the only other study of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships in southern california moore et al 2011 found generally higher concentrations by mass and count during wet weather flows but did not relate that to discharge magnitudes interestingly the concentration ranges observed for surface floating macroplastic in the los angeles river in 2004 by moore et al 2011 0 81 g1m 3 0 18 num1m 3 overlaps with the concentration ranges observed in this study 0 00047 2 99 g1m 3 0 034 24 num1m 3 a recent study also observed a nonmonotonic trend with the highest plastic concentrations at small increases in discharge haberstroh et al 2021 however concentration discharge rating curves with a positive slope 5 gyres and eoa inc 2016 negative slope van emmerik et al 2018 and no trend wagner et al 2019 have been observed in other regions we still do not know what the primary driving force of variability is in concentration discharge rating curves between watersheds 4 4 estimating annual macroplastic flux we used two flux estimation strategies to assess the impact of accounting for the concentration discharge rating curves described in 3 3 the annual flux estimate based solely on mean concentration was 27 2 82 84 8 metric tonnes and the concentration discharge rating curve estimate fig 12 was 18 2 2 9 222 2 metric tonnes fig 13 there is considerable overlap in the confidence intervals between the estimates there was more uncertainty resulting from the concentration discharge model fit because we introduced the uncertainty of the generalized additive model into the estimate this underscores the importance of robust uncertainty assessment in flux estimation strategies which can change the interpretation of the suitability differences between models at this time we would recommend using the mean concentration to estimate flux since it is a simpler model but it likely underestimates uncertainty because systematic dependence on discharge and time is not included more data is required to assess the differences between these estimates future work should pursue the processes behind our preliminary findings of hydrograph rising and falling limb behavior and nonmonotonic concentration discharge relationships to decrease the uncertainty in those relationships for the santa ana river the particle mass conversion from particle projected area could be improved by including morphological characteristics in the model or estimating particle density and the third dimension fig s2 shows particle size to mass relationships split up by particle morphologies some of the variability in the trend appears to be due to these morphological characteristics which likely correlate to both the third dimension and particle density studies investigating fluxes elsewhere should assess whether similar relationships exist and account for them in their flux estimates accordingly 5 conclusions this study was based on limited data 20 data points at one site and should be considered as initial evidence toward a process based understanding of macroplastic fate and transport processes in urban southern california watersheds lowflow and stormflow samples had the same particle size distribution suggesting that the channel is a critical location where particle size distributions are propagated or that the particle size distribution outside of the channel is the same as in the channel all relationships observed held in terms of macroplastic mass concentration and count concentration likely due in part to the stable particle size distributions higher macroplastic concentrations were observed during the rising limb of a storm and lower concentrations observed during a near peak falling limb suggesting macroplastic source depletion early in storms or rapid mobility of macroplastic however future studies should measure macroplastic concentrations over the full range of a single hydrograph to fully investigate hysteretic patterns macroplastic concentrations were nonmonotonically related to discharge water year macroplastic flux estimates made using mean concentration and the concentration discharge rating curve were not statistically distinguishable mean concentration may be appropriate to estimate flux when data availability is very low but future studies should follow up on the findings revealed here to decrease uncertainty and further investigate the dependence of macroplastic concentration discharge relationships on time at the event to seasonal scale a deeper analysis of sources and transport processes outside of the channel in the watershed would greatly advance our current understanding of how macroplastic is transported in this system these phenomena may be particularly important in small mountainous semi arid systems such as the santa ana river where in channel storage of macroplastics may be particularly high and the readily mobilized by flashy stormflow regimes funding w cowger was funded in part by an nsf graduate research fellowship this project was

7846,study region 24 stream gaging sites in puerto rico study focus at a station hydraulic geometry ahg which describes how channel width depth and velocity vary with discharge at a river cross section has long been used to study fluvial processes most prior ahg studies however focused on mid latitude temperate regions tropical zones including those affected by tropical cyclones tcs have received less attention this study analyzes spatial and temporal variability in ahg in puerto rico and identified the characteristics that correlate with ahg parameters these characteristics were then used to build regression models of these parameters new hydrological insights for the region model performance suggests that ahg can be predicted at ungaged locations in puerto rico the largest flood events mostly caused by major tcs were found to cause changes in all ahg parameters characteristics such as watershed land cover were found to be reliable predictors of ahg parameters reaches with steeper slopes were found to have limited lateral adjustability which may reflect consolidated bank materials watersheds with high percentages of forested area showed larger changes in the ahg velocity relationship related to changes in roughness but less vertical adjustability than more developed watersheds these results can help inform whether river channel properties in puerto rico and similar environments are resistant to the forces of tc induced flooding and how these properties are affected by such floods graphical abstract ga1 abbreviation ahg at a station hydraulic geometry tc

et al 2012 su et al 2015 and sand excavation zhang et al 2015 tropical cyclones tcs hit puerto rico pr frequently more than one annually on average are often associated with heavy and intense rainfall this rainfall combined with the steep mountainous terrain of pr and similar environments can produce some of the largest flood peaks per unit watershed area in the world ogden 2016 smith et al 2005 these floods can cause landslides debris flows mass wasting and fluvial erosion which redistribute large amounts of sediment along the river west et al 2011 and are capable of causing systematic lateral and vertical channel adjustments e g yousefi et al 2018 li et al 2020 found that channel conveyance capacity can change substantially as a result of tc flooding that study did not however examine how these changes manifest in terms of channel geometric properties and failed to isolate upstream watershed characteristics or local river reach influence e g slope land cover that could explain the observed conveyance capacity evolution at a station hydraulic geometry ahg provides a mechanism of studying channel morphology and its changes leopold and maddock 1953 it describes the relationships between discharge vs water surface width mean depth and mean velocity at individual river cross sections power law formulations have long been used to model ahg and these formulations have been widely applied to understand river geomorphology e g andreadis et al 2013 barefoot et al 2019 knighton and wharton 2014 leopold et al 1964 reid et al 2010 stewardson 2005 the standard ahg formulation which first appeared in leopold and maddock 1953 is 1 w a q b 2 d c q f 3 v k q m where w is channel width typically the wetted width d is the hydraulic depth i e cross sectional area divided by w v is mean stream velocity and q is the instantaneous discharge the requirement of continuity 4 q wdv ack q b f m implies the constraints ack 1 and b f m 1 the coefficients a c and k describe the relative magnitude of channel width channel depth and velocity or roughness while the exponents b f and m provide insight into how channel width channel depth and velocity roughness change with discharge notwithstanding the constraints above the coefficients and exponents from eqs 1 4 can vary substantially from place to place morel et al 2020b park 1977 and researchers have yet to fully reveal the physical principles that underly ahg behavior jia et al 2017 morel et al 2019 though not for lack of trying e g dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 watershed and river reach characteristics that have been shown to explain some observed ahg variability include drainage area qin et al 2020 watershed orientation and channel substrate turowski et al 2008 suspended sediment load wang et al

al 2020a qin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 turowski et al 2008 relationships have also been shown between ahg parameters from various cross sections within individual river systems dingman 2007 found that there are theoretical interdependencies among ahg coefficients and exponents turowski et al 2008 found that the relationship between the ratio f b and the exponent b follows a power law for data from taiwan gleason and smith 2014 found that local ahg coefficient and exponent pairs a and b c and f k and m from different locations along the same river follow log linear relationships they termed this at many station hydraulic geometry barber and gleason 2018 then verified that most rivers in continental u s follow at many station hydraulic geometry the empirical at many station hydraulic geometry was reconciled theoretically with ahg by brinkerhoff et al 2019 analyses of temporal changes in ahg and its causes remain relatively rare qin et al 2020 and most existing studies are confined to the mid latitudes data limitations mean that ahg in more tropical zones with their unique hydroclimatic and geologic conditions have been less studied see lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 and turowski et al 2008 for exceptions this study attempts to connect the findings of li et al 2020 with the ahg framework by examining the watershed and river reach determinants of ahg including whether or not it is feasible to estimate ahg at ungaged sites and also by evaluating the potential for ahg response to major flood events which are almost always caused by tcs in puerto rico li et al 2020 such findings could be valuable for applications such as simplified discharge estimation huang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 with a suitable ahg relationship between width and discharge and or between water surface elevations and discharge one can obtain reasonably accurate estimates of discharge based on channel widths and water surface elevations measured from in situ or remotely sensed imagery identification of relevant watershed and river reach characteristics and subsequent transferal to ungaged sites meanwhile could be used to inform flood risk management river restoration and related actions here we hypothesize that upstream watershed and river reach characteristics can predict ahg parameters at our study sites and ahg parameters will change after extreme flood events this study examined ahg parameters for 24 sites in pr correlation analyses were used to identify the watershed and river reach characteristics that are potentially predictive of ahg parameter estimates these characteristics were used to build multiple linear regression models for each parameter with cross validation used to evaluate their applicability to ungaged sites channel geometry responses to tc floods were examined by calculating changes in ahg parameters after major storms and comparing changes to watershed and river reach characteristics the methodology including study region and data used in this study is described in section 2 results follow in section 3 while discussion and conclusions are provided in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methodology 2 1 study region puerto rico pr is a mountainous island located in the northeast caribbean the average elevation of the mountainous middle part exceeds 1300 m above sea level masl while the average elevation of the less steep margin is about 500 masl annual precipitation ranges from around 500 cm for the mountainous center to 100 400 cm in the coastal lowlands daly et al 2003 a monsoon season begins in may and usually lasts until october overlapping with the june november north atlantic tc season limited by the island s aspect and east west mountain range its rivers generally range from 10 kilometers to about 50 kilometers in length with the longest rio de la plata measuring 74 kilometers and from 10 m to more than 60 m in width 2 2 data our ahg estimation relied on field measurements of channel geometry and velocity which the us geological survey usgs performs at stream gage sites on a regular basis roughly monthly to maintain accurate rating curves which are then used for continuous discharge estimation u s geological survey 2021a 2021b these field measurements were obtained from the national water information system nwis maintained by the usgs u s geological survey 2021a 2021b annual instantaneous peak discharges u s geological survey 2021a 2021b were used to identify the date with the largest flood in each site s record we applied rigorous screening to identify suitable usgs stream gage stations sites with recorded flags indicating influence by nearby dams as well as those located in the vicinity of man made structures such as weirs were excluded due to their influence on ahg reisenb√ºchler et al 2019 field measurement records in pr available through nwis usually start around 1990 though several sites records date back to the early 1980 s if a station is reported to have experienced datum changes we avoided all observations before the most recent datum change the site was excluded from the analysis if the most recent datum change occurred later than 1990 we applied the data accuracy criteria of slater et al 2015 who only considered field measurements in which the discharge is within one percent of the product of channel velocity and cross sectional channel area as reported by the usgs and those made in close proximity to the gage station within 300 feet 91 m usually only less than 10 of the field measurements were made directly at the gaged cross section only sites that have continuous daily discharge records in the same period of the field measurements were included the study period ends in february 2020 24 sites satisfied these criteria fig 1 table s1 the limited number of sites in the northwestern portion of the island is linked to the lower drainage density there upstream watershed and river reach characteristics were obtained or estimated from public gis and remote sensing resources and used to calculate correlations with and to predict ahg parameters falcone 2011 ocm partners 2019 u s geological survey 2006 watershed boundaries along with the upstream drainage area corresponding to each stream gage were downloaded from nwis u s geological survey 2021a 2021b watershed averaged elevation and slope were calculated for each gage based on a digital elevation model dem from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information office for coastal management which was built from lidar points with horizontal resolution of 0 7 m and stated vertical accuracy of 9 4 cm ocm partners 2019 we matched the reach segment from the river network u s geological survey 2006 to each of the 24 gauging sites and then measured the reach slope and sinuosity of the reach channel widths the width between river banks at each gage site were estimated via remote sensing imagery available through the google earth application taken in february 2020 percentages of developed forested and planted agricultural areas were obtained from the usgs gages ii dataset falcone 2011 note that land use metrics are static i e only available at the time point when gages ii data were taken in 2001 limitations stemming from this are discussed further in section 4 2 3 hydraulic geometry parameter estimation to study spatial variation of the hydraulic geometry we fitted power law models to the entire period of field measurements to get parameter estimates for each site see black lines in fig 2 for examples the parameter values in eqs 1 3 were estimated via the nonlinear least squares nls regression function in the r programming language r core team 2020 the residuals of each nls regression model were examined for homoscedasticity independence and normality using the package nlstools e g fig s1 baty et al 2015 units used in this study are m 3 s for discharge m for depth and width and m s for velocity the resulting units for a c and k are s m 2 s m 2 and m 3 respectively channel surface water widths and mean velocities were used to fit channel eqs 1 and 3 respectively while hydraulic mean depths in eq 2 were calculated by dividing flow areas by surface water widths after barber and gleason 2018 brinkerhoff et al 2019 doll et al 2002 shen et al 2016 the fitted parameters obtained via nls did not strictly satisfy continuity constraints eq 4 though nearly so results not shown the product of the coefficients were usually within 1 0 15 while the sum of the exponents were usually within 1 0 05 we thus applied a normalization used in prior studies jowett 1998 lee et al 2019 park 1977 to enforce continuity eqs 5 and 6 5 a adjusted a fitted a fitted c fitted k fitted 1 3 similar for c and k 6 b adjusted b fitted b fitted f fitted m fitted similar for f and m we also reproduced all subsequent analyses without this normalization results with and without normalization were nearly equivalent results without normalization are omitted for brevity eqs 1 and 2 imply that channel cross sectional geometry can be described by an equation of the form 7 d c a f b w f b eq 7 shows that depth is proportional to the surface water width to the power f b prior studies have examined f b as an indicator of channel cross sectional shape ferguson 1986 qin et al 2020 turowski et al 2008 for example width is proportional to depth when f b 1 implying a triangular cross section while f b 2 implies a parabolic form when b 0 f b would be infinity implying that the wetted width does not increase with discharge as in a rectangular cross section f b 1 represents a convex upwards curved channel section indicative of a cut bank point bar form with width increasing more than depth for medium to high discharges see fig 3 in ferguson 1986 the ratio c a f b which indicates relative bank steepness for a particular value of f b is absent from earlier studies we calculated f b and c a f b from our ahg estimates and refer to them as bank shape parameters 2 4 watershed and river reach characteristics and correlation analyses upstream watershed and reach scale characteristics were estimated to examine their relationships to ahg parameters and these parameters responses to floods other than the characteristics introduced in the section 2 2 we included three additional variables following morel et al 2019 froude number at median discharge of all available field measurements for each site f 50 the median width to depth ratio r wh and normalized active channel width w n these are calculated as 8 f 50 q 50 g 0 5 h 50 w 50 9 r wh w 50 h 50 10 w n channel width watershed area 0 42 where q 50 is median discharge w 50 and h 50 are reach average wetted width and depth at q 50 respectively finally the normalized two year flood calculated as the median of annual instantaneous peak flows from nwis divided by the upstream drainage area which is indicative of channel bankfull discharge and has been applied in stream flow studies leopold et al 1964 yu et al 2019 was included to describe the peakiness of a watershed s flood regime kendall s tau nonparametric rank correlation kendall 1938 was used to identify relationships between watershed reach characteristics and ahg parameters 2 5 ahg predictive regression models we used a stepwise process to develop models to predict ahg parameters based on watershed and river reach characteristics we began by creating multiple linear regression models for each ahg parameter based on all available predictors these were reduced to final predictive models via trial and error in order to balance model predictive power and complexity final models were those with the highest adjusted r squared values some variables such as channel width reach slope and f 50 were not used in the models due to collinearity among predictors following morel et al 2019 we took the natural log and the square root of elevation and watershed area respectively before considering them as predictors to evaluate the potential predictive power of the final regression models at similar ungaged sites in puerto rico as well as to avoid overfitting we performed k fold cross validation commonly applied to hydrologic hydraulic and ecologic models for uncertainty estimation e g esmaeelzadeh et al 2015 jung et al 2020 mamat et al 2021 nelson et al 2018 to estimate the root mean square error of the predicted values of each parameter the k fold cross validation randomly partitions data into k groups with nearly equal size and then fits the model with k 1 folds and the left out fold is used to validate the fit and validate process is repeated k times until each of the k folds has been used for validation geisser 1975 the choice of k is usually 5 or 10 since these values have been shown empirically to have error estimates relatively resistant to both high bias and high variance james et al 2021 it has been suggested to perform 10 fold cross validation 10 times to obtain reliable accuracy estimates bouckaert 2003 witten et al 2011 we followed this guidance in our analysis each fold contained two of our study sites while four sites were reserved for testing the four testing sites which were randomly drawn are 50136400 50063800 50113800 and 50124200 2 6 ahg temporal variation due to tropical cyclones li et al 2020 showed that recent major tcs primarily hurricanes hortense 1996 georges 1998 and maria 2017 caused substantial changes in river channel conveyance capacity in pr this earlier work however did little to elucidate more specific geomorphic changes ahg parameters can indeed change substantially in response to tcs see the red and blue lines in fig 2 which show distinct ahg relationships estimated before and after major storms we identified the largest local flood event the largest annual peak streamflow value for each site to separate the field measurements into two time series before and after this largest local flood event hurricanes hortense and georges caused the largest flood events at six sites each while hurricane maria caused the largest flood at ten others the largest floods at the two remaining sites were caused by non tc storms we again followed the methodology in section 2 3 to estimate ahg parameters see section 3 3 but only for periods four years before and four years after these identified flood events we calculated before and after percentage changes in ahg parameters including bank shape parameters by subtracting the values after the largest flood event from the values before and dividing the difference by the latter value these changes were then tested for correlation with watershed and river reach characteristics using the nonparametric rank correlation mentioned in section 2 4 we extracted the peak discharges of the local largest flood events u s geological survey 2021a 2021b and divided them by the 2 year peak discharge which as aforementioned is an indicator of the bankfull discharge at the same site to get normalized discharges of the largest local flood events these normalized flood discharges were included as an additional characteristic in the correlation analysis specific to ahg parameter changes caused by floods 3 results 3 1 ahg parameter estimates and correlation tests the power law models fit reasonably well p values much less than 0 05 to all six parameters at all sites except for velocity at site 50064200 which yielded a p value of 0 056 table s2 the average values for the exponents were 0 230 0 394 and 0 376 for b f and m respectively a ternary plot fig 3a shows similar distributions of exponents from this study and from the earlier ahg studies in pr from lewis 1969 and phillips and scatena 2013 the results are also similar to those from leopold and maddock 1953 in the mainland midwestern united states and leopold and miller 1956 in mainland ephemeral rivers results not shown similarly to phillips and scatena s 2013 observations we found that the width exponent is generally less than 0 33 with only one exception of b 0 344 relationships between ahg parameter estimates and the various watershed and reach characteristics are tabulated in terms of kendall s tau correlation table 1 while those of most obvious interest are shown in additional ternary plots fig 3b d upstream watershed area was found to be positively negatively correlated with f m p 0 014 for both f and m while both percentage of developed area and planted area were negatively positively correlated with f m p 0 001 for correlations between percentage of developed area and both f and m p 0 001 for correlation between percentage of planted area and f and p 0 004 for correlation between percentage of planted area and m average upstream watershed elevation slope and the percentage of forested area were found to be negatively positively correlated with f m p 0 001 between average upstream watershed elevation and f p 0 004 between average upstream watershed elevation and m p 0 001 between average upstream watershed slope and both f and m p 0 039 between percentage of forested area and f and p 0 008 between percentage of forested area and m no characteristics were found to be associated with b and no other characteristics were found to be correlated with any exponents upstream watershed area average watershed elevation channel width average reach slope r wh f 50 and w n were also found to be correlated with some coefficients table 1 the channel shape parameters f b and a c f b are negatively and positively correlated respectively with average watershed elevation with p values of 0 015 and 0 004 respectively upstream watershed area is also found to be negatively correlated with a c f b p 0 009 while average upstream watershed slope is found to be negatively correlated with f b p 0 034 the ratio f b was found to be negatively correlated p 0 015 with average watershed elevation indicating that higher elevation rivers in pr tend toward more triangular and less rectangular channel cross sectional shapes turowski et al 2008 found a strong log log relationship between the bank shape parameter f b and the exponent b for average parameter values in different studies by comparing our data with prior studies david et al 2010 lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 qin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 turowski et al 2008 we found that this relationship appears to hold across a wide range of studies and study locations the range of coefficients of the models fit separately to each of the five studies shown on fig 4 is 0 15 0 33 the range of exponents is 1 42 1 01 the coefficient and exponent of the model fit to our data are 0 22 and 1 35 respectively which are within the range the model fit range also contains the equation in turowski et al 2008 fig 4 gray line f b 0 28 0 06 b 1 12 0 07 this confirms that in puerto rico as in other locations general steep banked channels lead to smaller exponent b which is indicative of width being less adjustable which can be caused by consolidated bank materials like cohesive soils that are common in cases of steep banks 3 2 ahg predictive models by compiling the watershed and river reach characteristics we not only found the characteristics that are correlated to ahg parameters but were able to build models to predict their values which were missing from the studies we compared in fig 4 the final regression models to predict ahg parameters section 2 5 are shown in table 2 along with r squared values and overall model p values among the three coefficients exponents k b is least well predicted in terms of adjusted r squared the regression model for b is the only one not significant at the 5 level when subject to 10 fold cross validation all regression based models can predict parameter values with relative root mean square error rrmse rmse divided by the average parameter value between 10 and 30 except for the model for b which results in 30 4 morel et al 2019 2020a built predictive models for ahg exponents on a continental scale by data from france and new zealand with rmse ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 unitless our models generally showed 1 magnitude of order lower rmse for exponents which may be caused by a much smaller scale and more consistent environmental settings our models also provided predictions for ahg coefficients which are necessary information for discharge estimation but are not discussed in prior studies 3 3 hydraulic geometry response to tropical cyclones we re estimated ahg parameters for each site using two periods four years before and after the largest local flood event i e the highest single instantaneous flood peak for each site see section 2 6 both the percent differences between the before and after parameter values and the absolute value of these differences were calculated the absolute values are generally indicative of the overall tendency of a site s ahg relations to change in response to a major flood while the real difference provides the direction of that change the differences in the parameter values of the largest local flood event are shown in fig 5 percent changes in parameter values are evident at most sites and for all parameters the changes in the depth exponent f tend to be positive in the northeastern part of the island and negative in western puerto rico no obvious spatial patterns were evident for other parameters we then computed correlations between these parameter value changes and the various watershed and river reach characteristics table 3 r wh s and w n are positively correlated with the real percent difference of a p 0 034 0 034 0 039 respectively while s is also negatively correlated p 0 034 with the real percent difference in k normalized two year flood and f 50 are positively correlated with the shape coefficient c a f b p values are 0 042 and 0 03 respectively the percentage of forested developed area is negatively positively correlated with the absolute percent difference of k with p values of 0 03 0 008 the percentage of forested developed area is also positively negatively correlated with the absolute percent difference of b with p values of 0 003 0 009 watershed area channel width and the percentage of planted area are also negatively correlated with the absolute percent difference of b p 0 008 0 033 0 021 respectively the percentage of planted area average watershed slope is positively negatively correlated with the absolute percent change of c with p 0 036 p 0 017 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies the average values of the exponents b f m obtained in this study are 0 230 0 394 and 0 376 respectively which are close to lewis 1969 and phillips and scatena 2013 results in puerto rico fig 3a leopold and maddock s results in the midwest us leopold and maddock 1953 and leopold and miller s results in ephemeral streams in us leopold and miller 1956 the b and f values agree with the prior work in puerto rico phillips and scatena 2013 in that width b contributes a smaller component than depth f and velocity m and never exceeds one third with one slight minor exception of b 0 34 in 14 sites velocity has the largest exponent while depth has the largest exponent in the other 10 sites width never had the largest exponent similar to qin et al 2020 the ratio f b describes the shape of river banks ferguson 1986 ranging from 0 93 to 12 89 in this study with the median of 1 44 the majority of sites have ratios within or near the range 1 2 indicating that the majority of channel cross sections are either triangular or parabolic the ratio at some sites however are higher highlighting that there does exist a diversity of channel cross sectional shapes in puerto rico including ones closer to rectangular the log log linear relationship between the shape parameter f b and b are significant for both our data and a collection of parameters from former studies conducted in puerto rico colorado in the mountainous western united states and the yellow river in china the fitted equations are all close to what turowski et al 2008 found using average values from other studies despite the strong log log relationship between f b and b we found that this relationship did not predict b as well as the regression based model for that parameter rmse and rrmse of b estimates based on the log linear model are 0 61 and 265 this may be due to the requisite log and exponential transformations nonetheless the high similarity of the log log linear relationship among different studies in highly varied geographic regions suggests the potential to estimate channel shape from the exponent b 4 2 hydraulic parameters and watershed and river reach characteristics 4 2 1 exponents the characteristics that were significantly correlated with the depth exponent f were inversely correlated with the velocity exponent m table 1 which is not unexpected due to the continuity requirement eq 4 these characteristics include upstream drainage area the percentages of developed forested and planted area average upstream watershed slope and elevation our results are consistent with klein 1981 and qin et al 2020 in that depth is a greater contributor for higher discharges in large rivers positive correlation between watershed area and f while width contributes more in small streams negative but weak p 0 9 correlation between upstream watershed area and b no watershed or river reach characteristics were found to be significant correlated with the width exponent b at the 5 level phillips and scatena 2013 found that while velocity has a larger exponent for rural channels in puerto rico depth contributes to a larger exponent extent in urban catchments our correlation results agree with this finding the percentage of developed forested area of a watershed is positively negatively correlated with the depth exponent f and negatively positively with the velocity exponent m this is further supported by the significant and positive correlation between f m and percentage of developed area kendall s tau 0 54 p 10 4 cohesive banks are common in both developed and forested watersheds with stable banks the river channels have limited lateral adjustability millar and quick 1993 millar 2000 this potentially explains why land cover metrics were not significantly correlated with b the positive correlation between f and the percentage of developed area indicates that the channels tend to adjust vertically in more developed watersheds than in more forested watersheds which agrees with previous research showing that channels in urbanized environments are often prone to incision booth 1990 cole et al 2017 in forested watersheds wood load can contribute to flow resistance and is subject to adjustments from frequent and flashy floods cadol and wohl 2013 in support of the positive correlation between m adjustability of channel roughness and percent forested area the average elevation and slope of the watersheds are highly correlated kendall s tau 0 58 p 10 4 and thus yield similar correlations with f negative and m positive ran et al 2012 and others have concluded that mountainous bedrock channels are typically stable meaning scour and infill are negligible this agrees with the observations in pike et al 2010 that channels of higher elevation in northeastern puerto rico are usually more resistant to erosion due to stable river bed materials such as granite while channels of lower elevation are usually in alluvium this likely explains our result that higher elevation and steeper i e more mountainous watersheds accommodate increasing discharge primarily through velocity positive correlation with m rather than depth negative correlation with f further field studies of river bed and soil material can improve understanding of the lithologic controls on ahg parameters 4 2 2 coefficients and bank shape parameters average watershed elevation was found to be negatively correlated with f b kendall s tau 0 36 p 0 015 table 2 and positively correlated with c a f b kendall s tau 0 41 p 0 004 table 2 since most channels have forms between triangular f b 1 and parabolic f b 2 this correlation suggests that lower elevation channels tend to be parabolic with a gradually sloped banks while the higher elevation channels tend to be triangular with steeper banks this can be explained by the difference of channel substrate higher elevation watersheds are usually in mountainous areas with bedrock channels while rivers in lower elevation areas carry more alluvium which can be shaped into parabolic forms ran et al 2012 the coefficients in eqs 1 3 are unit dependent and are usually treated as values of width depth or velocity when the discharge equals one unit m 3 s in our case dingman and afshari 2018 the coefficients are general indicators of a channel s width depth and roughness how these characteristics influence discharges at different flow levels is determined by exponents for example in ran et al 2012 a wide channel with highly cohesive steep banks result in a high value of a and a relatively small value of b upstream drainage area was significantly correlated with a positive and c negative and negatively but insignificantly correlated with k this is similar to qin et al 2020 and suggests that channels in the larger watersheds in puerto rico are generally more wide than deep in terms of cross sectional geometric controls on discharge channel width is positively correlated with a confirming the interpretation of a as a scale factor for channel width ran et al 2012 the positive correlation between channel width and k can be explained by continuity eq 4 reach slope is found to be negatively correlated with a in support of that channels with greater slope have lower width to depth ratios due to less lateral adjustability of resistant bank material the positive correlation between average watershed elevation and c shows that mountainous channels in puerto rico are usually deep consistent with the observation mentioned above that channels at high elevations are more likely to be triangular rather than parabolic high values of normalized active channel width reflect wide channels relative to catchment size by eq 7 morel et al 2019 which could be indicative of increases in roughness associated with feedbacks between channel width and instream wood loading negative correlation between normalized active channel width and k table 1 agreeing with former studies in that wood load increases flow resistance cadol and wohl 2013 curran and hession 2013 mcbride et al 2007 2008 coefficients are more influential when values of the variable width depth and velocity are low while exponents are more influential for high values to demonstrate we considered ahg parameters together with published flood stages obtained from national weather service national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2021 to predict bankfull discharges based on eq 2 we found that on average exponents are more influential than coefficients at determining bankfull discharge at flood stage for example a 1 increase in f can resulted in an average decrease in bankfull discharge of 7 1 while a 1 increase in c gave only an average decrease of 2 9 it should be noted however that few sites have direct discharge measurements near or above these flood stages see also li et al 2020 for discussion on this and other limitations in the pr field measurements so these results should be taken with a grain of salt this calls for further data to better understand the influence of both coefficients and exponents at flood discharges 4 3 predictive models the k fold error estimates reach an acceptable level of accuracy suggested by the rrmse the rmse rrmses for estimates of b f and m are 0 072 30 4 0 076 18 7 and 0 052 14 6 respectively the rmse and p values are generally lower and r squared values generally higher than the predictive models from morel et al 2019 likely due to a much reduced geographic scope and thus a smaller more homogeneous set of sites the rmse rrmse for coefficients a c and k are 2 5 s m 2 19 2 0 055 s m 2 21 1 and 0 10 m 2 29 1 respectively the high rmse though not rrmse of a is due to its wide range and much higher magnitude compared to other parameters the regression models not only yielded reliable estimates of the parameters at the study sites but show the potential to predict parameter values for ungaged sites in similar environmental settings the rmses rrmses for estimates of b f and m are 0 045 22 1 0 055 17 3 and 0 068 14 2 respectively at the testing sites the rmse rrmse for coefficients a c and k are 3 2 s m 2 26 9 0 02 s m 2 6 8 and 0 07 m 2 24 3 respectively note that the rrmses are calculated as the ratio between rmse and the average parameter values since test data have different averages than training data there can be some parameters with higher rmse but lower rrmse e g m the generally lower rrmse at testing sites than the training data during cross validation supports the predictive ability of our regression models whether the multiple linear regression models are suitable for parameter prediction in a different environmental settings as well as the specific set of characteristics and the weights of each characteristic used in the model however needs to be determined using field measurements and other region specific data in addition temporal changes in predictors due to tcs or other drivers were not considered in these predictive models but may be important this limitation is discussed further in the next subsection the land use data used in this study are from 2001 falcone 2011 while the usgs streamflow measurements spanned from roughly 1990 2020 most of the characteristics other than land use information were calculated based on the 2016 2017 lidar dem from noaa office for coastal management ocm partners 2019 which was obtained shortly before hurricane maria as a consequence we didn t examine how land use metrics co vary temporally with ahg higher frequency land use and elevation data could help more fully reveal the watershed and reach controls on ahg and would also likely yield more accurate predictive models of ahg unfortunately such data were not available to us 4 4 tropical cyclone effects on ahg the normalized two year flood is positively correlated with real i e not absolute percent change of c a f b indicating that greater flashiness can steepen shapes after floods possibly as a result of channel incision e g schumm et al 1984 simon and rinaldi 2006 wallerstein and thorne 2004 s is positively correlated with the real percent change of a showing that in meandering channels channel widths tend to increase after floods this is consistent with the expectation that sinuous channels are fully alluvial with laterally adjustable channel boundaries r wh and w n are also positively correlate with real percent change of a showing that banks in channels with flatter cross sections erode more readily than channels with steep banks which is likely indicative of constraints on lateral adjustability imposed by consolidated or cohesive bank materials or vegetative root reinforcement millar and quick 1993 millar 2000 the negative correlation between s and real percent change of k is probably caused by continuity requirement eq 4 average watershed slope is found to be negatively correlated with absolute percent change of c consistent with the observation from section 4 2 1 that rivers in steeper watersheds are more stable this agrees with former research that rivers in mountainous areas are usually supply limited and have resistant boundaries that are less responsive to changing in driving forces montgomery and buffington 1997 montgomery and macdonald 2002 channel width and watershed area are negatively correlated with absolute change of b showing that channel width s contribution to discharge is relatively more less stable in the larger smaller study watersheds and wider narrower channels agreeing with qin et al 2020 that river stability tends to increase with watershed area the percentage of developed forested area is positively negatively correlated with the absolute change k indicating that flow velocity is relatively more stable in forested watersheds than in urban channels facing tc floods flow velocities in locations with vegetated banks and large instream roughness elements tend to be confined to narrower ranges zong and nepf 2010 curran and hession 2013 thus we would expect flow velocities to experience less change in forested areas than in more developed areas the percentage of developed forested area is negatively positively correlated with the absolute change of b showing that the lateral adjustability is more stable in developed watersheds than in forested ones this makes sense since urban channels are often anthropogenically confined more data on channel boundary materials and vegetation could help future study analyze the stability of the river channels in puerto rico li et al 2020 found that river channels can experience both significant instant and gradual changes as responses to floods brought by tcs from a broader view focusing on channel conveyance capacity how these conveyance capacity changes were achieved by river reaches however was not discussed in that paper we herein elaborated on how channels adjust their geometry and roughness changes of which can result in conveyance capacity changes and identified potential predictors that render the channel geometry and roughness changes brought by tc floods more qualitatively predictable in li et al 2020 we found that conveyance capacity could be abruptly changed by flood events typically from tcs that were of 10 year recurrence interval and above this capacity was also found to gradually recover from these changes toward a pre flood quasi equilibrium state a corresponding channel geometry recovery period seems likely but remains underexplored due to the scarcity of our data roughly monthly entries we were unable to construct time series of ahg parameters with high enough temporal resolution to monitor the recovery of these parameters in this study either the recovery rate and extent nevertheless are of high practical importance since it can help determine whether updated hydraulic geometry is needed for accurately predicting flood risks and also the frequency of the updates li et al 2022 it has been shown that climate vegetation density reach sinuosity drainage density watershed area and topography can influence both the channel responses to floods and subsequent recoveries baker 1977 costa 1974 wolman and gerson 1978 tropical regions usually have faster recovery than temperate regions wolman and gerson 1978 with some channels in tropical watersheds capable of returning to their pre flood states within one year of even very large floods costa 1974 other than continuous high temporal resolution field measurements future studies could also focus on other agents to understand whether large floods such as those from hurricane maria play an important role in shaping river channel morphology in pr one potential method is through analyses of sediments landslides and debris flows are important factors that contribute to the systematic redistribution of sediment west et al 2011 and by understanding their frequencies and recovery rates associated with major tcs we could infer channel geometric responses and recoveries in pr tcs that can cause landslide triggering rainfall events are relatively common scatena and larsen 1991 potentially facilitating such studies one such example is that of grande et al 2021 who analyzed river sediments in the guab√° basin in pr using isotope tracing and found that the concentration of 10bei increased linearly over the 18 months following hurricane maria to roughly the preflood level suggesting a recovery time of less than 2 years after major landsliding the frequency of major channel morphological changes and how fast river channels can recover from these changes together determine how often the channel geomorphology should be updated in flood risk management li et al 2022 the information can help in the future studies to understand how debris flows and landslides contribute to ahg parameter changes and how long these effects might persist other aspects such as whether ahg parameters recover at a same rate as other indicators and whether there are other key contributors to ahg change beyond channel erosion and debris flows are also required to fully answer the question that how frequently the ahg parameters change and how fast they can recover 4 5 potential applications of ahg parameter prediction the regression models presented in section 3 2 provide a means of predicting ahg parameters from watershed and river reach characteristics rather than from direct field measurements which may be costly and hard to maintain and unavailable for ungaged sites this could facilitate the application of ahg to discharge estimation and monitoring nasa s surface water and ocean topography satellite which is targeted to launch in 2022 can deliver maps of water surface elevation and river width at high resolution pedinotti et al 2014 while existing satellite platforms can provide river width estimates based on eqs 1 and 2 one could utilize such observations to estimate discharge at overpass times such simplified estimation of discharge could be a valuable supplement to current discharge monitoring systems especially in ungaged reaches and also help monitor flood occurrence and duration which are key to flood risk management ahg parameters themselves could be used as indicators of river channel status by constructing time series of ahg parameter values after major flood events and compare them with values before one could evaluate channel recovery former studies have applied similar ideas to monitor river restoration characteristics such as minimum flow depth and velocity jowett 1998 flow resistance comiti et al 2007 channel shape williams et al 2002 and even ecological characteristics such as oxygen deficit stout and frbp 1979 although we followed strict standards to screen and filter field measurements and watershed and river reach characteristics see section 2 2 measurement errors certainly remain the stated vertical accuracy of the lidar dem we used from noaa is 9 4 cm which can give a 95 ci of 18 5 cm ocm partners 2019 this may not be influential on average watershed elevation or slope due to the effects of this averaging impacts may be larger however on the accuracy of reach slopes not considered in this study and subsequent correlation results 5 summary and conclusions river cross sectional geometry plays a critical role in fluvial processes e g bennet and bridge 1995 guan et al 2016 malkinson and wittenberg 2007 power law at a station hydraulic geometry ahg formulations describing this geometry were introduced more than 60 years ago leopold and maddock 1953 and have been widely confirmed empirically and analyzed theoretically e g andreadis et al 2013 barefoot et al 2019 dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 the physical controls of ahg remain underexplored jia et al 2017 qin et al 2020 however especially in tropical areas which are generally less instrumented than more temperate zones in puerto rico the intense precipitation brought by tropical cyclones tcs has been shown before to cause substantial changes to channel conveyance capacity via sediment redistribution li et al 2020 that study failed to identify the mechanisms for such changes however here we examine ahg at 24 stream gage sites in puerto rico with a focus on understanding and modeling the upstream and river reach controls on ahg with one goal being ahg estimation at ungaged sites as well as how ahg responds to major tc induced floods ahg parameter estimates in this study are similar in magnitude to former studies in puerto rico lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 we found that these parameter estimates are correlated with a range of watershed and river reach characteristics and can be robustly predicted using multiple linear regression based on these characteristics we can reach acceptable accuracy relative rmses are usually between 10 and 30 using these models which could be used to predict ahg parameters in similar settings where cross sectional geometry data are lacking some sites showed distinct changes in ahg such as narrowed and deepened channels after large floods the large majority of which were caused by tcs certain watershed and river reach characteristics are predictive both of whether and how ahg parameters change in response to floods though this paper identified predictive watershed and river reach characteristics and discussed the possible physical causes further study likely including additional field observations are needed to provide better explanations of the underlying geomorphological processes more recent and continuous measurements of the characteristics could help better capture the watershed conditions as well as disturbances caused by tcs the models in this study showed a potential for prediction of ahg parameters supported by low error estimates in similar settings where cross sectional geometry data are lacking their applicability to other environmental settings however was beyond the scope of this work prediction of ahg parameter at ungaged sites together with advances in remote sensing technology can simplify discharge estimation and support a range of water and flood management activities the ahg parameters can also serve as indicators of river channel conditions which can be employed to assess aquatic habitat recovery and other restoration questions after major disturbances such as tc

7846,study region 24 stream gaging sites in puerto rico study focus at a station hydraulic geometry ahg which describes how channel width depth and velocity vary with discharge at a river cross section has long been used to study fluvial processes most prior ahg studies however focused on mid latitude temperate regions tropical zones including those affected by tropical cyclones tcs have received less attention this study analyzes spatial and temporal variability in ahg in puerto rico and identified the characteristics that correlate with ahg parameters these characteristics were then used to build regression models of these parameters new hydrological insights for the region model performance suggests that ahg can be predicted at ungaged locations in puerto rico the largest flood events mostly caused by major tcs were found to cause changes in all ahg parameters characteristics such as watershed land cover were found to be reliable predictors of ahg parameters reaches with steeper slopes were found to have limited lateral adjustability which may reflect consolidated bank materials watersheds with high percentages of forested area showed larger changes in the ahg velocity relationship related to changes in roughness but less vertical adjustability than more developed watersheds these results can help inform whether river channel properties in puerto rico and similar environments are resistant to the forces of tc induced flooding and how these properties are affected by such floods graphical abstract ga1 abbreviation ahg at a station hydraulic geometry tc

et al 2012 su et al 2015 and sand excavation zhang et al 2015 tropical cyclones tcs hit puerto rico pr frequently more than one annually on average are often associated with heavy and intense rainfall this rainfall combined with the steep mountainous terrain of pr and similar environments can produce some of the largest flood peaks per unit watershed area in the world ogden 2016 smith et al 2005 these floods can cause landslides debris flows mass wasting and fluvial erosion which redistribute large amounts of sediment along the river west et al 2011 and are capable of causing systematic lateral and vertical channel adjustments e g yousefi et al 2018 li et al 2020 found that channel conveyance capacity can change substantially as a result of tc flooding that study did not however examine how these changes manifest in terms of channel geometric properties and failed to isolate upstream watershed characteristics or local river reach influence e g slope land cover that could explain the observed conveyance capacity evolution at a station hydraulic geometry ahg provides a mechanism of studying channel morphology and its changes leopold and maddock 1953 it describes the relationships between discharge vs water surface width mean depth and mean velocity at individual river cross sections power law formulations have long been used to model ahg and these formulations have been widely applied to understand river geomorphology e g andreadis et al 2013 barefoot et al 2019 knighton and wharton 2014 leopold et al 1964 reid et al 2010 stewardson 2005 the standard ahg formulation which first appeared in leopold and maddock 1953 is 1 w a q b 2 d c q f 3 v k q m where w is channel width typically the wetted width d is the hydraulic depth i e cross sectional area divided by w v is mean stream velocity and q is the instantaneous discharge the requirement of continuity 4 q wdv ack q b f m implies the constraints ack 1 and b f m 1 the coefficients a c and k describe the relative magnitude of channel width channel depth and velocity or roughness while the exponents b f and m provide insight into how channel width channel depth and velocity roughness change with discharge notwithstanding the constraints above the coefficients and exponents from eqs 1 4 can vary substantially from place to place morel et al 2020b park 1977 and researchers have yet to fully reveal the physical principles that underly ahg behavior jia et al 2017 morel et al 2019 though not for lack of trying e g dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 watershed and river reach characteristics that have been shown to explain some observed ahg variability include drainage area qin et al 2020 watershed orientation and channel substrate turowski et al 2008 suspended sediment load wang et al 2006 and reach slope david et al 2010 while recent work has built predictive models for ahg exponents b f and m morel et al 2019 2020a the coefficients a c and k have received less attention morel et al 2020a qin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 turowski et al 2008 relationships have also been shown between ahg parameters from various cross sections within individual river systems dingman 2007 found that there are theoretical interdependencies among ahg coefficients and exponents turowski et al 2008 found that the relationship between the ratio f b and the exponent b follows a power law for data from taiwan gleason and smith 2014 found that local ahg coefficient and exponent pairs a and b c and f k and m from different locations along the same river follow log linear relationships they termed this at many station hydraulic geometry barber and gleason 2018 then verified that most rivers in continental u s follow at many station hydraulic geometry the empirical at many station hydraulic geometry was reconciled theoretically with ahg by brinkerhoff et al 2019 analyses of temporal changes in ahg and its causes remain relatively rare qin et al 2020 and most existing studies are confined to the mid latitudes data limitations mean that ahg in more tropical zones with their unique hydroclimatic and geologic conditions have been less studied see lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 and turowski et al 2008 for exceptions this study attempts to connect the findings of li et al 2020 with the ahg framework by examining the watershed and river reach determinants of ahg including whether or not it is feasible to estimate ahg at ungaged sites and also by evaluating the potential for ahg response to major flood events which are almost always caused by tcs in puerto rico li et al 2020 such findings could be valuable for applications such as simplified discharge estimation huang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 with a suitable ahg relationship between width and discharge and or between water surface elevations and discharge one can obtain reasonably accurate estimates of discharge based on channel widths and water surface elevations measured from in situ or remotely sensed imagery identification of relevant watershed and river reach characteristics and subsequent transferal to ungaged sites meanwhile could be used to inform flood risk management river restoration and related actions here we hypothesize that upstream watershed and river reach characteristics can predict ahg parameters at our study sites and ahg parameters will change after extreme flood events this study examined ahg parameters for 24 sites in pr correlation analyses were used to identify the watershed and river reach characteristics that are potentially predictive of ahg parameter estimates these characteristics were used to build multiple linear regression models for each parameter with cross validation used to evaluate their applicability to ungaged sites channel geometry responses to tc floods were examined by calculating changes in ahg parameters after major storms and comparing changes to watershed and river reach characteristics the methodology including study region and data used in this study is described in section 2 results follow in section 3 while discussion and conclusions are provided in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methodology 2 1 study region puerto rico pr is a mountainous island located in the northeast caribbean the average elevation of the mountainous middle part exceeds 1300 m above sea level masl while the average elevation of the less steep margin is about 500 masl annual precipitation ranges from around 500 cm for the mountainous center to 100 400 cm in the coastal lowlands daly et al 2003 a monsoon season begins in may and usually lasts until october overlapping with the june november north atlantic tc season limited by the island s aspect and east west mountain range its rivers generally range from 10 kilometers to about 50 kilometers in length with the longest rio de la plata measuring 74 kilometers and from 10 m to more than 60 m in width 2 2 data our ahg estimation relied on field measurements of channel geometry and velocity which the us geological survey usgs performs at stream gage sites on a regular basis roughly monthly to maintain accurate rating curves which are then used for continuous discharge estimation u s geological survey 2021a 2021b these field measurements were obtained from the national water information system nwis maintained by the usgs u s geological survey 2021a 2021b annual instantaneous peak discharges u s geological survey 2021a 2021b were used to identify the date with the largest flood in each site s record we applied rigorous screening to identify suitable usgs stream gage stations sites with recorded flags indicating influence by nearby dams as well as those located in the vicinity of man made structures such as weirs were excluded due to their influence on ahg reisenb√ºchler et al 2019 field measurement records in pr available through nwis usually start around 1990 though several sites records date back to the early 1980 s if a station is reported to have experienced datum changes we avoided all observations before the most recent datum change the site was excluded from the analysis if the most recent datum change occurred later than 1990 we applied the data accuracy criteria of slater et al 2015 who only considered field measurements in which the discharge is within one percent of the product of channel velocity and cross sectional channel area as reported by the usgs and those made in close proximity to the gage station within 300 feet 91 m usually only less than 10 of the field measurements were made directly at the gaged cross section only sites that have continuous daily discharge records in the same period of the field measurements were included the study period ends in february 2020 24 sites satisfied these criteria fig 1 table s1 the limited number of sites in the northwestern portion of the island is linked to the lower drainage density there upstream watershed and river reach characteristics were obtained or estimated from public gis and remote sensing resources and used to calculate correlations with and to predict ahg parameters falcone 2011 ocm partners 2019 u s geological survey 2006 watershed boundaries along with the upstream drainage area corresponding to each stream gage were downloaded from nwis u s geological survey 2021a 2021b watershed averaged elevation and slope were calculated for each gage based on a digital elevation model dem from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information office for coastal management which was built from lidar points with horizontal resolution of 0 7 m and stated vertical accuracy of 9 4 cm ocm partners 2019 we matched the reach segment from the river network u s geological survey 2006 to each of the 24 gauging sites and then measured the reach slope and sinuosity of the reach channel widths the width between river banks at each gage site were estimated via remote sensing imagery available through the google earth application taken in february 2020 percentages of developed forested and planted agricultural areas were obtained from the usgs gages ii dataset falcone 2011 note that land use metrics are static i e only available at the time point when gages ii data were taken in 2001 limitations stemming from this are discussed further in section 4 2 3 hydraulic geometry parameter estimation to study spatial variation of the hydraulic geometry we fitted power law models to the entire period of field measurements to get parameter estimates for each site see black lines in fig 2 for examples the parameter values in eqs 1 3 were estimated via the nonlinear least squares nls regression function in the r programming language r core team 2020 the residuals of each nls regression model were examined for homoscedasticity independence and normality using the package nlstools e g fig s1 baty et al 2015 units used in this study are m 3 s for discharge m for depth and width and m s for velocity the resulting units for a c and k are s m 2 s m 2 and m 3 respectively channel surface water widths and mean velocities were used to fit channel eqs 1 and 3 respectively while hydraulic mean depths in eq 2 were calculated by dividing flow areas by surface water widths after barber and gleason 2018 brinkerhoff et al 2019 doll et al 2002 shen et al 2016 the fitted parameters obtained via nls did not strictly satisfy continuity constraints eq 4 though nearly so results not shown the product of the coefficients were usually within 1 0 15 while the sum of the exponents were usually within 1 0 05 we thus applied a normalization used in prior studies jowett 1998 lee et al 2019 park 1977 to enforce continuity eqs 5 and 6 5 a adjusted a fitted a fitted c fitted k fitted 1 3 similar for c and k 6 b adjusted b fitted b fitted f fitted m fitted similar for f and m we also reproduced all subsequent analyses without this normalization results with and without normalization were nearly equivalent results without normalization are omitted for brevity eqs 1 and 2 imply that channel cross sectional geometry can be described by an equation of the form 7 d c a f b w f b eq 7 shows that depth is proportional to the surface water width to the power f b prior studies have examined f b as an indicator of channel cross sectional shape ferguson 1986 qin et al 2020 turowski et al 2008 for example width is proportional to depth when f b 1 implying a triangular cross section while f b 2 implies a parabolic form when b 0 f b would be infinity implying that the wetted width does not increase with discharge as in a rectangular cross section f b 1 represents a convex upwards curved channel section indicative of a cut bank point bar form with width increasing more than depth for medium to high discharges see fig 3 in ferguson 1986 the ratio c a f b which indicates relative bank steepness for a particular value of f b is absent from earlier studies we calculated f b and c a f b from our ahg estimates and refer to them as bank shape parameters 2 4 watershed and river reach characteristics and correlation analyses upstream watershed and reach scale characteristics were estimated to examine their relationships to ahg parameters and these parameters responses to floods other than the characteristics introduced in the section 2 2 we included three additional variables following morel et al 2019 froude number at median discharge of all available field measurements for each site f 50 the median width to depth ratio r wh and normalized active channel width w n these are calculated as 8 f 50 q 50 g 0 5 h 50 w 50 9 r wh w 50 h 50 10 w n channel width watershed area 0 42 where q 50 is median discharge w 50 and h 50 are reach average wetted width and depth at q 50 respectively finally the normalized two year flood calculated as the median of annual instantaneous peak flows from nwis divided by the upstream drainage area which is indicative of channel bankfull discharge and has been applied in stream flow studies leopold et al 1964 yu et al 2019 was included to describe the peakiness of a watershed s flood regime kendall s tau nonparametric rank correlation kendall 1938 was used to identify relationships between watershed reach characteristics and ahg parameters 2 5 ahg predictive regression models we used a stepwise process to develop models to predict ahg parameters based on watershed and river reach characteristics we began by creating multiple linear regression models for each ahg parameter based on all available predictors these were reduced to final predictive models via trial and error in order to balance model predictive power and complexity final models were those with the highest adjusted r squared values some variables such as channel width reach slope and f 50 were not used in the models due to collinearity among predictors following morel et al 2019 we took the natural log and the square root of elevation and watershed area respectively before considering them as predictors to evaluate the potential predictive power of the final regression models at similar ungaged sites in puerto rico as well as to avoid overfitting we performed k fold cross validation commonly applied to hydrologic hydraulic and ecologic models for uncertainty estimation e g esmaeelzadeh et al 2015 jung et al 2020 mamat et al 2021 nelson et al 2018 to estimate the root mean square error of the predicted values of each parameter the k fold cross validation randomly partitions data into k groups with nearly equal size and then fits the model with k 1 folds and the left out fold is used to validate the fit and validate process is repeated k times until each of the k folds has been used for validation geisser 1975 the choice of k is usually 5 or 10 since these values have been shown empirically to have error estimates relatively resistant to both high bias and high variance james et al 2021 it has been suggested to perform 10 fold cross validation 10 times to obtain reliable accuracy estimates bouckaert 2003 witten et al 2011 we followed this guidance in our analysis each fold contained two of our study sites while four sites were reserved for testing the four testing sites which were randomly drawn are 50136400 50063800 50113800 and 50124200 2 6 ahg temporal variation due to tropical cyclones li et al 2020 showed that recent major tcs primarily hurricanes hortense 1996 georges 1998 and maria 2017 caused substantial changes in river channel conveyance capacity in pr this earlier work however did little to elucidate more specific geomorphic changes ahg parameters can indeed change substantially in response to tcs see the red and blue lines in fig 2 which show distinct ahg relationships estimated before and after major storms we identified the largest local flood event the largest annual peak streamflow value for each site to separate the field measurements into two time series before and after this largest local flood event hurricanes hortense and georges caused the largest flood events at six sites each while hurricane maria caused the largest flood at ten others the largest floods at the two remaining sites were caused by non tc storms we again followed the methodology in section 2 3 to estimate ahg parameters see section 3 3 but only for periods four years before and four years after these identified flood events we calculated before and after percentage changes in ahg parameters including bank shape parameters by subtracting the values after the largest flood event from the values before and dividing the difference by the latter value these changes were then tested for correlation with watershed and river reach characteristics using the nonparametric rank correlation mentioned in section 2 4 we extracted the peak discharges of the local largest flood events u s geological survey 2021a 2021b and divided them by the 2 year peak discharge which as aforementioned is an indicator of the bankfull discharge at the same site to get normalized discharges of the largest local flood events these normalized flood discharges were included as an additional characteristic in the correlation analysis specific to ahg parameter changes caused by floods 3 results 3 1 ahg parameter estimates and correlation tests the power law models fit reasonably well p values much less than 0 05 to all six parameters at all sites except for velocity at site 50064200 which yielded a p value of 0 056 table s2 the average values for the exponents were 0 230 0 394 and 0 376 for b f and m respectively a ternary plot fig 3a shows similar distributions of exponents from this study and from the earlier ahg studies in pr from lewis 1969 and phillips and scatena 2013 the results are also similar to those from leopold and maddock 1953 in the mainland midwestern united states and leopold and miller 1956 in mainland ephemeral rivers results not shown similarly to phillips and scatena s 2013 observations we found that the width exponent is generally less than 0 33 with only one exception of b 0 344 relationships between ahg parameter estimates and the various watershed and reach characteristics are tabulated in terms of kendall s tau correlation table 1 while those of most obvious interest are shown in additional ternary plots fig 3b d upstream watershed area was found to be positively negatively correlated with f m p 0 014 for both f and m while both percentage of developed area and planted area were negatively positively correlated with f m p 0 001 for correlations between percentage of developed area and both f and m p 0 001 for correlation between percentage of planted area and f and p 0 004 for correlation between percentage of planted area and m average upstream watershed elevation slope and the percentage of forested area were found to be negatively positively correlated with f m p 0 001 between average upstream watershed elevation and f p 0 004 between average upstream watershed elevation and m p 0 001 between average upstream watershed slope and both f and m p 0 039 between percentage of forested area and f and p 0 008 between percentage of forested area and m no characteristics were found to be associated with b and no other characteristics were found to be correlated with any exponents upstream watershed area average watershed elevation channel width average reach slope r wh f 50 and w n were also found to be correlated with some coefficients table 1 the channel shape parameters f b and a c f b are negatively and positively correlated respectively with average watershed elevation with p values of 0 015 and 0 004 respectively upstream watershed area is also found to be negatively correlated with a c f b p 0 009 while average upstream watershed slope is found to be negatively correlated with f b p 0 034 the ratio f b was found to be negatively correlated p 0 015 with average watershed elevation indicating that higher elevation rivers in pr tend toward more triangular and less rectangular channel cross sectional shapes turowski et al 2008 found a strong log log relationship between the bank shape parameter f b and the exponent b for average parameter values in different studies by comparing our data with prior studies david et al 2010 lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 qin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 turowski et al 2008 we found that this relationship appears to hold across a wide range of studies and study locations the range of coefficients of the models fit separately to each of the five studies shown on fig 4 is 0 15 0 33 the range of exponents is 1 42 1 01 the coefficient and exponent of the model fit to our data are 0 22 and 1 35 respectively which are within the range the model fit range also contains the equation in turowski et al 2008 fig 4 gray line f b 0 28 0 06 b 1 12 0 07 this confirms that in puerto rico as in other locations general steep banked channels lead to smaller exponent b which is indicative of width being less adjustable which can be caused by consolidated bank materials like cohesive soils that are common in cases of steep banks 3 2 ahg predictive models by compiling the watershed and river reach characteristics we not only found the characteristics that are correlated to ahg parameters but were able to build models to predict their values which were missing from the studies we compared in fig 4 the final regression models to predict ahg parameters section 2 5 are shown in table 2 along with r squared values and overall model p values among the three coefficients exponents k b is least well predicted in terms of adjusted r squared the regression model for b is the only one not significant at the 5 level when subject to 10 fold cross validation all regression based models can predict parameter values with relative root mean square error rrmse rmse divided by the average parameter value between 10 and 30 except for the model for b which results in 30 4 morel et al 2019 2020a built predictive models for ahg exponents on a continental scale by data from france and new zealand with rmse ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 unitless our models generally showed 1 magnitude of order lower rmse for exponents which may be caused by a much smaller scale and more consistent environmental settings our models also provided predictions for ahg coefficients which are necessary information for discharge estimation but are not discussed in prior studies 3 3 hydraulic geometry response to tropical cyclones we re estimated ahg parameters for each site using two periods four years before and after the largest local flood event i e the highest single instantaneous flood peak for each site see section 2 6 both the percent differences between the before and after parameter values and the absolute value of these differences were calculated the absolute values are generally indicative of the overall tendency of a site s ahg relations to change in response to a major flood while the real difference provides the direction of that change the differences in the parameter values of the largest local flood event are shown in fig 5 percent changes in parameter values are evident at most sites and for all parameters the changes in the depth exponent f tend to be positive in the northeastern part of the island and negative in western puerto rico no obvious spatial patterns were evident for other parameters we then computed correlations between these parameter value changes and the various watershed and river reach characteristics table 3 r wh s and w n are positively correlated with the real percent difference of a p 0 034 0 034 0 039 respectively while s is also negatively correlated p 0 034 with the real percent difference in k normalized two year flood and f 50 are positively correlated with the shape coefficient c a f b p values are 0 042 and 0 03 respectively the percentage of forested developed area is negatively positively correlated with the absolute percent difference of k with p values of 0 03 0 008 the percentage of forested developed area is also positively negatively correlated with the absolute percent difference of b with p values of 0 003 0 009 watershed area channel width and the percentage of planted area are also negatively correlated with the absolute percent difference of b p 0 008 0 033 0 021 respectively the percentage of planted area average watershed slope is positively negatively correlated with the absolute percent change of c with p 0 036 p 0 017 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies the average values of the exponents b f m obtained in this study are 0 230 0 394 and 0 376 respectively which are close to lewis 1969 and phillips and scatena 2013 results in puerto rico fig 3a leopold and maddock s results in the midwest us leopold and maddock 1953 and leopold and miller s results in ephemeral streams in us leopold and miller 1956 the b and f values agree with the prior work in puerto rico phillips and scatena 2013 in that width b contributes a smaller component than depth f and velocity m and never exceeds one third with one slight minor exception of b 0 34 in 14 sites velocity has the largest exponent while depth has the largest exponent in the other 10 sites width never had the largest exponent similar to qin et al 2020 the ratio f b describes the shape of river banks ferguson 1986 ranging from 0 93 to 12 89 in this study with the median of 1 44 the majority of sites have ratios within or near the range 1 2 indicating that the majority of channel cross sections are either triangular or parabolic the ratio at some sites however are higher highlighting that there does exist a diversity of channel cross sectional shapes in puerto rico including ones closer to rectangular the log log linear relationship between the shape parameter f b and b are significant for both our data and a collection of parameters from former studies conducted in puerto rico colorado in the mountainous western united states and the yellow river in china the fitted equations are all close to what turowski et al 2008 found using average values from other studies despite the strong log log relationship between f b and b we found that this relationship did not predict b as well as the regression based model for that parameter rmse and rrmse of b estimates based on the log linear model are 0 61 and 265 this may be due to the requisite log and exponential transformations nonetheless the high similarity of the log log linear relationship among different studies in highly varied geographic regions suggests the potential to estimate channel shape from the exponent b 4 2 hydraulic parameters and watershed and river reach characteristics 4 2 1 exponents the characteristics that were significantly correlated with the depth exponent f were inversely correlated with the velocity exponent m table 1 which is not unexpected due to the continuity requirement eq 4 these characteristics include upstream drainage area the percentages of developed forested and planted area average upstream watershed slope and elevation our results are consistent with klein 1981 and qin et al 2020 in that depth is a greater contributor for higher discharges in large rivers positive correlation between watershed area and f while width contributes more in small streams negative but weak p 0 9 correlation between upstream watershed area and b no watershed or river reach characteristics were found to be significant correlated with the width exponent b at the 5 level phillips and scatena 2013 found that while velocity has a larger exponent for rural channels in puerto rico depth contributes to a larger exponent extent in urban catchments our correlation results agree with this finding the percentage of developed forested area of a watershed is positively negatively correlated with the depth exponent f and negatively positively with the velocity exponent m this is further supported by the significant and positive correlation between f m and percentage of developed area kendall s tau 0 54 p 10 4 cohesive banks are common in both developed and forested watersheds with stable banks the river channels have limited lateral adjustability millar and quick 1993 millar 2000 this potentially explains why land cover metrics were not significantly correlated with b the positive correlation between f and the percentage of developed area indicates that the channels tend to adjust vertically in more developed watersheds than in more forested watersheds which agrees with previous research showing that channels in urbanized environments are often prone to incision booth 1990 cole et al 2017 in forested watersheds wood load can contribute to flow resistance and is subject to adjustments from frequent and flashy floods cadol and wohl 2013 in support of the positive correlation between m adjustability of channel roughness and percent forested area the average elevation and slope of the watersheds are highly correlated kendall s tau 0 58 p 10 4 and thus yield similar correlations with f negative and m positive ran et al 2012 and others have concluded that mountainous bedrock channels are typically stable meaning scour and infill are negligible this agrees with the observations in pike et al 2010 that channels of higher elevation in northeastern puerto rico are usually more resistant to erosion due to stable river bed materials such as granite while channels of lower elevation are usually in alluvium this likely explains our result that higher elevation and steeper i e more mountainous watersheds accommodate increasing discharge primarily through velocity positive correlation with m rather than depth negative correlation with f further field studies of river bed and soil material can improve understanding of the lithologic controls on ahg parameters 4 2 2 coefficients and bank shape parameters average watershed elevation was found to be negatively correlated with f b kendall s tau 0 36 p 0 015 table 2 and positively correlated with c a f b kendall s tau 0 41 p 0 004 table 2 since most channels have forms between triangular f b 1 and parabolic f b 2 this correlation suggests that lower elevation channels tend to be parabolic with a gradually sloped banks while the higher elevation channels tend to be triangular with steeper banks this can be explained by the difference of channel substrate higher elevation watersheds are usually in mountainous areas with bedrock channels while rivers in lower elevation areas carry more alluvium which can be shaped into parabolic forms ran et al 2012 the coefficients in eqs 1 3 are unit dependent and are usually treated as values of width depth or velocity when the discharge equals one unit m 3 s in our case dingman and afshari 2018 the coefficients are general indicators of a channel s width depth and roughness how these characteristics influence discharges at different flow levels is determined by exponents for example in ran et al 2012 a wide channel with highly cohesive steep banks result in a high value of a and a relatively small value of b upstream drainage area was significantly correlated with a positive and c negative and negatively but insignificantly correlated with k this is similar to qin et al 2020 and suggests that channels in the larger watersheds in puerto rico are generally more wide than deep in terms of cross sectional geometric controls on discharge channel width is positively correlated with a confirming the interpretation of a as a scale factor for channel width ran et al 2012 the positive correlation between channel width and k can be explained by continuity eq 4 reach slope is found to be negatively correlated with a in support of that channels with greater slope have lower width to depth ratios due to less lateral adjustability of resistant bank material the positive correlation between average watershed elevation and c shows that mountainous channels in puerto rico are usually deep consistent with the observation mentioned above that channels at high elevations are more likely to be triangular rather than parabolic high values of normalized active channel width reflect wide channels relative to catchment size by eq 7 morel et al 2019 which could be indicative of increases in roughness associated with feedbacks between channel width and instream wood loading negative correlation between normalized active channel width and k table 1 agreeing with former studies in that wood load increases flow resistance cadol and wohl 2013 curran and hession 2013 mcbride et al 2007 2008 coefficients are more influential when values of the variable width depth and velocity are low while exponents are more influential for high values to demonstrate we considered ahg parameters together with published flood stages obtained from national weather service national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2021 to predict bankfull discharges based on eq 2 we found that on average exponents are more influential than coefficients at determining bankfull discharge at flood stage for example a 1 increase in f can resulted in an average decrease in bankfull discharge of 7 1 while a 1 increase in c gave only an average decrease of 2 9 it should be noted however that few sites have direct discharge measurements near or above these flood stages see also li et al 2020 for discussion on this and other limitations in the pr field measurements so these results should be taken with a grain of salt this calls for further data to better understand the influence of both coefficients and exponents at flood discharges 4 3 predictive models the k fold error estimates reach an acceptable level of accuracy suggested by the rrmse the rmse rrmses for estimates of b f and m are 0 072 30 4 0 076 18 7 and 0 052 14 6 respectively the rmse and p values are generally lower and r squared values generally higher than the predictive models from morel et al 2019 likely due to a much reduced geographic scope and thus a smaller more homogeneous set of sites the rmse rrmse for coefficients a c and k are 2 5 s m 2 19 2 0 055 s m 2 21 1 and 0 10 m 2 29 1 respectively the high rmse though not rrmse of a is due to its wide range and much higher magnitude compared to other parameters the regression models not only yielded reliable estimates of the parameters at the study sites but show the potential to predict parameter values for ungaged sites in similar environmental settings the rmses rrmses for estimates of b f and m are 0 045 22 1 0 055 17 3 and 0 068 14 2 respectively at the testing sites the rmse rrmse for coefficients a c and k are 3 2 s m 2 26 9 0 02 s m 2 6 8 and 0 07 m 2 24 3 respectively note that the rrmses are calculated as the ratio between rmse and the average parameter values since test data have different averages than training data there can be some parameters with higher rmse but lower rrmse e g m the generally lower rrmse at testing sites than the training data during cross validation supports the predictive ability of our regression models whether the multiple linear regression models are suitable for parameter prediction in a different environmental settings as well as the specific set of characteristics and the weights of each characteristic used in the model however needs to be determined using field measurements and other region specific data in addition temporal changes in predictors due to tcs or other drivers were not considered in these predictive models but may be important this limitation is discussed further in the next subsection the land use data used in this study are from 2001 falcone 2011 while the usgs streamflow measurements spanned from roughly 1990 2020 most of the characteristics other than land use information were calculated based on the 2016 2017 lidar dem from noaa office for coastal management ocm partners 2019 which was obtained shortly before hurricane maria as a consequence we didn t examine how land use metrics co vary temporally with ahg higher frequency land use and elevation data could help more fully reveal the watershed and reach controls on ahg and would also likely yield more accurate predictive models of ahg unfortunately such data were not available to us 4 4 tropical cyclone effects on ahg the normalized two year flood is positively correlated with real i e not absolute percent change of c a f b indicating that greater flashiness can steepen shapes after floods possibly as a result of channel incision e g schumm et al 1984 simon and rinaldi 2006 wallerstein and thorne 2004 s is positively correlated with the real percent change of a showing that in meandering channels channel widths tend to increase after floods this is consistent with the expectation that sinuous channels are fully alluvial with laterally adjustable channel boundaries r wh and w n are also positively correlate with real percent change of a showing that banks in channels with flatter cross sections erode more readily than channels with steep banks which is likely indicative of constraints on lateral adjustability imposed by consolidated or cohesive bank materials or vegetative root reinforcement millar and quick 1993 millar 2000 the negative correlation between s and real percent change of k is probably caused by continuity requirement eq 4 average watershed slope is found to be negatively correlated with absolute percent change of c consistent with the observation from section 4 2 1 that rivers in steeper watersheds are more stable this agrees with former research that rivers in mountainous areas are usually supply limited and have resistant boundaries that are less responsive to changing in driving forces montgomery and buffington 1997 montgomery and macdonald 2002 channel width and watershed area are negatively correlated with absolute change of b showing that channel width s contribution to discharge is relatively more less stable in the larger smaller study watersheds and wider narrower channels agreeing with qin et al 2020 that river stability tends to increase with watershed area the percentage of developed forested area is positively negatively correlated with the absolute change k indicating that flow velocity is relatively more stable in forested watersheds than in urban channels facing tc floods flow velocities in locations with vegetated banks and large instream roughness elements tend to be confined to narrower ranges zong and nepf 2010 curran and hession 2013 thus we would expect flow velocities to experience less change in forested areas than in more developed areas the percentage of developed forested area is negatively positively correlated with the absolute change of b showing that the lateral adjustability is more stable in developed watersheds than in forested ones this makes sense since urban channels are often anthropogenically confined more data on channel boundary materials and vegetation could help future study analyze the stability of the river channels in puerto rico li et al 2020 found that river channels can experience both significant instant and gradual changes as responses to floods brought by tcs from a broader view focusing on channel conveyance capacity how these conveyance capacity changes were achieved by river reaches however was not discussed in that paper we herein elaborated on how channels adjust their geometry and roughness changes of which can result in conveyance capacity changes and identified potential predictors that render the channel geometry and roughness changes brought by tc floods more qualitatively predictable in li et al 2020 we found that conveyance capacity could be abruptly changed by flood events typically from tcs that were of 10 year recurrence interval and above this capacity was also found to gradually recover from these changes toward a pre flood quasi equilibrium state a corresponding channel geometry recovery period seems likely but remains underexplored due to the scarcity of our data roughly monthly entries we were unable to construct time series of ahg parameters with high enough temporal resolution to monitor the recovery of these parameters in this study either the recovery rate and extent nevertheless are of high practical importance since it can help determine whether updated hydraulic geometry is needed for accurately predicting flood risks and also the frequency of the updates li et al 2022 it has been shown that climate vegetation density reach sinuosity drainage density watershed area and topography can influence both the channel responses to floods and subsequent recoveries baker 1977 costa 1974 wolman and gerson 1978 tropical regions usually have faster recovery than temperate regions wolman and gerson 1978 with some channels in tropical watersheds capable of returning to their pre flood states within one year of even very large floods costa 1974 other than continuous high temporal resolution field measurements future studies could also focus on other agents to understand whether large floods such as those from hurricane maria play an important role in shaping river channel morphology in pr one potential method is through analyses of sediments landslides and debris flows are important factors that contribute to the systematic redistribution of sediment west et al 2011 and by understanding their frequencies and recovery rates associated with major tcs we could infer channel geometric responses and recoveries in pr tcs that can cause landslide triggering rainfall events are relatively common scatena and larsen 1991 potentially facilitating such studies one such example is that of grande et al 2021 who analyzed river sediments in the guab√° basin in pr using isotope tracing and found that the concentration of 10bei increased linearly over the 18 months following hurricane maria to roughly the preflood level suggesting a recovery time of less than 2 years after major landsliding the frequency of major channel morphological changes and how fast river channels can recover from these changes together determine how often the channel geomorphology should be updated in flood risk management li et al 2022 the information can help in the future studies to understand how debris flows and landslides contribute to ahg parameter changes and how long these effects might persist other aspects such as whether ahg parameters recover at a same rate as other indicators and whether there are other key contributors to ahg change beyond channel erosion and debris flows are also required to fully answer the question that how frequently the ahg parameters change and how fast they can recover 4 5 potential applications of ahg parameter prediction the regression models presented in section 3 2 provide a means of predicting ahg parameters from watershed and river reach characteristics rather than from direct field measurements which may be costly and hard to maintain and unavailable for ungaged sites this could facilitate the application of ahg to discharge estimation and monitoring nasa s surface water and ocean topography satellite which is targeted to launch in 2022 can deliver maps of water surface elevation and river width at high resolution pedinotti et al 2014 while existing satellite platforms can provide river width estimates based on eqs 1 and 2 one could utilize such observations to estimate discharge at overpass times such simplified estimation of discharge could be a valuable supplement to current discharge monitoring systems especially in ungaged reaches and also help monitor flood occurrence and duration which are key to flood risk management ahg parameters themselves could be used as indicators of river channel status by constructing time series of ahg parameter values after major flood events and compare them with values before one could evaluate channel recovery former studies have applied similar ideas to monitor river restoration characteristics such as minimum flow depth and velocity jowett 1998 flow resistance comiti et al 2007 channel shape williams et al 2002 and even ecological characteristics such as oxygen deficit stout and frbp 1979 although we followed strict standards to screen and filter field measurements and watershed and river reach characteristics see section 2 2 measurement errors certainly remain the stated vertical accuracy of the lidar dem we used from noaa is 9 4 cm which can give a 95 ci of 18 5 cm ocm partners 2019 this may not be influential on average watershed elevation or slope due to the effects of this averaging impacts may be larger however on the accuracy of reach slopes not considered in this study and subsequent correlation results 5 summary and conclusions river cross sectional geometry plays a critical role in fluvial processes e g bennet and bridge 1995 guan et al 2016 malkinson and wittenberg 2007 power law at a station hydraulic geometry ahg formulations describing this geometry were introduced more than 60 years ago leopold and maddock 1953 and have been widely confirmed empirically and analyzed theoretically e g andreadis et al 2013 barefoot et al 2019 dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 the physical controls of ahg remain underexplored jia et al 2017 qin et al 2020 however especially in tropical areas which are generally less instrumented than more temperate zones in puerto rico the intense precipitation brought by tropical cyclones tcs has been shown before to cause substantial changes to channel conveyance capacity via sediment redistribution li et al 2020 that study failed to identify the mechanisms for such changes however here we examine ahg at 24 stream gage sites in puerto rico with a focus on understanding and modeling the upstream and river reach controls on ahg with one goal being ahg estimation at ungaged sites as well as how ahg responds to major tc induced floods ahg parameter estimates in this study are similar in magnitude to former studies in puerto rico lewis 1969 phillips and scatena 2013 we found that these parameter estimates are correlated with a range of watershed and river reach characteristics and can be robustly predicted using multiple linear regression based on these characteristics we can reach acceptable accuracy relative rmses are usually between 10 and 30 using these models which could be used to predict ahg parameters in similar settings where cross sectional geometry data are lacking some sites showed distinct changes in ahg such as narrowed and deepened channels after large floods the large majority of which were caused by tcs certain watershed and river reach characteristics are predictive both of whether and how ahg parameters change in response to floods though this paper identified predictive watershed and river reach characteristics and discussed the possible physical causes further study likely including additional field observations are needed to provide better explanations of the underlying geomorphological processes more recent and continuous measurements of the characteristics could help better capture the watershed conditions as well as disturbances caused by tcs the models in this study showed a potential for prediction of ahg parameters supported by low error estimates in similar settings where cross sectional geometry data are lacking their applicability to other environmental settings however was beyond the scope of this work prediction of ahg parameter at ungaged sites together with advances in remote sensing technology can simplify discharge estimation and support a range of water and flood management activities the ahg parameters can also serve as indicators of river channel conditions which can be employed to assess aquatic habitat recovery and other restoration questions after major disturbances such as tc

7847,study region karkheh and karun basins 29 35 n 46 52 e are two large river basins area 51 000 and 67 000 km2 respectively with complex topography in southwest iran study focus access to spatio temporally consistent precipitation data is a key requirement for hydrological studies especially in data scarce regions this study evaluated 14 global precipitation products against gauge observations from 2003 to 2012 in karun and karkheh basins southwest iran different categorical and statistical indices at varying spatial and temporal resolution including kling gupta efficiency kge bias correlation coefficient and variability ratio were used to evaluate the products new hydrological insights for the region for daily time steps tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and cmorph bldv1 0 outperformed all other products with kge 0 3 tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and persiann cdr were the best performing products for monthly time steps with kge 0 5 era5 land showed the highest positive bias bias 1 5 compared with in situ observations particularly for mountainous southeastern parts of karun basin overall bias adjusted products obtained by merging ground based observations in the estimations outperformed the unadjusted versions the spatial distribution of statistical error metrics indicated that almost all products showed their greatest uncertainties for mountainous regions due to complex precipitation processes in these regions these results can contribute significantly to hydrological and water resources planning measures in the study region including early flood

affects surface runoff soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and several other hydro climatic variables ghajarnia et al 2021 kalantari et al 2019 markonis et al 2019 2021 owing to its close interactions with other land atmospheric variables reliable estimation of precipitation is of particular interest and critical importance in a variety of fields such as water resources management hydrological modeling global energy analysis climate modeling and agricultural studies asante et al 2007 carrera hernandez and gaskin 2007 funk et al 2014 huffman et al 1997 kucera et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 ground based observations provide the most accurate precipitation measurements sun et al 2018 however in inaccessible and remote areas and in many developing countries gauge records are either incomplete or non existent mostly due to the high cost of gauge installation and maintenance salio et al 2015 sun et al 2018 these spatial gaps in precipitation measurements together with the common inconsistencies in gauge records make it difficult to provide an unbiased view of precipitation at global scale brunetti et al 2006 different high resolution precipitation estimation products have been developed in recent decades with increasing use of remote sensing techniques and enhanced computational capacities these state of the art global and quasi global products can be divided into four categories 1 reanalysis products 2 gridded ground based observations 3 satellite based products and 4 climate data records cdrs hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b saemian et al 2021 these spatio temporally consistent products are potentially good alternatives for ground based observations and can address some of the disadvantages and uncertainties of gauge records but must be examined thoroughly before use to ensure their reliability and accuracy shayeghi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 therefore numerous studies have focused on evaluating the performance of precipitation estimation products across regions of the world with differing geographical and climate conditions these studies have been carried out at different spatial scales including global regional and local aghakouchak et al 2011 beck et al 2017 2019a derin et al 2016 duan et al 2016 eini et al 2019 2021 2022a 2022b ghajarnia et al 2015 2018 guo et al 2015 hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b ma et al 2020 2022 saemian et al 2021 zhu et al 2021b kumar et al 2022 pradhan et al 2022 in the case of iran many previous studies have evaluated precipitation estimation products for some basins or the entire country an early study by javanmard et al 2010 evaluated the performance of tmpa 3b42 precipitation estimates against synoptic gauge records 1998 2006 for iran other studies since then have evaluated different sets of global precipitation products against in situ observations for iran and have compared the performance of these products at different temporal and spatial scales e g alijanian et al 2017 azizi et al 2016 darand et al 2017 azizian and ramezani etedali 2019 darand and khandu 2020 s m hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b hosseini moghari et al 2018 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 2013 katiraie boroujerdy 2013 moazami et al 2016 2013 raziei and sotoudeh 2017 sharifi et al 2016 ghajarnia et al 2018 many of these studies have found that most products are more efficient in the zagros mountains and southern iran than in coastal regions in the north where all products reportedly show poor performance alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 moazami et al 2016 raziei and sotoudeh 2017 sharifi et al 2016 recently fallah et al 2020 and mosaffa et al 2020 provided a better basis for choosing a good source of precipitation estimates across two basins in southwest iran karun and karkheh respectively however there is still considerable uncertainty regarding various aspects of the performance of precipitation estimation products at different spatial and temporal scales in karun and karkheh basins for example many recent studies have focused on a limited number of global precipitation products and the period and time scale of comparison differ between studies another key discrepancy is that different observational gauge datasets such as those from iran meteorological organization irimo and iran water management research institute tamab have been used as reference data in different studies in addition the observational rain gauge network in iran suffers from uncertainties and measurement inconsistencies ghajarnia et al 2014 thus previous studies of iran and particularly of karun and karkheh basins have still shortcomings especially in the evaluation approaches and reference datasets used which makes comparison of results difficult for instance mosaffa et al 2020 only used 26 rain gauges in karkheh basin for daily assessments and fallah et al 2020 focused solely on monthly evaluations with limited numbers of metrics therefore it is currently not feasible to draw conclusions for the region based on previous studies most previous studies have only used synoptic station records as they are the most accurate rain gauges in iran and have neglected data from other rain gauges such as those used by tamab despite the fact that synoptic stations are mostly located at low altitudes and do not sample at higher elevations which tamab stations do therefore there is a need to use more comprehensive data on karun and karkheh basins considering a more complete set of in situ rain gauges and including both synoptic stations and tamab stations with better coverage of higher altitudes when evaluating the performance of the most commonly used global precipitation products in these basins the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of 14 common and well known global precipitation products persiann persiann cdr persiann ccs cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 era5 land merra 2 jra 55 pgfv2 0 mswepv2 0 and chirpsv2 0 against data from the domestic rain gauge network in karun and karkheh basins product performance was analyzed using daily precipitation data 2003 2012 and monthly data aggregated from daily observations as described in section 2 the evaluation was performed using different statistical and categorical measures which are also described in section 2 results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by a summary and conclusions in section 4 the overall aim of the study was to provide meaningful insights into regional water resource management hydrological modelling and climate analyses across complex terrain with scarce data by using a wide range of precipitation products with different aspects of analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies between latitude 29 35 n and longitude 46 52 e in southwest iran and encompasses karkheh and karun basins through which two of the largest rivers in iran flow fig 1 karkheh and karun basin occupy an area of 51 000 and 67 000 km2 respectively and long term average streamflow is around 170 and 590 m3 s respectively khazaei 2021 the zagros mountain range means that these basins have some of the most complex terrain in iran with average elevation increasing drastically from 0 to 3916 m above sea level from north to south mean annual precipitation in karkheh basin is around 450 mm year with spatial variation ranging from 150 mm year on arid low elevation plains to 750 mm year in highland areas choubin et al 2019 mean annual precipitation in karun basin is 632 mm year with larger spatial variability of 153 mm year in arid southern lowlands to 2000 mm year in mountainous areas fallah et al 2020 fig 2 2 2 reference data rain gauge data provided by irimo and tamab were used as the reference dataset daily data from a total of 254 gauge stations within a 10 year period 2003 2012 were used to evaluate the performance of the different global precipitation products fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the rain gauges across karkheh and karun basins 2 3 global precipitation products fourteen global precipitation estimation products with different temporal and spatial resolution were chosen comprising three reanalysis four satellite based and seven multi source precipitation products satellite based precipitation products including geostationary satellites and polar orbiting satellites estimates precipitation using vis ir method passive microwave method and mutli sensor technique huffman et al 2007a 2007b every single method has its pros and cons which must be considered furthermore by combining the latest observations with a short range forecast constrained by previous observations data assimilation provides the best estimate of the earth system s current state this estimate called the analysis forms the basis of weather forecasts the quality of forecasts is dependent on the accuracy of the analysis when weather and climate analyses are produced for prolonged periods using the same assimilation system as before they become reanalysis product hersbach et al 2020 the third group is multi source precipitation products that benefit from reanalysis nad satellite estimate the main characteristics of all products are shown in table s1 column data source represents their source of estimation 2 3 1 reanalysis precipitation products reanalysis datasets provide a spatially complete and temporally coherent time series of data for different global atmospheric variables by benefiting from three main components data assimilation approaches forecasting models and different input observations dee et al 2011 due to the lack of globally consistent observational data climate reanalysis products are used as an alternative in a wide range of earth science studies qian et al 2006 in this study we used precipitation data from the following three reanalysis products european center for medium range weather forecast reanalysis ecmwf 5th generation land era5 land hersbach et al 2020 japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 rienecker et al 2011 era5 land provides a consistent view of changes in land variables over many decades at higher spatial and temporal resolution compared with era5 which was developed by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis product sabater and data 2019 spanning 1950 present time era5 land is one of the longest and finest reanalysis products with temporal resolution of one hour and spatial native resolution of 9 km hersbach et al 2020 jra 55 the second reanalysis product launched by japan meteorological agency extensively improved the japanese 25 year reanalysis product jra 25 onogi et al 2007 jra 55 addresses issues identified with the previous product and produces relevant detailed climate data especially for climate change studies and assessing multidecadal variabilities kobayashi et al 2015 the daily jra 55 reanalysis product with spatial resolution of 1 25 1 25 covers the entire globe kobayashi et al 2015 merra 2 is nasa s second generation reanalysis product spanning 1979 to present merra 2 utilizes a recent version of the goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 data assimilation system it covers the whole globe with high spatial resolution of 0 5 0 67 and hourly time steps rienecker et al 2011 2 3 2 satellite based precipitation products satellite based precipitation estimates offer an alternative way to monitor precipitation at global scale compared with ground based observations considering the high variability of precipitation in time and space satellites can provide valuable information for estimating precipitation with suitable spatial and temporal resolution kidd and huffman 2011 for this study we selected four widely used satellite based products trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis near real time 3b42rt version 7 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 climate prediction center morphing raw version 1 cmorph rawv1 0 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann and persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs by using various meteorological satellites around the world tmpa provides precipitation estimates at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution covering 50 n to 50 s at three hourly time scales for 1998 2016 huffman et al 2007a 2007b tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 is the near real time with latency of 7 h from the observation time version of tmpa products the satellite based persiann product is designed to produce global precipitation estimations at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution using an artificial neural network in order to generate 30 minute rainfall estimate persiann utilizes the global infrared ir information from geosynchronous satellites goes 8 goes 10 gms 5 metsat 6 and metsat 7 provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and then aggregates these estimates into 6 h rainfall hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 persiann ccs is a successor of the persiann product that also benefits from satellite information on cloud attributes and further incorporates them into the rainfall estimation relationships hong et al 2004 in comparison with persiann the ccs version has finer spatial resolution 0 04 0 04 covering 60 n 60 s for 2004 present time at different temporal scales cmorph rawv1 0 is a near real time product developed by noaa it is based on low orbital satellite passive microwave pmw sensors with ir information used to interpolate between successive pmw derived rainfall intensity fields joyce et al 2004 the primary and reprocessed versions of cmorph are called version 0 x and version 1 respectively 2 3 3 multi source precipitation products different multi source precipitation products have been developed in recent years due to the short period and uncertainties of precipitation estimation from satellite based precipitation products these multi source precipitation products are a combination of two or more precipitation estimations from various sources in this study we used seven high resolution multi source products namely cmorph bias corrected version 1 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph satellite gauge merged version 1 cmorph bldv1 0 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station v 2 chirpsv2 0 persiann climate data record persiann cdr trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis research grade 3b42 version 7 tmpa 3b42v7 0 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswepv2 0 and princeton global forcings version 2 pgfv2 0 cmorph v1 0 contains three different precipitation products i cmorph raw introduced earlier ii cmorph crt the bias corrected version using the probability density function pdf matching bias removal technique on cmorph raw and iii cmorph bld merged product generated by calibrating cmorph raw estimates with in situ data and using an optional interpolation technique joyce et al 2004 chirpsv2 0 is another reliable up to date product for many early warning objectives that covers areas exceeding 50 n 50 s it provides precipitation estimates in the period 1981 present time and combines high resolution satellite imagery 0 05 0 05 with data from in situ stations funk et al 2015 persiann cdr is also based on the original persiann algorithm using gridded satellite b1 gridsat b1 infrared data and adjusted using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly product ashouri et al 2015 this product was created for extreme daily precipitation events and climate studies that require data for more than 30 years persiann cdr is available in high spatial resolution 0 25 25 covering 60 n 60 s for 1983 present time with a 3 month time delay tmpa 3b42v7 0 is the research product of tmpa calibrated via gauge data and incorporating different sensor calibrations and additional post processing it is available in 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and covers 50 n to 50 s for 2000 2016 huffman et al 2007a 2007b liu 2015 mswepv2 0 recently developed by beck et al 2019a 2019b is a global precipitation product with temporal and spatial resolution of 3 h and 0 1 respectively for 1979 2020 the exceptional feature of mswepv2 0 is that it combines in situ satellite and reanalysis data to provide high quality global precipitation estimates pgf is another global precipitation product that combines several sources including in situ satellite and reanalysis data disaggregating them in time and space it is available in 3 hour to monthly temporal scale with 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 spatial resolution sheffield et al 2006 2 4 evaluation approach several steps were followed when evaluating the performance of the global precipitation products initially long term time series of the precipitation estimates from all 14 global products and observed precipitation at rain gauge stations were collected and preprocessed by reformatting the data to prepare them for performance evaluations tasks carried out using climate data operator cdo schulzweida 2019 various statistical metrics were then used to characterize model behaviors and quantify their associated uncertainties and errors in precipitation estimation this step was carried out using the climate data tools cdt and hydrogof packages in the r programming environment zambrano bigiarini 2014 the error at different spatial and temporal scales for the global precipitation products was computed and illustrated using various visualization techniques the most common methods available for error determination are continuous statistical parameters and metrics based on contingency tables the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the precipitation products in daily and monthly time steps but their performance in estimating annual time series and mean annual precipitation in the study area was also examined 2 4 1 continuous statistical indices continuous statistical indices show how well predicted values correspond to observed values in this study we used kling gupta efficiency kge since it measures three types of error temporal error r bias error Œ≤ and variability error Œ≥ gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 moreover kge is a robust index since it summarizes multiple aspects of model error into a single indicator 1 kge 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 Œ≥ 1 2 where r denotes pearson correlation coefficient hereafter cc see eq 2 Œ≤ is the bias component defined as the ratio between average observed and estimated precipitation values eq 3 and Œ≥ represents the variability defined as the ratio of estimated to observed coefficient of variation eq 4 in the following equations Œº o and Œº e is the average precipitation value in the observational and estimated times series respectively œÉ o and œÉ e is the standard deviation in observations and estimations respectively n is the number of records in the time series with valid observed or estimated data number of records excluding the no data values in the time series and o i and e i denotes respectively observational and estimated data at date i in the time series kge r Œ≤ and Œ≥ all have their optimum value at unity 2 r 1 n 1 n o i Œº o e i Œº e œÉ o œÉ e 3 Œ≤ Œº e Œº o 4 Œ≥ œÉ e Œº e œÉ o Œº o 2 4 2 categorical statistical indices categorical statistics measure the agreement between estimated and observed occurrence of events in this study the contingency table shown in table 2 was used to define dichotomous estimations and calculate contingency table indices wilks 2011 a dichotomous estimate determines the occurrence and non occurrence of rainfall as yes and no events respectively in order to detect yes and no precipitation events a threshold needs to be specified in this study the threshold was set at 1 mm day based on similar assumptions in previous studies e g ghajarnia et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 in the contingency table a hit event indicates the condition in which both observational and estimated datasets agree on the occurrence of precipitation while a false alarm fa shows that the precipitation event estimated by the model has not occurred in reality and is not a precipitation event in the observational dataset wilks 2011 similarly a miss refers to an event recorded in the reference observation dataset but missed by the global precipitation estimation product while a correct negative cn indicates that both the observational dataset and estimation products have reported a no rainfall event wilks 2011 based on the time series of dichotomous conditions and the number of hit fa miss and cn variables different indicators are defined and can be calculated to evaluate the performance of different global models in estimation of precipitation occurrence see ebert et al 2007 for more details in this study we used three indicators probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and heidke skill score hss to measure the association between precipitation product estimates and observed rainfall occurrences pod determines the ratio of rainfall events correctly identified by the precipitation product to the total number of real rain events based on the observational dataset perfect score 1 far shows the ratio of the total number of false rainfall identifications by the model to the total number of estimated yes rainfall events by the global precipitation product perfect score 0 since pod and far only consider single aspects of precipitation we also used hss as a more robust indicator that measures the performance of precipitation products in terms of dichotomous statistics stanski et al 1989 hss also measures the overall ability of a precipitation estimation product in capturing the occurrence of precipitation events perfect score 1 eqs 5 to 7 were used to calculate pod far and hss based on the dichotomous statistics according to table 1 5 pod a a c 6 far b b a 7 hss 2 ad bc a c c d a b b d 2 4 3 dry and wet spell analysis we used two indices consecutive dry days cdd and consecutive wet days cwd to analyze the accuracy of the global precipitation products in terms of estimating the duration of dry and wet spells cdd and cwd are both calculated based on daily precipitation in this study the threshold was set at 1 mm day cdd and cwd are formulated as follows 8 rr ij 1 mm 9 rr ij 1 mm where rr ij is daily precipitation amount on day i in period j 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of precipitation estimation products at annual and monthly time scales a mean annual precipitation map map for karun and karkheh basins based on all gridded precipitation products and interpolated gauge records for the period 2003 2012 is shown in fig 3 measured map in gauge records varied from 134 to 1384 mm year across the basins and increased from the northwestern lowlands of karkheh basin to the southeastern highlands of karun basin this indicates presence of a spatial pattern and relationship between map and elevation with high altitude areas receiving greater amounts of annual precipitation the terrain barrier effect leads to high precipitation rates over mountainous regions in the zagros chain a bulky topographical feature with continuous ridge lines in those regions the precipitation rate is affected by elevation changes overall visual comparison of the map patterns for the basins showed that the main spatial patterns produced by tmpa 3b42v7 0 were closest to the observed values followed by era5 land and merra 2 with slight overestimations and chirpsv2 0 with slight underestimation relative to the observational spatial pattern fig 3 the persiann family seemed to be less successful in capturing the spatial pattern of map in general but persiann ccs performed better than the others with more accurate estimations of map in the mountainous areas of karun basin while persiann significantly underestimated map values in the highlands cmorph crt and cmorph bld adjusted versions both improved estimations compared with cmorph raw non adjusted version but still underestimated map in the study area and did not correctly capture the increasing spatial pattern from lowlands to highlands persiann mswepv2 0 and pgfv2 0 simulated the observed spatial pattern of map in declining order and all greatly underestimated precipitation in the study area jra 55 also showed relatively poor performance in capturing the map spatial pattern considering its coarser spatial resolution compared with other products due to complex topography and the particular climate system in the study region affected by proximity to the coast in the west and high mountain ranges in the center estimation of precipitation was not an easy task for the global products the highest and lowest map value among all products was produced by era5 land and cmorph crtv1 0 respectively with recorded precipitation of up to 1500 and below 40 mm year respectively in central areas of karun basin and southwestern parts of karkheh basin as found previously by javanmard et al 2010 and darand et al 2017 tmpa 3b42v7 0 showed relatively good performance in capturing annual precipitation in the study region with only slight underestimation fig 4 show the temporal variation in annual and monthly precipitation time series 2004 2012 respectively as measured at rain gauge stations and estimated by different precipitation products the bias adjusted products merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 tmpa3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and pgfv2 0 but not chirpsv2 0 showed rather similar trends throughout the study period except for 2004 with annual variation close to that in observations fig 4 the performance of some unadjusted products i e jra 55 persiann ccs and era5 land was not acceptable when compared against the observational data although their performance improved slightly after 2008 era5 land produced the greatest overestimation of all products while persiann and cmorph rawv1 0 produced the greatest underestimations on an annual basis fig 4 the temporal trend in precipitation at monthly scale showed relatively better performance of tmpa 3b42v7 0 and poor estimation by persiann cdr persiann ccs persiann and chirpsv2 0 fig 4 other products were capable overall of detecting the general trend in observed precipitation with reasonable accuracy and slight over or under estimation all products except era5 land tended to underestimate observed precipitation over the study area both at annual and monthly time scales these results from time series analysis were consistent with the results from the map maps see fig 3 which showed great overestimation by era5 land across mountainous regions and better results for tmpa 3b42v7 0 overall although both persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 0 utilized the same observational precipitation data source gpcp adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2007a 2007b to improve their estimations the calibration procedure used in tmpa 3b42v7 0 seemed to make it more efficient than persiann cdr and provided tmpa 3b42v7 0 with better accuracy for the study area in terms of the spatial variation in map and monthly and annual estimations 3 2 statistical error in global precipitation product estimates at daily scale the performance of all 14 precipitation products at daily time steps based on the kge error index and its related components is compared and evaluated in fig 5 all products showed relatively poor accuracy with negative kge values for persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 all products had kge 0 4 but merra 2 with approximately kge 0 4 performed better than all other products fig 5 overall the bias adjusted products i e tmpa 3b42v7 0 cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 outperformed the unadjusted products i e cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 in terms of kge except for persiann cdr which was the most inaccurate product given the poor performance of persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 fig 5 caution is needed in application of these products to estimate precipitation at daily time scale in the study area the correlation coefficient cc bias and variability ratio vr values revealed interesting details on the performance of the different products leading to their general kge values fig 5 based on cc era5 land performed best among all products cc 0 6 but its high bias value 1 5 led to low overall kge value 0 22 for the study area in terms of bias persiann cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 mswepv2 0 and pgfv2 0 underestimated precipitation to some extent bias 0 7 while era5 land was the only product with clear overestimation at daily time scale similar to the annual and monthly results in fig 4 in terms of vr merra 2 tmpa 3b42v7 0 and pgfv2 0 with their higher kge values also displayed vr values closer to one while cmorph rawv1 0 and persiann cdr with negative kge values tended to underestimate the variability in the observed precipitation dataset across the study area and at daily scale overall the relatively high kge value for gauge corrected products suggested that these products could be more efficient than raw products in daily precipitation estimation across the study region however the more in depth analysis must be considered since some gauge corrected products were not among the best performed products similar findings were also drawn for various precipitation products across different regions at a daily time scale for some studies ghozat et al 2021 ma et al 2021 saemian et al 2021 which indicated that they must be used with caution in this time scale fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of kge index for different products that gave scores varying from very low to high for the study area the kge scores ranged from around 1 65 for persiann cdr to approximately 0 8 for merra 2 across various regions indicating varying performance of the products in matching reference precipitation at daily time steps considering the spatial distribution of kge it is noteworthy that chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and all products in the persiann family showed lower accuracy with kge 0 3 in most regions however merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 era5 land and pgfv2 0 outperformed the other products and provided better daily estimates at different locations around the study area the results also indicated that using gauge data was effective for products in the cmorph and tmpa families while there was no significance improvement for the bias adjusted version of persiann i e persiann cdr fig 6 cmorph bldv1 0 which benefits from a proper calibration procedure is pmw based and the distinction between snowfall and precipitation over mountainous regions is well captured by this product the ir based products i e chirpsv2 0 persiann persiann cdr and persiann ccs did not perform well for mountainous regions fig 6 previous studies suggest that ir based products have limitations in estimating orographic rain events over complex terrain derin et al 2016 shen et al 2020 tong et al 2014 yong et al 2015 as confirmed by our findings fig 6 the low kge value of mswepv2 0 for the zagros mountains might result from associated uncertainty from all precipitation products for this region since that product merges multiple precipitation products to produce its final estimates beck et al 2019b overall the findings and patterns obtained fig 6 indicated that the majority of the global precipitation products tested were ineffective for daily hydrological applications across the study area due to the vital importance of karun and karkheh basins for water resources and hydrology in iran use of global daily precipitation products after proper bias adjustment and enhancement of the estimations is indicated complete cc bias and vr maps are provided in supplementary information figs s1 s3 comparison of the spatial patterns of the cc maps produced by different global precipitation products at daily time scale fig s1 indicated that in general mswepv2 0 era5 land and cmorph bldv1 0 estimates were well correlated with the gauge precipitation data especially in southeastern parts of karun basin with cc values ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 while lower cc values 0 0 5 were generally found for karkheh basin era5 land outperformed all other products and its estimates were well correlated with gauge observations cc 0 7 at the majority of stations the bias adjusted versions of the cmorph and tmpa products produced better results across the study area than their non adjusted versions however persiann cdr showed no improvement on its real time version the poor performance of cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann might be due to inability of the pdf matching based bias removal technique and cloud top based infrared observations over complex terrain alijanian et al 2017 dinku et al 2007 based on this index the worst results were produced by chirpsv2 0 among the unadjusted products era5 land significantly overestimated precipitation amount bias 1 35 in most regions while other unadjusted products showed lower bias fig s2 dominant precipitation processes over complex topographies such as the zagros mountains may have resulted in poor performance of era5 land which is consistent with findings by fallah et al 2020 the high bias rate for era5 land may arise from its poor snowfall or precipitation detection especially during wet months while the lack of a proper snowfall removal process in era5 land is reported to cause high overestimation for mountainous regions jiang et al 2021 orsolini et al 2019 the spatial distribution of bias also showed that all products except era5 land were susceptible to low bias rate for stations located in humid southeastern parts of karun basin in the arid southern part of both basins all products overestimated precipitation amount with bias values ranging between 1 15 and 1 35 thus the precipitation products tended to underestimate precipitation amount for wet regions and overestimate it for dry regions which is consistent with previous results amjad et al 2020 chiaravalloti et al 2018 de leeuw et al 2015 el kenawy et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 overall the results showed that merra 2 persiann cdr pgfv2 0 and chirps had acceptable accuracy for some stations with bias rate between 0 85 and 1 35 however these products showed moderate to high overestimation for other stations especially in mountainous regions in southeastern karun basin persiann and cmorph rawv1 0 showed the worst performance among all products with strong underestimation bias 0 45 in particular for stations located in the southeastern part of karun basin the spatial distribution of vr in daily time steps for all products is shown in fig s3 the bias adjusted merra 2 chirpsv2 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 products were superior to other products in terms of vr and had the highest number of stations with values close to the optimum 0 95 1 05 era5 land persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 jra 55 and persiann ccs showed significant underestimation based on this index for most stations among all products persiann cdr had the most stations with vr 0 75 indicating a high rate of underestimation for the study region interestingly among all products with overestimation vr 1 15 the rate of overestimation was highest for stations located in southeast karun basin and to some extent in northwest karkheh basin the values of vr in daily time steps along with all other statistical indicators indicated that almost all products could not capture accurately the spatial variability in precipitation across both basins therefore effective preprocessing methods must be considered prior to utilizing these products for complex terrain the performance of the different precipitation products over the study area in terms of the contingency table of pod and far is compared and evaluated in figs s4 s5 in supplementary information era5 land greatly outperformed all other products with the highest pod value 0 7 however this may have come at the cost of overestimating precipitation events as era5 land also displayed the greatest bias rate see figs 4 and 5 and highest far values for the study area fig s5 this is in line with previous findings for both the era5 and era interim products amjad et al 2020 de leeuw et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 h√©nin et al 2018 persiann ccs persiann cdr jra 55 and cmorph bldv1 0 showed acceptable accuracy and performed better than the other products in terms of pod index fig s4 interestingly and in contrast to the results for daily kge index calibration of persiann cdr and cmorph bldv1 0 using gauge information significantly improved their rainfall detection capability however this was not the case for cmorph crtv1 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 the adjusted versions of cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 respectively overall chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 and persiann had the worst results of all products based on pod index fig s4 although the precipitation products performed relatively well in detecting rainy days the far values were slightly high for all products across both basins fig s5 showing weaker ability of all products in detecting no rainfall events this was particularly the case for era5 land as explained before considering its high pod value conversely cmorph rawv1 0 which provided the lowest pod index values in fig s4 performed better than all other products in terms of far index explaining the high underestimation of observed precipitation by cmorph raw1 0 across both basins fig s5 interestingly the spatial distribution of far index indicated that bias adjusted products reduced the accuracy of their unadjusted versions especially for persiann cdr this might be because improving either far or pod usually leads to impairment of the other as there is a trade off between the ability of a model in detecting rainy days high pod and falsely reporting them high far ghajarnia et al 2016 the far values showed no particular spatial pattern across the study area fig s5 fig 7 shows the ability of the products in correct detection of rainfall events based on the hss index cmorph bldv1 0 and mswepv2 0 had the highest accuracy among all products in terms of hss with values 0 6 across the study area in addition merra 2 and era5 land showed acceptable performance for both basins however none of the products performed well for the northern mountainous region in karun basin hss values around 0 3 chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 tmpa 3brtv7 0 and persiann showed the worst performance across both basins chirpsv2 0 had the worst results of all products comparing the spatial distribution of hss for unadjusted and bias adjusted versions of the products fig 7 the results indicated enhanced performance of the adjusted versions particularly in the persiann and tmpa families where the bias adjusted versions showed higher hss in southern parts of karun basin considering all metrics in daily time scales it could be noted that all products must be examined from different angles as one metric does not fully represent the complete performance of products in any case overall the poor performance of products on a daily time scale raised a great concern for the local authorities since the gauge network suffers from spatio temporal inconsistency ghajarnia et al 2015 to this end a proper daily bias correction must be implemented to utilize these products for local usage across karun and karkheh river basins however the common uncertainties associated with these kinds of studies including a spatial mismatch between in situ and global precipitation products point to pixel approach and gauge uncertainties must be considered furthermore considering the calculated metrics bias is generally the primary cause of error in the global precipitation products our results are consistent with those of satg√© et al 2020 and saemian et al 2021 who compared 23 and 44 gridded precipitation products over west africa and iran respectively they have found that bias is the predominant factor affecting kge scores therefore it could be inferred that a high cc score does not always guarantee high performance of precipitation products and various criteria must be considered while analyzing them 3 3 statistical analysis of global precipitation products at monthly time steps to examine the performance of the global precipitation products more thoroughly at monthly scale which is an appropriate temporal resolution for water resources and climate change studies the evaluations were repeated based on monthly time series compared with the daily results see fig 5 the kge scores varied over a wider range at monthly time steps and reached higher values fig 8 tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr merra 2 and pgfv2 0 outperformed other products in terms of monthly kge score with average kge values 0 5 the bias adjusted products tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 showed better monthly kge scores than their unadjusted versions surprisingly tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 jra 55 and persiann ccs which are basically unadjusted products performed even better than some bias adjusted products such as mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 chirpsv2 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 comparing the results of persiann cdr at monthly and daily time steps revealed that the significant improvement in its precipitation estimations at monthly time steps might be related to the calibration of persiann cdr with monthly gpcp data ashouri et al 2015 the results also indicated higher cc values in comparison with daily values for most of the products studied fig s6 mswepv2 0 and era5 land also had very high monthly cc but their kge values were low due to their high under and overestimation respectively low and high bias index the high cc value obtained for mswepv2 0 might be related to its algorithm which gives observational data higher weighting based on their cc in the merging scheme beck et al 2019b all products successfully represented the monthly variation in observed precipitation as the variability indices mostly ranged around the optimum value unity fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of kge score for the different global precipitation products the overall spatial pattern of kge score suggested that almost all products except cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann performed well for karkheh basin with improved performance of the bias adjusted versions however for karun basin with its more diverse topographical conditions and higher mountains only merra 2 persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 0 performed moderately well while other products showed poor performance the results also indicated that the reanalysis products were significantly different from each other with merra 2 having high accuracy across both basins while era5 land and jra 55 showed poor to moderate accuracy the bias adjusted products of mswepv2 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and pgfv2 0 showed poor performance across mountainous regions indicating unsuccessful bias adjustments in the study area the main reasons for this might be inherent limitations of the calibration procedure and the lack of a gauge network in remote highlands dahri et al 2021 furthermore it could be stated that merging various sources of precipitation products into single products might increase the uncertainty of precipitation estimation as every single product has its uncertainty regarding precipitation estimation the spatial distributions of cc and vr index are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively in supplementary information due to the similarity of bias at monthly and daily time steps monthly biases are not reported again in this section all products except cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 produced estimates that were well correlated with gauge records cc 0 7 and showed their best performance for stations located in the west and southeast of the study area fig s6 compared with daily time steps fig s1 bias adjusted precipitation products provided higher accuracy and were more reliable across both basins at monthly time steps however the differences between bias adjusted and unadjusted versions were more negligible at daily compared with monthly time steps which means more efficient adjustment in monthly outputs of the models this is in line with previous findings on the performance of persiann persiann cdr tmpa 3b42v7 0 and mswep at different temporal scales in iran indicating that the cc value increases significantly at monthly time steps compared with daily time steps alijanian et al 2017 fallah et al 2020 found that based on monthly cc index era5 performed well whereas jra 55 and mswepv2 0 showed relatively poor performance for karun basin which was contradicted by our findings this might be due to the lower gauge density of the reference dataset used in fallah et al 2020 or the difference between the study periods in the evaluations 2000 2015 in fallah et al 2020 as opposed to 2003 2012 in this study fig s7 shows the spatial distribution of vr in global precipitation products over the study area the bias adjusted products merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 were able to better capture the precipitation variability across the two basins vr 0 9 1 05 in most regions indicating that these products could be used to predict monthly precipitation variability with higher confidence level the chirpsv2 0 jra 55 and persiann cdr products greatly underestimated precipitation variability particularly in southwestern parts of the study area vr 0 85 other products showed great overestimation in the north of karkheh basin persiann cmorph crtv1 0 and cmorph rawv1 0 and in the mountainous southeastern part of karun basin persiann cmorph crtv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 overall considering the vr of the bias adjusted versions of persiann trmm and cmorph but not cmorph crtv1 0 it is evident that the use of gauge records converted the overestimated outputs of these products to optimum or underestimated values 3 4 model rankings and summary of evaluations a performance diagram roebber 2009 was created to summarize the results this diagram uses the categorical indicators pod sr success ratio csi as labeled solid contours and bias as dashed lines with labels on the outward extension of the line it summarizes model performance based on contingency table indices with the best values in the top right and the worst in the bottom left corner to evaluate the performance of the 14 precipitation products for different precipitation levels precipitation intensity was divided into four categories 0 5 5 10 10 20 and 20 mm day representing light moderate heavy and extreme rainfall respectively the performance diagram for all products fig 10 indicated that merra 2 cmorph bldv1 0 mswepv2 0 pgfv2 0 jra 55 and era5 land outperformed the other products in correctly capturing precipitation occurrences followed by persiann cdr the results also indicated that bias adjusted versions of persiann persiann cdr and cmorph cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 performed better than their unadjusted versions fig 10 in the tmpa family incorporation of gauge information did not improve the estimation of precipitation occurrence by tmpa 3b42v7 0 surprisingly all products had a near perfect score in detecting light rainfall events 0 5 mm day however the performance of all products in detecting moderate 5 10 mm day and heavy 10 20 mm day precipitation events deteriorated points were closer to the no skill area for the moderate precipitation class and scattered in the plot with better performance of era5 land for the heavy precipitation class era5 land followed by meera 2 outperformed other products in detecting extreme precipitation events fig 10 for this precipitation category jra 55 persiann cdr cmorph bldv1 0 and mswepv2 0 performed similarly with sr 0 5 pod 0 2 csi 0 2 and bias varying from 0 3 to 0 5 cmorph rawv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 were the worst products at capturing heavy and extreme precipitation events tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 showed similar performance to tmpa 3b42v7 0 while other bias adjusted products cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann cdr outperformed their unadjusted versions in the heavy precipitation class overall the performance diagram indicated that era5 land and merra 2 performed better than the other products particularly in reproducing rainfall events above 20 mm day fig 10 however all products seemed to perform well in capturing rainfall events in the light intensity class previously nashwan et al 2020 found better performance for global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap ushio et al 2009 and african rainfall climatology arc novella and thiaw 2013 for the 0 5 mm day precipitation class in egypt the overall ranking of the different precipitation products in terms of average monthly and daily kge scores showed that the performance of products at monthly time scale was around twice as good as at daily time scale fig 11 this might have been influenced by merging the monthly observational datasets in some products e g persiann cdr persiann cdr was the worst performing product at daily time scale with even worst performance than persiann fig 11a however its performance improved considerably at monthly time scale when persiann cdr was the second best product fig 11b conversely the performance of cmorph bldv1 0 deteriorated from daily to monthly time scale fig 11 based on the average kge index tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and pgfv2 0 were the three best performing products in estimation of precipitation rates both at daily and monthly time scales cmorph bldv1 0 and persiann cdr were also among the best performing products but only at daily and monthly scale respectively a shorter time scale of evaluation daily could yield poor results considering this beck et al 2019a who evaluated 26 precipitation datasets across the continental united states conus concluded that when it came to cc bias and vr precipitation products performed significantly poorer than the monthly time scale as a result of this finding the error characteristics of a given dataset may change due to changing the assessment time scale accordingly we also observed a similar pattern when considering the median kge value for the study area fig 11 as we showed the kge value varies between 0 08 to 0 66 on the monthly time scale while on a daily basis it lies between 0 19 to 0 35 for different products 3 5 dry and wet spell analysis fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of cwd index for different products with values varying from 2 days to 14 days across the study area according to observational data wet spell duration is high cwd 4 across southeastern and northwestern parts of the study region it is lower cwd 3 in southwestern parts mainly due to low precipitation rate during all months of the year the results showed that merra 2 estimates were well matched with in situ observations with cwd varying between 2 5 and 7 1 days and somewhat overestimated across eastern parts tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 and cmorph rawv1 0 with rather similar patterns to observed cwd values showed relatively better performance than other satellite based products while cmorph bldv1 0 with cwd values varying between 2 3 and 8 5 days was superior to the other adjusted products incorporating gauge information was efficient for cmorph family products but calibrating persiann and tmpa with gauge information did not provide meaningful improvements in these two families other products including chirpsv2 0 persiann families pgfv2 0 jra 55 and era5 land could not capture the spatial variability in cwd index seen in observational data as found in previous comparisons see sections 3 2 and 3 3 era5 land greatly overestimated wet conditions with cwd values ranging from 4 to 14 which might derive from its significant overestimation regarding daily to annual precipitation amounts the results for mswepv2 0 showed that this product had moderate to high accuracy with cwd ranging between 2 4 and 6 days fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the cdd index for the different products with cdd varying from 62 days to 214 days across the study area similarly to the cwd index longer duration dry spells were mainly scattered across southwestern parts of the study region cdd 170 days and shorter duration dry spells were mainly scattered along southeastern and to some extent northern parts cdd 150 days some stations with cdd 130 were scattered unevenly across these parts overall the spatial pattern of results showed moderate to high consistency between era5 land tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 cmorph bldv1 0 merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 estimates and observed cdd pattern however other products could not capture the variability in the cdd index with high accuracy across the study region among all products cmorph crtv1 0 followed by merra 2 performed slightly better than the others with cdd index ranging from 112 to 214 days the cdd index analysis showed that cmorph families were improved after gauge calibration while other families including persiann and tmpa were not improved by bias adjustment this might derive from the gauge adjustment procedure and source of gauge information used the cdd index results for mswepv2 0 showed that the incidence of dry spells surprisingly increased which might be a result of this product s calibration procedure or weighting algorithms to better analyze dry and wet conditions across the study region we performed yearly time series analysis of the cwd and cdd indices fig s9 the results showed that among the reanalysis products merra 2 estimates were well matched with observational data regarding cwd index for almost all years the era5 land product showed significant overestimation from 2003 to 2012 however jra 55 had a similar temporal pattern in cdd index with slight over underestimation in some years satellite based products including persiann ccs and persiann greatly overestimated and underestimated cwd index respectively throughout the study period except for 2007 with a large cwd for persiann for the cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 products no specific pattern was found throughout the study period among the multi source products tested cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 captured the temporal variability in cwd index although both showed some degree of overestimation after 2007 considering the temporal pattern of reanalysis products for cdd index era5 land and jra 55 showed large underestimation throughout all years fig s8 as seen for the cwd results merra 2 was well matched with observed cdd values except for years after 2008 slight overestimation the satellite based products showed low accuracy in capturing dry spells with low to high underestimation throughout all years for various products for the multi source products adjusting gauge information proved efficient for cmorph crtv1 0 products with high accuracy and temporal pattern of cdd consistent with observational data the adjusted tmpa product showed moderate accuracy in capturing cdd temporal pattern with significant underestimation throughout the period a consistent temporal pattern with slight overestimation was also observed between mswepv2 0 and observation based cdd index from 2003 to 2012 the results indicated poor accuracy for other multi source products including persiann cdr chirpsv2 0 and pgfv2 0 in capturing temporal trends in cdd index overall spatial and temporal analysis across the study region showed that gauge adjusted products were mostly superior to satellite based products in terms of capturing dry and wet spell duration specifically the results indicated that merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 performed best in terms of cwd and cdd index respectively since cdd and cwd are of great importance for drought analysis merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 could be useful for calculations relating to agricultural activities as they can efficiently represent dry and wet periods casanueva et al 2014 considering the results of cwd and cdd indices see figs 12 and 13 and fig s8 it could be noted that products with high accuracy on a monthly and daily time basis had relatively high accuracy in capturing spatial variability of both indices furthermore large distortion of era5 land and persiann family products from observed cwd values were also observed in most regions this issue might be due to the high bias rate of era5 land see fig 8 and fig s3 which is dominant all over the region era5 land product tend to overestimate cwd values while underestimating cdd values in most regions which reflect from its large overestimation in most regions furthermore the persiann family products suffer from low hss and kge values which indicate their low detection ability and poor estimates resulting in poor performance of these products regarding cdd and cwd indices also our results for tmpa adjusted version were consistent with keikhosravi kiany et al 2020 who indicated that this product had high accuracy regarding fixed threshold extreme indices including cwd and cdd indices over the southwest of iran 3 6 error source analysis of the different precipitation products in point to grid evaluation we used the maximum number of stations in the study area however some highlands areas suffer from low density station coverage and the uneven distribution of the gauge network in these areas added some degree of uncertainty to the evaluation process previous studies comparing the performance of global precipitation products in highlands areas have generally found that almost all types of products have difficulty in capturing the precipitation variation and characteristics of such regions eini et al 2021 saemian et al 2021 sui et al 2020 zhu et al 2021b this poor performance of precipitation estimation products in highlands areas is a challenge since it is not known whether it derives from the estimation algorithm used and whether poor coverage of stations in these areas affects the evaluation process scale mismatches between precipitation products and in situ observational data also add some uncertainty to evaluations e g point based in situ observations cannot capture areal precipitation characteristics over large grids 0 5 0 5 0 25 0 25 this problem arises particularly in complex topographies dominated by a complex precipitation regime previous evaluations of the three different types of precipitation products have shown that products calibrated with gauge information are more reliable hou et al 2014 hsu et al 1997 xu et al 2021 however the calibration approach used is also essential for instance we found that persiann cdr cmorph crtv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 calibrated with gauge data did not provide meaningful results probably owing to the calibration procedure or the gauge information used previous studies examining aimerg and aera5 land across asia have found that daily gauge information produces more reliable estimates at all time steps compared with incorporating monthly gauge information with raw satellite or reanalysis data it has also been shown that products using gauge records from a limited number of stations produce poor results we found that persiann cdr cmorph crtv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 which use gpcp cpc and ghcn data respectively for their calibration ashouri et al 2015 funk et al 2014 xie et al 2017 had low accuracy almost at all time scales except monthly time steps for perisann cdr the gpcp cpc and ghcn gauge sources are only based on low density irimo stations in iran and product calibration may fail since only a small proportion of irimo stations are freely accessible it is also worth noting that incorporating all precipitation estimates into single products may not always lead to accurate results in this study mswepv2 0 a unique product that uses various sources of precipitation estimations showed moderate performance compared with other products on all time scales it can thus be inferred that combining all sources of estimates may produce more bias than found in individual estimates most of the products used in mswepv2 0 were compared in this study and we found that one of its core products era5 land greatly overestimated precipitation however the mswepv2 0 product is unique in type and required improvements need to be considered in future development particularly regarding the morphology based merging algorithm zhu et al 2021a moreover selection of error metrics must follow a logical approach and caution is needed in their application using error metrics sensitive to outliers or large values must be considered during the evaluation process in this study we found that era5 land had large pod values compared with other products however the far results for era5 land were not satisfactory probably because of its reported large overestimation of precipitation in different regions fallah et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 orsolini et al 2019 which was confirmed by our findings thus robust indicators that measure the accuracy of global precipitation products from multiple aspects must be used in product verification on applying the products to different precipitation categories we found that they behaved similarly with high accuracy in low tails however in high tails many of the products showed poor accuracy which may reflect low detection capability in this category moreover the results for the adjusted products were superior to those of their unadjusted versions previous studies have suggested that global precipitation products especially satellite based products may have difficulty in capturing high tails aghakouchak et al 2011 bakhtar et al 2022 eini et al 2022b prakash et al 2016 their ability to capture extreme events may also depend mainly on geographical location existing complex terrain as in the study region or large scale precipitation pattern palharini et al 2020 our results suggested that merra 2 underperformed compared with most other products in analysis of dry and wet spell duration other have reported similar findings regarding the accuracy of merra 2 in capturing drought and extreme precipitation indices at different spatial and temporal scales chen et al 2019 kuswanto and naufal 2019 le et al 2020 odon et al 2019 ullah et al 2021 3 7 limitations and areas for further study in this study we evaluated the performance of 14 global precipitation products three reanalysis four satellite based and seven multi source across karun and karkheh basins southwest iran based on the literature there are two main approaches for evaluating global precipitation products pixel and point wise in this study we extracted datasets for in situ observation locations point wise approach so future studies should compare these datasets using a pixel wise approach since global precipitation products offer spatio temporally consistent data they could be a helpful tool in regional water management in developing countries that suffer from poor gauge networks for example regional water managers could benefit from using estimates produced by these products in dealing with water related issues such as seasonal water allocation drought management mitigation and flood modeling future studies should compare the results of global precipitation products in terms of drought investigation and flood modeling in regions suffering from alternating droughts and floods in recent years moreover we mainly compared the datasets from the metrological perspective and evaluated the efficiency of the precipitation products in capturing precipitation variation future studies should evaluate the products using a distributed hydrological model for the selected basins which are two primary sources of water in iran evaluation of the global precipitation products showed that almost all had lower reliability at daily than at monthly time steps thus bias correction should be applied before using daily data from these products in practical applications such as real time flood monitoring dam operation or other near real time applications within regional water resources management at monthly time steps the results were satisfactory so future water balance and long term climate studies could consider these products as a benchmark with some degree of bias correction for the specific region however the unadjusted versions of all products performed poorly in capturing precipitation variation at monthly and daily time steps so these products should be used with caution in operational applications such as preparing flood warnings and optimizing dam operation in this study we evaluated the performance of the global precipitation products at different precipitation intensities including light and extreme categories we also analyzed the accuracy of the products regarding cwd and cdd indices i e in prediction of dry and wet spell duration the performance of global precipitation products in capturing the variability of extreme events at varying spatial and temporal resolution and the effect of extreme precipitation events can also be evaluated using different precipitation algorithms where we suggest using etccdi indices as a benchmark here we analyzed precipitation products derived from a variety of sources using various metrics in order to conduct a more accurate analysis we recommend that future studies evaluate the accuracy of precipitation products by considering their sources this could be useful for future studies to analyze different precipitation algorithms with an in depth discussion of their data sources therefore we suggested that future studies evaluate the accuracy of global precipitation products while considering their data assimilation algorithms and also their source of estimates here we compared 14 commonly used products that match the time coverage of our in situ observations and the chosen period 2003 2012 was appropriate since gauge network density was sufficient for the evaluation other products such as gpm era products could be considered for future evaluations of regions with a short period of observational data and a sparse gauge network finally it is worth mentioning that we did not consider gauge based products which are based solely on in situ observations and would thus be superior to satellite based and reanalysis based products as this would not have added any valuable information however the interpolation error among gauge based products must be considered and for some long term applications such as climate change studies flood return period gauge based products could be used too 4 conclusions the performance of 14 high resolution precipitation products cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 persiann persiann cdr persiann cdr mswepv2 0 pgfv2 0 jra 55 era5 land merra 2 chirpsv2 0 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 in estimating daily and monthly precipitation in karun and karkheh basins iran 2003 2012 was evaluated and compared against reference observations from 254 local gauges across both basins different statistical categorical and visualization methods were used to scrutinize different aspects of the performance of the global precipitation products the conclusions were as follows 1 comparison of map maps based on observational data and global precipitation products revealed that tmpa 3b42 both versions era5 land and merra 2 provided better annual estimates for the whole study area 2 for annual time series of precipitation averaged over the whole study area all products except chirpsv2 0 achieved similar performance in capturing changes in annual observed precipitation after 2004 at monthly time steps tmpa 3b42v7 0 outperformed all other products with estimates closest to the reference observations era5 land overestimated annual precipitation while all other products were either close to or underestimated the reference dataset 3 statistical evaluation revealed poor accuracy of all products at daily time scale but all bias adjusted products except persainn cdr outperformed their unadjusted version era5 land was not among the best performing products at daily time scale its high correlation coefficient value denoted good correlation with observed precipitation over the study area but its high bias rate and low variability ratio led to relatively low kge score 4 three categorical metrics were employed pod far hss based on pod era5 land persiann ccs persiann cdr jra 55 and cmorph bldv1 0 were the best performing products in addition all bias adjusted products outperformed their unadjusted versions based on pod based on far correction lowered the performance of uncorrected versions based on the overall hss index cmorph bld v1 0 mswepv2 0 merra 2 and era5 land outperformed other products across the study area none of the products performed well in mountainous areas in karun basin 5 statistical indices indicated considerable improvement in the performance of all products when applied to monthly results almost twice as good as for daily time steps in term of monthly kge tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and merra 2 were the best performing products with average kge 0 5 due to the complex precipitation pattern over highland areas all products except tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and merra 2 showed poor accuracy in these regions based on the kge index overall based on all indices at monthly time scale bias adjusted products outperformed their unadjusted versions 6 a performance diagram showed good reliability of all products for the light rainfall category 0 5 mm day but poor accuracy for moderate 5 10 mm day to heavy 10 20 mm day precipitation classes era5 land outperformed other products in detecting rainfall occurrences above 10 mm day with era5 land joining it for the extreme precipitation class 20 mm day ranking the products in terms of accurate estimation of precipitation rates based on average kge index showed that tmpa 3b42v7 0 and merra 2 were the two most reliable products at both daily and monthly time scale across karun and karkheh basins in southwest iran 7 analysis of dry and wet spell duration based on different precipitation products showed that merra 2 was superior to others in terms of cwd index and cmorph crtv1 0 was the best performing in terms of cdd index followed by merra 2 these findings provide better insights into the performance of different global precipitation products for two crucial and threatened basins in iran and can support other hydrological and

7847,study region karkheh and karun basins 29 35 n 46 52 e are two large river basins area 51 000 and 67 000 km2 respectively with complex topography in southwest iran study focus access to spatio temporally consistent precipitation data is a key requirement for hydrological studies especially in data scarce regions this study evaluated 14 global precipitation products against gauge observations from 2003 to 2012 in karun and karkheh basins southwest iran different categorical and statistical indices at varying spatial and temporal resolution including kling gupta efficiency kge bias correlation coefficient and variability ratio were used to evaluate the products new hydrological insights for the region for daily time steps tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and cmorph bldv1 0 outperformed all other products with kge 0 3 tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and persiann cdr were the best performing products for monthly time steps with kge 0 5 era5 land showed the highest positive bias bias 1 5 compared with in situ observations particularly for mountainous southeastern parts of karun basin overall bias adjusted products obtained by merging ground based observations in the estimations outperformed the unadjusted versions the spatial distribution of statistical error metrics indicated that almost all products showed their greatest uncertainties for mountainous regions due to complex precipitation processes in these regions these results can contribute significantly to hydrological and water resources planning measures in the study region including early flood warning systems drought monitoring and optimization of dam operation graphical abstract ga1 keywords global precipitation estimation products spatio temporal performance evaluation statistical error analysis categorical index iran data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction precipitation a fundamental variable in the global water cycle directly or indirectly affects surface runoff soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and several other hydro climatic variables ghajarnia et al 2021 kalantari et al 2019 markonis et al 2019 2021 owing to its close interactions with other land atmospheric variables reliable estimation of precipitation is of particular interest and critical importance in a variety of fields such as water resources management hydrological modeling global energy analysis climate modeling and agricultural studies asante et al 2007 carrera hernandez and gaskin 2007 funk et al 2014 huffman et al 1997 kucera et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 ground based observations provide the most accurate precipitation measurements sun et al 2018 however in inaccessible and remote areas and in many developing countries gauge records are either incomplete or non existent mostly due to the high cost of gauge installation and maintenance salio et al 2015 sun et al 2018 these spatial gaps in precipitation measurements together with the common inconsistencies in gauge records make it difficult to provide an unbiased view of precipitation at global scale brunetti et al 2006 different high resolution precipitation estimation products have been developed in recent decades with increasing use of remote sensing techniques and enhanced computational capacities these state of the art global and quasi global products can be divided into four categories 1 reanalysis products 2 gridded ground based observations 3 satellite based products and 4 climate data records cdrs hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b saemian et al 2021 these spatio temporally consistent products are potentially good alternatives for ground based observations and can address some of the disadvantages and uncertainties of gauge records but must be examined thoroughly before use to ensure their reliability and accuracy shayeghi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 therefore numerous studies have focused on evaluating the performance of precipitation estimation products across regions of the world with differing geographical and climate conditions these studies have been carried out at different spatial scales including global regional and local aghakouchak et al 2011 beck et al 2017 2019a derin et al 2016 duan et al 2016 eini et al 2019 2021 2022a 2022b ghajarnia et al 2015 2018 guo et al 2015 hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b ma et al 2020 2022 saemian et al 2021 zhu et al 2021b kumar et al 2022 pradhan et al 2022 in the case of iran many previous studies have evaluated precipitation estimation products for some basins or the entire country an early study by javanmard et al 2010 evaluated the performance of tmpa 3b42 precipitation estimates against synoptic gauge records 1998 2006 for iran other studies since then have evaluated different sets of global precipitation products against in situ observations for iran and have compared the performance of these products at different temporal and spatial scales e g alijanian et al 2017 azizi et al 2016 darand et al 2017 azizian and ramezani etedali 2019 darand and khandu 2020 s m hosseini moghari and tang 2020a 2020b hosseini moghari et al 2018 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 2013 katiraie boroujerdy 2013 moazami et al 2016 2013 raziei and sotoudeh 2017 sharifi et al 2016 ghajarnia et al 2018 many of these studies have found that most products are more efficient in the zagros mountains and southern iran than in coastal regions in the north where all products reportedly show poor performance alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 moazami et al 2016 raziei and sotoudeh 2017 sharifi et al 2016 recently fallah et al 2020 and mosaffa et al 2020 provided a better basis for choosing a good source of precipitation estimates across two basins in southwest iran karun and karkheh respectively however there is still considerable uncertainty regarding various aspects of the performance of precipitation estimation products at different spatial and temporal scales in karun and karkheh basins for example many recent studies have focused on a limited number of global precipitation products and the period and time scale of comparison differ between studies another key discrepancy is that different observational gauge datasets such as those from iran meteorological organization irimo and iran water management research institute tamab have been used as reference data in different studies in addition the observational rain gauge network in iran suffers from uncertainties and measurement inconsistencies ghajarnia et al 2014 thus previous studies of iran and particularly of karun and karkheh basins have still shortcomings especially in the evaluation approaches and reference datasets used which makes comparison of results difficult for instance mosaffa et al 2020 only used 26 rain gauges in karkheh basin for daily assessments and fallah et al 2020 focused solely on monthly evaluations with limited numbers of metrics therefore it is currently not feasible to draw conclusions for the region based on previous studies most previous studies have only used synoptic station records as they are the most accurate rain gauges in iran and have neglected data from other rain gauges such as those used by tamab despite the fact that synoptic stations are mostly located at low altitudes and do not sample at higher elevations which tamab stations do therefore there is a need to use more comprehensive data on karun and karkheh basins considering a more complete set of in situ rain gauges and including both synoptic stations and tamab stations with better coverage of higher altitudes when evaluating the performance of the most commonly used global precipitation products in these basins the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of 14 common and well known global precipitation products persiann persiann cdr persiann ccs cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 era5 land merra 2 jra 55 pgfv2 0 mswepv2 0 and chirpsv2 0 against data from the domestic rain gauge network in karun and karkheh basins product performance was analyzed using daily precipitation data 2003 2012 and monthly data aggregated from daily observations as described in section 2 the evaluation was performed using different statistical and categorical measures which are also described in section 2 results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by a summary and conclusions in section 4 the overall aim of the study was to provide meaningful insights into regional water resource management hydrological modelling and climate analyses across complex terrain with scarce data by using a wide range of precipitation products with different aspects of analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies between latitude 29 35 n and longitude 46 52 e in southwest iran and encompasses karkheh and karun basins through which two of the largest rivers in iran flow fig 1 karkheh and karun basin occupy an area of 51 000 and 67 000 km2 respectively and long term average streamflow is around 170 and 590 m3 s respectively khazaei 2021 the zagros mountain range means that these basins have some of the most complex terrain in iran with average elevation increasing drastically from 0 to 3916 m above sea level from north to south mean annual precipitation in karkheh basin is around 450 mm year with spatial variation ranging from 150 mm year on arid low elevation plains to 750 mm year in highland areas choubin et al 2019 mean annual precipitation in karun basin is 632 mm year with larger spatial variability of 153 mm year in arid southern lowlands to 2000 mm year in mountainous areas fallah et al 2020 fig 2 2 2 reference data rain gauge data provided by irimo and tamab were used as the reference dataset daily data from a total of 254 gauge stations within a 10 year period 2003 2012 were used to evaluate the performance of the different global precipitation products fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the rain gauges across karkheh and karun basins 2 3 global precipitation products fourteen global precipitation estimation products with different temporal and spatial resolution were chosen comprising three reanalysis four satellite based and seven multi source precipitation products satellite based precipitation products including geostationary satellites and polar orbiting satellites estimates precipitation using vis ir method passive microwave method and mutli sensor technique huffman et al 2007a 2007b every single method has its pros and cons which must be considered furthermore by combining the latest observations with a short range forecast constrained by previous observations data assimilation provides the best estimate of the earth system s current state this estimate called the analysis forms the basis of weather forecasts the quality of forecasts is dependent on the accuracy of the analysis when weather and climate analyses are produced for prolonged periods using the same assimilation system as before they become reanalysis product hersbach et al 2020 the third group is multi source precipitation products that benefit from reanalysis nad satellite estimate the main characteristics of all products are shown in table s1 column data source represents their source of estimation 2 3 1 reanalysis precipitation products reanalysis datasets provide a spatially complete and temporally coherent time series of data for different global atmospheric variables by benefiting from three main components data assimilation approaches forecasting models and different input observations dee et al 2011 due to the lack of globally consistent observational data climate reanalysis products are used as an alternative in a wide range of earth science studies qian et al 2006 in this study we used precipitation data from the following three reanalysis products european center for medium range weather forecast reanalysis ecmwf 5th generation land era5 land hersbach et al 2020 japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 rienecker et al 2011 era5 land provides a consistent view of changes in land variables over many decades at higher spatial and temporal resolution compared with era5 which was developed by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis product sabater and data 2019 spanning 1950 present time era5 land is one of the longest and finest reanalysis products with temporal resolution of one hour and spatial native resolution of 9 km hersbach et al 2020 jra 55 the second reanalysis product launched by japan meteorological agency extensively improved the japanese 25 year reanalysis product jra 25 onogi et al 2007 jra 55 addresses issues identified with the previous product and produces relevant detailed climate data especially for climate change studies and assessing multidecadal variabilities kobayashi et al 2015 the daily jra 55 reanalysis product with spatial resolution of 1 25 1 25 covers the entire globe kobayashi et al 2015 merra 2 is nasa s second generation reanalysis product spanning 1979 to present merra 2 utilizes a recent version of the goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 data assimilation system it covers the whole globe with high spatial resolution of 0 5 0 67 and hourly time steps rienecker et al 2011 2 3 2 satellite based precipitation products satellite based precipitation estimates offer an alternative way to monitor precipitation at global scale compared with ground based observations considering the high variability of precipitation in time and space satellites can provide valuable information for estimating precipitation with suitable spatial and temporal resolution kidd and huffman 2011 for this study we selected four widely used satellite based products trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis near real time 3b42rt version 7 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 climate prediction center morphing raw version 1 cmorph rawv1 0 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann and persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs by using various meteorological satellites around the world tmpa provides precipitation estimates at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution covering 50 n to 50 s at three hourly time scales for 1998 2016 huffman et al 2007a 2007b tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 is the near real time with latency of 7 h from the observation time version of tmpa products the satellite based persiann product is designed to produce global precipitation estimations at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution using an artificial neural network in order to generate 30 minute rainfall estimate persiann utilizes the global infrared ir information from geosynchronous satellites goes 8 goes 10 gms 5 metsat 6 and metsat 7 provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and then aggregates these estimates into 6 h rainfall hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 persiann ccs is a successor of the persiann product that also benefits from satellite information on cloud attributes and further incorporates them into the rainfall estimation relationships hong et al 2004 in comparison with persiann the ccs version has finer spatial resolution 0 04 0 04 covering 60 n 60 s for 2004 present time at different temporal scales cmorph rawv1 0 is a near real time product developed by noaa it is based on low orbital satellite passive microwave pmw sensors with ir information used to interpolate between successive pmw derived rainfall intensity fields joyce et al 2004 the primary and reprocessed versions of cmorph are called version 0 x and version 1 respectively 2 3 3 multi source precipitation products different multi source precipitation products have been developed in recent years due to the short period and uncertainties of precipitation estimation from satellite based precipitation products these multi source precipitation products are a combination of two or more precipitation estimations from various sources in this study we used seven high resolution multi source products namely cmorph bias corrected version 1 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph satellite gauge merged version 1 cmorph bldv1 0 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station v 2 chirpsv2 0 persiann climate data record persiann cdr trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis research grade 3b42 version 7 tmpa 3b42v7 0 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswepv2 0 and princeton global forcings version 2 pgfv2 0 cmorph v1 0 contains three different precipitation products i cmorph raw introduced earlier ii cmorph crt the bias corrected version using the probability density function pdf matching bias removal technique on cmorph raw and iii cmorph bld merged product generated by calibrating cmorph raw estimates with in situ data and using an optional interpolation technique joyce et al 2004 chirpsv2 0 is another reliable up to date product for many early warning objectives that covers areas exceeding 50 n 50 s it provides precipitation estimates in the period 1981 present time and combines high resolution satellite imagery 0 05 0 05 with data from in situ stations funk et al 2015 persiann cdr is also based on the original persiann algorithm using gridded satellite b1 gridsat b1 infrared data and adjusted using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly product ashouri et al 2015 this product was created for extreme daily precipitation events and climate studies that require data for more than 30 years persiann cdr is available in high spatial resolution 0 25 25 covering 60 n 60 s for 1983 present time with a 3 month time delay tmpa 3b42v7 0 is the research product of tmpa calibrated via gauge data and incorporating different sensor calibrations and additional post processing it is available in 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and covers 50 n to 50 s for 2000 2016 huffman et al 2007a 2007b liu 2015 mswepv2 0 recently developed by beck et al 2019a 2019b is a global precipitation product with temporal and spatial resolution of 3 h and 0 1 respectively for 1979 2020 the exceptional feature of mswepv2 0 is that it combines in situ satellite and reanalysis data to provide high quality global precipitation estimates pgf is another global precipitation product that combines several sources including in situ satellite and reanalysis data disaggregating them in time and space it is available in 3 hour to monthly temporal scale with 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 spatial resolution sheffield et al 2006 2 4 evaluation approach several steps were followed when evaluating the performance of the global precipitation products initially long term time series of the precipitation estimates from all 14 global products and observed precipitation at rain gauge stations were collected and preprocessed by reformatting the data to prepare them for performance evaluations tasks carried out using climate data operator cdo schulzweida 2019 various statistical metrics were then used to characterize model behaviors and quantify their associated uncertainties and errors in precipitation estimation this step was carried out using the climate data tools cdt and hydrogof packages in the r programming environment zambrano bigiarini 2014 the error at different spatial and temporal scales for the global precipitation products was computed and illustrated using various visualization techniques the most common methods available for error determination are continuous statistical parameters and metrics based on contingency tables the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the precipitation products in daily and monthly time steps but their performance in estimating annual time series and mean annual precipitation in the study area was also examined 2 4 1 continuous statistical indices continuous statistical indices show how well predicted values correspond to observed values in this study we used kling gupta efficiency kge since it measures three types of error temporal error r bias error Œ≤ and variability error Œ≥ gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 moreover kge is a robust index since it summarizes multiple aspects of model error into a single indicator 1 kge 1 r 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 Œ≥ 1 2 where r denotes pearson correlation coefficient hereafter cc see eq 2 Œ≤ is the bias component defined as the ratio between average observed and estimated precipitation values eq 3 and Œ≥ represents the variability defined as the ratio of estimated to observed coefficient of variation eq 4 in the following equations Œº o and Œº e is the average precipitation value in the observational and estimated times series respectively œÉ o and œÉ e is the standard deviation in observations and estimations respectively n is the number of records in the time series with valid observed or estimated data number of records excluding the no data values in the time series and o i and e i denotes respectively observational and estimated data at date i in the time series kge r Œ≤ and Œ≥ all have their optimum value at unity 2 r 1 n 1 n o i Œº o e i Œº e œÉ o œÉ e 3 Œ≤ Œº e Œº o 4 Œ≥ œÉ e Œº e œÉ o Œº o 2 4 2 categorical statistical indices categorical statistics measure the agreement between estimated and observed occurrence of events in this study the contingency table shown in table 2 was used to define dichotomous estimations and calculate contingency table indices wilks 2011 a dichotomous estimate determines the occurrence and non occurrence of rainfall as yes and no events respectively in order to detect yes and no precipitation events a threshold needs to be specified in this study the threshold was set at 1 mm day based on similar assumptions in previous studies e g ghajarnia et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 in the contingency table a hit event indicates the condition in which both observational and estimated datasets agree on the occurrence of precipitation while a false alarm fa shows that the precipitation event estimated by the model has not occurred in reality and is not a precipitation event in the observational dataset wilks 2011 similarly a miss refers to an event recorded in the reference observation dataset but missed by the global precipitation estimation product while a correct negative cn indicates that both the observational dataset and estimation products have reported a no rainfall event wilks 2011 based on the time series of dichotomous conditions and the number of hit fa miss and cn variables different indicators are defined and can be calculated to evaluate the performance of different global models in estimation of precipitation occurrence see ebert et al 2007 for more details in this study we used three indicators probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and heidke skill score hss to measure the association between precipitation product estimates and observed rainfall occurrences pod determines the ratio of rainfall events correctly identified by the precipitation product to the total number of real rain events based on the observational dataset perfect score 1 far shows the ratio of the total number of false rainfall identifications by the model to the total number of estimated yes rainfall events by the global precipitation product perfect score 0 since pod and far only consider single aspects of precipitation we also used hss as a more robust indicator that measures the performance of precipitation products in terms of dichotomous statistics stanski et al 1989 hss also measures the overall ability of a precipitation estimation product in capturing the occurrence of precipitation events perfect score 1 eqs 5 to 7 were used to calculate pod far and hss based on the dichotomous statistics according to table 1 5 pod a a c 6 far b b a 7 hss 2 ad bc a c c d a b b d 2 4 3 dry and wet spell analysis we used two indices consecutive dry days cdd and consecutive wet days cwd to analyze the accuracy of the global precipitation products in terms of estimating the duration of dry and wet spells cdd and cwd are both calculated based on daily precipitation in this study the threshold was set at 1 mm day cdd and cwd are formulated as follows 8 rr ij 1 mm 9 rr ij 1 mm where rr ij is daily precipitation amount on day i in period j 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of precipitation estimation products at annual and monthly time scales a mean annual precipitation map map for karun and karkheh basins based on all gridded precipitation products and interpolated gauge records for the period 2003 2012 is shown in fig 3 measured map in gauge records varied from 134 to 1384 mm year across the basins and increased from the northwestern lowlands of karkheh basin to the southeastern highlands of karun basin this indicates presence of a spatial pattern and relationship between map and elevation with high altitude areas receiving greater amounts of annual precipitation the terrain barrier effect leads to high precipitation rates over mountainous regions in the zagros chain a bulky topographical feature with continuous ridge lines in those regions the precipitation rate is affected by elevation changes overall visual comparison of the map patterns for the basins showed that the main spatial patterns produced by tmpa 3b42v7 0 were closest to the observed values followed by era5 land and merra 2 with slight overestimations and chirpsv2 0 with slight underestimation relative to the observational spatial pattern fig 3 the persiann family seemed to be less successful in capturing the spatial pattern of map in general but persiann ccs performed better than the others with more accurate estimations of map in the mountainous areas of karun basin while persiann significantly underestimated map values in the highlands cmorph crt and cmorph bld adjusted versions both improved estimations compared with cmorph raw non adjusted version but still underestimated map in the study area and did not correctly capture the increasing spatial pattern from lowlands to highlands persiann mswepv2 0 and pgfv2 0 simulated the observed spatial pattern of map in declining order and all greatly underestimated precipitation in the study area jra 55 also showed relatively poor performance in capturing the map spatial pattern considering its coarser spatial resolution compared with other products due to complex topography and the particular climate system in the study region affected by proximity to the coast in the west and high mountain ranges in the center estimation of precipitation was not an easy task for the global products the highest and lowest map value among all products was produced by era5 land and cmorph crtv1 0 respectively with recorded precipitation of up to 1500 and below 40 mm year respectively in central areas of karun basin and southwestern parts of karkheh basin as found previously by javanmard et al 2010 and darand et al 2017 tmpa 3b42v7 0 showed relatively good performance in capturing annual precipitation in the study region with only slight underestimation fig 4 show the temporal variation in annual and monthly precipitation time series 2004 2012 respectively as measured at rain gauge stations and estimated by different precipitation products the bias adjusted products merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 tmpa3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and pgfv2 0 but not chirpsv2 0 showed rather similar trends throughout the study period except for 2004 with annual variation close to that in observations fig 4 the performance of some unadjusted products i e jra 55 persiann ccs and era5 land was not acceptable when compared against the observational data although their performance improved slightly after 2008 era5 land produced the greatest overestimation of all products while persiann and cmorph rawv1 0 produced the greatest underestimations on an annual basis fig 4 the temporal trend in precipitation at monthly scale showed relatively better performance of tmpa 3b42v7 0 and poor estimation by persiann cdr persiann ccs persiann and chirpsv2 0 fig 4 other products were capable overall of detecting the general trend in observed precipitation with reasonable accuracy and slight over or under estimation all products except era5 land tended to underestimate observed precipitation over the study area both at annual and monthly time scales these results from time series analysis were consistent with the results from the map maps see fig 3 which showed great overestimation by era5 land across mountainous regions and better results for tmpa 3b42v7 0 overall although both persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 0 utilized the same observational precipitation data source gpcp adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2007a 2007b to improve their estimations the calibration procedure used in tmpa 3b42v7 0 seemed to make it more efficient than persiann cdr and provided tmpa 3b42v7 0 with better accuracy for the study area in terms of the spatial variation in map and monthly and annual estimations 3 2 statistical error in global precipitation product estimates at daily scale the performance of all 14 precipitation products at daily time steps based on the kge error index and its related components is compared and evaluated in fig 5 all products showed relatively poor accuracy with negative kge values for persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 all products had kge 0 4 but merra 2 with approximately kge 0 4 performed better than all other products fig 5 overall the bias adjusted products i e tmpa 3b42v7 0 cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 outperformed the unadjusted products i e cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 in terms of kge except for persiann cdr which was the most inaccurate product given the poor performance of persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 fig 5 caution is needed in application of these products to estimate precipitation at daily time scale in the study area the correlation coefficient cc bias and variability ratio vr values revealed interesting details on the performance of the different products leading to their general kge values fig 5 based on cc era5 land performed best among all products cc 0 6 but its high bias value 1 5 led to low overall kge value 0 22 for the study area in terms of bias persiann cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 mswepv2 0 and pgfv2 0 underestimated precipitation to some extent bias 0 7 while era5 land was the only product with clear overestimation at daily time scale similar to the annual and monthly results in fig 4 in terms of vr merra 2 tmpa 3b42v7 0 and pgfv2 0 with their higher kge values also displayed vr values closer to one while cmorph rawv1 0 and persiann cdr with negative kge values tended to underestimate the variability in the observed precipitation dataset across the study area and at daily scale overall the relatively high kge value for gauge corrected products suggested that these products could be more efficient than raw products in daily precipitation estimation across the study region however the more in depth analysis must be considered since some gauge corrected products were not among the best performed products similar findings were also drawn for various precipitation products across different regions at a daily time scale for some studies ghozat et al 2021 ma et al 2021 saemian et al 2021 which indicated that they must be used with caution in this time scale fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of kge index for different products that gave scores varying from very low to high for the study area the kge scores ranged from around 1 65 for persiann cdr to approximately 0 8 for merra 2 across various regions indicating varying performance of the products in matching reference precipitation at daily time steps considering the spatial distribution of kge it is noteworthy that chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and all products in the persiann family showed lower accuracy with kge 0 3 in most regions however merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 era5 land and pgfv2 0 outperformed the other products and provided better daily estimates at different locations around the study area the results also indicated that using gauge data was effective for products in the cmorph and tmpa families while there was no significance improvement for the bias adjusted version of persiann i e persiann cdr fig 6 cmorph bldv1 0 which benefits from a proper calibration procedure is pmw based and the distinction between snowfall and precipitation over mountainous regions is well captured by this product the ir based products i e chirpsv2 0 persiann persiann cdr and persiann ccs did not perform well for mountainous regions fig 6 previous studies suggest that ir based products have limitations in estimating orographic rain events over complex terrain derin et al 2016 shen et al 2020 tong et al 2014 yong et al 2015 as confirmed by our findings fig 6 the low kge value of mswepv2 0 for the zagros mountains might result from associated uncertainty from all precipitation products for this region since that product merges multiple precipitation products to produce its final estimates beck et al 2019b overall the findings and patterns obtained fig 6 indicated that the majority of the global precipitation products tested were ineffective for daily hydrological applications across the study area due to the vital importance of karun and karkheh basins for water resources and hydrology in iran use of global daily precipitation products after proper bias adjustment and enhancement of the estimations is indicated complete cc bias and vr maps are provided in supplementary information figs s1 s3 comparison of the spatial patterns of the cc maps produced by different global precipitation products at daily time scale fig s1 indicated that in general mswepv2 0 era5 land and cmorph bldv1 0 estimates were well correlated with the gauge precipitation data especially in southeastern parts of karun basin with cc values ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 while lower cc values 0 0 5 were generally found for karkheh basin era5 land outperformed all other products and its estimates were well correlated with gauge observations cc 0 7 at the majority of stations the bias adjusted versions of the cmorph and tmpa products produced better results across the study area than their non adjusted versions however persiann cdr showed no improvement on its real time version the poor performance of cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann might be due to inability of the pdf matching based bias removal technique and cloud top based infrared observations over complex terrain alijanian et al 2017 dinku et al 2007 based on this index the worst results were produced by chirpsv2 0 among the unadjusted products era5 land significantly overestimated precipitation amount bias 1 35 in most regions while other unadjusted products showed lower bias fig s2 dominant precipitation processes over complex topographies such as the zagros mountains may have resulted in poor performance of era5 land which is consistent with findings by fallah et al 2020 the high bias rate for era5 land may arise from its poor snowfall or precipitation detection especially during wet months while the lack of a proper snowfall removal process in era5 land is reported to cause high overestimation for mountainous regions jiang et al 2021 orsolini et al 2019 the spatial distribution of bias also showed that all products except era5 land were susceptible to low bias rate for stations located in humid southeastern parts of karun basin in the arid southern part of both basins all products overestimated precipitation amount with bias values ranging between 1 15 and 1 35 thus the precipitation products tended to underestimate precipitation amount for wet regions and overestimate it for dry regions which is consistent with previous results amjad et al 2020 chiaravalloti et al 2018 de leeuw et al 2015 el kenawy et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 overall the results showed that merra 2 persiann cdr pgfv2 0 and chirps had acceptable accuracy for some stations with bias rate between 0 85 and 1 35 however these products showed moderate to high overestimation for other stations especially in mountainous regions in southeastern karun basin persiann and cmorph rawv1 0 showed the worst performance among all products with strong underestimation bias 0 45 in particular for stations located in the southeastern part of karun basin the spatial distribution of vr in daily time steps for all products is shown in fig s3 the bias adjusted merra 2 chirpsv2 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 products were superior to other products in terms of vr and had the highest number of stations with values close to the optimum 0 95 1 05 era5 land persiann cdr cmorph rawv1 0 jra 55 and persiann ccs showed significant underestimation based on this index for most stations among all products persiann cdr had the most stations with vr 0 75 indicating a high rate of underestimation for the study region interestingly among all products with overestimation vr 1 15 the rate of overestimation was highest for stations located in southeast karun basin and to some extent in northwest karkheh basin the values of vr in daily time steps along with all other statistical indicators indicated that almost all products could not capture accurately the spatial variability in precipitation across both basins therefore effective preprocessing methods must be considered prior to utilizing these products for complex terrain the performance of the different precipitation products over the study area in terms of the contingency table of pod and far is compared and evaluated in figs s4 s5 in supplementary information era5 land greatly outperformed all other products with the highest pod value 0 7 however this may have come at the cost of overestimating precipitation events as era5 land also displayed the greatest bias rate see figs 4 and 5 and highest far values for the study area fig s5 this is in line with previous findings for both the era5 and era interim products amjad et al 2020 de leeuw et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 h√©nin et al 2018 persiann ccs persiann cdr jra 55 and cmorph bldv1 0 showed acceptable accuracy and performed better than the other products in terms of pod index fig s4 interestingly and in contrast to the results for daily kge index calibration of persiann cdr and cmorph bldv1 0 using gauge information significantly improved their rainfall detection capability however this was not the case for cmorph crtv1 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 the adjusted versions of cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 respectively overall chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 and persiann had the worst results of all products based on pod index fig s4 although the precipitation products performed relatively well in detecting rainy days the far values were slightly high for all products across both basins fig s5 showing weaker ability of all products in detecting no rainfall events this was particularly the case for era5 land as explained before considering its high pod value conversely cmorph rawv1 0 which provided the lowest pod index values in fig s4 performed better than all other products in terms of far index explaining the high underestimation of observed precipitation by cmorph raw1 0 across both basins fig s5 interestingly the spatial distribution of far index indicated that bias adjusted products reduced the accuracy of their unadjusted versions especially for persiann cdr this might be because improving either far or pod usually leads to impairment of the other as there is a trade off between the ability of a model in detecting rainy days high pod and falsely reporting them high far ghajarnia et al 2016 the far values showed no particular spatial pattern across the study area fig s5 fig 7 shows the ability of the products in correct detection of rainfall events based on the hss index cmorph bldv1 0 and mswepv2 0 had the highest accuracy among all products in terms of hss with values 0 6 across the study area in addition merra 2 and era5 land showed acceptable performance for both basins however none of the products performed well for the northern mountainous region in karun basin hss values around 0 3 chirpsv2 0 cmorph rawv1 0 tmpa 3brtv7 0 and persiann showed the worst performance across both basins chirpsv2 0 had the worst results of all products comparing the spatial distribution of hss for unadjusted and bias adjusted versions of the products fig 7 the results indicated enhanced performance of the adjusted versions particularly in the persiann and tmpa families where the bias adjusted versions showed higher hss in southern parts of karun basin considering all metrics in daily time scales it could be noted that all products must be examined from different angles as one metric does not fully represent the complete performance of products in any case overall the poor performance of products on a daily time scale raised a great concern for the local authorities since the gauge network suffers from spatio temporal inconsistency ghajarnia et al 2015 to this end a proper daily bias correction must be implemented to utilize these products for local usage across karun and karkheh river basins however the common uncertainties associated with these kinds of studies including a spatial mismatch between in situ and global precipitation products point to pixel approach and gauge uncertainties must be considered furthermore considering the calculated metrics bias is generally the primary cause of error in the global precipitation products our results are consistent with those of satg√© et al 2020 and saemian et al 2021 who compared 23 and 44 gridded precipitation products over west africa and iran respectively they have found that bias is the predominant factor affecting kge scores therefore it could be inferred that a high cc score does not always guarantee high performance of precipitation products and various criteria must be considered while analyzing them 3 3 statistical analysis of global precipitation products at monthly time steps to examine the performance of the global precipitation products more thoroughly at monthly scale which is an appropriate temporal resolution for water resources and climate change studies the evaluations were repeated based on monthly time series compared with the daily results see fig 5 the kge scores varied over a wider range at monthly time steps and reached higher values fig 8 tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr merra 2 and pgfv2 0 outperformed other products in terms of monthly kge score with average kge values 0 5 the bias adjusted products tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 showed better monthly kge scores than their unadjusted versions surprisingly tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 jra 55 and persiann ccs which are basically unadjusted products performed even better than some bias adjusted products such as mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 chirpsv2 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 comparing the results of persiann cdr at monthly and daily time steps revealed that the significant improvement in its precipitation estimations at monthly time steps might be related to the calibration of persiann cdr with monthly gpcp data ashouri et al 2015 the results also indicated higher cc values in comparison with daily values for most of the products studied fig s6 mswepv2 0 and era5 land also had very high monthly cc but their kge values were low due to their high under and overestimation respectively low and high bias index the high cc value obtained for mswepv2 0 might be related to its algorithm which gives observational data higher weighting based on their cc in the merging scheme beck et al 2019b all products successfully represented the monthly variation in observed precipitation as the variability indices mostly ranged around the optimum value unity fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of kge score for the different global precipitation products the overall spatial pattern of kge score suggested that almost all products except cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann performed well for karkheh basin with improved performance of the bias adjusted versions however for karun basin with its more diverse topographical conditions and higher mountains only merra 2 persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 0 performed moderately well while other products showed poor performance the results also indicated that the reanalysis products were significantly different from each other with merra 2 having high accuracy across both basins while era5 land and jra 55 showed poor to moderate accuracy the bias adjusted products of mswepv2 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and pgfv2 0 showed poor performance across mountainous regions indicating unsuccessful bias adjustments in the study area the main reasons for this might be inherent limitations of the calibration procedure and the lack of a gauge network in remote highlands dahri et al 2021 furthermore it could be stated that merging various sources of precipitation products into single products might increase the uncertainty of precipitation estimation as every single product has its uncertainty regarding precipitation estimation the spatial distributions of cc and vr index are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively in supplementary information due to the similarity of bias at monthly and daily time steps monthly biases are not reported again in this section all products except cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 persiann and chirpsv2 0 produced estimates that were well correlated with gauge records cc 0 7 and showed their best performance for stations located in the west and southeast of the study area fig s6 compared with daily time steps fig s1 bias adjusted precipitation products provided higher accuracy and were more reliable across both basins at monthly time steps however the differences between bias adjusted and unadjusted versions were more negligible at daily compared with monthly time steps which means more efficient adjustment in monthly outputs of the models this is in line with previous findings on the performance of persiann persiann cdr tmpa 3b42v7 0 and mswep at different temporal scales in iran indicating that the cc value increases significantly at monthly time steps compared with daily time steps alijanian et al 2017 fallah et al 2020 found that based on monthly cc index era5 performed well whereas jra 55 and mswepv2 0 showed relatively poor performance for karun basin which was contradicted by our findings this might be due to the lower gauge density of the reference dataset used in fallah et al 2020 or the difference between the study periods in the evaluations 2000 2015 in fallah et al 2020 as opposed to 2003 2012 in this study fig s7 shows the spatial distribution of vr in global precipitation products over the study area the bias adjusted products merra 2 mswepv2 0 cmorph bldv1 0 and tmpa 3b42v7 0 were able to better capture the precipitation variability across the two basins vr 0 9 1 05 in most regions indicating that these products could be used to predict monthly precipitation variability with higher confidence level the chirpsv2 0 jra 55 and persiann cdr products greatly underestimated precipitation variability particularly in southwestern parts of the study area vr 0 85 other products showed great overestimation in the north of karkheh basin persiann cmorph crtv1 0 and cmorph rawv1 0 and in the mountainous southeastern part of karun basin persiann cmorph crtv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 overall considering the vr of the bias adjusted versions of persiann trmm and cmorph but not cmorph crtv1 0 it is evident that the use of gauge records converted the overestimated outputs of these products to optimum or underestimated values 3 4 model rankings and summary of evaluations a performance diagram roebber 2009 was created to summarize the results this diagram uses the categorical indicators pod sr success ratio csi as labeled solid contours and bias as dashed lines with labels on the outward extension of the line it summarizes model performance based on contingency table indices with the best values in the top right and the worst in the bottom left corner to evaluate the performance of the 14 precipitation products for different precipitation levels precipitation intensity was divided into four categories 0 5 5 10 10 20 and 20 mm day representing light moderate heavy and extreme rainfall respectively the performance diagram for all products fig 10 indicated that merra 2 cmorph bldv1 0 mswepv2 0 pgfv2 0 jra 55 and era5 land outperformed the other products in correctly capturing precipitation occurrences followed by persiann cdr the results also indicated that bias adjusted versions of persiann persiann cdr and cmorph cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 performed better than their unadjusted versions fig 10 in the tmpa family incorporation of gauge information did not improve the estimation of precipitation occurrence by tmpa 3b42v7 0 surprisingly all products had a near perfect score in detecting light rainfall events 0 5 mm day however the performance of all products in detecting moderate 5 10 mm day and heavy 10 20 mm day precipitation events deteriorated points were closer to the no skill area for the moderate precipitation class and scattered in the plot with better performance of era5 land for the heavy precipitation class era5 land followed by meera 2 outperformed other products in detecting extreme precipitation events fig 10 for this precipitation category jra 55 persiann cdr cmorph bldv1 0 and mswepv2 0 performed similarly with sr 0 5 pod 0 2 csi 0 2 and bias varying from 0 3 to 0 5 cmorph rawv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 were the worst products at capturing heavy and extreme precipitation events tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 showed similar performance to tmpa 3b42v7 0 while other bias adjusted products cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 and persiann cdr outperformed their unadjusted versions in the heavy precipitation class overall the performance diagram indicated that era5 land and merra 2 performed better than the other products particularly in reproducing rainfall events above 20 mm day fig 10 however all products seemed to perform well in capturing rainfall events in the light intensity class previously nashwan et al 2020 found better performance for global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap ushio et al 2009 and african rainfall climatology arc novella and thiaw 2013 for the 0 5 mm day precipitation class in egypt the overall ranking of the different precipitation products in terms of average monthly and daily kge scores showed that the performance of products at monthly time scale was around twice as good as at daily time scale fig 11 this might have been influenced by merging the monthly observational datasets in some products e g persiann cdr persiann cdr was the worst performing product at daily time scale with even worst performance than persiann fig 11a however its performance improved considerably at monthly time scale when persiann cdr was the second best product fig 11b conversely the performance of cmorph bldv1 0 deteriorated from daily to monthly time scale fig 11 based on the average kge index tmpa 3b42v7 0 merra 2 and pgfv2 0 were the three best performing products in estimation of precipitation rates both at daily and monthly time scales cmorph bldv1 0 and persiann cdr were also among the best performing products but only at daily and monthly scale respectively a shorter time scale of evaluation daily could yield poor results considering this beck et al 2019a who evaluated 26 precipitation datasets across the continental united states conus concluded that when it came to cc bias and vr precipitation products performed significantly poorer than the monthly time scale as a result of this finding the error characteristics of a given dataset may change due to changing the assessment time scale accordingly we also observed a similar pattern when considering the median kge value for the study area fig 11 as we showed the kge value varies between 0 08 to 0 66 on the monthly time scale while on a daily basis it lies between 0 19 to 0 35 for different products 3 5 dry and wet spell analysis fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of cwd index for different products with values varying from 2 days to 14 days across the study area according to observational data wet spell duration is high cwd 4 across southeastern and northwestern parts of the study region it is lower cwd 3 in southwestern parts mainly due to low precipitation rate during all months of the year the results showed that merra 2 estimates were well matched with in situ observations with cwd varying between 2 5 and 7 1 days and somewhat overestimated across eastern parts tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 and cmorph rawv1 0 with rather similar patterns to observed cwd values showed relatively better performance than other satellite based products while cmorph bldv1 0 with cwd values varying between 2 3 and 8 5 days was superior to the other adjusted products incorporating gauge information was efficient for cmorph family products but calibrating persiann and tmpa with gauge information did not provide meaningful improvements in these two families other products including chirpsv2 0 persiann families pgfv2 0 jra 55 and era5 land could not capture the spatial variability in cwd index seen in observational data as found in previous comparisons see sections 3 2 and 3 3 era5 land greatly overestimated wet conditions with cwd values ranging from 4 to 14 which might derive from its significant overestimation regarding daily to annual precipitation amounts the results for mswepv2 0 showed that this product had moderate to high accuracy with cwd ranging between 2 4 and 6 days fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the cdd index for the different products with cdd varying from 62 days to 214 days across the study area similarly to the cwd index longer duration dry spells were mainly scattered across southwestern parts of the study region cdd 170 days and shorter duration dry spells were mainly scattered along southeastern and to some extent northern parts cdd 150 days some stations with cdd 130 were scattered unevenly across these parts overall the spatial pattern of results showed moderate to high consistency between era5 land tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 cmorph bldv1 0 merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 estimates and observed cdd pattern however other products could not capture the variability in the cdd index with high accuracy across the study region among all products cmorph crtv1 0 followed by merra 2 performed slightly better than the others with cdd index ranging from 112 to 214 days the cdd index analysis showed that cmorph families were improved after gauge calibration while other families including persiann and tmpa were not improved by bias adjustment this might derive from the gauge adjustment procedure and source of gauge information used the cdd index results for mswepv2 0 showed that the incidence of dry spells surprisingly increased which might be a result of this product s calibration procedure or weighting algorithms to better analyze dry and wet conditions across the study region we performed yearly time series analysis of the cwd and cdd indices fig s9 the results showed that among the reanalysis products merra 2 estimates were well matched with observational data regarding cwd index for almost all years the era5 land product showed significant overestimation from 2003 to 2012 however jra 55 had a similar temporal pattern in cdd index with slight over underestimation in some years satellite based products including persiann ccs and persiann greatly overestimated and underestimated cwd index respectively throughout the study period except for 2007 with a large cwd for persiann for the cmorph rawv1 0 and tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 products no specific pattern was found throughout the study period among the multi source products tested cmorph bldv1 0 and cmorph crtv1 0 captured the temporal variability in cwd index although both showed some degree of overestimation after 2007 considering the temporal pattern of reanalysis products for cdd index era5 land and jra 55 showed large underestimation throughout all years fig s8 as seen for the cwd results merra 2 was well matched with observed cdd values except for years after 2008 slight overestimation the satellite based products showed low accuracy in capturing dry spells with low to high underestimation throughout all years for various products for the multi source products adjusting gauge information proved efficient for cmorph crtv1 0 products with high accuracy and temporal pattern of cdd consistent with observational data the adjusted tmpa product showed moderate accuracy in capturing cdd temporal pattern with significant underestimation throughout the period a consistent temporal pattern with slight overestimation was also observed between mswepv2 0 and observation based cdd index from 2003 to 2012 the results indicated poor accuracy for other multi source products including persiann cdr chirpsv2 0 and pgfv2 0 in capturing temporal trends in cdd index overall spatial and temporal analysis across the study region showed that gauge adjusted products were mostly superior to satellite based products in terms of capturing dry and wet spell duration specifically the results indicated that merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 performed best in terms of cwd and cdd index respectively since cdd and cwd are of great importance for drought analysis merra 2 and cmorph crtv1 0 could be useful for calculations relating to agricultural activities as they can efficiently represent dry and wet periods casanueva et al 2014 considering the results of cwd and cdd indices see figs 12 and 13 and fig s8 it could be noted that products with high accuracy on a monthly and daily time basis had relatively high accuracy in capturing spatial variability of both indices furthermore large distortion of era5 land and persiann family products from observed cwd values were also observed in most regions this issue might be due to the high bias rate of era5 land see fig 8 and fig s3 which is dominant all over the region era5 land product tend to overestimate cwd values while underestimating cdd values in most regions which reflect from its large overestimation in most regions furthermore the persiann family products suffer from low hss and kge values which indicate their low detection ability and poor estimates resulting in poor performance of these products regarding cdd and cwd indices also our results for tmpa adjusted version were consistent with keikhosravi kiany et al 2020 who indicated that this product had high accuracy regarding fixed threshold extreme indices including cwd and cdd indices over the southwest of iran 3 6 error source analysis of the different precipitation products in point to grid evaluation we used the maximum number of stations in the study area however some highlands areas suffer from low density station coverage and the uneven distribution of the gauge network in these areas added some degree of uncertainty to the evaluation process previous studies comparing the performance of global precipitation products in highlands areas have generally found that almost all types of products have difficulty in capturing the precipitation variation and characteristics of such regions eini et al 2021 saemian et al 2021 sui et al 2020 zhu et al 2021b this poor performance of precipitation estimation products in highlands areas is a challenge since it is not known whether it derives from the estimation algorithm used and whether poor coverage of stations in these areas affects the evaluation process scale mismatches between precipitation products and in situ observational data also add some uncertainty to evaluations e g point based in situ observations cannot capture areal precipitation characteristics over large grids 0 5 0 5 0 25 0 25 this problem arises particularly in complex topographies dominated by a complex precipitation regime previous evaluations of the three different types of precipitation products have shown that products calibrated with gauge information are more reliable hou et al 2014 hsu et al 1997 xu et al 2021 however the calibration approach used is also essential for instance we found that persiann cdr cmorph crtv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 calibrated with gauge data did not provide meaningful results probably owing to the calibration procedure or the gauge information used previous studies examining aimerg and aera5 land across asia have found that daily gauge information produces more reliable estimates at all time steps compared with incorporating monthly gauge information with raw satellite or reanalysis data it has also been shown that products using gauge records from a limited number of stations produce poor results we found that persiann cdr cmorph crtv1 0 and chirpsv2 0 which use gpcp cpc and ghcn data respectively for their calibration ashouri et al 2015 funk et al 2014 xie et al 2017 had low accuracy almost at all time scales except monthly time steps for perisann cdr the gpcp cpc and ghcn gauge sources are only based on low density irimo stations in iran and product calibration may fail since only a small proportion of irimo stations are freely accessible it is also worth noting that incorporating all precipitation estimates into single products may not always lead to accurate results in this study mswepv2 0 a unique product that uses various sources of precipitation estimations showed moderate performance compared with other products on all time scales it can thus be inferred that combining all sources of estimates may produce more bias than found in individual estimates most of the products used in mswepv2 0 were compared in this study and we found that one of its core products era5 land greatly overestimated precipitation however the mswepv2 0 product is unique in type and required improvements need to be considered in future development particularly regarding the morphology based merging algorithm zhu et al 2021a moreover selection of error metrics must follow a logical approach and caution is needed in their application using error metrics sensitive to outliers or large values must be considered during the evaluation process in this study we found that era5 land had large pod values compared with other products however the far results for era5 land were not satisfactory probably because of its reported large overestimation of precipitation in different regions fallah et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 orsolini et al 2019 which was confirmed by our findings thus robust indicators that measure the accuracy of global precipitation products from multiple aspects must be used in product verification on applying the products to different precipitation categories we found that they behaved similarly with high accuracy in low tails however in high tails many of the products showed poor accuracy which may reflect low detection capability in this category moreover the results for the adjusted products were superior to those of their unadjusted versions previous studies have suggested that global precipitation products especially satellite based products may have difficulty in capturing high tails aghakouchak et al 2011 bakhtar et al 2022 eini et al 2022b prakash et al 2016 their ability to capture extreme events may also depend mainly on geographical location existing complex terrain as in the study region or large scale precipitation pattern palharini et al 2020 our results suggested that merra 2 underperformed compared with most other products in analysis of dry and wet spell duration other have reported similar findings regarding the accuracy of merra 2 in capturing drought and extreme precipitation indices at different spatial and temporal scales chen et al 2019 kuswanto and naufal 2019 le et al 2020 odon et al 2019 ullah et al 2021 3 7 limitations and areas for further study in this study we evaluated the performance of 14 global precipitation products three reanalysis four satellite based and seven multi source across karun and karkheh basins southwest iran based on the literature there are two main approaches for evaluating global precipitation products pixel and point wise in this study we extracted datasets for in situ observation locations point wise approach so future studies should compare these datasets using a pixel wise approach since global precipitation products offer spatio temporally consistent data they could be a helpful tool in regional water management in developing countries that suffer from poor gauge networks for example regional water managers could benefit from using estimates produced by these products in dealing with water related issues such as seasonal water allocation drought management mitigation and flood modeling future studies should compare the results of global precipitation products in terms of drought investigation and flood modeling in regions suffering from alternating droughts and floods in recent years moreover we mainly compared the datasets from the metrological perspective and evaluated the efficiency of the precipitation products in capturing precipitation variation future studies should evaluate the products using a distributed hydrological model for the selected basins which are two primary sources of water in iran evaluation of the global precipitation products showed that almost all had lower reliability at daily than at monthly time steps thus bias correction should be applied before using daily data from these products in practical applications such as real time flood monitoring dam operation or other near real time applications within regional water resources management at monthly time steps the results were satisfactory so future water balance and long term climate studies could consider these products as a benchmark with some degree of bias correction for the specific region however the unadjusted versions of all products performed poorly in capturing precipitation variation at monthly and daily time steps so these products should be used with caution in operational applications such as preparing flood warnings and optimizing dam operation in this study we evaluated the performance of the global precipitation products at different precipitation intensities including light and extreme categories we also analyzed the accuracy of the products regarding cwd and cdd indices i e in prediction of dry and wet spell duration the performance of global precipitation products in capturing the variability of extreme events at varying spatial and temporal resolution and the effect of extreme precipitation events can also be evaluated using different precipitation algorithms where we suggest using etccdi indices as a benchmark here we analyzed precipitation products derived from a variety of sources using various metrics in order to conduct a more accurate analysis we recommend that future studies evaluate the accuracy of precipitation products by considering their sources this could be useful for future studies to analyze different precipitation algorithms with an in depth discussion of their data sources therefore we suggested that future studies evaluate the accuracy of global precipitation products while considering their data assimilation algorithms and also their source of estimates here we compared 14 commonly used products that match the time coverage of our in situ observations and the chosen period 2003 2012 was appropriate since gauge network density was sufficient for the evaluation other products such as gpm era products could be considered for future evaluations of regions with a short period of observational data and a sparse gauge network finally it is worth mentioning that we did not consider gauge based products which are based solely on in situ observations and would thus be superior to satellite based and reanalysis based products as this would not have added any valuable information however the interpolation error among gauge based products must be considered and for some long term applications such as climate change studies flood return period gauge based products could be used too 4 conclusions the performance of 14 high resolution precipitation products cmorph rawv1 0 cmorph bldv1 0 cmorph crtv1 0 persiann persiann cdr persiann cdr mswepv2 0 pgfv2 0 jra 55 era5 land merra 2 chirpsv2 0 tmpa 3b42rtv7 0 tmpa 3b42v7 0 in estimating daily and monthly precipitation in karun and karkheh basins iran 2003 2012 was evaluated and compared against reference observations from 254 local gauges across both basins different statistical categorical and visualization methods were used to scrutinize different aspects of the performance of the global precipitation products the conclusions were as follows 1 comparison of map maps based on observational data and global precipitation products revealed that tmpa 3b42 both versions era5 land and merra 2 provided better annual estimates for the whole study area 2 for annual time series of precipitation averaged over the whole study area all products except chirpsv2 0 achieved similar performance in capturing changes in annual observed precipitation after 2004 at monthly time steps tmpa 3b42v7 0 outperformed all other products with estimates closest to the reference observations era5 land overestimated annual precipitation while all other products were either close to or underestimated the reference dataset 3 statistical evaluation revealed poor accuracy of all products at daily time scale but all bias adjusted products except persainn cdr outperformed their unadjusted version era5 land was not among the best performing products at daily time scale its high correlation coefficient value denoted good correlation with observed precipitation over the study area but its high bias rate and low variability ratio led to relatively low kge score 4 three categorical metrics were employed pod far hss based on pod era5 land persiann ccs persiann cdr jra 55 and cmorph bldv1 0 were the best performing products in addition all bias adjusted products outperformed their unadjusted versions based on pod based on far correction lowered the performance of uncorrected versions based on the overall hss index cmorph bld v1 0 mswepv2 0 merra 2 and era5 land outperformed other products across the study area none of the products performed well in mountainous areas in karun basin 5 statistical indices indicated considerable improvement in the performance of all products when applied to monthly results almost twice as good as for daily time steps in term of monthly kge tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and merra 2 were the best performing products with average kge 0 5 due to the complex precipitation pattern over highland areas all products except tmpa 3b42v7 0 persiann cdr and merra 2 showed poor accuracy in these regions based on the kge index overall based on all indices at monthly time scale bias adjusted products outperformed their unadjusted versions 6 a performance diagram showed good reliability of all products for the light rainfall category 0 5 mm day but poor accuracy for moderate 5 10 mm day to heavy 10 20 mm day precipitation classes era5 land outperformed other products in detecting rainfall occurrences above 10 mm day with era5 land joining it for the extreme precipitation class 20 mm day ranking the products in terms of accurate estimation of precipitation rates based on average kge index showed that tmpa 3b42v7 0 and merra 2 were the two most reliable products at both daily and monthly time scale across karun and karkheh basins in southwest iran 7 analysis of dry and wet spell duration based on different precipitation products showed that merra 2 was superior to others in terms of cwd index and cmorph crtv1 0 was the best performing in terms of cdd index followed by merra 2 these findings provide better insights into the performance of different global precipitation products for two crucial and threatened basins in iran and can support other hydrological and water resources studies in the region the differences found between products in estimating precipitation at daily or monthly time scale show the importance of evaluations of this type which can allow other researchers to choose their preferred products based on their specific needs and preferences credit authorship contribution statement author contributions were as follows a r a b and a s

drought is a natural recurring phenomenon that occurs everywhere at various points in time drought is a complex topic which has impacts on different ecosystems depending on the intensity and duration and socio economic impacts that often magnify the problems of the most vulnerable members of society since 1974 drought has claimed more than one million lives and caused 60 billion in damage throughout the world united nations un 2008 a thorough understanding of drought is essential to mitigate the current drought risk and prepare for climate change central asia is characterized by complex geographic landscapes shortages of water resources agriculture led economies and growing populations in addition central asia has a predominantly arid semiarid climate that is particularly sensitive to changes of atmospheric circulation as such the region even in slightly drier years has endured significant agricultural production losses destruction of local economies and threats to social stability broka et al 2016 clearly developing drought prevention and preparedness strategies requires a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of drought and its evolutionary nature liu et al 2018 wen et al 2018 since drought is a regional phenomenon that occurs over a long period of time it is important to understand the spatial characteristics of drought previous studies on droughts mainly before 2005 focused on the analysis of spatial patterns using data available in the target area for example statistical methods such as correlation analysis and empirical orthogonal functions can be used to estimate the regional characteristics of droughts oladipo 1986 cook et al 1999 hisdal and tallaksen 2003 diaz et al 2020 andreadis et al 2005 proposed a method for estimating the drought severity area duration which is used to track drought duration according to the spatial changes of drought severity using a grid based hydrological model however focusing on spatial characteristics obscures much of the temporal evolution of droughts therefore it is essential to analyze the spatiotemporal structures of droughts to understand the role of external and internal forcing in drought progression subsequent studies have applied a global severity area duration curve analysis sheffield et al 2009 zhan et al 2016 drought cluster characteristics e g distribution of centroids the direction of displacement over time and changes in a cluster area intensity and severity have been studied at national vicente serrano 2006 vidal et al 2010 xu et al 2015 zhai et al 2016 and continental lloyd hughes 2012 scales however previous studies were limited to simple assessments of drought regions using time series of drought severity or report aggregation vicente serrano 2006 vidal et al 2010 gocic and trajkovic 2014 wang et al 2015 many researchers analyzed drought events with relatively long durations and large impact areas in spatiotemporal drought interpretations in other words minor drought events have generally been filtered out so as not to affect the identification of major drought events for example diaz et al 2020 showed that after first filtering the largest cluster the cluster with the largest area at each time step the 3d drought onset and end time duration affected area and spatiotemporal evolution were tracked and analyzed however such the 3d clustering algorithm has the problem of easily overlooking weak drought events in this study we propose a practical method for monitoring droughts in space and time from a three dimensional 3d perspective and identifying all drought events in the central asia region during the period of 1981 2018 using high resolution drought data various drought characterization factors i e starting and ending time of drought duration severity area intensity distance and direction of drought trajectory are used to quantify drought events from the 3d perspective leading to contribute to the creation of dynamic drought maps finally based on dynamic drought maps we present a novel drought monitoring approach that can quantify the evolutionary characteristics of developing drought events on both temporal and spatial scales 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area as shown in fig 1 consists of six countries tajikistan kazakhstan turkmenistan uzbekistan part of china and kyrgyzstan as the precipitation data used in this study is only available for regions below 50 n the study area had to be cropped accordingly the countries within central asia have high climatic contrasts generally across the region winters are moderate to cool with mean temperatures ranging from 3 20 c while summers are warm to hot with mean temperatures ranging from 20 c to 40 c winter temperatures can drop as low as 45 c and go as high as 50 c in summer broka et al 2016 precipitation also varies across the region where the average annual precipitation is 500 mm in tajikistan and 250 mm in uzbekistan usaid 2018 in central asia 80 of the land surface has a higher sensitivity to precipitation anomalies while temperature is becoming an important parameter in drought assessment to account for the potential impact of climate change on arid regions that is even if there is no significant change of precipitation an increase of the atmospheric temperature will increase the rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration which may reduce available water resources in central asia mirzabaev 2013 for the drought analysis of the central asia region it is appropriate to use the drought index based on precipitation and temperature which considers the effect of evapotranspiration on drought 2 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei is a multi scale drought index based on a water balance and is widely used to assess drought conditions this index reflects the extent to which a region deviates from the average drought year with negative values representing more evaporation than precipitation and positive values representing more precipitation than evaporation to estimate the spei value the difference of the water balance was normalized to a log logistic probability distribution vicente serrano et al 2010 of which the probability density function and cumulative distribution function are given in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 f x Œ≤ Œ± x Œ≥ Œ± 1 x Œ≥ Œ± 2 2 f x 1 Œ± x Œ≥ Œ≤ 1 where Œ± Œ≤ and Œ≥ are parameters representing the scale shape and location respectively vicente serrano 2006 calculated the spei as follows 3 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where c0 2 5155 c1 0 8028 c2 0 0203 d1 1 4327 d2 0 1892 and d3 0 0013 when p 0 5 w 2 ln p and when p 0 5 w 2 ln 1 p the drought severity is classified by the spei as shown in table 1 pyarali et al 2022 presented a high resolution 5 km standardized precipitation evaporation index spei hr for central asia at various time scales from 1981 to 2018 using climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station s chirps precipitation and global land evaporation amsterdam model s gleam potential evaporation ep datasets the available observed meteorological data of the region is not continuous and very scarce for the entirety of central asia the spei hr dataset was developed to overcome the lack of data for monitoring the effects of drought in central asia in this study we utilized 6 month time scale of spei hr data covering the period from 1981 to 2018 for the characteristics analysis of 3d drought events 2 3 dynamic drought detection technique dddt algorithm in general to identify drought events in a 3d concept a continuous grid is divided into clusters 2d spatial clusters on a spatial scale and then defined as a 3d drought event by examining connectivity on a time scale rulinda et al 2013 in this study in screening 3d drought events the assumption that it occurs when adjacent grids are in a drought state in both temporal and spatial dimensions is still followed guo et al 2018 however the dddt algorithm proposed in this study is different from previous studies in the process of clustering the grid on the spatial scale and the method of determining the center of drought in this study the dynamic evolution of drought was analyzed using the dddt algorithm as follows step 1 spatial definition of a single drought event at the spatial scale a drought cluster is identified by continuous drought area cda analysis corzo perez et al 2011 lloyd hughes 2012 van huijgevoort et al 2013 herrera estrada et al 2017 diaz et al 2020 the cda analysis follows a connected component labeling approach for clustering drought cells haralick and shapiro 1992 by applying a two scan algorithm first each cell is numbered for a location the binary grid is then navigated to perform the first run which assigns temporary labels to connected adjacent components cells this label represents the connection between the eight closest neighbors and all cells a 3 3 cell section was used in this study with a total of nine cells in the grid and eight perimeters in the centroid cell more detail information on the cda analysis is provided in corzo perez et al 2011 however when clustering drought regions based on the cda only the presence of drought classified by a specific threshold is adapted without considering the grid based severity of drought that is clustering droughts on a spatial scale based on grid specific binary 0 and 1 values we assume the grid by grid drought intensity is uniform therefore in this study a new concept of clustering spatial drought areas was proposed by considering the difference of drought severities by grid this means that the spatial drought extent is centered on the grid with the greatest severity at a specific time and the drought intensity is propagated to the adjacent grid therefore the grid can be clustered by considering the size of the drought severity of the original grid rather than the binary value 0 1 step 2 centroid identification for spatial drought in previous studies researchers identified a major drought cluster e g the cluster with the largest drought area at a specific time and defined the centroid p of the cluster as the centroid at each time step corzo perez et al 2011 lloyd hughes 2012 that is at each time step only one center of the drought cluster is determined however when determining the center of drought according to this method the case with a large drought severity in a cluster with a small area may be overlooked in addition mild droughts that occur over large areas may be overestimated leading to the selection of drought centers diaz et al 2020 therefore in this study we did not intend to decide on one clustering on the spatial scale every time the overlapping area ratio of spatially adjacent clusters was reviewed using eq 4 for all the 2d drought clusters classified in step 1 as a target when the overlapping area ratio was 75 or more they were reclassified into one cluster and the centroid s equation is detailed in wang et al 2019 for example as shown in eq 4 a1 and a2 were merged by the threshold i e spatial overlap ratio into one cluster where the overlap ratio of areas between single drought events a1 and a2 was 75 or more the cell with the lowest spei was selected as the centroid of drought in each cluster 4 spatial overlap ratio area a 1 a 2 area a 1 a 2 100 step 3 centroid linkage of temporally consecutive clusters a rule that separates or joins time sequences is required to link the centroids of a continuous cluster over time in this study the redundancy rate of the drought clusters over time was considered as the threshold i e temporal overlap ratio the two clusters were defined as having temporal continuity when the ratio of the overlapping area to the area of a relatively large community between the area of the community at time t at and at time t 1 at 1 was 50 or more as shown in eq 5 the rules for connecting the centroids of the clusters are shown in fig 2 5 temporal overlap ratio a overlap t t 1 max a t a t 1 100 2 4 spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts the spatiotemporal characteristics of a drought can be explained using indicators such as drought duration severity affected area intensity location of drought centroid latitude and longitude and the distance and direction of the drought trajectory 1 drought duration is determined by the period between the beginning and the end of the drought in space and time meaning the time at which the drought centroids are connected 2 drought severity is the sum of the cumulative severities of the affected grid during the drought duration the drought threshold spei 1 0 was used to determine a 3d drought event as in table 1 3 drought area is defined as the number of the affected grids during the drought duration the area per grid is 25 km2 in this study 4 drought intensity is the severity divided by the duration of drought 5 drought centroid is the cluster s centroid at the spatial scale it is calculated by weighted average considering the drought severity for each grid 6 distance of the drought trajectory is calculated as the sum of distance between centroids for a 3d drought event 7 direction of the drought trajectory is determined based on the location where the 3d drought event started latitude longitude and the location where it ended latitude longitude table 2 describes how to distinguish the direction of drought trajectory fig 3 presents the schematic diagram for identifying the migration direction of a drought where the angle Œ∏ is in the range of 0 360 the direction of the migration path is interpreted as follows the positive eastern direction from the origin of the coordinate system with respect to the first drought centroid initial centroid is represented on the horizontal axis furthermore Œ∏ between the horizontal axis and the line connecting the origin and the centroid of the last drought the last centroid represents a value for determining the migration direction as shown in table 2 the centroid of a particular cluster is located in one of 16 proposed positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 3d drought event analysis based on the dddt algorithm the dddt algorithm was applied to define spatiotemporal drought events in central asia these droughts are considered as a continuum in three dimensions longitude latitude time i e drought patches clustered in the 2d space must be continuously connected in the temporal dimension to be grouped into one final cluster 3d drought event table 3 and fig 4 show the results of extracting 3d drought events in central asia by applying this method during the period of 1981 2018 according to the estimated spei6 hr a total of 32 274 drought events lasting more than two months occurred in this study the characteristics of the occurrence of drought in central asia were summarized using six indices that characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of drought phenomena the distributions of the values for each indicator are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a e show box plots of each indicator for the 3d drought events showing the characteristics of the movement direction of the drought trajectory based on the location information of the center it was found that most of the trajectories of droughts occurring in central asia moved in the lateral direction east and west ene e ese wnw w wsw pearson correlation analysis was performed to analyze the statistical characteristics of spatiotemporal evolution using the 3d drought event characteristic indicator the pearson correlation coefficients between drought duration dd drought severity ds drought area da drought intensity di trajectory travel distance td and drought trajectory travel direction ddt are shown in fig 5 it was confirmed that the drought duration severity area and trajectory movement distance indicators had a high correlation 0 7 0 9 with each other on the other hand for drought intensity the correlations between drought duration r 0 31 and travel distance r 0 56 were low however the direction of movement of the drought trajectory had no correlation with the drought duration severity area intensity or distance traveled table 4 presents the top 20 most severe drought events in central asia from 1981 to 2018 the most severe drought event was based on the drought severity sum of speis values below 1 affected by the grid during the drought duration that had the highest correlation with other indicators among the six drought indicators reviewed above table 4 shows the characteristics beginning b time end e time duration severity area intensity movement distance and trajectory direction of the most severe drought events top 20 in central asia the most severe drought occurred in kyrgyzstan which started in october 2007 and continued for 11 months this drought showed a lateral movement trajectory to the west Œ∏ 180 71 and the affected area during the duration of the drought was 230 900 km¬≤ which is larger than the area of kyrgyzstan 199 900 km¬≤ the second most severe drought occurred in uzbekistan beginning in august 1985 the drought continued for 12 months this drought showed a movement trajectory in the north northeast Œ∏ 61 25 direction and the affected area during the drought was 220 850 km¬≤ based on the drought occurrence times indicated by the bolds in table 4 the drought events that occurred within the period of 2007 2008 accounted for 35 7 out of 20 of the total number of droughts in fact during 2007 2008 there were severe droughts in turkmenistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan food and agriculture organization fao 2017 accordingly it is effective to use the 3d drought event identification technique based on the dddt algorithm in characterizing and understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of drought phenomena 3 2 a new drought monitoring approach using conditional filtering the dddt algorithm proposed in this study has an advantage in explaining the developmental process and evolutionary characteristics of drought phenomena this method determines 3d drought events to quantify the continuous and dynamic evolutionary developmental characteristics of drought events in the 3d space in particular this method can identify all drought events in the long term drought time series in previous studies when a drought event was identified using the 3d clustering method the occurrence of drought in the grid was distinguished according to the binary number system in determining the spatial drought patch which is a 2d concept xu et al 2015 guo et al 2018 on the other hand the dddt algorithm proposed in this study clusters the spatial drought patch by considering that the grid with a large drought depth becomes the center and transfers spreads to adjacent grids in determining the occurrence of drought in the grid accordingly it is possible to quantify the dynamic development characteristics of drought events by sufficiently considering the scale of drought depth for each grid a drought event identified in this way can be shown in fig 6 as a dynamic drought map that includes all the drought attributes in the 3d aspect fig 6 a is a diagram comparing a typical drought map with a dynamic drought map the typical drought map on the left panel shows the drought index values for a specific month using spei6 hr data in contrast the dynamic drought map on the right panel contains drought characteristics for drought events identified through the dddt algorithm therefore in the dynamic drought map clustered drought patches are characteristic in consideration of the continuity and dynamics of drought events fig 6 b shows a conceptual diagram of the characteristic variables of 3d drought events dry start time drought center drought affected area center movement trajectory and movement direction in this study we intended to explore various methods that can utilize dynamic drought maps including 3d drought attributes for example a conditional drought monitoring approach is helpful to determine whether a drought patch included in a dynamic drought map is new at this time or whether a drought patch that occurred in the past has continued to the present time the upper graphs in fig 7 are time series plots of the number of drought patches per month during the drought period in central asia as shown in fig 6 b the dynamic drought map contains information that can confirm the continuity and dynamics of past drought events for each patch that is except for the drought patch in which the temporal continuity of the drought event exists the remainder is classified as a newly appeared drought patch in the current month the bottom graphs of fig 7 show the drought monitoring information divided through the new conditional drought monitoring approach the orange bars represent the case of drought duration is one month classified as a drought patch newly generated every month on the other hand the green bars represent the case of drought duration is more than 2 months in which the drought events that have occurred in the past have continuity until the current month it was confirmed that when the number of drought patches rapidly increases 2002 02 03 2007 09 10 the proportion of drought patches newly generated in the current month increases significantly in contrast when the number of drought patches continues to increase steadily over a long period of time 2010 6 2011 1 the proportion of past drought patches increases significantly in addition the number of drought patches decreased sharply from february to july 2011 but it was confirmed that drought patches that occurred in the past persisted for a long time to verify the effectiveness of the conditional drought monitoring technique based on the dynamic drought map it is necessary to compare and review the actual recorded drought cases with the results obtained through drought monitoring fig 8 shows the results of dividing the data into two types of monthly drought patches identified in central asia from 1981 to 2018 where the y axis represents the number of monthly drought patches here type 1 is the number of new drought patches that occurred in the current month and type 2 is the number of drought patches that occurred from the time before the corresponding month and continued until the current month comparing the number of drought patches of the two types per month it was confirmed that there was a delay time between the time series of type 1 and type 2 when a newly created drought patch continued into the next month in addition depending on the characteristics of the occurrence of new drought patches up to a specific month it causes a change in the number of drought patches of type 2 for example after january 1983 when the type 1 drought patch rapidly increases with a steep slope most of it leads to type 2 except for the case of a flash drought of less than one month however when the type 1 drought patch steadily increases over a long period of time such as after june 1993 the type 2 drought patch has a large cumulative effect due to the type 1 drought patch in december 2007 the number of type 1 drought patches appeared to gradually decrease however at this time the number of type 2 drought patches continued to increase and then changed to a decreasing trend after 9 months accordingly when forecasting future droughts based on data built through dynamic drought monitoring it will be useful information to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of the droughts that have occurred in the past 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a dynamic drought monitoring method based on a 3d drought event selected by applying the dynamic drought monitoring technique algorithm in addition considering the climate typical temperate continental climate of central asia and various topographical characteristics mountainous terrain low lying basin desert and grassland the most suitable data for drought monitoring high resolution 5 km spei hr drought dataset was carefully selected and utilized in addition the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought events and the movement characteristics of dynamic drought trajectories were analyzed by a 3d concept utilizing the dddt algorithm for droughts in central asia the dynamic drought characteristics are explained through a 3d clustering method based on the dddt algorithm which were defined as 3d drought events which included various drought characteristic indicators drought durations severity effected area intensity location latitude and longitude distance and direction of the drought trajectory to quantify the spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics of drought events then we proposed a new conditional drought monitoring approach that can explain the developmental process and evolutionary characteristics of drought phenomena using a 3d concept in this study several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 in characterizing the evolution of spatial drought the dddt algorithm does not cluster according to the occurrence of drought 1 or 0 in other words the actual size of the drought depth for each grid is fully reflected and clustered it also follows the basic assumption that the drought magnitude of the adjacent grid around the grid with the maximum drought depth is mitigated it is based on the concept that the effects of a drought spread to neighboring regions centered on the maximum depth of drought this is a useful concept for consistency in determining one centroid per drought patch 2 in the past the evolution of spatiotemporal drought was characterized by focusing on the largest drought event however if the dddt algorithm is applied using a high resolution drought data set it is possible to identify all mild drought events that have been easily overlooked 3 during the period of 1981 2018 the drought trajectories in central asia tended to move horizontally to the east and west central asia droughts have very strong correlations among the duration depth area and travel distance indicators of trajectories this has the advantage of being clear in determining one criterion indicator among various indicators in determining the most severe drought event 4 the dynamic drought map including all 3d drought properties would be useful for conditional drought monitoring in other words when using the dynamic drought map even information that cannot be confirmed in a general drought map such as the temporal continuity and dynamic evolution characteristics of drought events can be intuitively identified in this study only one filtering condition two types of patch classification type 1 and type 2 was used to apply the conditional drought monitoring approach however there will be countless other drought information that can be obtained by using dynamic drought maps therefore in a follow up study we intend to develop various filtering contents necessary to increase the utilization of the new conditional drought monitoring approach proposed in this study this will help to discover the characteristics of spatiotemporal drought patterns in the central asia region furthermore it will be valuable as numerical data that can be used for short term and long term drought forecast studies funding this work

2022 presented a high resolution 5 km standardized precipitation evaporation index spei hr for central asia at various time scales from 1981 to 2018 using climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station s chirps precipitation and global land evaporation amsterdam model s gleam potential evaporation ep datasets the available observed meteorological data of the region is not continuous and very scarce for the entirety of central asia the spei hr dataset was developed to overcome the lack of data for monitoring the effects of drought in central asia in this study we utilized 6 month time scale of spei hr data covering the period from 1981 to 2018 for the characteristics analysis of 3d drought events 2 3 dynamic drought detection technique dddt algorithm in general to identify drought events in a 3d concept a continuous grid is divided into clusters 2d spatial clusters on a spatial scale and then defined as a 3d drought event by examining connectivity on a time scale rulinda et al 2013 in this study in screening 3d drought events the assumption that it occurs when adjacent grids are in a drought state in both temporal and spatial dimensions is still followed guo et al 2018 however the dddt algorithm proposed in this study is different from previous studies in the process of clustering the grid on the spatial scale and the method of determining the center of drought in this study the dynamic evolution of drought was analyzed using the dddt algorithm as follows step 1 spatial definition of a single drought event at the spatial scale a drought cluster is identified by continuous drought area cda analysis corzo perez et al 2011 lloyd hughes 2012 van huijgevoort et al 2013 herrera estrada et al 2017 diaz et al 2020 the cda analysis follows a connected component labeling approach for clustering drought cells haralick and shapiro 1992 by applying a two scan algorithm first each cell is numbered for a location the binary grid is then navigated to perform the first run which assigns temporary labels to connected adjacent components cells this label represents the connection between the eight closest neighbors and all cells a 3 3 cell section was used in this study with a total of nine cells in the grid and eight perimeters in the centroid cell more detail information on the cda analysis is provided in corzo perez et al 2011 however when clustering drought regions based on the cda only the presence of drought classified by a specific threshold is adapted without considering the grid based severity of drought that is clustering droughts on a spatial scale based on grid specific binary 0 and 1 values we assume the grid by grid drought intensity is uniform therefore in this study a new concept of clustering spatial drought areas was proposed by considering the difference of drought severities by grid this means that the spatial drought extent is centered on the grid with the greatest severity at a specific time and the drought intensity is propagated to the adjacent grid therefore the grid can be clustered by considering the size of the drought severity of the original grid rather than the binary value 0 1 step 2 centroid identification for spatial drought in previous studies researchers identified a major drought cluster e g the cluster with the largest drought area at a specific time and defined the centroid p of the cluster as the centroid at each time step corzo perez et al 2011 lloyd hughes 2012 that is at each time step only one center of the drought cluster is determined however when determining the center of drought according to this method the case with a large drought severity in a cluster with a small area may be overlooked in addition mild droughts that occur over large areas may be overestimated leading to the selection of drought centers diaz et al 2020 therefore in this study we did not intend to decide on one clustering on the spatial scale every time the overlapping area ratio of spatially adjacent clusters was reviewed using eq 4 for all the 2d drought clusters classified in step 1 as a target when the overlapping area ratio was 75 or more they were reclassified into one cluster and the centroid s equation is detailed in wang et al 2019 for example as shown in eq 4 a1 and a2 were merged by the threshold i e spatial overlap ratio into one cluster where the overlap ratio of areas between single drought events a1 and a2 was 75 or more the cell with the lowest spei was selected as the centroid of drought in each cluster 4 spatial overlap ratio area a 1 a 2 area a 1 a 2 100 step 3 centroid linkage of temporally consecutive clusters a rule that separates or joins time sequences is required to link the centroids of a continuous cluster over time in this study the redundancy rate of the drought clusters over time was considered as the threshold i e temporal overlap ratio the two clusters were defined as having temporal continuity when the ratio of the overlapping area to the area of a relatively large community between the area of the community at time t at and at time t 1 at 1 was 50 or more as shown in eq 5 the rules for connecting the centroids of the clusters are shown in fig 2 5 temporal overlap ratio a overlap t t 1 max a t a t 1 100 2 4 spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts the spatiotemporal characteristics of a drought can be explained using indicators such as drought duration severity affected area intensity location of drought centroid latitude and longitude and the distance and direction of the drought trajectory 1 drought duration is determined by the period between the beginning and the end of the drought in space and time meaning the time at which the drought centroids are connected 2 drought severity is the sum of the cumulative severities of the affected grid during the drought duration the drought threshold spei 1 0 was used to determine a 3d drought event as in table 1 3 drought area is defined as the number of the affected grids during the drought duration the area per grid is 25 km2 in this study 4 drought intensity is the severity divided by the duration of drought 5 drought centroid is the cluster s centroid at the spatial scale it is calculated by weighted average considering the drought severity for each grid 6 distance of the drought trajectory is calculated as the sum of distance between centroids for a 3d drought event 7 direction of the drought trajectory is determined based on the location where the 3d drought event started latitude longitude and the location where it ended latitude longitude table 2 describes how to distinguish the direction of drought trajectory fig 3 presents the schematic diagram for identifying the migration direction of a drought where the angle Œ∏ is in the range of 0 360 the direction of the migration path is interpreted as follows the positive eastern direction from the origin of the coordinate system with respect to the first drought centroid initial centroid is represented on the horizontal axis furthermore Œ∏ between the horizontal axis and the line connecting the origin and the centroid of the last drought the last centroid represents a value for determining the migration direction as shown in table 2 the centroid of a particular cluster is located in one of 16 proposed positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 3d drought event analysis based on the dddt algorithm the dddt algorithm was applied to define spatiotemporal drought events in central asia these droughts are considered as a continuum in three dimensions longitude latitude time i e drought patches clustered in the 2d space must be continuously connected in the temporal dimension to be grouped into one final cluster 3d drought event table 3 and fig 4 show the results of extracting 3d drought events in central asia by applying this method during the period of 1981 2018 according to the estimated spei6 hr a total of 32 274 drought events lasting more than two months occurred in this study the characteristics of the occurrence of drought in central asia were summarized using six indices that characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of drought phenomena the distributions of the values for each indicator are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a e show box plots of each indicator for the 3d drought events showing the characteristics of the movement direction of the drought trajectory based on the location information of the center it was found that most of the trajectories of droughts occurring in central asia moved in the lateral direction east and west ene e ese wnw w wsw pearson correlation analysis was performed to analyze the statistical characteristics of spatiotemporal evolution using the 3d drought event characteristic indicator the pearson correlation coefficients between drought duration dd drought severity ds drought area da drought intensity di trajectory travel distance td and drought trajectory travel direction ddt are shown in fig 5 it was confirmed that the drought duration severity area and trajectory movement distance indicators had a high correlation 0 7 0 9 with each other on the other hand for drought intensity the correlations between drought duration r 0 31 and travel distance r 0 56 were low however the direction of movement of the drought trajectory had no correlation with the drought duration severity area intensity or distance traveled table 4 presents the top 20 most severe drought events in central asia from 1981 to 2018 the most severe drought event was based on the drought severity sum of speis values below 1 affected by the grid during the drought duration that had the highest correlation with other indicators among the six drought indicators reviewed above table 4 shows the characteristics beginning b time end e time duration severity area intensity movement distance and trajectory direction of the most severe drought events top 20 in central asia the most severe drought occurred in kyrgyzstan which started in october 2007 and continued for 11 months this drought showed a lateral movement trajectory to the west Œ∏ 180 71 and the affected area during the duration of the drought was 230 900 km¬≤ which is larger than the area of kyrgyzstan 199 900 km¬≤ the second most severe drought occurred in uzbekistan beginning in august 1985 the drought continued for 12 months this drought showed a movement trajectory in the north northeast Œ∏ 61 25 direction and the affected area during the drought was 220 850 km¬≤ based on the drought occurrence times indicated by the bolds in table 4 the drought events that occurred within the period of 2007 2008 accounted for 35 7 out of 20 of the total number of droughts in fact during 2007 2008 there were severe droughts in turkmenistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan food and agriculture organization fao 2017 accordingly it is effective to use the 3d drought event identification technique based on the dddt algorithm in characterizing and understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of drought phenomena 3 2 a new drought monitoring approach using conditional filtering the dddt algorithm proposed in this study has an advantage in explaining the developmental process and evolutionary characteristics of drought phenomena this method determines 3d drought events to quantify the continuous and dynamic evolutionary developmental characteristics of drought events in the 3d space in particular this method can identify all drought events in the long term drought time series in previous studies when a drought event was identified using the 3d clustering method the occurrence of drought in the grid was distinguished according to the binary number system in determining the spatial drought patch which is a 2d concept xu et al 2015 guo et al 2018 on the other hand the dddt algorithm proposed in this study clusters the spatial drought patch by considering that the grid with a large drought depth becomes the center and transfers spreads to adjacent grids in determining the occurrence of drought in the grid accordingly it is possible to quantify the dynamic development characteristics of drought events by sufficiently considering the scale of drought depth for each grid a drought event identified in this way can be shown in fig 6 as a dynamic drought map that includes all the drought attributes in the 3d aspect fig 6 a is a diagram comparing a typical drought map with a dynamic drought map the typical drought map on the left panel shows the drought index values for a specific month using spei6 hr data in contrast the dynamic drought map on the right panel contains drought characteristics for drought events identified through the dddt algorithm therefore in the dynamic drought map clustered drought patches are characteristic in consideration of the continuity and dynamics of drought events fig 6 b shows a conceptual diagram of the characteristic variables of 3d drought events dry start time drought center drought affected area center movement trajectory and movement direction in this study we intended to explore various methods that can utilize dynamic drought maps including 3d drought attributes for example a conditional drought monitoring approach is helpful to determine whether a drought patch included in a dynamic drought map is new at this time or whether a drought patch that occurred in the past has continued to the present time the upper graphs in fig 7 are time series plots of the number of drought patches per month during the drought period in central asia as shown in fig 6 b the dynamic drought map contains information that can confirm the continuity and dynamics of past drought events for each patch that is except for the drought patch in which the temporal continuity of the drought event exists the remainder is classified as a newly appeared drought patch in the current month the bottom graphs of fig 7 show the drought monitoring information divided through the new conditional drought monitoring approach the orange bars represent the case of drought duration is one month classified as a drought patch newly generated every month on the other hand the green bars represent the case of drought duration is more than 2 months in which the drought events that have occurred in the past have continuity until the current month it was confirmed that when the number of drought patches rapidly increases 2002 02 03 2007 09 10 the proportion of drought patches newly generated in the current month increases significantly in contrast when the number of drought patches continues to increase steadily over a long period of time 2010 6 2011 1 the proportion of past drought patches increases significantly in addition the number of drought patches decreased sharply from february to july 2011 but it was confirmed that drought patches that occurred in the past persisted for a long time to verify the effectiveness of the conditional drought monitoring technique based on the dynamic drought map it is necessary to compare and review the actual recorded drought cases with the results obtained through drought monitoring fig 8 shows the results of dividing the data into two types of monthly drought patches identified in central asia from 1981 to 2018 where the y axis represents the number of monthly drought patches here type 1 is the number of new drought patches that occurred in the current month and type 2 is the number of drought patches that occurred from the time before the corresponding month and continued until the current month comparing the number of drought patches of the two types per month it was confirmed that there was a delay time between the time series of type 1 and type 2 when a newly created drought patch continued into the next month in addition depending on the characteristics of the occurrence of new drought patches up to a specific month it causes a change in the number of drought patches of type 2 for example after january 1983 when the type 1 drought patch rapidly increases with a steep slope most of it leads to type 2 except for the case of a flash drought of less than one month however when the type 1 drought patch steadily increases over a long period of time such as after june 1993 the type 2 drought patch has a large cumulative effect due to the type 1 drought patch in december 2007 the number of type 1 drought patches appeared to gradually decrease however at this time the number of type 2 drought patches continued to increase and then changed to a decreasing trend after 9 months accordingly when forecasting future droughts based on data built through dynamic drought monitoring it will be useful information to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of the droughts that have occurred in the past 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a dynamic drought monitoring method based on a 3d drought event selected by applying the dynamic drought monitoring technique algorithm in addition considering the climate typical temperate continental climate of central asia and various topographical characteristics mountainous terrain low lying basin desert and grassland the most suitable data for drought monitoring high resolution 5 km spei hr drought dataset was carefully selected and utilized in addition the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought events and the movement characteristics of dynamic drought trajectories were analyzed by a 3d concept utilizing the dddt algorithm for droughts in central asia the dynamic drought characteristics are explained through a 3d clustering method based on the dddt algorithm which were defined as 3d drought events which included various drought characteristic indicators drought durations severity effected area intensity location latitude and longitude distance and direction of the drought trajectory to quantify the spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics of drought events then we proposed a new conditional drought monitoring approach that can explain the developmental process and evolutionary characteristics of drought phenomena using a 3d concept in this study several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 in characterizing the evolution of spatial drought the dddt algorithm does not cluster according to the occurrence of drought 1 or 0 in other words the actual size of the drought depth for each grid is fully reflected and clustered it also follows the basic assumption that the drought magnitude of the adjacent grid around the grid with the maximum drought depth is mitigated it is based on the concept that the effects of a drought spread to neighboring regions centered on the maximum depth of drought this is a useful concept for consistency in determining one centroid per drought patch 2 in the past the evolution of spatiotemporal drought was characterized by focusing on the largest drought event however if the dddt algorithm is applied using a high resolution drought data set it is possible to identify all mild drought events that have been easily overlooked 3 during the period of 1981 2018 the drought trajectories in central asia tended to move horizontally to the east and west central asia droughts have very strong correlations among the duration depth area and travel distance indicators of trajectories this has the advantage of being clear in determining one criterion indicator among various indicators in determining the most severe drought event 4 the dynamic drought map including all 3d drought properties would be useful for conditional drought monitoring in other words when using the dynamic drought map even information that cannot be confirmed in a general drought map such as the temporal continuity and dynamic evolution characteristics of drought events can be intuitively identified in this study only one filtering condition two types of patch classification type 1 and type 2 was used to apply the conditional drought monitoring approach however there will be countless other drought information that can be obtained by using dynamic drought maps therefore in a follow up study we intend to develop various filtering contents necessary to increase the utilization of the new conditional drought monitoring approach proposed in this study this will help to discover the characteristics of spatiotemporal drought patterns in the central asia region furthermore it will be valuable as numerical data that can be used for short term and long term drought forecast studies funding this work

7849,study region this study was conducted in dodola town ethiopia study focus this study aims to examine the impacts of landuse and climate changes on peak runoff and flooding volumes and also evaluates the effectiveness of low impact development using swmm 5 1 three decades of landuse landcover were analyzed to assess the performance of the existing drainage system furthermore the effect of climate change on drainage system performance was assessed using the estimated design storms from two global climate models canesm2 and hadgem2 es new hydrological insights for region the trend of landuse landcover analysis shows that the town has experienced a significant increase in the impervious surface area ranging from 59 73 to 86 01 in response to urbanization the trend of peak stormwater showed a continuously increasing trend the field observations confirm that the landuse change has had a significant impact on the performance of stormwater drainage systems the study also found that the peak runoff and flooding volume of the study area was increased under separate and combined effects of rainfall intensity variation due to climate change and increased impervious surface area this finding indicates that existing drainage systems flooded due to discharge exceeding the design capacity and that profit is required when considering the effects of both land use and climate change scenarios three environmentally friendly low impact development approaches bio retention permeable pavement and a combination of the two are applied to reduce increased peak stormwater and mitigate flooding problems keywords urbanization climate change peak stormwater urban flooding lid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flooding is one of the most worldwide challenges that threaten the population infrastructure properties loss of life and the environment hlodversdottir et al 2015 thieken et al 2016 nile et al 2018 in recent years high magnitude urban flooding caused due to surface runoff increased as a result of landuse change moreover extreme rainfall events due to the effect of climate change have increased the urban flooding severity and risks in worldwide towns cities kundzewicz et al 2014 nile et al 2019 in addition the problem related to flooding in the urban area occurs when stormwater drainage systems are inadequate for peak flow in the process of urbanization the natural surface area is transferred into an impervious cover that alters natural hydrological processes hu et al 2020 it is evident by the rapid expansion of the urbanization process in the city and increasingly intense rainstorms have caused the risks of urban flooding as evidenced many studies e g guan et al 2016 neupane 2018 have assessed landuse and climate change impacts on the stormwater drainage systems separately halsn√¶s and kaspersen 2018 investigated the effect of climate change on urban drainage systems in the city of odense denmark by using one single climate simulation chain under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios however zhou et al 2019 investigated the effect of climate change on flooding in a major city in northern china using an ensemble of low resolution bias adjusted global climate models gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 moreover padulano et al 2021 evaluated the flood hazard caused by variability in 19 climate projection models under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the city of naples italy in addition to this most finding shows that changes in landuse affect the hydrological processes which mean alterations in flooding volume and peak flow du et al 2012 hu et al 2020 as a result urban areas are expected to become even more exposed and vulnerable to flooding in the future moreover in the coming years extreme floods are expected to be more frequent and devastating due to the effects of climate change and the expansion of urbanization that increases the generation of urban catchment runoff huong and pathirana 2013 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 an urban stormwater simulation model applied to a large catchment of dublin ireland showed that landuse change from 2013 to 2026 could cause monthly runoff to increase by 30 in winter and annual runoff to increase by up to 15 willuweit et al 2016 however there are limited studies that assessed the combined effects of climate change and landuse on the urban catchment stormwater also they described how stormwater drainage systems behave under varying rainfall and urbanization conditions wu et al 2013 abdul aziz and al amin 2016 saraswat et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 the unpredictable rainfall intensity in the city with urbanization and the lack of sufficient drainage systems are among the main reasons for the floods increase hassan et al 2021 moreover the modeled drainage system in the town city not considered both effects of climate and landuse change willuweit and o sullivan 2013 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 razaq et al 2019 panos et al 2021 in addition recent studies were conducted to assess the effects of riparian vegetation on real water flow in open channels and to quantify flow turbulence in channels using various experimental approaches khan et al 2022 lama et al 2022 to alleviate flooding various low impact development lid practices e g rainfall garden green bio retention vegetative roofs and pervious pavement are implemented at both local and watershed scales worldwide each with its own set of functions and stormwater management techniques lee et al 2012 line et al 2012 guan et al 2015 kong et al 2017 mangrove trees are another environmentally friendly water engineering solution that has an impact on the unidirectional flow characteristics of structures kazemi et al 2018 many studies evaluated the effectiveness of lid in flood hazard mitigation in urban areas based on its simplicity cost effectiveness eco friendly solutions and sustainability zahmatkesh et al 2015 akhter and hewa 2016 lama et al 2021 lama 2016 also conducted an experimental study on the flow dynamics and turbulence patterns in a drainage channel under various scenarios they concluded that common reeds flow vegetation interactions have impacted the hydraulic efficiency of a drainage channel by changing the flow resistance velocity distribution and turbulence in a channel huong and pathirana 2013 akhter and hewa 2016 ahiablame and shakya 2016 reported a 12 75 42 reduction in runoff as a response to land use change however pyke et al 2011 and zahmatkesh et al 2015 found that mitigation measures reduced 27 2 and 34 5 of the increased runoff volume due to the climate change scenario respectively lids also have the potential to significantly reduce urban flood risks as a result of the combined effects of land use and climate change neupane 2018 neupane et al 2021 the problems caused by high magnitude flooding volume mostly happened in ethiopian cities towns many times even recently urban flooding problems have occurred in diredawa and addis abeba as a result of dynamic landuse change and insufficient drainage system provision affecting properties and infrastructures and causing traffic congestion birhanu et al 2016 haile and worku 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 similarly flooding problems during the rainy season are a regular observable fact in dodola the existing stormwater drainage system is inadequate because it was built without adequate hydrological hydraulic analysis as well as without taking landuse and climate change scenarios into account the systems were insufficient to accommodate the increased peak stormwater caused by both effects rapid urbanisation and climate change many areas in dodola town were inundated especially in the low lying sub area furthermore flooding disrupted the community s daily activities as well as the homes of several residents therefore this study was investigated to model stormwater management based on landuse and climate change using swmm 5 1 the first aim of this study is to provide hydrological information that is not available for dodola town by predicting the rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves second this study aims to evaluate the performance of the existing drainage system under climate and landuse change third to evaluate the effectiveness of the three lids types to minimize the increased flooding as the response to landuse and climate change after achieving the above objectives this study is expected to provide a technical solution for experts engineering and decision makers to identify flood problems and evaluate proposed solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area dodola town fig 1 is located at the latitude of 6010 27 70 n to 7001 01 64 n and

the catchment s highest and lowest elevations are 2529 and 2413 m above sea level respectively and are located near the mara mountain and the kora river 74 33 of the area is characterized by a gentle slope the middle and lower part of the catchment is characterized by a slopping slope 8 6 plain slope 15 55 moderate slope 1 48 and extremely steep slope 0 04 the soil distribution of the study area is predominantly mollic glysols and pellic vertisols which cover 9 52 and 90 48 respectively according to the fao soil map the mean annual rainfall is 619 1731 9 mm the mean lowest and highest monthly rainfalls are 38 11 mm in january and 156 mm in july respectively the average daily minimum is 6 c and the mean daily maximum temperature is 25 9 c 2 2 data sets in this study both spatial and temporal data sets were used a 12 5mx 12 5 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was acquired from the alaska satellite facility https asf alaska edu to analyze the average slope of each sub catchment low cloud cover satellite datasets were downloaded from https earthexplorer usgv gov these datasets which are landsat images for 2010 and 2020 were used to develop landuse maps to identify the impacts of landuse changes the pixel size of the satellite images is 30 30 m a soil map was taken from the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia mwioe the town master plan which was obtained from the municipal city office contains road layouts and information related to various public infrastructures the 30 years 1989 2019 daily observed rainfall data was collected from the ethiopian national metrological agency the global climate models such as ec earth mpi es lr canesm2 hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 were obtained from the cordex africa database via earth system grid federation esgf kamworapan and surussavadee 2019 aznarez et al 2021 these models have spatial grid resolutions of 0 44 longitude and 0 44 latitude hewitson et al 2012 in this study outputs from five gcms were dynamically downscaled using the regional climate models rcms racmo22t remo2009 rca4 racmo22t and rca4 respectively the data for the model s calibration and validation were measured near the outfall of the system the drainage network data was obtained via field survey the typical values for manning s roughness coefficient for the conduits were extracted from the literature akdoƒüan and g√ºven 2016 2 3 methodology as fig 2 shows the workflow of the study is structured in four main categories namely 1 land use land cover change 2 the climate change analysis 3 the simulation of sub catchment stormwater considering different scenarios and 4 the effectiveness of the low impact development practices the first category assesses the percentage increase of impervious surface area due to the landuse change the second category develops the updated rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves to account for the effect of climate change the downscaled and bias corrected rainfall data was converted into different return period design storms to derive swmm 5 1 model the main outcomes of climate change and landuse land cover category are the main input of the third category which relies on the simulation of urban stormwater and investigates the potential effects of the climate and landuse change on the peak stormwater and efficiency of the drainage system the fourth category evaluates the effectiveness of three types of lid practices applied for the mitigation of urban inundation 2 3 1 study area delineation and sub division for the catchment delineation the arc hydro terrain processing tool which requires dem of the study area as the input vector was used using 12 5 m dem the terrain analysis was performed to generate flow direction longest flow path the path within a catchment through which water travels from the farthest point to the outlet sub catchment outlet and area moreover the actual flow path and flow processes in urban regions are not only influenced by the topography condition other factors such as road layout and built up settlements influence flow direction these factors were considered when the catchment was divided into homogeneous sub catchments shen and zhang 2014 as a result the divided sub catchment based on terrain analysis was further subdivided and adjusted based on the town s landuse types kong et al 2017 a field investigation was also done to confirm the stormwater drainage patterns developed using arcgis as indicated in fig 3 the total area of dodola town was divided into 36 sub catchments 292 junctions and 291 conduits 2 3 2 swmm 5 1 development the stormwater management model version 5 1 a processed based hydrologic hydraulic model developed by us environmental protection agency epa was chosen to evaluate the impacts of different land development conditions and climate change on the peak runoff as well as the effectiveness of proposed aggregate lids to mitigate urban flooding this model was selected because 1 it accounts for spatial variability of sub catchment properties 2 each sub catchment receives inflows from rainfall and generates runoff based on the assigned sub catchment parameters e g area flow width percentage of imperviousness imperv average slope etc 3 it accounts dynamic rainfall runoff from single or continuous peak runoff quantity in urban areas 4 it quantifies the sub catchment peak runoff at different climate and landuse change and identify the location of flooding nodes in the drainage networks the model required many input parameters to quantify the peak runoff and identify flooding location including sub catchment characteristics physical characteristics of drainage e g diameter length slope and material design storms and soil properties of the study area zhou et al 2018 these inputted parameters were estimated through a combination of spatial analysis in arcgis 10 3 literature sources field surveys and model defaults the physical characteristics of each sub catchment including areas slope and flow path length were generated accordingly based on 12 5 mx 12 5 m resolution dem data using the arc hydro extension in arc map 10 3 esri the width of the overland flow path which an important in the model and is very sensitive in stormwater runoff simulations was calculated as suggested by bisht et al 2016 1 w a l where w is the width of the sub catchment a is an area of sub catchment and l is the longest overflow path the sub catchment slope was considered to be equal to the slope of the flow path and was estimated as the difference in elevation divided by the length of the flow path on the map in reality the sub catchment slope and imperviousness vary within the sub catchment therefore according to the suggestion of niyonkuru et al 2018a 2018b the weighted average slope of each sub catchment was calculated the percentage of imperviousness of each sub catchment was determined by the landuse type the swmm 5 1 model is based on defining the impervious fraction of individual land uses within the sub catchment and then weighting these impervious fractions by the proportion of the sub catchment that is covered by individual land use based on this eq 2 was applied for computing imp values 2 im p e r v a 1 i 1 a 2 i 2 a n i n a 1 a 2 a n where imperv is the weighted percentage imperviousness of the sub catchment in is the value of imperviousness of each type of surface cover and ai is the area of each type of surface values for other sub catchment parameters such as surface roughness described by manning coefficient n value surface depression storage depths d store and the green ampt infiltration rates for pervious areas were based on the ranges given by reference giron√°s et al 2010 the study area soil parameters such as the initial moisture deficit hydraulic conductivity and the suction head of the soil were estimated based on the soil types mollic gleysols and pellic vertisols extracted for the study area parnas et al 2021 for hydraulic modeling the inputted properties required for junctions and outfalls spatial location invert elevation and maximum depth and key parameters of conduit spatial position were collected via field survey the properties of the stormwater drainage network were converted into shapefile fig 3 using arcgis 10 3 and then imported into swmm 5 1 2 3 3 landuse landcover change the most important factor influencing the amount of urban stormwater is landuse change the process of landuse change can not only cause significant changes in runoff patterns in terms of both peak flow volumes and time of runoff response but also vulnerabilities to flooding risks the processing of satellite images such as geo referencing mosaicking layer stacking and supervised classification was carried out in erdas imagine 2015 software the classified landuse images were then generalized and reclassified into government administration residency open space green area playgrounds and cemetery for the 2020 landuse map the above landuse types were used for consistency in analysis the results of the past ten years landuse can be used to make predictions ten years later namely the prediction data for 2030 to predict the future landuse the previous researchers used different techniques from there the markov chain analysis and ca analysis are widely adopted to quantify the future period landuse using the known landuse datasets of different periods weng 2002 sun et al 2007 regmi et al 2014 to effectively do this the markov chain model is a useful technique to quantify the future period landuse change in dodola town the markov process predicts the future state of a system based on the preceding state by developing a transition probability matrix of lu lc change starting from the time one to time two furthermore this technique is widely used to predict future landuse by 2030 a transition probability matrix for landuse change was developed using the markov chain transition estimator from time one to two the calculation of land use prediction is followed by 3 s t t 1 pij x s t where s t is the system status at the time of t s t 1 is the system status at the time of t 1 pij is the transition probability matrix in a state which is calculated as follows 4 p p ij p11 p12 p1n p21 p22 p2n p31 p32 p3n where p is the transition probability pij represents the probability of converting from the current state i to another state j in next time pn is the state s probability for any time guan et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 the transition probability matrix was calculated for the periods 2010 and 2020 to predict the probability of land use pattern by 2030 this matrix was produced by the cross tabulation of two periods with land use images the landuse area in calculated for the years 2010 2020 and 2030 is listed in table 1 and fig 4 2 3 4 climate change model the assessment of climate change effects on the drainage system efficient needs an evaluation of the accuracy of a climate model yazdanfar and sharma 2015 numerous endeavors have been made to examine the performance of climate models in simulating various climate variables e g precipitation gu et al 2014 sun et al 2021 as stated by smith et al 1998 in this study the gcms were selected considering four criteria 1 the availability of projected data for the catchment 2 spatial resolution fine resolution gcms are preferred 3 validity performance of gcms using statistical measures and 4 representativeness an ensemble of gcms covering a wide range of projections of rainfall is considered based on the above criteria the downscaled rainfall data of five global climate models ccml hadgem2 es canesm2 ec earth and miroc5 were evaluated chen et al 2012 mendlik and gobiet 2016 statistical measures such as percentage of bias root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of variation cv were used to evaluate the performance of climate models thus in terms of cv and rmse hadgem2 es performs better results than others canesm cm5 performs better than others in terms of bias and cv therefore based on the statistical evaluation the future projected rainfall data of both hadgem2 es and canesm2 were obtained i downscaling and bias correction the baseline 1988 2005 and future projected rainfall data 2006 2100 of the study area were downscaled from the gcms according to padulano et al 2021 the impact of future climate conditions on urban flooding can be simulated using climate models however due to several systematic climate model errors and spatial averaging within grid cells simulations of precipitation often show biases that restrict the use of produced climate model data as direct input for hydrological models therefore the bias of climate model data should corrected before it can be used for the input of the model fang et al 2015 alamdari 2018 climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd is a tool used to extract and bias correct data obtained from global climate models berhanu 2018 saade et al 2021 in scientific literature bias correction methods vary from simple linear to complex quantile distribution functions fang et al 2015 stated that different bias correction methods for precipitation such as linear scaling local intensity scaling power transformation distribution mapping of precipitation using gamma distribution and quantile mapping precipitation methods for rainfall the power transformation and quantile mapping method perform best in terms of frequency indices as suggested by the previous study conducted in the ethiopian watershed wagesho et al 2013 worku 2019 tadese 2020 moreover from the listed methods the power transformation method was selected in cmhydr to correct bias because this method considered day to day variability precipitation and it needs information on monthly observed statistics such as mean and coefficient of variation cv which others didn t smitha et al 2018 ghimire et al 2019 leander and buishand 2007 5 p ap b where p is the corrected rainfall and p is the uncorrected rainfall data parameters a and b were found for every month of the year including available data for all years the determination of the b parameter was done iteratively using a solver in excel in contrast b depends only on the cv of the data and its determination were independent of the value of a the parameter a was determined when the mean of the transformed daily values agreed with the observed mean leander and buishand 2007 ii design storm rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves for current and future climate conditions were developed and were used to estimate the design storm of different return periods maimone et al 2019 once the annual maximum daily precipitation data were extracted the rainfall depths of hourly sub hourly 0 5 1 2 3 6 and 12 were disaggregated from daily time resolution rainfall using the reduction formula suggested by the indian meteorological department chowdhury et al 2007 nwaogazie et al 2021 which is 6 p t p 24 x t 24 1 3 where pt mm is the rainfall depth for the duration of t hour p24 maximum annual daily rainfall mm and t the time duration in hours for the required rainfall depth in hours the t year rainfall depth and rainfall intensity for the baseline and future period were computed using the best fitted probability distribution method maimone et al 2019 to select the best fitted probability distribution method eleven different methods such as two parameter distributions normal lognormal and gumbel maximum three parameter distributions log pearson iii generalized extreme value glo gpa and web and five parameter distributions wakeby distribution was compared nguyen et al 2017 alam et al 2018 gado et al 2021 the l moment ratio diagram and statistical goodness of tests such as kolmogorov smirnov ks anderson darling ad and chi square x2 have been adopted to select the probability distribution method ahmad et al 2016 gado and nguyen 2016 mamoon and rahman 2017 the value of l skewness œÑ 3 and l kurtosis œÑ 4 from the l moment ratio diagram and goodness of fits confirm generalized extreme value gev is the best fitted for the study area to estimate rainfall depth at different return periods as shown in eq 7 a alam et al 2018 ghosh et al 2016 7 x t u Œ± k 1 Œ≥ 1 k k t Œ± k 2 Œ≥ 1 2 k Œ≥ 2 1 k where u a k and t are the parameters of gev kt is a frequency factor depends on the return period eq 8 8 k t k Œ≥ 1 k log 1 1 t k k Œ≥ 1 2 k Œ≥ 2 1 k 1 2 hence for different return periods the rainfall intensity it was calculated by dividing the estimated rainfall depth by the corresponding storm duration the inputted design storms for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years return periods were estimated in the chicago design storm format as recommended in the literature krvavica and rubiniƒá 2020 berggren et al 2014 the rainfall durations of 15 30 60 120 and 180 of different return periods were chosen as examples in this study laouacheria et al 2019 similarly the design storms of 3 hrs for both canesm2 and hadgem2 es climate models under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were estimated and inputted separately in the model to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the hydrological processes aznarez et al 2021 2 3 5 identification of the impacts of climate and landuse changes on the stormwater drainage systems it was the objective of this work to investigate the effects of separate and combined urbanization and climate changes on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in managing urban flooding due to the storm water s peak it is very important to know flood locations and identify flood problems the results of the swmm 5 1 simulation were used to try to identify the stormwater flooding caused in the junctions as suggested by hassan et al 2017 no flooding very light flooding medium flooding high flooding and very high flooding with junction flooding ranges of 0 0 001 m3 s 0 001 0 01 m3 s 0 01 0 02 m3 s 0 02 0 04 m3 s and greater 0 04 m3 s in this study the junctions of the system were classified according to the above stage and also the junctions that mostly flooded were identified with their flooding magnitude in each scenario 2 3 6 evaluation of low impact development lid effectiveness in reducing peak stormwater in this study two scenarios were considered to observe the difference in the stormwater runoff i e with and without the implementation of the low impact development lids practices in scenario 1 the stormwater of the study area was simulated without the implementation of lids in scenario 2 three types of lids were implemented to reduce the increased stormwater runoff caused by urbanization climate change and both effects of landuse and climate change the swmm 5 1 has been successfully applied to evaluate the potential benefits of implementing lid zhu and chen 2017 omidi et al 2021 the model includes seven different types of lids approach practices that can be used to reduce peak runoff bio retention cell green roof infiltration trench permeable pavement rain barrel rain garden and vegetative swales zanandrea and luiz 2018 the effectiveness of three types of lids was evaluated bio retention permeable pavers and a combination of the two first the swmm 5 1 simulated sub catchment peak runoff total volume of flooding and many flooded junctions without implemented lids practices for landuse climate change and both combined scenarios then the swmm simulated again without changing the inputted parameters in the model the percentage reduction in peak flow flooding volume and number of flooded junctions was calculated using the model under scenarios 1 and 2 as rossmann and huber 2016 suggested the input parameters of lid practices in swmm 5 1 were defined by taking into account the characteristics of local soil types sandy clay and sandy loam 2 3 7 model calibration and validation the swmm 5 1 model was required since a large set of parameters was estimated from various data sources and these parameters affect the model output with different weights resulting in different uncertainty gao et al 2020 to solve this the sensitivity of parameters was investigated to identify which inputted parameters would be most effective in minimizing differences between the simulated and observed results niyonkuru et al 2018a 2018b behrouz et al 2020 there are different sensitivity analysis techniques are available in the literature differentiated into global methods and local methods saltelli et al 2008 in this paper a local sensitivity analysis technique by brun et al 2001 was used to model calibration and validation because it evaluates the model response to the variation of input parameters which are changed one at a time del giudice padulano 2016 moreover the local method is preferred to select in this study due to solving identification problems in rainfall runoff models mancipe munoz et al 2014 and due to the required computational effort is minimal if compared to global techniques also it can be easily integrated into modeling software to provide a preliminary identification analysis dotto et al 2010 the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool in pcswmm was used to calibrate and validate the swmm 5 1 for the study area niazi et al 2017 the sensitivity based genetic algorithm ga calibration method which consists of four components sensitivity analysis calibration determining the limit or range of the calibration parameters and performance evaluation of the calibrated model was used in the pcswmm this ga allows the user to select the initial values for control parameters along with a specified level of uncertainties between observed and simulated channel runoff depth basnayaka 2012 perin et al 2020 then pcswmm updates the independent variables model parameters and returns the updated input parameters to swmm 5 1 this process was repeated until the maximum iteration was reached the flow depth calibrations taken into consideration in this study were the surface roughness of the impervious n imperv and pervious n perv sub catchment surfaces and the depths of surface depressions on impervious dstore imperv and pervious dstore perv areas percentage of impervious area overland flow width slope and soil parameters all the other insensitive parameters were left unchanged from their initial values while the sensitive parameters were adjusted frequently until the simulated results closely matched the measured values three goodness of fit statistics the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d eqs 9 11 were used to evaluate model performance during calibration and validation as suggested by basnayaka 2012 niyonkuru et al 2018a 2018b 9 r 2 i 1 n s i m i s i m i o b s i o b s i 2 i 1 n s i m i s i m i 2 i 1 n o b s i o b s i 2 10 n s e 1 i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 i 1 n o b s i o b s i 2 11 d 1 i 1 n o b s

values respectively and n is the total number of observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis results for sensitivity analysis at the first stage the model was run using the initial parameter of the model in the pcswmm the parameters were systematically adjusted until differences between the two results were minimized means until the simulated results closely matched the measured runoff depth from the graphical comparison the parameters are then classified according to their importance ranking as given in table 2 there are eleven parameters of the swmm 5 1 model that were subject to the sensitivity analysis the outcome of the sensitivity analysis reveals that imperv average overland slope manning s roughness coefficient of overland surface flow depth of depression storage sub catchment width and infiltration parameters were the most important parameters that influence the runoff depth according to the results imperv slope and sub catchment width are more sensitive than others and positively correlated with the results of the model in the study area however the roughness coefficient of pervious surface area and green ampt infiltration parameters are the least significant parameters inversely affecting the output of swmm 5 1 3 2 calibration and validation of model parameters for study catchment calibration was performed for selected rainfall events by varying the values of the inputted parameters in the model from their initial values as shown in table 2 this was done to evaluate the changes in the simulated results after varying the initial value of each parameter while considering the same rainfall events the simulated and observed runoff depth were graphically compared fig 5 it can be seen that there is variation after the initial value of inputted parameters was adjusted in the model the most sensitive parameters imperv slope and sub catchment width have the greatest impact on the model result the adjusted values of dstore imp and n perv inputted parameters are very close to the initial value at the end of calibration however the calibrated parameter values of initial deficit and suction head are roughly close to a maximum value of parameters in this study the parameters of the model are calibrated by two storm events on 10 july and 1 august 2020 the model validation is done to test the performance of the calibrated model parameters on independent storm events which were not used in the calibration the storm events on 5 august 2020 are selected for validation the simulated runoff depth of the validation event is shown in fig 6 together with the observed results the results of the goodness of fit tests for the calibration and validation model are indicated in table 3 the results show that the r2 nse and d are within the acceptable range of events for the swmm 5 1 model niazi et al 2017 although the value of nse is 0 63 and 0 74 for calibration and validation respectively values between 0 and 1 are acceptable so in this study the calibration and validation of swmm 5 1 are acceptable r2 and d criteria also imply for indicate that the prediction errors are well balanced it can be concluded that the model achieved acceptance accuracy for simulation in the dodola town based on the goodness of fit indices 3 3 effects of landuse landcover change on peak stormwater the simulated results of the hydrological response during landuse landcover change revealed an increase in peak runoff over three decades as presented in table 4 the trend landuse change in the study area increased impervious surface area from 59 73 to 86 01 within 20 years 2010 2030 resulting in peak flow from 16 12 m3 s to 39 99 m3 s and peak flow time from 1 29 2 01 respectively compared to the baseline scenario the percentage change in stormwater would be 27 49 and 59 69 under 2020 and 2030 from 2010 respectively these results revealed that the town converted to a paved surface such as residential settlements commercial areas and public infrastructures through urban expansions peak runoff and flooding risks have increased in the current and future scenarios when compared to the baseline scenario 2010 furthermore as the time of peak runoff response shifted significantly the community become more vulnerable to flooding similarly previous studies have shown that an increasing trend in runoff and flood volume is expected in future scenarios due to an increasing impervious surface ratio akhter and hewa 2016 marhaento et al 2018 if the study area s impervious surface area increased from 59 73 to 86 01 the total inflow volume and flooding volume of the junctions would be increased by 116 064 106 to 287 928 106 ltr and 15 740 106 to 26 249 106 ltr respectively furthermore similar to the present study an earlier study by kong et al 2017 found that flooding volume increased by 92 9 before 35 min as impervious surface area increased to 67 the increased impervious ratio of 26 3 increased the number of flooded junctions from 11 to 98 as shown in table 5 notably junctions j156 j139 and j80 shown in fig 7 are flooded before 2 h of simulation time with flooding volumes of 49 74 143 9 and 259 41 106 ltr respectively fig 7 a and 8 b shows the locations of flooded junctions and type of flooding in the study area as a result of the simulated impervious surface area of 59 73 and 86 01 respectively according to simulation results 51 junctions 17 5 of a total of 292 are flooded under the 2020 landuse scenario while 98 junctions 33 56 of a total of 292 are flooded under the 2030 landuse scenario as suggested by hassan et al 2017 based on the flooding flow rate on junctions 1 96 and 98 04 of junctions are classified as high flooding and very high flooding respectively among all junctions j139 which is located downstream of the town is very highly flooded before 1 45 h of rainfall duration similar to this finding shanableh et al 2018 investigated as 60 of drainage system junctions flooded due to rapid landuse change in ten years fig 7 b revealed that flooded junctions were slightly flooded fairly flooded highly flooded and very highly flooded with 17 18 26 and 39 respectively overall this finding revealed that rapid urbanization with an insufficient drainage system would increase the risk of urban flooding as the result of urban growth in the 2030 the high flooding risks will expected in the downstream area of the town northeast direction this flooding problems will may affects the resident s house damages property and infrastructure 3 4 effects of climate change on stormwater this study used two gcms to investigate the impact of climate change on stormwater drainage systems figs 8 10 show the rainfall intensity variation of the 50 year return period due to climate change in canesm2 and hadgem2 es under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the 2030 s 2050 s and 2080 s respectively peak runoff and flooding volume increased as rainfall intensity varied due to both climate models canesm2 and hadgem2 es according to rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the variation in rainfall intensities for the canesm2 ranges between 1 5 and 18 6 and 3 9 19 8 resulting in peak runoff ranges of 8 96 41 77 m3 s and 12 44 34 5 m3 s respectively similarly the variation in hadgem2 es predicted rainfall intensities resulted in an increase in catchment surface runoff of 24 5m3 s to 53m3 s and 28 7m3 s to 68 4m3 s under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively this demonstrates that the intensity of rainfall and magnitude of peak flow varies depending on the type of climate model and emission scenario used as depicted in shahabul and elshorbagy 2015 degaetano and castellano 2017 in addition the variation in rainfall intensity caused by climate change affects the volume of stormwater and flooding in the town as well as the efficiency of drainage systems the total flooding volume increased from 16 113 106 to 34 118 106 and 16 318 106 to 37 147 106 from canesm2 and hadgem2 es respectively due to the design storms changed from 10 to 50 year return period as shown in table 6 flooding volume is expected to increase by 32 and 28 respectively under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of the ensemble median of the two climate models these revealed that existing drainage systems designed based on historical idf relationships can be resilient to future climate conditions as a result of the variation in rainfall the number of flooded junctions increased increasing the flooding risks in the study area at the 5 year return period of canesm2 and hadgem2 es 15 1 and 17 5 of junctions are flooded before 1 35 h of simulation time respectively these occurred as a result of the simulated stormwater exceeding the design capacity identifying the locations of flooding in the town and the type of flooding under climate change scenarios used to manage the severity of urban flooding based on the flow rates as suggested by hassan et al 2017 9 16 42 and 33 of flooded junctions were classified as very light medium high and very high flooding junctions respectively the results showed that the drainage systems failed to collect and safely convey peak stormwater from the town furthermore many previous studies have recently recommended that stormwater management systems designed to meet historic idf relationships can be resilient to the future rainfall intensity of gcms stormwater drainage systems designed on historical assumptions flooded 39 of junctions hossain et al 2020 and have a 46 increase in flooding volume hassan et al 2017 the existing stormwater management system overflowed and caused flooding risks in the urban area as a result of climate change predicted by various global climate models babaei et al 2018 thakali et al 2016 when the predicted landuse of 2030 is combined with the predicted rainfall of hadgem2 es and canesm2 the combined scenario resulted in runoff of 79 31 m3 s and 74 65 m3 s respectively the flooding volume in the study area is high in magnitude causing infrastructure damage and interfering with community activities the dodola town drainage systems should be redesigned using the gcms estimated design storms and future landuse to overcome flooding problems that arose prior to the design period as a result of insufficient drainage systems 3 5 effects of various lid scenarios on runoff management as shown in fig 11 all lids permeable pavement bio retention and combined lids have significant runoff reduction capabilities for the shortest rainfall duration of 3 h the combined mitigation measures have a maximum capacity of 78 6 64 2 and 59 5 peak runoff reduction for historical canesm2 and hadgem2 es rainfall patterns respectively the efficiency of all lids was consistent with storm events however design storms that vary due to climate change may affect the performance of mitigation measures even though there is a significant increase in peak runoff as a result of climate change lid techniques have shown significant potential to reduce the peak up to 53 4 and 48 5 for the corresponding rainfall patterns of canesm2 and hadgem2 es respectively as shown in fig 11b c similarly niu et al 2016 investigated the effectiveness of three types of lids on peak runoff in china by simulating rainfall patterns less than 4 h and more than 4 h according to their study the results differ under both simulation conditions similarly jemberie and melesse 2021 studied the effects of various lid on rainfall patterns of 10 min 30 min and 1 hr duration and highlighted that lids have significant runoff reduction capacities for the shortest rainfall duration furthermore the results show that if all types of lid measures are implemented based on different scenarios there is a high potential for flooding volume reduction flood mitigation measures were found to reduce peak flow in the future below the baseline scenario offsetting the adverse impact of climate change pyke et al 2011 kirshen et al 2015 kim et al 2015 in addition impacts of urban flooding caused due to urban expansion can be easily managed using mitigation techniques in terms of the landuse scenario permeable pavement can reduce peak runoff by up to 35 2 whereas bio retention can reduce it by 21 2 if it is effectively applied among three lid facilities combined pp br offered a maximum reduction in peak flow as shown in fig 12 consistent with this study s results fiori and volpi 2020 luan et al 2019 and zhu and chen 2017 have suggested that combined practices can reduce a higher percentage of flooding volume in highly urbanized sub catchments under both scenarios landuse and climate change high peak runoff is expected and will pose flooding risks in the town the use of more resilient systems such as lid can mitigate some risks by mimicking the urban hydrological process more closely the results of this study show an implemented lids can minimize the flooding problems that hindered the normal activity of the community and damage to infrastructures the total flooding volume of the junctions is reduced up to 34 and 46 in the case of bio retention and permeable pavement respectively however only lids alone could not compensate for the adverse impacts of land use and climate change for evidence dudula and randhir 2016 simulated increasing peak runoff by 15 25 even with low impact development to support this kirshen et al 2015 found that lids alone could not reduce the flooding risks caused by adverse impacts of climate change by 2070 for both 10 and 100 year storms similarly jenkins et al 2017 concluded that 33 of houses and properties are affected by an increase in flood vulnerability even with lids therefore this study suggested that to reimburse the adverse flooding problems under climate and landuse change implementation of lids with adequate drainage systems should be required for dodola town 4 conclusions in an attempt to quantify the separate and combined effects of landuse land cover and climate change on the performance of the urban drainage system in dodola town ethiopia swmm 5 1 was performed furthermore landuse change and projected climate change scenarios obtained from two gcms canesm2 and hadgem2 es were then also incorporated into the modeling a validated swmm 5 1 model was then used to simulate the peak flow flooding volume and performance of the drainage system under different past and future scenarios climate change caused by canesm2 and hadgem2 es will cause up to 39 72 and 45 2 of the existing drainage system to flood respectively total flooding volume rose from 15 740 106 to 26 249 106 ltr as impervious surface area fractions increased from 59 73 to 86 01 and the ratio of flooded junctions increased from 3 76 to 33 56 the finding revealed that the drainage system failed before its design period to convey the peak runoff caused by the combined effects of landuse and climate change and the study area in the urban center is affected by flooding problems incorporating the three types of lids into the existing stormwater drainage system helps to minimize the increased flood risk in the study area compared to all lids the combined of the permeable pavement and bio retention provides the most effective control of flooding volume from the study area as the number of flooded junctions increased from the simulation with the existing and future scenarios the study concluded that dodola s existing drainage system is insufficient to accommodate peak runoff either for existing or future landuse and climate change scenarios according to the findings of this study flooding problems hampered the normal activity of the community for an hour as well as damage to the town s infrastructure overall this finding can be vigorously promoted for dodola town to plan and apply different lids according to local conditions to achieve the purpose of stormwater management possible mitigation measures should also be taken into consideration with

7849,study region this study was conducted in dodola town ethiopia study focus this study aims to examine the impacts of landuse and climate changes on peak runoff and flooding volumes and also evaluates the effectiveness of low impact development using swmm 5 1 three decades of landuse landcover were analyzed to assess the performance of the existing drainage system furthermore the effect of climate change on drainage system performance was assessed using the estimated design storms from two global climate models canesm2 and hadgem2 es new hydrological insights for region the trend of landuse landcover analysis shows that the town has experienced a significant increase in the impervious surface area ranging from 59 73 to 86 01 in response to urbanization the trend of peak stormwater showed a continuously increasing trend the field observations confirm that the landuse change has had a significant impact on the performance of stormwater drainage systems the study also found that the peak runoff and flooding volume of the study area was increased under separate and combined effects of rainfall intensity variation due to climate change and increased impervious surface area this finding indicates that existing drainage systems flooded due to discharge exceeding the design capacity and that profit is required when considering the effects of both land use and climate change scenarios three environmentally friendly low impact development approaches bio retention permeable pavement and a combination of the two are applied to reduce increased peak stormwater and mitigate flooding problems keywords urbanization climate change peak stormwater urban flooding lid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flooding is one of the most worldwide challenges that threaten the population infrastructure properties loss of life and the environment hlodversdottir et al 2015 thieken et al 2016 nile et al 2018 in recent years high magnitude urban flooding caused due to surface runoff increased as a result of landuse change moreover extreme rainfall events due to the effect of climate change have increased the urban flooding severity and risks in worldwide towns cities kundzewicz et al 2014 nile et al 2019 in addition the problem related to flooding in the urban area occurs when stormwater drainage systems are inadequate for peak flow in the process of urbanization the natural surface area is transferred into an impervious cover that alters natural hydrological processes hu et al 2020 it is evident by the rapid expansion of the urbanization process in the city and increasingly intense rainstorms have caused the risks of urban flooding as evidenced many studies e g guan et al 2016 neupane 2018 have assessed landuse and climate change impacts on the stormwater drainage systems separately halsn√¶s and kaspersen 2018 investigated the effect of climate change on urban drainage systems in the city of odense denmark by using one single climate simulation chain under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios however zhou et al 2019 investigated the effect of climate change on flooding in a major city in northern china using an ensemble of low resolution bias adjusted global climate models gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 moreover padulano et al 2021 evaluated the flood hazard caused by variability in 19 climate projection models under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the city of naples italy in addition to this most finding shows that changes in landuse affect the hydrological processes which mean alterations in flooding volume and peak flow du et al 2012 hu et al 2020 as a result urban areas are expected to become even more exposed and vulnerable to flooding in the future moreover in the coming years extreme floods are expected to be more frequent and devastating due to the effects of climate change and the expansion of urbanization that increases the generation of urban catchment runoff huong and pathirana 2013 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 an urban stormwater simulation model applied to a large catchment of dublin ireland showed that landuse change from 2013 to 2026 could cause monthly runoff to increase by 30 in winter and annual runoff to increase by up to 15 willuweit et al 2016 however there are limited studies that assessed the combined effects of climate change and landuse on the urban catchment stormwater also they described how stormwater drainage systems behave under varying rainfall and urbanization conditions wu et al 2013 abdul aziz and al amin 2016 saraswat et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 the unpredictable rainfall intensity in the city with urbanization and the lack of sufficient drainage systems are among the main reasons for the floods increase hassan et al 2021 moreover the modeled drainage system in the town city not considered both effects of climate and landuse change willuweit and o sullivan 2013 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 razaq et al 2019 panos et al 2021 in addition recent studies were conducted to assess the effects of riparian vegetation on real water flow in open channels and to quantify flow turbulence in channels using various experimental approaches khan et al 2022 lama et al 2022 to alleviate flooding various low impact development lid practices e g rainfall garden green bio retention vegetative roofs and pervious pavement are implemented at both local and watershed scales worldwide each with its own set of functions and stormwater management techniques lee et al 2012 line et al 2012 guan et al 2015 kong et al 2017 mangrove trees are another environmentally friendly water engineering solution that has an impact on the unidirectional flow characteristics of structures kazemi et al 2018 many studies evaluated the effectiveness of lid in flood hazard mitigation in urban areas based on its simplicity cost effectiveness eco friendly solutions and sustainability zahmatkesh et al 2015 akhter and hewa 2016 lama et al 2021 lama 2016 also conducted an experimental study on the flow dynamics and turbulence patterns in a drainage channel under various scenarios they concluded that common reeds flow vegetation interactions have impacted the hydraulic efficiency of a drainage channel by changing the flow resistance velocity distribution and turbulence in a channel huong and pathirana 2013 akhter and hewa 2016 ahiablame and shakya 2016 reported a 12 75 42 reduction in runoff as a response to land use change however pyke et al 2011 and zahmatkesh et al 2015 found that mitigation measures reduced 27 2 and 34 5 of the increased runoff volume due to the climate change scenario respectively lids also have the potential to significantly reduce urban flood risks as a result of the combined effects of land use and climate change neupane 2018 neupane et al 2021 the problems caused by high magnitude flooding volume mostly happened in ethiopian cities towns many times even recently urban flooding problems have occurred in diredawa and addis abeba as a result of dynamic landuse change and insufficient drainage system provision affecting properties and infrastructures and causing traffic congestion birhanu et al 2016 haile and worku 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 similarly flooding problems during the rainy season are a regular observable fact in dodola the existing stormwater drainage system is inadequate because it was built without adequate hydrological hydraulic analysis as well as without taking landuse and climate change scenarios into account the systems were insufficient to accommodate the increased peak stormwater caused by both effects rapid urbanisation and climate change many areas in dodola town were inundated especially in the low lying sub area furthermore flooding disrupted the community s daily activities as well as the homes of several residents therefore this study was investigated to model stormwater management based on landuse and climate change using swmm 5 1 the first aim of this study is to provide hydrological information that is not available for dodola town by predicting the rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves second this study aims to evaluate the performance of the existing drainage system under climate and landuse change third to evaluate the effectiveness of the three lids types to minimize the increased flooding as the response to landuse and climate change after achieving the above objectives this study is expected to provide a technical solution for experts engineering and decision makers to identify flood problems and evaluate proposed solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area dodola town fig 1 is located at the latitude of 6010 27 70 n to 7001 01 64 n and longitude 39052 0 97 e to 39012 32 86 e upstream of the wabe shebele river basin and at the right side of the addis ababa bale robe main road in south eastern ethiopia the total study area is 1193 ha the catchment s highest and lowest elevations are 2529 and 2413 m above sea level respectively and are located near the mara mountain and the kora river 74 33 of the area is characterized by a gentle slope the middle and lower part of the catchment is characterized by a slopping slope 8 6 plain slope 15 55 moderate slope 1 48 and extremely steep slope 0 04 the soil distribution of the study area is predominantly mollic glysols and pellic vertisols which cover 9 52 and 90 48 respectively according to the fao soil map the mean annual rainfall is 619 1731 9 mm the mean lowest and highest monthly rainfalls are 38 11 mm in january and 156 mm in july respectively the average daily minimum is 6 c and the mean daily maximum temperature is 25 9 c 2 2 data sets in this study both spatial and temporal data sets were used a 12 5mx 12 5 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was acquired from the alaska satellite facility https asf alaska edu to analyze the average slope of each sub catchment low cloud cover satellite datasets were downloaded from https earthexplorer usgv gov these datasets which are landsat images for 2010 and 2020 were used to develop landuse maps to identify the impacts of landuse changes the pixel size of the satellite images is 30 30 m a soil map was taken from the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia mwioe the town master plan which was obtained from the municipal city office contains road layouts and information related to various public infrastructures the 30 years 1989 2019 daily observed rainfall data was collected from the ethiopian national metrological agency the global climate models such as ec earth mpi es lr canesm2 hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 were obtained from the cordex africa database via earth system grid federation esgf kamworapan and surussavadee 2019 aznarez et al 2021 these models have spatial grid resolutions of 0 44 longitude and 0 44 latitude hewitson et al 2012 in this study outputs from five gcms were dynamically downscaled using the regional climate models rcms racmo22t remo2009 rca4 racmo22t and rca4 respectively the data for the model s calibration and validation were measured near the outfall of the system the drainage network data was obtained via field survey the typical values for manning s roughness coefficient for the conduits were extracted from the literature akdoƒüan and g√ºven 2016 2 3 methodology as fig 2 shows the workflow of the study is structured in four main categories namely 1 land use land cover change 2 the climate change analysis 3 the simulation of sub catchment stormwater considering different scenarios and 4 the effectiveness of the low impact development practices the first category assesses the percentage increase of impervious surface area due to the landuse change the second category develops the updated rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves to account for the effect of climate change the downscaled and bias corrected rainfall data was converted into different return period design storms to derive swmm 5 1 model the main outcomes of climate change and landuse land cover category are the main input of the third category which relies on the simulation of urban stormwater and investigates the potential effects of the climate and landuse change on the peak stormwater and efficiency of the drainage system the fourth category evaluates the effectiveness of three types of lid practices applied for the mitigation of urban inundation 2 3 1 study area delineation and sub division for the catchment delineation the arc hydro terrain processing tool which requires dem of the study area as the input vector was used using 12 5 m dem the terrain analysis was performed to generate flow direction longest flow path the path within a catchment through which water travels from the farthest point to the outlet sub catchment outlet and area moreover the actual flow path and flow processes in urban regions are not only influenced by the topography condition other factors such as road layout and built up settlements influence flow direction these factors were considered when the catchment was divided into homogeneous sub catchments shen and zhang 2014 as a result the divided sub catchment based on terrain analysis was further subdivided and adjusted based on the town s landuse types kong et al 2017 a field investigation was also done to confirm the stormwater drainage patterns developed using arcgis as indicated in fig 3 the total area of dodola town was divided into 36 sub catchments 292 junctions and 291 conduits 2 3 2 swmm 5 1 development the stormwater management model version 5 1 a processed based hydrologic hydraulic model developed by us environmental protection agency epa was chosen to evaluate the impacts of different land development conditions and climate change on the peak runoff as well as the effectiveness of proposed aggregate lids to mitigate urban flooding this model was selected because 1 it accounts for spatial variability of sub catchment properties 2 each sub catchment receives inflows from rainfall and generates runoff based on the assigned sub catchment parameters e g area flow width percentage of imperviousness imperv average slope etc 3 it accounts dynamic rainfall runoff from single or continuous peak runoff quantity in urban areas 4 it quantifies the sub catchment peak runoff at different climate and landuse change and identify the location of flooding nodes in the drainage networks the model required many input parameters to quantify the peak runoff and identify flooding location including sub catchment characteristics physical characteristics of drainage e g diameter length slope and material design storms and soil properties of the study area zhou et al 2018 these inputted parameters were estimated through a combination of spatial analysis in arcgis 10 3 literature sources field surveys and model defaults the physical characteristics of each sub catchment including areas slope and flow path length were generated accordingly based on 12 5 mx 12 5 m resolution dem data using the arc hydro extension in arc map 10 3 esri the width of the overland flow path which an important in the model and is very sensitive in stormwater runoff simulations was calculated as suggested by bisht et al 2016 1 w a l where w is the width of the sub catchment a is an area of sub catchment and l is the longest overflow path the sub catchment slope was considered to be equal to the slope of the flow path and was estimated as the difference in elevation divided by the length of the flow path on the map in reality the sub catchment slope and imperviousness vary within the sub catchment therefore according to the suggestion of niyonkuru et al 2018a 2018b the weighted average slope of each sub catchment was calculated the percentage of imperviousness of each sub catchment was determined by the landuse type the swmm 5 1 model is based on defining the impervious fraction of individual land uses within the sub catchment and then weighting these impervious fractions by the proportion of the sub catchment that is covered by individual land use based on this eq 2 was applied for computing imp values 2 im p e r v a 1 i 1 a 2 i 2 a n i n a 1 a 2 a n where imperv is the weighted percentage imperviousness of the sub catchment in is the value of imperviousness of each type of surface cover and ai is the area of each type of surface values for other sub catchment parameters such as surface roughness described by manning coefficient n value surface depression storage depths d store and the green ampt infiltration rates for pervious areas were based on the ranges given by reference giron√°s et al 2010 the study area soil parameters such as the initial moisture deficit hydraulic conductivity and the suction head of the soil were estimated based on the soil types mollic gleysols and pellic vertisols extracted for the study area parnas et al 2021 for hydraulic modeling the inputted properties required for junctions and outfalls spatial location invert elevation and maximum depth and key parameters of conduit spatial position were collected via field survey the properties of the stormwater drainage network were converted into shapefile fig 3 using arcgis 10 3 and then imported into swmm 5 1 2 3 3 landuse landcover change the most important factor influencing the amount of urban stormwater is landuse change the process of landuse change can not only cause significant changes in runoff patterns in terms of both peak flow volumes and time of runoff response but also vulnerabilities to flooding risks the processing of satellite images such as geo referencing mosaicking layer stacking and supervised classification was carried out in erdas imagine 2015 software the classified landuse images were then generalized and reclassified into government administration residency open space green area playgrounds and cemetery for the 2020 landuse map the above landuse types were used for consistency in analysis the results of the past ten years landuse can be used to make predictions ten years later namely the prediction data for 2030 to predict the future landuse the previous researchers used different techniques from there the markov chain analysis and ca analysis are widely adopted to quantify the future period landuse using the known landuse datasets of different periods weng 2002 sun et al 2007 regmi et al 2014 to effectively do this the markov chain model is a useful technique to quantify the future period landuse change in dodola town the markov process predicts the future state of a system based on the preceding state by developing a transition probability matrix of lu lc change starting from the time one to time two furthermore this technique is widely used to predict future landuse by 2030 a transition probability matrix for landuse change was developed using the markov chain transition estimator from time one to two the calculation of land use prediction is followed by 3 s t t 1 pij x s t where s t is the system status at the time of t s t 1 is the system status at the time of t 1 pij is the transition probability matrix in a state which is calculated as follows 4 p p ij p11 p12 p1n p21 p22 p2n p31 p32 p3n where p is the transition probability pij represents the probability of converting from the current state i to another state j in next time pn is the state s probability for any time guan et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 the transition probability matrix was calculated for the periods 2010 and 2020 to predict the probability of land use pattern by 2030 this matrix was produced by the cross tabulation of two periods with land use images the landuse area in calculated for the years 2010 2020 and 2030 is listed in table 1 and fig 4 2 3 4 climate change model the assessment of climate change effects on the drainage system efficient needs an evaluation of the accuracy of a climate model yazdanfar and sharma 2015 numerous endeavors have been made to examine the performance of climate models in simulating various climate variables e g precipitation gu et al 2014 sun et al 2021 as stated by smith et al 1998 in this study the gcms were selected considering four criteria 1 the availability of projected data for the catchment 2 spatial resolution fine resolution gcms are preferred 3 validity performance of gcms using statistical measures and 4 representativeness an ensemble of gcms covering a wide range of projections of rainfall is considered based on the above criteria the downscaled rainfall data of five global climate models ccml hadgem2 es canesm2 ec earth and miroc5 were evaluated chen et al 2012 mendlik and gobiet 2016 statistical measures such as percentage of bias root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of variation cv were used to evaluate the performance of climate models thus in terms of cv and rmse hadgem2 es performs better results than others canesm cm5 performs better than others in terms of bias and cv therefore based on the statistical evaluation the future projected rainfall data of both hadgem2 es and canesm2 were obtained i downscaling and bias correction the baseline 1988 2005 and future projected rainfall data 2006 2100 of the study area were downscaled from the gcms according to padulano et al 2021 the impact of future climate conditions on urban flooding can be simulated using climate models however due to several systematic climate model errors and spatial averaging within grid cells simulations of precipitation often show biases that restrict the use of produced climate model data as direct input for hydrological models therefore the bias of climate model data should corrected before it can be used for the input of the model fang et al 2015 alamdari 2018 climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd is a tool used to extract and bias correct data obtained from global climate models berhanu 2018 saade et al 2021 in scientific literature bias correction methods vary from simple linear to complex quantile distribution functions fang et al 2015 stated that different bias correction methods for precipitation such as linear scaling local intensity scaling power transformation distribution mapping of precipitation using gamma distribution and quantile mapping precipitation methods for rainfall the power transformation and quantile mapping method perform best in terms of frequency indices as suggested by the previous study conducted in the ethiopian watershed wagesho et al 2013 worku 2019 tadese 2020 moreover from the listed methods the power transformation method was selected in cmhydr to correct bias because this method considered day to day variability precipitation and it needs information on monthly observed statistics such as mean and coefficient of variation cv which others didn t smitha et al 2018 ghimire et al 2019 leander and buishand 2007 5 p ap b where p is the corrected rainfall and p is the uncorrected rainfall data parameters a and b were found for every month of the year including available data for all years the determination of the b parameter was done iteratively using a solver in excel in contrast b depends only on the cv of the data and its determination were independent of the value of a the parameter a was determined when the mean of the transformed daily values agreed with the observed mean leander and buishand 2007 ii design storm rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves for current and future climate conditions were developed and were used to estimate the design storm of different return periods maimone et al 2019 once the annual maximum daily precipitation data were extracted the rainfall depths of hourly sub hourly 0 5 1 2 3 6 and 12 were disaggregated from daily time resolution rainfall using the reduction formula suggested by the indian meteorological department chowdhury et al 2007 nwaogazie et al 2021 which is 6 p t p 24 x t 24 1 3 where pt mm is the rainfall depth for the duration of t hour p24 maximum annual daily rainfall mm and t the time duration in hours for the required rainfall depth in hours the t year rainfall depth and rainfall intensity for the baseline and future period were computed using the best fitted probability distribution method maimone et al 2019 to select the best fitted probability distribution method eleven different methods such as two parameter distributions normal lognormal and gumbel maximum three parameter distributions log pearson iii generalized extreme value glo gpa and web and five parameter distributions wakeby distribution was compared nguyen et al 2017 alam et al 2018 gado et al 2021 the l moment ratio diagram and statistical goodness of tests such as kolmogorov smirnov ks anderson darling ad and chi square x2 have been adopted to select the probability distribution method ahmad et al 2016 gado and nguyen 2016 mamoon and rahman 2017 the value of l skewness œÑ 3 and l kurtosis œÑ 4 from the l moment ratio diagram and goodness of fits confirm generalized extreme value gev is the best fitted for the study area to estimate rainfall depth at different return periods as shown in eq 7 a alam et al 2018 ghosh et al 2016 7 x t u Œ± k 1 Œ≥ 1 k k t Œ± k 2 Œ≥ 1 2 k Œ≥ 2 1 k where u a k and t are the parameters of gev kt is a frequency factor depends on the return period eq 8 8 k t k Œ≥ 1 k log 1 1 t k k Œ≥ 1 2 k Œ≥ 2 1 k 1 2 hence for different return periods the rainfall intensity it was calculated by dividing the estimated rainfall depth by the corresponding storm duration the inputted design storms for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years return periods were estimated in the chicago design storm format as recommended in the literature krvavica and rubiniƒá 2020 berggren et al 2014 the rainfall durations of 15 30 60 120 and 180 of different return periods were chosen as examples in this study laouacheria et al 2019 similarly the design storms of 3 hrs for both canesm2 and hadgem2 es climate models under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were estimated and inputted separately in the model to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the hydrological processes aznarez et al 2021 2 3 5 identification of the impacts of climate and landuse changes on the stormwater drainage systems it was the objective of this work to investigate the effects of separate and combined urbanization and climate changes on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in managing urban flooding due to the storm water s peak it is very important to know flood locations and identify flood problems the results of the swmm 5 1 simulation were used to try to identify the stormwater flooding caused in the junctions as suggested by hassan et al 2017 no flooding very light flooding medium flooding high flooding and very high flooding with junction flooding ranges of 0 0 001 m3 s 0 001 0 01 m3 s 0 01 0 02 m3 s 0 02 0 04 m3 s and greater 0 04 m3 s in this study the junctions of the system were classified according to the above stage and also the junctions that mostly flooded were identified with their flooding magnitude in each scenario 2 3 6 evaluation of low impact development lid effectiveness in reducing peak stormwater in this study two scenarios were considered to observe the difference in the stormwater runoff i e with and without the implementation of the low impact development lids practices in scenario 1 the stormwater of the study area was simulated without the implementation of lids in scenario 2 three types of lids were implemented to reduce the increased stormwater runoff caused by urbanization climate change and both effects of landuse and climate change the swmm 5 1 has been successfully applied to evaluate the potential benefits of implementing lid zhu and chen 2017 omidi et al 2021 the model includes seven different types of lids approach practices that can be used to reduce peak runoff bio retention cell green roof infiltration trench permeable pavement rain barrel rain garden and vegetative swales zanandrea and luiz 2018 the effectiveness of three types of lids was evaluated bio retention permeable pavers and a combination of the two first the swmm 5 1 simulated sub catchment peak runoff total volume of flooding and many flooded junctions without implemented lids practices for landuse climate change and both combined scenarios then the swmm simulated again without changing the inputted parameters in the model the percentage reduction in peak flow flooding volume and number of flooded junctions was calculated using the model under scenarios 1 and 2 as rossmann and huber 2016 suggested the input parameters of lid practices in swmm 5 1 were defined by taking into account the characteristics of local soil types sandy clay and sandy loam 2 3 7 model calibration and validation the swmm 5 1 model was required since a large set of parameters was estimated from various data sources and these parameters affect the model output with different weights resulting in different uncertainty gao et al 2020 to solve this the sensitivity of parameters was investigated to identify which inputted parameters would be most effective in minimizing differences between the simulated and observed results niyonkuru et al 2018a 2018b behrouz et al 2020 there are different sensitivity analysis techniques are available in the literature differentiated into global methods and local methods saltelli et al 2008 in this paper a local sensitivity analysis technique by brun et al 2001 was used to model calibration and validation because it evaluates the model response to the variation of input parameters which are changed one at a time del giudice padulano 2016 moreover the local method is preferred to select in this study due to solving identification problems in rainfall runoff models mancipe munoz et al 2014 and due to the required computational effort is minimal if compared to global techniques also it can be easily integrated into modeling software to provide a preliminary identification analysis dotto et al 2010 the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool in pcswmm was used to calibrate and validate the swmm 5 1 for the study area niazi et al 2017 the sensitivity based genetic algorithm ga calibration method which consists of four components sensitivity analysis calibration determining the limit or range of the calibration parameters and performance evaluation of the calibrated model was used in the pcswmm this ga allows the user to select the initial values for control parameters along with a specified level of uncertainties between observed and simulated channel runoff depth basnayaka 2012 perin et al 2020 then pcswmm updates the independent variables model parameters and returns the updated input parameters to swmm 5 1 this process was repeated until the maximum iteration was reached the flow depth calibrations taken into consideration in this study were the surface roughness of the impervious n imperv and pervious n perv sub catchment surfaces and the depths of surface depressions on impervious dstore imperv and pervious dstore perv areas percentage of impervious area overland flow width slope and soil parameters all the other insensitive parameters were left unchanged from their initial values while the sensitive parameters were adjusted frequently until the simulated results closely matched the measured values three goodness of fit statistics the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d eqs 9 11 were used to evaluate model performance during calibration and validation as suggested by basnayaka 2012

values respectively and n is the total number of observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis results for sensitivity analysis at the first stage the model was run using the initial parameter of the model in the pcswmm the parameters were systematically adjusted until differences between the two results were minimized means until the simulated results closely matched the measured runoff depth from the graphical comparison the parameters are then classified according to their importance ranking as given in table 2 there are eleven parameters of the swmm 5 1 model that were subject to the sensitivity analysis the outcome of the sensitivity analysis reveals that imperv average overland slope manning s roughness coefficient of overland surface flow depth of depression storage sub catchment width and infiltration parameters were the most important parameters that influence the runoff depth according to the results imperv slope and sub catchment width are more sensitive than others and positively correlated with the results of the model in the study area however the roughness coefficient of pervious surface area and green ampt infiltration parameters are the least significant parameters inversely affecting the output of swmm 5 1 3 2 calibration and validation of model parameters for study catchment calibration was performed for selected rainfall events by varying the values of the inputted parameters in the model from their initial values as shown in table 2 this was done to evaluate the changes in the simulated results after varying the initial value of each parameter while considering the same rainfall events the simulated and observed runoff depth were graphically compared fig 5 it can be seen that there is variation after the initial value of inputted parameters was adjusted in the model the most sensitive parameters imperv slope and sub catchment width have the greatest impact on the model result the adjusted values of dstore imp and n perv inputted parameters are very close to the initial value at the end of calibration however the calibrated parameter values of initial deficit and suction head are roughly close to a maximum value of parameters in this study the parameters of the model are calibrated by two storm events on 10 july and 1 august 2020 the model validation is done to test the performance of the calibrated model parameters on independent storm events which were not used in the calibration the storm events on 5 august 2020 are selected for validation the simulated runoff depth of the validation event is shown in fig 6 together with the observed results the results of the goodness of fit tests for the calibration and validation model are indicated in table 3 the results show that the r2 nse and d are within the acceptable range of events for the swmm 5 1 model niazi et al 2017 although the value of nse is 0 63 and 0 74 for calibration and validation respectively values between 0 and 1 are acceptable so in this study the calibration and validation of swmm 5 1 are acceptable r2 and d criteria also imply for indicate that the prediction errors are well balanced it can be concluded that the model achieved acceptance accuracy for simulation in the dodola town based on the goodness of fit indices 3 3 effects of landuse landcover change on peak stormwater the simulated results of the hydrological response during landuse landcover change revealed an increase in peak runoff over three decades as presented in table 4 the trend landuse change in the study area increased impervious surface area from 59 73 to 86 01 within 20 years 2010 2030 resulting in peak flow from 16 12 m3 s to 39 99 m3 s and peak flow time from 1 29 2 01 respectively compared to the baseline scenario the percentage change in stormwater would be 27 49 and 59 69 under 2020 and 2030 from 2010 respectively these results revealed that the town converted to a paved surface such as residential settlements commercial areas and public infrastructures through urban expansions peak runoff and flooding risks have increased in the current and future scenarios when compared to the baseline scenario 2010 furthermore as the time of peak runoff response shifted significantly the community become more vulnerable to flooding similarly previous studies have shown that an increasing trend in runoff and flood volume is expected in future scenarios due to an increasing impervious surface ratio akhter and hewa 2016 marhaento et al 2018 if the study area s impervious surface area increased from 59 73 to 86 01 the total inflow volume and flooding volume of the junctions would be increased by 116 064 106 to 287 928 106 ltr and 15 740 106 to 26 249 106 ltr respectively furthermore similar to the present study an earlier study by kong et al 2017 found that flooding volume increased by 92 9 before 35 min as impervious surface area increased to 67 the increased impervious ratio of 26 3 increased the number of flooded junctions from 11 to 98 as shown in table 5 notably junctions j156 j139 and j80 shown in fig 7 are flooded before 2 h of simulation time with flooding volumes of 49 74 143 9 and 259 41 106 ltr respectively fig 7 a and 8 b shows the locations of flooded junctions and type of flooding in the study area as a result of the simulated impervious surface area of 59 73 and 86 01 respectively according to simulation results 51 junctions 17 5 of a total of 292 are flooded under the 2020 landuse scenario while 98 junctions 33 56 of a total of 292 are flooded under the 2030 landuse scenario as suggested by hassan et al 2017 based on the flooding flow rate on junctions 1 96 and 98 04 of junctions are classified as high flooding and very high flooding respectively among all junctions j139 which is located downstream of the town is very highly flooded before 1 45 h of rainfall duration similar to this finding shanableh et al 2018 investigated as 60 of drainage system junctions flooded due to rapid landuse change in ten years fig 7 b revealed that flooded junctions were slightly flooded fairly flooded highly flooded and very highly flooded with 17 18 26 and 39 respectively overall this finding revealed that rapid urbanization with an insufficient drainage system would increase the risk of urban flooding as the result of urban growth in the 2030 the high flooding risks will expected in the downstream area of the town northeast direction this flooding problems will may affects the resident s house damages property and infrastructure 3 4 effects of climate change on stormwater this study used two gcms to investigate the impact of climate change on stormwater drainage systems figs 8 10 show the rainfall intensity variation of the 50 year return period due to climate change in canesm2 and hadgem2 es under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the 2030 s 2050 s and 2080 s respectively peak runoff and flooding volume increased as rainfall intensity varied due to both climate models canesm2 and hadgem2 es according to rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the variation in rainfall intensities for the canesm2 ranges between 1 5 and 18 6 and 3 9 19 8 resulting in peak runoff ranges of 8 96 41 77 m3 s and 12 44 34 5 m3 s respectively similarly the variation in hadgem2 es predicted rainfall intensities resulted in an increase in catchment surface runoff of 24 5m3 s to 53m3 s and 28 7m3 s to 68 4m3 s under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively this demonstrates that the intensity of rainfall and magnitude of peak flow varies depending on the type of climate model and emission scenario used as depicted in shahabul and elshorbagy 2015 degaetano and castellano 2017 in addition the variation in rainfall intensity caused by climate change affects the volume of stormwater and flooding in the town as well as the efficiency of drainage systems the total flooding volume increased from 16 113 106 to 34 118 106 and 16 318 106 to 37 147 106 from canesm2 and hadgem2 es respectively due to the design storms changed from 10 to 50 year return period as shown in table 6 flooding volume is expected to increase by 32 and 28 respectively under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of the ensemble median of the two climate models these revealed that existing drainage systems designed based on historical idf relationships can be resilient to future climate conditions as a result of the variation in rainfall the number of flooded junctions increased increasing the flooding risks in the study area at the 5 year return period of canesm2 and hadgem2 es 15 1 and 17 5 of junctions are flooded before 1 35 h of simulation time respectively these occurred as a result of the simulated stormwater exceeding the design capacity identifying the locations of flooding in the town and the type of flooding under climate change scenarios used to manage the severity of urban flooding based on the flow rates as suggested by hassan et al 2017 9 16 42 and 33 of flooded junctions were classified as very light medium high and very high flooding junctions respectively the results showed that the drainage systems failed to collect and safely convey peak stormwater from the town furthermore many previous studies have recently recommended that stormwater management systems designed to meet historic idf relationships can be resilient to the future rainfall intensity of gcms stormwater drainage systems designed on historical assumptions flooded 39 of junctions hossain et al 2020 and have a 46 increase in flooding volume hassan et al 2017 the existing stormwater management system overflowed and caused flooding risks in the urban area as a result of climate change predicted by various global climate models babaei et al 2018 thakali et al 2016 when the predicted landuse of 2030 is combined with the predicted rainfall of hadgem2 es and canesm2 the combined scenario resulted in runoff of 79 31 m3 s and 74 65 m3 s respectively the flooding volume in the study area is high in magnitude causing infrastructure damage and interfering with community activities the dodola town drainage systems should be redesigned using the gcms estimated design storms and future landuse to overcome flooding problems that arose prior to the design period as a result of insufficient drainage systems 3 5 effects of various lid scenarios on runoff management as shown in fig 11 all lids permeable pavement bio retention and combined lids have significant runoff reduction capabilities for the shortest rainfall duration of 3 h the combined mitigation measures have a maximum capacity of 78 6 64 2 and 59 5 peak runoff reduction for historical canesm2 and hadgem2 es rainfall patterns respectively the efficiency of all lids was consistent with storm events however design storms that vary due to climate change may affect the performance of mitigation measures even though there is a significant increase in peak runoff as a result of climate change lid techniques have shown significant potential to reduce the peak up to 53 4 and 48 5 for the corresponding rainfall patterns of canesm2 and hadgem2 es respectively as shown in fig 11b c similarly niu et al 2016 investigated the effectiveness of three types of lids on peak runoff in china by simulating rainfall patterns less than 4 h and more than 4 h according to their study the results differ under both simulation conditions similarly jemberie and melesse 2021 studied the effects of various lid on rainfall patterns of 10 min 30 min and 1 hr duration and highlighted that lids have significant runoff reduction capacities for the shortest rainfall duration furthermore the results show that if all types of lid measures are implemented based on different scenarios there is a high potential for flooding volume reduction flood mitigation measures were found to reduce peak flow in the future below the baseline scenario offsetting the adverse impact of climate change pyke et al 2011 kirshen et al 2015 kim et al 2015 in addition impacts of urban flooding caused due to urban expansion can be easily managed using mitigation techniques in terms of the landuse scenario permeable pavement can reduce peak runoff by up to 35 2 whereas bio retention can reduce it by 21 2 if it is effectively applied among three lid facilities combined pp br offered a maximum reduction in peak flow as shown in fig 12 consistent with this study s results fiori and volpi 2020 luan et al 2019 and zhu and chen 2017 have suggested that combined practices can reduce a higher percentage of flooding volume in highly urbanized sub catchments under both scenarios landuse and climate change high peak runoff is expected and will pose flooding risks in the town the use of more resilient systems such as lid can mitigate some risks by mimicking the urban hydrological process more closely the results of this study show an implemented lids can minimize the flooding problems that hindered the normal activity of the community and damage to infrastructures the total flooding volume of the junctions is reduced up to 34 and 46 in the case of bio retention and permeable pavement respectively however only lids alone could not compensate for the adverse impacts of land use and climate change for evidence dudula and randhir 2016 simulated increasing peak runoff by 15 25 even with low impact development to support this kirshen et al 2015 found that lids alone could not reduce the flooding risks caused by adverse impacts of climate change by 2070 for both 10 and 100 year storms similarly jenkins et al 2017 concluded that 33 of houses and properties are affected by an increase in flood vulnerability even with lids therefore this study suggested that to reimburse the adverse flooding problems under climate and landuse change implementation of lids with adequate drainage systems should be required for dodola town 4 conclusions in an attempt to quantify the separate and combined effects of landuse land cover and climate change on the performance of the urban drainage system in dodola town ethiopia swmm 5 1 was performed furthermore landuse change and projected climate change scenarios obtained from two gcms canesm2 and hadgem2 es were then also incorporated into the modeling a validated swmm 5 1 model was then used to simulate the peak flow flooding volume and performance of the drainage system under different past and future scenarios climate change caused by canesm2 and hadgem2 es will cause up to 39 72 and 45 2 of the existing drainage system to flood respectively total flooding volume rose from 15 740 106 to 26 249 106 ltr as impervious surface area fractions increased from 59 73 to 86 01 and the ratio of flooded junctions increased from 3 76 to 33 56 the finding revealed that the drainage system failed before its design period to convey the peak runoff caused by the combined effects of landuse and climate change and the study area in the urban center is affected by flooding problems incorporating the three types of lids into the existing stormwater drainage system helps to minimize the increased flood risk in the study area compared to all lids the combined of the permeable pavement and bio retention provides the most effective control of flooding volume from the study area as the number of flooded junctions increased from the simulation with the existing and future scenarios the study concluded that dodola s existing drainage system is insufficient to accommodate peak runoff either for existing or future landuse and climate change scenarios according to the findings of this study flooding problems hampered the normal activity of the community for an hour as well as damage to the town s infrastructure overall this finding can be vigorously promoted for dodola town to plan and apply different lids according to local conditions to achieve the purpose of stormwater management possible mitigation measures should also be taken into consideration with
