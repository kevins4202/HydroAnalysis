4620,climate change significantly influences the global hydrological cycle and consequently affects climatic extremes therefore the present study focuses upon the varying patterns of climate extremes across india for past and future here a comprehensive methodological framework incorporating univariate and joint probabilistic analysis using copulas has been proposed to study the climate extremes moreover multi model ensembles of climate extreme indices are developed using reliability ensemble averaging rea technique for reducing uncertainty in projecting future climate extremes the datasets used are daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature for past 1975 2019 and future 2025 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario a preliminary assessment of climate extremes indicates that r20 r95p consecutive wet days cwd txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn show a positive trend predominantly across india in future the bivariate assessment of precipitation extreme indices for the period 1989 2019 suggests that parts of north western north eastern southern western region and western ghats are highly prone to floods and a large portion of country is vulnerable towards co occurrence of floods and droughts moreover integrated assessment of extreme number of hot days tx90p and nights tn90p indicate that along with the projected increase in hot days nights the frequency of their concurrence in a year is likely to increase in future over the country the present study provides useful information on the regional distribution of climate extremes and can further contribute to facilitate an effective adaptation strategy keywords climate change copula india joint return period precipitation extremes temperature extremes 1 introduction persistent extreme weather events namely droughts floods heatwaves can significantly alter natural ecosystems and impose enormous societal challenges easterling et al 2000 mann et al 2017 sisco et al 2017 trenberth et al 2014 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased substantially since the pre industrial era which has led to the warming of the earth s atmosphere karl and trenberth 2003 consequently with constant relative humidity the moisture content in the atmosphere roughly increases by 6 7 k 1 in the lower tropospheric temperature willett et al 2007 thereby influencing the intensity and occurrence of extreme precipitation over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 also it is expected that the global annual surface temperature is likely to increase by 1 4 5 8 c at the end of the twenty first century and consequently the occurrence and intensity of future extreme events will be intensified beniston et al 2007 ipcc 2007 in recent years increasing catastrophic losses due to the adverse consequences of extreme climatic events have aroused public awareness beniston and stephenson 2004 zolina et al 2004 presently climate change is imposing huge challenges to food security and water resources of 1 2 billion population in india extreme events are now more frequent goyal and surampalli 2018 the adverse consequences of extreme events may alter the spatio temporal characteristics e g frequency intensity and duration and the distribution of water availability jha et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 sharma and goyal 2020 singh et al 2018 is threatening india s agrarian economy chattopadhyay 2010 for instance a drought event in 2016 affected 330 million people yielding an economic loss of 100 billion assocham report 2016 in india similarly 268 flood events have been reported during 1950 2015 affecting 825 million people and this is a threefold rise in the extreme precipitation events during the same period over the central part of india roxy et al 2017 it is therefore of paramount importance to investigate the future variability of extreme weather events related to precipitation as this will provide insight into probable changes in the occurrence and magnitude of floods and droughts li et al 2015 this will then guide suitable adaptation strategies and disaster mitigation policies jhong and tung 2018 the outputs from the studies based on observational data suggest in high confidence that high temperature extremes have increased and low temperature extremes have decreased after the 1950s globally field et al 2012 at the continental level the results show that such changes have occurred in most of the regions in north america europe asia and australia portmann et al 2009 the study indicates that most of the land surface areas in the world depict rising occurrences of warm nights and declining cold nights similarly the same areas show a rising occurrence of warm days and declining cold days apart from a few regions in north and south america further several studies suggest that this rise and fall in the extremes is mostly due to climate change rather than the influence of internal variability fischer et al 2012 kim et al 2016 portmann et al 2009 to address possible changes in future climate extreme events global climate models gcms are a credible tool presently gcm datasets under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 can be analysed to obtain inferences about possible future climatic changes under different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios it should be noted that the variability of extreme weather events due to climate change is highly diverse at a regional scale the occurrence of extreme events such as floods droughts heatwaves etc is not only affected by the atmospheric processes but also the hydrology and ecology of the regions reichstein et al 2013 terrado et al 2014 therefore researchers around the globe have attempted to investigate possible changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events examples include but are not limited to studies by sillmann et al 2013 and sillmann et al 2013 who analysed changes in precipitation extremes globally using an ensemble of gcms and found an increase in extreme events except over central america australia south africa and mediterranean region donat et al 2013 performed an analysis of extreme precipitation events using hadex2 model outputs and found an increase in the extreme precipitation characteristics in most parts of the world zollo et al 2016 studied extreme precipitation indices over italy using high resolution climate model outputs under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and reported that extreme events are likely to increase over italy goswami et al 2018b examined extremes of precipitation over north sikkim himalayan region using multiple gcms and the results suggest a significant increase in the trend of precipitation extremes during 2006 2100 donat et al 2016 postulated an intensification of the daily precipitation extremes particularly over the world s dry regions as a consequence of projected global warming it is evident from these investigations that increased global warming is going to exacerbate precipitation extremes around the world further apart from the observed data the historical climate model simulations also confirm the extreme warming and cooling trends in the past sillmann et al 2013 the coupled model intercomparison projects phase 5 cmip5 data also reveal different behaviour of cold extremes as compared to the observational estimates field et al 2012 the study also suggests that the alterations in the precipitation extremes are usually more spatially varied relative to the temperature extremes the results obtained from the climate model simulations of the historical extremes also suggest rising rainfall extremes due to growing greenhouse gas emissions min et al 2011 as the increase in temperature trend has been recorded it is expected that the heat stress might also increase moreover regional heat stress is more affected by local humidity characteristics willett and sherwood 2012 showed that even if the humidity is less in some regions more intense heat stress can be still be observed moreover knutson and ploshay 2016 suggested significant evidence of the role of global climate change in summer heat stress the mean projected warming in different representative construction pathways rcps by the end of 2099 as compared to 1986 2005 are given as 0 3 c 1 7 c rcp 2 6 1 1 c 2 6 c rcp 4 5 2 6 c 4 8 c rcp 8 5 carlos timm et al 2006 field et al 2012 the results from cmip5 simulations in general indicate a local rise in the intensity of temperature extremes with global warming seneviratne et al 2016 in previous studies the probabilistic behaviour of extreme characteristics has been studied by frei and schär 2001 groisman 1999 palmer and räisänen 2002 to examine the stochastic nature of hydro meteorological variables a univariate approach technique is best used boo et al 2006 colombo et al 1999 katz and brown 1992 however the interdependency of one variable with another exists due to the stochastic nature of the variables univariate analyses may under overestimate the risk associated with the variable and consequently extreme events moreover the univariate analysis is not able to describe the complex dependency structure of hydro meteorological extremes kao and govindaraju 2007 therefore a multivariate analysis would be more useful in analysing meteorological and hydrological extremes kao and govindaraju 2010 as such the concept of copula is popularly used to model the dependency structure of the random variables sadegh et al 2017 in the fields of hydrology and climatology the application of copula methodology has gained popularity das et al 2020 de michele et al 2005 de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 goswami et al 2018a jha et al 2019a from the past studies it is well established that to incorporate the multivariate analysis copulas are flexible tools with no assumption and are widely used bargaoui bardossy 2015 ganguli reddy 2012 jha et al 2019b leonard et al 2008 shiau 2006 zhang singh 2007 among others the objective of this study is to analyse the spatio temporal variability and the joint probability behaviour of climate extremes using a copula based approach we have used observed daily precipitation from india meteorological department imd global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd dataset for daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature and statistically downscaled dataset nex gddp for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to identify the climate hotspot regions over india in past and future respectively future vulnerability maps are also generated which will help in improving resilience towards climate risk 2 study area and data sources in the present study 24 major river basins of india are delineated based on the classification of india wris 2014 fig 1 the study is conducted for 24 river basins of india except for some parts of the indus river basin and brahmaputra river basin lying in state of jammu and kashmir and arunachal pradesh as shown in fig 1 observed daily gridded precipitation data 0 5 0 5 across all the river basins from the india meteorological department imd during 1975 2019 is used daily maximum temperature tx and daily minimum temperature tn variables 0 25 0 25 used here for period of 1975 2016 are obtained from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd for land surface modelling by terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university sheffield et al 2006 this dataset integrates reanalysis products with latest observation based datasets it is a significantly improvement over the original reanalysis variables and can be used in a broad range of hydrological climatological and ecological applications sheffield et al 2006 the outputs from gcms are used to obtain future projections under different climate scenarios and thereby play an exemplary role in the assessment of impacts of global climate change the two climate change scenarios are proposed based on radiative forcing ipcc 2014 for instance the radiative forcing under rcp4 5 will increase for the first half of the century and then stabilizes to a value of 4 5 w m2 towards the end of the century stabilized scenario whereas radiative forcing under rcp8 5 extreme scenario increases throughout the 21st century before attaining a level of 8 5 w m2 taylor et al 2012 here we use nex gddp dataset which contains downscaled outputs daily precipitation daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature of 21 cmip5 gcms simulations taylor et al 2012 at a spatial resolution of 0 250 for the period 1950 2005 retrospective run and 2006 2100 prospective run under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table 1 the dataset is generated by application of bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd technique thrasher et al 2012 using global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd provided by terrestrial hydrology research group of princeton university sheffield et al 2006 the high resolution of nex gddp dataset facilitates the climate impact studies at a finer scale of towns watersheds thrasher et al 2012 moreover jain et al 2019 found that this dataset shows a substantial improvement over cmip5 and cordex dataset in seasonal and daily precipitation across india and also provides a realistic representation of climate extremes and henceforth can be used as a potential dataset for impact assessment studies at a regional scale the detailed information about the dataset can be obtained at https nex nasa gov nex projects 1356 in the present study we use daily precipitation daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature of 21 gcms from nex gddp dataset daily precipitation data are resampled using bilinear interpolation to 0 50 to match with observed daily precipitation dataset daily minimum temperature and daily maximum temperature are used at 0 250 matching with gmfd temperature data 1975 2016 3 methods the assessment of climate extremes is performed using univariate analysis and a bivariate probabilistic model as shown in fig 2 here the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 is utilized to detect statistically significant trends in time series of climate extreme indices and a non parametric test sen s slope is used to estimate the magnitude of this trend sen 1968 especially the bivariate analysis is carried out using the copula method which is an advanced and flexible tool to assess inherent probabilistic properties of climate extremes leonard et al 2008 salvadori and de michele 2004 xu et al 2020 zhang and singh 2007 moreover the reliability ensemble averaging rea technique is used to develop a multi model ensemble for each climate extreme indices the major building blocks of the proposed methodology i e climate extreme indices rea technique and copula method are explained in detail in the following sections 3 1 extreme climate indices extreme climate indices can describe the variation in intensity frequency and duration of precipitation events etccdi n d four extreme precipitation indices including number of very heavy precipitation days r20 total amount of extreme precipitation r95p consecutive wet days cwd and consecutive dry days cdd are selected to represent the precipitation extremes eight temperature indices including annual maximum tx txx annual maximum tn tnx hot days tx90p hot nights tn90p annual minimum tx txn annual minimum tn tnn cold days tx10p and cold nights tn10p are selected to describe temperature extremes the base period for calculation of percentile based precipitation and temperature extreme indices is 1989 2019 and 1985 2016 respectively the definition and unit of extreme indices are presented in table 2 based on the motivation of the study the joint probabilistic characteristics of ten combinations of extreme indices are selected the combinations associated with precipitation extremes are represented as r20 r95p cwd r95p r20 cdd cdd cwd and cdd r95p and the combinations related with temperature extremes are represented as txx tnn tn90p tx90p tx10p tn10p tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p the selected different combinations of extreme climatic indices in the present study represent different climate conditions the combinations representing precipitation extremes are formed to examine the dependence structure of drying and wetting conditions of different river basins to analyse the joint probability of very heavy precipitation and frequency of extreme precipitation r20 r95p is used for evaluation of the probability of concurrence of long wet periods with extreme precipitation frequency within a year cwd r95p combinations is constructed r20 cdd is used to reflect the concurrence changes in the very heavy precipitation and long dry periods and cdd cwd is chosen to examine the joint behaviour of long dry and wet periods within a year lastly to evaluate the probability of concurrence of long dry periods with extreme precipitation frequency within a year cdd r95p combination is used in general tn90p tx90p represents co occurrence of two hot extremes extreme number of hot days and nights in summer season in a year tx10p tn10p describes the co occurrence of two cold extremes extreme number of cold days and nights in winter season in a single year moreover txx tnn tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p represents co occurrence of a hot and a cold extreme within a single year txx tnn signifies the joint behaviour of txx hottest day in summer season and tnn coldest night in winter season and tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p are used to reflect the concurrence of extreme number of hot and cold days nights respectively in a year 3 2 reliability ensemble averaging rea uncertainties in the climate model outputs should be analysed through criteria based on the historical model performance wilby 2010 in this case reliability ensemble averaging rea is adopted to quantify model uncertainty since this method is used in precipitation and temperature for modelling uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple models ghosh and mujumdar 2009 giorgi and mearns 2002 while projecting for the future rea measures the multimodal uncertainty in the form of model performance and model convergence and assigns a weight to each model based on their ability to capture the observed climate and convergence of the simulated changes across gcms furthermore rea allows for a reduction in uncertainty range in the simulated series by minimizing the influence of outlier and poorly performing models this enables measurement of the reliability of the simulated series by fulfilling the model performance and convergence criteria following are the steps performed to quantify multi model uncertainty using rea i to evaluate the performance criteria root mean square error rmse is used for all the selected extreme indices for instance a time series of an extreme index say r95p is divided into 10 equal intervals of a cumulative distribution function cdf for the observed as well as for all the gcms during the historical period 1975 2005 ii then rmse is computed based on the values at each cdf points for all the gcms as compared to the observed values of r95p the inverse of rmse is used as weight proportionality for all the different gcms the higher weight suggests better performance of the particular gcm and vice versa iii the weights evaluated during the model performance criteria are considered as the initial weights to evaluate the performance criteria iv next the weighted mean cdf is computed by multiplying the future simulated values for r95p at each equal interval of the cdf and the weights separately for each gcm this weighted mean cdf is now considered as a reference and the rmse is computed with respect to the reference v subsequently step i is repeated the weights obtained for all the gcms are used in the next iteration to set the reference i e the weighted mean cdf vi the steps from iv to v are repeated until the weights obtained at n th iteration is same as the weights at n 1 th iteration the final weights for all the selected gcms are obtained from the convergence criteria it is worth mentioning that the process is performed over all the grid points and for all the selected climate extreme indices the convergence final weight for each gcm is multiplied with the particular extreme index using the weights obtained and the weighted ensemble of all the gcms for the index is considered for further analysis the analysis is performed for the periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 separately under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for each grid point and extreme indices for instance rea analysis at a grid point 32 00 lat 76 50 long for r95p is presented in table 3 moreover the evaluation of mean climate extreme indices obtained from multi model rea ensemble and observed datasets for the period 1975 2005 is also carried out the results of the comparison indicate that precipitation extreme indices r20 r95p cwd and cdd from ensemble show a good correlation with observed data ranging from 0 79 to 0 87 fig s13 and mean of temperature extreme indices txx tnx txn and tnn also show a good correlation which ranges from 0 98 to 0 99 fig s14 overall the performance of the multi model ensemble illustrates its substantial capability to simulate climate extreme indices moreover to quantify the uncertainty range 95 confidence interval here we followed the approach proposed by giorgi and mearns 2002 for ensemble mean and rea method see text s1 for details the uncertainty follows the spatial distribution of mean climate extreme indices i e lower the magnitude lower the uncertainty however it increases towards the end of the century 2065 2095 fig s15 to fig s21 across the country for both precipitation and temperature extreme indices corroborating with global scale findings from solomon et al 2007 the results reveal that uncertainty from ensemble mean is more than rea method across the country for future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for each climate extreme indices the comparison of uncertainty obtained from ensemble mean and rea method clearly indicates that rea method has relatively less inherent uncertainty for climate extremes indices in future this indicates the effectiveness of rea approach over traditional ensemble mean method furthermore the country average for uncertainty of mean precipitation extreme indices r20 cdd cwd obtained from rea method for future includes 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is 2 37 10 98 4 97 days respectively similarly country average for temperature extreme indices txx tnx txn tnn is 0 83 1 25 1 17 and 1 31 c respectively for period wise and scenario wise details see fig s15 to fig s21 and table s1 consequently the simulations from these multi models have been used to study the behaviour of climate extreme in future under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 3 copula based probabilistic model a major limitation of univariate analysis is that it might under overestimate the risk associated with extreme events furthermore the univariate analysis of extremes does not take into account the complex dependence of hydro meteorological extreme events kao and govindaraju 2007 it is crucial in the analysis of complex extreme events such as joint occurrence of two different kinds of extremes i e the magnitude of high precipitation and frequency of high precipitation therefore a multivariate approach would be more valuable for the assessment of such climate extremes generally used multivariate distributions are the extensions of univariate ones and suffer from many limitations salvadori and de michele 2004 shiau 2006 a crucial limitation of these traditional approaches is their inability to construct multivariate distributions from different types of marginals to rectify this marginals are modified to become normally or independently distributed which can considerably compromise the accuracy of the approach furthermore these methods also assume the stationarity property of involved variables which does not hold good in the context of climate studies and must be incorporated while studying extreme hydrologic events bracken et al 2018 das umamahesh 2017 khaliq et al 2006 these limitations can be tackled by incorporating the copula approach in multivariate analysis copula is an effective tool to model multivariate distribution among random variables and is independent of individual probabilistic specifications sklar 1959a this method is advantageous in modelling the joint distributions as the dependence structure is modelled independently of the marginal distributions several studies support the idea that copulas provide a robust methodology for studying hydro climatic events which can be referred for detailed information bracken et al 2018 goswami et al 2018b de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 gomez et al 2017 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 kao and govindaraju 2010 zhang et al 2013 3 3 1 marginal probability distribution the selection of a suitable marginal distribution is a vital step before formulating the joint probabilistic models in this study the selection of the marginal distributions is done based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test statistics massey 1951 performed over a set of selected theoretical distributions gumbel gamma exponential weibull and log normal distributions the goodness of fit is measured in terms of the maximum difference between the theoretical cumulative distribution functions cdfs and corresponding empirical cdfs at a significance level of 5 to assess the appropriate distribution for each index 3 3 2 background of copulas copulas are multi variate mathematical functions becoming popular due to the inherent ability to join or couple more than one time independent variable nelsen 2007 the copula functions can model the multi variate distributions efficiently separating the effect of involved marginals sadegh et al 2017 sklar 1959b proposed the term copula and provided the background of copula based analysis in statistical and mathematical context in the famous theorem named after him the major benefit of using copula in formulating the multivariate distribution lies in the fact that the formulation of multivariate distribution is simplified by incorporating the correlation of the random variables when the marginal distributions are given shiau et al 2007 since the parameters of marginal distributions are not used in defining the dependence structure therefore copula methodology adds versatility to the modelling of the dependency structure of two or more variables the joint probability distribution of two correlated variables x and y having marginal distributions f x x p x x and f y y p y y respectively can be defined as f x y x y p x x y y the copula association between these two marginals can be expressed as 1 f x y x y c f x x f y y the copula function c is unique if f and g are continuous further with the continuous marginal distribution f and g having u f x and v f y the associated copula can be established in terms of density function of copula c as 2 c u v 2 c u v u v in the present paper we have focused on bivariate copulas as bivariate analysis is commonly performed in hydro climatological literature though number of dimensions are limited in some copula families others can be extended to higher dimensions the readers are advised to refer joe 2014 and nelsen 2007 for detailed information regarding different copulas and their inherent properties moreover the copulas are characterised into different families among which elliptical and archimedean families are commonly used to study the joint behaviour of hydro climatic extremes miao et al 2016 in the present analysis the copula type namely frank copula from archimedean family gaussian copula from elliptical family and bivariate plackett family have been employed see details in table 4 the benefits of selecting the above copulas are i frank and plackett enable to incorporate variety of marginal processes chiou and tsay 2008 ii with single parameter the methodology to model the joint probability using the selected copulas in the present study is simple and flexible ganguli and reddy 2014 iii the selected copulas are capable of modelling the joint dependence of positively as well as negatively correlated variables zhang and singh 2007 the kendall tau correlation is used as the scale free measure of dependence to construct the corresponding copula function c for further information about copulas used in the study can be found in bouyé et al 2000 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 palaro and hotta 2006 trivedi and zimmer 2005 furthermore to find out the appropriate copula and the copula parameter akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 are used and can be defined as 3 aic 2 k 2 l 4 bic ln n k 2 l where kisthe number of parameters ni s the sample size and listhe maximum likelihood estimates for the copula the aic as a measure of goodness of fit incorporates both complexity of the model and also minimizes the error residuals the error residuals are independent and identically distributed with gaussian assumption and centered around zero moreover aic by adding penalty term based on the number of parameters minimizes the problem of over conditioning sadegh et al 2017 lower the aic and bic values better is the model fit additionally the aic and bic have proven to be very efficient measure of the relative quality of copula based bivariate probabilistic models in previous works such as cong and brady 2012 lasmar and berthoumieu 2014 3 3 3 bivariate joint return period generally the return period is characterised as the mean interarrival occurrence duration between two events in hydrology the return period concept is used to compute the return level corresponding to the return period for hydrological design purposes the frequency of co occurrence of extremes of any combinations of two climate extreme indices within the same year can be understood by examination of the bivariate joint return period in this study joint return period jrp for a combination extreme has been calculate using the following method salvadori and de michele 2004 5 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 1 f x x f y y f x y x y t x x y y is the jrp when x and y exceed certain thresholds for instance if x t and y t are t year marginal values of x and y respectively t x x t y y t has been denoted as t x y t in the paper for example t c d d c w d 10 signifies the return period of an extreme event when the combination cdd cwd exceeds their 10 year marginal values the joint return period jrp for each grid point is calculated for past precipitation extremes 1989 2019 and temperature extremes 1985 2016 and future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 3 3 4 change rate in joint return period the percentage change in joint return period cjrp for the future with respect to past 1989 2019 is represented as cjrp the change rate in joint return period jrp for each grid point was evaluated for future periods 6 cjrp t x y future t t x y past t t x y past t 100 where t x y future t t x y t for future periods t x y past t t x y t for past based on observed data cjrp change in joint return period 4 results 4 1 univariate assessment of climate extreme indices before the investigation of joint probabilistic behaviour of climate extremes a preliminary anaysis of precipitation and temperature extreme indices is carried out for the past 1989 2019 and 1985 2016 respectively and future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using the mean trend statstics using non parametric mann kendall test at 95 level of significance and sen s slope statistics based on z statistics the trends are classified as increasing 0 z 1 96 significantly increasing z 1 96 decreasing 1 96 z 0 and significantly decreasing z 1 96 and the magnitude of trend is evaluated using sen s slope 4 1 1 extreme precipitation indices in general r20 across the past and future is found to be high 20 days for northeast region and western ghats and low 1 5 days for the western region fig s1a during 1989 2019 r20 shows both decreasing ganga basin north east region godavari basin tapi basin and upper parts of indus basin and increasing parts of southern india central eastern and western region trends however it encompass a positive trend mostly between 0 and 0 25 days year in major segments of country in future fig s1b s1c under rcp4 5 it shows an increasing trend predominantly across the country in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 whereas some parts of western ghats central eastern and central region also attain significantly increasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 it follows a similar pattern increasing trend across the country along with an substantial increase in spatial extent of regions encompassing significantly increasing trend during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 most parts of peninsular india show a significantly increasing trend and during 2065 2095 north eastern and northern region also show a significantly increasing trend generally r95p attain a higher magnitude 500 mm in western ghats and northeastern region whereas western region encompass a lower magnitude 25 250 mm fig s2a during 1989 2019 around 50 of the country comprising of parts of central eastern western southernmost and central region show a positive trend mostly between 0 4 mm year fig s2b s2c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 it predominantly shows an increasing trend mostly between 0 4 mm year and significantly increasing trend mostly between 4 mm year across the country in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 respectively consequently cwd is generally high 25 days for western ghats northeast region and low 3 10 days for western region fig s3a and the overall trend in cwd across the country is decreasing mostly between 0 20 and 0 days year in the past whereas parts of indus river basin arid western region and south western region of india show an increasing mostly between 0 and 0 20 days year trend fig s3b s3c under rcp4 5 it shows an increasing trend predominantly across the country in future whereas a few parts of upper ganga river basin also encompass a critically increasing trend during 2025 2055 under rcp8 5 an increasing trend is predominant across the country in future whereas parts of central central eastern and northeastern region show a decreasing trend moreover some parts of southernmost india encompass a critically increasing trend towards the end of century 2065 2095 subsequently cdd is mostly high 200 days in western region and low 34 100 days in parts of western ghats northernmost southernmost central eastern and northeastern region fig s4a during 1989 2019 cdd shows a general increasing trend mostly between 0 and 1 days year across the country however upper indus basin parts of southermost region and western ghats show a decreasing trend mostly between 1 to 0 days year fig s4b s4c under rcp4 5 the overall trend is decreasing across the country in future whereas northeastern region and parts of cental region and northernmost region show a increasing trend during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 respectively under rcp8 5 during 2025 2055 it shows an overall increasing trend whereas northernmost westernmost regions and southernmost region encompass a decreasing trend moreover during 2065 2095 it shows a overall decreasing trend whereas parts of southernmost region and north eastern region encompass a increasing trend 4 1 2 extreme temperature indices in this section hot extreme txx tnx tx90p tn90p and cold extremes indices txn tnn tx10p tn10p are discussed for past and future generally txx across past and future is found to be high 43 c for western ghats southernmost north eastern some parts of northern region and low 43 c in several parts of country covering central western central eastern region fig s5 during 1985 2016 txx shows a decreasing trend mostly 1 to 0 c decade across major segment of country whereas it encompasses a positive trend in future under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during 2025 2055 it shows a significantly increasing trend with the magnitude of trend of 0 to 0 50 c decade mostly across the country and during 2065

trend across the country with the rate of 5 to 10 decade in western ghats north east western some parts of northern region and 0 5 decade in remaining region during 2065 2095 tx90p shows a significantly increasing increasing trend 0 5 decade except some parts of central eastern region moreover under rcp8 5 tx90p shows a significantly increasing trend mostly 5 to 10 decade for the period 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 across the country the spatial pattern of mean trend and sen s slope of tn90p number of warm nights are similar to tx90p it also shows a positive trend in the past and future predominantly in the country during 1985 2016 tn90p ranges from 10 to 20 with an increasing significantly increasing trend 0 5 decade predominantly across the country except western region and some parts of ne showing a decreasing trend mostly 0 50 fig s8 under rcp4 5 during 2025 2055 it shows a significantly increasing trend with a rate 0 to 5 decade in central western central eastern ganga river basin and 5 to 10 decade in some parts of northern north east southern region during 2065 2095 it indicates a significantly increasing trend 0 5 decade except some parts of ganga river basin under rcp8 5 during 2025 2055 tn90p shows a significantly increasing trend across the country with a rate of 5 to 10 decade in central western ganga river basin and 10 decade in some parts of northern north east southern region central eastern moreover during 2065 2095 it shows a significantly increasing trend mostly 5 to 10 decade across the country generally txn is found to be lower 24 c in northern central western north eastern central eastern regions and higher 24 c in southern region fig s9 during 1985 2016 txn shows an increasing trend 0 to 0 50 c decade across major portion of country additionally a significantly increasing trend 0 50 c decade is also detected for some parts of northern ganga basin and north east under rcp4 5 txn shows a significantly increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade in future in 2025 2055 and further shows an increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade towards 2065 2095 predominantly across the country on the other hand a few parts of central eastern india also indicate a decreasing trend 0 25 to 0 c decade during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 it shows a significantly increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade in 2025 2055 across country during 2065 2095 it shows a significantly increasing trend throughout the country with a rate of 0 50 c decade in northern central western north eastern central eastern regions and with 0 0 50 c decade in remaining parts of country it can be inferred from here that regions with lower txn show a higher increasing rate than other regions during 2065 2095 in the extreme rcp8 5 scenario generally tnn is lower 11 c in majority portion of country except southern region fig s10 during 1985 2016 it shows an increasing trend 0 to 0 50 c decade across indus basin western southern most central eastern region and a

increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade towards 2065 2095 across the country and a few parts of central eastern india show a decreasing trend 0 50 to 0 c decade during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 tnn indicates a significantly increasing trend 0 50 c decade in 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 mostly across country based upon sen s slope of tnn mostly 0 50 c decade and txn mostly 0 50 c decade under rcp8 5 it is found that tnn change rate is greater than txx change rate which might indicate that nights will get hotter at a greater pace than days in winter season mainly across the country additionally during 1985 2016 tx10p attains mean value of 10 with a decreasing significantly decreasing trend 1 decade mostly across the country and it continues to show a negative trend in future fig s11 under both rcp4 5

it shows a significantly decreasing trend mostly 0 50 to 1 decade and during 2065 2095 it follows a decreasing trend mostly 0 50 to 1 decade under rcp8 5 it follows a significantly decreasing trend mostly 0 50 to 1 decade in 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 mostly across country 4 2 observed joint return period to comprehensively understand the change in probabilistic behaviour of a joint climate extremes precipitation and temperature extreme from past to the future firstly spatial distribution of observed jrp has been investigated for 10 25 50 100 year return period it has been found that the spatial pattern of observed jrp corresponding to different return periods resemble each other throughout india for every combination extreme therefore we have taken into consideration jrp at 10 year return period for spatio temporal assessment of the vulnerability towards climate extremes 4 2 1 precipitation extremes 1989 2019 the jrp of r20 r95p cwd r95p represents the potential risk of region towards floods and r20 cdd cdd cwd cdd r95p identifies the vulnerability of river basins towards co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year the terms floods and droughts has been used to indicate the possible implications of the precipitation extreme not necessarily the traditional definitions of floods and droughts the observed jrp at 10 year return period for the combination extreme r20 r95 t10 r20 r95 ranges from 12 to 70 years the regions acquiring lower t10 r20 r95 have a higher probability of occurrence of intense precipitation events representing higher susceptibility to floods the t10 r20 r95 suggests that north western id1 north eastern ids 2b 21 22 and southern region ids 4 5 17 18 19 are prone to floods fig 3 a t10 cwd r95p ranges from 22 to 661 years the regions exhibiting lower t10 cwd r95p are more likely to face intense wet spells and intense precipitation events which implies these regions bear greater risk to floods the regions having higher proneness towards floods pertaining to t10 cwd r95p shows a similar spatial pattern as t10 r20 r95 while excluding north eastern region and including western ghats id14 and westernmost regions id20 fig 3b t10 r20 cdd ranges from 25 to 5400 years the regions with lower t10 r20 cdd are more likely to face severe precipitation and severe dry spells in a single year and thus encounter a greater risk for the co occurrence of floods and droughts within the same year the t10 r20 cdd suggest that southern id4 and central eastern ids 6 7 8 15 region of the country have high susceptibility towards the co occurrence of floods and droughts fig 3c t10 cdd r95 ranges from 34 to 4000 years the regions with lower t10 cdd r95p have a higher possibility of co occurrence of intense dry spells and intense precipitation events within the same year this implies that the regions acquiring lower t10 cdd r95p withstand a greater risk of co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year the spatial pattern of the regions subjected to greater risk towards the occurrence of such extreme events according to t10 cdd r95p is found to be similar to t10 r20 cdd while also including the most parts of ganga basin fig 3e t10 cdd cwd ranges from 30 to 2500 years the regions acquiring lower t10 cdd cwd are more likely to face intense dry and intense wet spells within the same year which indicates the higher susceptibility of these regions towards co occurrence of floods and droughts t10 cdd cwd indicates that most parts of ganga basin north eastern ids 2c 21 western ids 10 11 20 and central ids 3 12 13 region are at risk towards the occurrence of such extreme events fig 3d 4 2 2 temperature extremes 1985 2016 t10 txx tnn signifies the co occurrence of 10 year return levels of txx hottest day in summer season and tnn coldest night in winter season within a single year the regions encompass low t10 txx tnn predominantly lies in indus river basin western central and some parts of central eastern region fig 4 t10 tn90p tx90p indicates concurrence of 10 year return levels of tn90p and tx90p within a single year which signifies the joint occurrence of extreme number of hot days and nights summer season t10 tn90p tx90p shows low magnitude mostly in southern and some parts of northern region t10 tn10p tx10p denotes the co occurrence of 10 year return levels of tx10p and tn10p within a single year which indicates the joint occurrence of extreme number of cold days and nights winter season it indicates that a large portion of country except few parts of central eastern southern and western region is vulnerable to such climatic extreme t10 tx10p tx90p denotes the concurrence of 10 year return levels of tx10p and tx90p within a single year which indicates the joint occurrence of extreme number of hot days summer season and cold days winter season t10 tx10p tx90p shows that only north eastern and some parts of southern region are vulnerable towards occurrence such an extreme t10 tn10p tn90p signifies the joint occurrence of 10 year return levels of tn10p and tn90p within a single year which indicates the co occurrence of extreme number of warm nights summer season and cold nights winter season t10 tn10p tn90p indicates that such event is highly unlikely return period 500 years to occur across the country except few parts of central india 4 3 change in joint return period cjrp in future the spatial and temporal distribution of change in joint return period can provide valuable insights on the variation of the joint probabilistic behaviour of climate extremes during the future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 with respect to the past 1989 2019 a decrease in the magnitude of jrp leads to negative cjrp which implies that the risk towards the occurrence of climate extremes would increase in future and the region would become more vulnerable relative to the past here we classify the cjrp into four categories as critically decreasing 50 decreasing 50 to 0 increasing 0 50 and critically increasing 50 trend in jrp 4 3 1 precipitation extremes under rcp4 5 during 2025 2055 t10 r20 r95 shows a negative trend decreasing critically

remains similar during 2065 2095 where a large portion of 11 out of 24 river basins show a negative trend fig 5b mostly lying in north eastern ids 2b 2c 21 22 central ids 3 13 central eastern ids 6 7

eastern ids 6 7 15 north eastern ids 2b 2c 21 22 southernmost ids 9 and western region id11 furthermore the spatial extent of regions with negative trend augments during 2065 2095 where a large portion of 12 out of 24 river basins show a negative trend mostly lying in central ids 3 11 central eastern ids 6 7 8 15 north eastern ids 22 western ids 11 20 and southern region ids 4 9 17 based upon magnitude of change in t10 cwd r95p the river basins in central tapi central eastern brahmani and baitarni subarnarekha and north eastern region mrfm are found to be highly sensitive to floods throughout the mid century and end of 21st century during both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 under rcp4 5 in the mid century t10 r20 cdd encompass a negative trend in major portion of 3 out of 24 river basins

during 2025 2055 t10 r20 cdd shows a decreasing critically decreasing trend in major portion of the country a large segment of 16 out of 24 river basins whereas during 2065 2095 this spatial extent decreases covering a large portion of 10 out of 24 river basins mostly lying in western id20 north western id1 southern ids 5 9 16 17 18 and north eastern region id 2b 2c 22 based upon change in t10 r20 cdd under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 indus in north western region and efrgkb and efrpcb basins in southern region are found to be highly sensitive to co occurrence of floods and droughts throughout the mid century and end of 21st century under rcp4 5 during 2025 2055 t10 cdd cwd shows a negative trend in major parts of 6 out of 24 river basins predominantly lying in southern ids 5 9 16 18 central eastern id15 and north eastern region id21 fig 5d and during 2055 2095 t10 cdd cwd shows a negative trend in large parts of 15 out of 24 basins covering the entire country except parts of western region under rcp8 5 in the mid century a major portion of 7 out of 24 basins encompass a negative trend in t10 cdd cwd mostly lying in southern ids 5 9 16 18 19 central id3 and northwest region id1 whereas towards the end of 21st century a large portion of 13 out of 24 basins show a negative trend in t10 cdd cwd in most parts of country except ganga river basin and parts of central and central eastern region based upon change in t10 cdd cwd the river basins of southern region pennar cauvery efrpcb are found to be highly sensitive under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095

and for the period 2065 2095 the spatial extent of the region exhibiting increased risk towards co occurrence of floods and droughts pertaining to t10 cdd r95 plummets relative to 2025 2055 but covers a major portion of 9 out of 24 river basins mostly lying in north western id1 north eastern id 2b southern 5 9 16 17 18 and western region ids 11 20 based on change in t10 cdd r95 the brahmaputra

during the period 2025 2055 whole country show a negative trend predominantly critical decreasing trend in t10 txx tnn with respect to joint return period for 1985 2016 fig 6 however during the period 2065 2095 the regions showing a negative trend mostly decreasing trend decreases which includes the parts of western central western ghats central central eastern lower ganga basin north east region under rcp8 5 the major portion of country show a critical decreasing trend for the period 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 for the combination extreme tn90p and tx90p change in t10 tn90p tx90p in future is similar as t10 txx tnn under rcp4 5 for period 2025 2055 it follows a negative trend decreasing critical decreasing across the country however for period 2065 2095 the regions encompassing negative trend mostly decreasing decreases slightly excluding few parts of central eastern central upper ganga basin and north eastern region under rcp8 5 it indicates a negative trend mostly critical decreasing across the whole country for 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 for the period 2025 2055 t10 tn10p tx10p shows decreasing trend mostly across the country except western parts of central eastern north east and ganga river basin however under rcp8 5 for the same period major portion of country encompass a decreasing trend on the other hand during 2065 2095 major parts of country show a positive trend mostly critical increasing t10 tx10p tx90p mostly shows critical increasing trend during 2025 2055 under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across the country however during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 the regions such as western northern central central eastern and a major portion of ganga river basin show a critically decreasing trend moreover during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 the major portion of country encompass a critically increasing trend change in t10 tn10p tn90p show a similar spatial pattern as t10 tx10p tx90p for period 2025 2055 under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with major portion of country encompassing a critically increasing trend however it shows a negative trend for the period 2065 2095 in various parts of country under rcp4 5 during the period 2065 2095 major segment of country shows a critically decreasing trend whereas under rcp8 5 a large portion of country except central and central eastern region show a negative trend mostly critically decreasing 5 discussion despite growing concerns that climatic extremes would tend to increase and intensify in magnitude in the future beniston et al 2007 houghton et al 2001 ipcc 2007 regional investigations of the likelihood of the climate extremes are scarce in india here we study twelve climate extreme indices four precipitation indices and eight temperature indices capturing extreme climatic events from different perspectives firstly a preliminary analysis of climate extreme indices is carried out for past and future periods followed by quantification of joint return period of climatic extremes in this study joint return period of climatic extremes is evaluated by the application of a bivariate copula to find the joint dependence between different climate extreme indices during the historical period precipitation 1989 2019 temperature 1985 2016 and future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across india this enabled us to assess the probable changes in joint return period relative to the observed joint return period 1989 2019 for ten combinations five combinations representing precipitation and temperature extremes each from the climate extreme indices during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 here we found that r20 and r95p are generally high 20 days 500 mm for northeast region and western ghats and low 1 5 days 25 250 mm for the western region during 1989 2019 the trends in r20 and r95p show similar spatial pattern around 50 of the country comprising of parts of central eastern western southern and central region show a positive trend mostly between 0 4 mm year in the future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 r20 and r95p show an increasing trend in major segments of country under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in india predominantly precipitation occurs in monsoon season june to september the above findings are coherent with the studies conducted for monsoon season kumar et al 2011 rao et al 2014 revadekar et al 2011 where they found that there may be a significant increase in frequency of very heavy precipitation days and intensity of precipitation in the future moreover the trends in r95p and r10 obtained by rao et al 2014 for future corroborate with the trends in r95p and r20 evaluated in the present study respectively consequently cwd is generally high 25 days for western ghats northeast region and low 3 10 days for western region and the overall trend in cwd across the country is decreasing in the past and a large portion of the country exhibit an increasing trend in the future subsequently cdd is found mostly high 200 days in western region and low 34 100 days in parts of western ghats northernmost southernmost central eastern and northeastern region cdd shows a general increasing trend mostly between 0 and 1 days year and adecreasing trend in the past 1989 2019 and future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 in major segments of country which is coherent with the findings by rao et al 2014 for monsoon season further the identification of climatic hotspot regions in terms of precipitation extremes is carried out based upon t10 during 1989 2019 into regions prone to floods and co occurrence of floods and droughts the regions which encompass lower t10 r20 r95 and t10 cwd r95p have a higher likelihood of extreme precipitation events and are characterized as regions susceptible to floods the results indicate that north western indus north eastern brahmaputra mrfb mrfm southern krishna cauvery efrkpb efrpcb efrscb western ghats wfrst and westernmost regions wfkrsl are highly prone towards floods the change in t10 r20 r95p and t10 cwd r95p indicate that the river basins in western sabarmati central tapi central eastern brahmani and baitarni subarnarekha and north eastern region mrfm show increased risk towards floods in future the regions with lower t10 r20 cdd t10 cdd cwd and t10 cdd r95 have a greater risk of co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year and further classified as regions at risk towards co occurrence of floods and droughts the results show that a large portion of the country is prone towards co occurrence of floods and droughts which includes most parts of ganga basin southern krishna central eastern subarnarekha brahmani and baitarni mahanadi efrmgb north eastern barak and others mrfb western mahi sabarmati wfkrsl and central region narmada tapi godavari the change in t10 r20 cdd t10 cdd cwd and t10 cdd r95p indicate river basins of southern region pennar cauvery efrpcb efrgkb north eastern region brahmaputra and north western region indus attain increased risk towards co occurrence of floods and droughts in future moreover it can be concluded from above discussion that many river basins which were less susceptible towards precipitation extremes during 1989 2019 would become vulnerable in the future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under the changing climate generally the results of univariate analysis of temperature extremes provide evidence of the increase in warm extremes tnx tx90p tn90p and increase in annual maximum day txn during summer and annual maximum night temperature tnn during winter season the results indicate a decrease in number of cold days tx10p and nights tn10p during 1985 2016 the findings of temperature extreme indices during 1985 2016 mostly corroborate with previous studies from india kumar et al 2017 panda et al 2014 asia caesar et al 2011 and also consistent with studies at the global scale alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013 field et al 2012 overall txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn are significantly increasing in future except increasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 predominantly across the country however tx10p and tn10p show a significantly decreasing in future except decreasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 across the country it can be inferred that number of hot days nights are projected to increase and number of cold days nights in a year would decrease in future in india which is mostly consistent with the previous studies kumar et al 2013 2020 the bivariate analysis of temperature extremes shows that t10 txx tnn is low in indus river basin western central and some parts of central eastern region during 1985 2016 and it shows an overall negative trend in future across the country t10 tn90p tx90p shows low magnitude mostly in southern and some parts of northern region during 1985 2016 whereas it also predominantly follows a negative trend in future across the country this suggests that along with the projected increase in hot days nights the probability of co occurrence of extreme number of hot days and nights in a single will also increase in future during 1985 2016 t10 tn10p tx10p illustrates that a large portion of country is vulnerable to such an extreme moreover it mostly shows a increasing and decreasing for 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively throughout the country this indicates that with the projected decrease in number of cold days nights the possibility of co occurrence of extreme number of cold days and nights will also decrease towards the end of century the magnitude of t10 tx10p tx90p and t10 tn10p tn90p is mostly more than 100 years across the country during 1985 2016 therefore the occurrence of such climate extremes is highly unlikely additionally t10 tx10p tx90p and t10 tn10p tn90p show a critically decreasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 mostly across the country and both show a critically increasing trend during 2025 2055 under rcp4 5 across the country 6 conclusion recent evidence suggests that changing climate is significantly influencing the hydrological cycle and consequently affecting behaviour of climate extremes such regional investigations about changing climate extremes are scarce in india and the present study is set out to fulfill this gap here a comprehensive assessment of climate extremes using an integrated statistical and probabilistic approach across india for past and future is carried out the copula method is employed to examine the bivariate characteristics of different climate extreme indices the datasets used to conduct the analysis for past are observed daily precipitation 1989 2019 from india meteorological department imd daily temperature from global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd 1985 2016 and the future examination is carried out using nex gddp nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections dataset which contains downscaled meteorological outputs of 21 cmip5 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario consequently multi model ensembles for the climate extreme indices from this dataset are developed using reliability ensemble averaging rea technique which are utilized to evaluate the climate extremes in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results obtained indicate that r20 r95p and cwd attain an increasing trend and cdd mostly shows a decreasing trend in major segments of the country in future based upon the 10 year joint return periods 1989 2019 of precipitation extreme combinations it is found that parts of north western north eastern southern western region and western ghats are highly prone to floods and a large portion of the country is vulnerable towards co occurrence of floods and droughts moreover the study shows that many regions with less vulnerability towards precipitation extremes would become more vulnerable in future furthermore txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn are found to be significantly increasing in future except increasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 predominantly across the country and tx10p and tn10p follow a significantly decreasing trend in future across the except exhibiting a decreasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 throughout the country with the projected increase in hot days nights the frequency of concurrence of extreme number of hot days tx90p and nights tn90p within a year would increase in future across the country the present study about the probabilistic evaluation of climate extremes using copula improves our understanding of the extremes in the changing climate and provides valuable additional information for the development of disaster mitigation strategies in india a limitation of the study is that climate observations for the evaluation of joint return period of climate extremes are analysed under the assumption of a stationary climate the study considers two climate scenarios evaluation of joint return period for climate extremes for other climate scenarios may also be essential to study in future works future works on the similar aspect can emphasize upon utilization of higher dimensional copula to find the dependence between occurrences of

4620,climate change significantly influences the global hydrological cycle and consequently affects climatic extremes therefore the present study focuses upon the varying patterns of climate extremes across india for past and future here a comprehensive methodological framework incorporating univariate and joint probabilistic analysis using copulas has been proposed to study the climate extremes moreover multi model ensembles of climate extreme indices are developed using reliability ensemble averaging rea technique for reducing uncertainty in projecting future climate extremes the datasets used are daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature for past 1975 2019 and future 2025 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario a preliminary assessment of climate extremes indicates that r20 r95p consecutive wet days cwd txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn show a positive trend predominantly across india in future the bivariate assessment of precipitation extreme indices for the period 1989 2019 suggests that parts of north western north eastern southern western region and western ghats are highly prone to floods and a large portion of country is vulnerable towards co occurrence of floods and droughts moreover integrated assessment of extreme number of hot days tx90p and nights tn90p indicate that along with the projected increase in hot days nights the frequency of their concurrence in a year is likely to increase in future over the country the present study provides useful information on the regional distribution of climate extremes and can further contribute to facilitate an effective adaptation strategy keywords climate change copula india joint return period precipitation extremes temperature extremes 1 introduction persistent extreme weather events namely droughts floods heatwaves can significantly alter natural ecosystems and impose enormous societal challenges easterling et al 2000 mann et al 2017 sisco et al 2017 trenberth et al 2014 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased substantially since the pre industrial era which has led to the warming of the earth s atmosphere karl and trenberth 2003 consequently with constant relative humidity the moisture content in the atmosphere roughly increases by 6 7 k 1 in the lower tropospheric temperature willett et al 2007 thereby influencing the intensity and occurrence of extreme precipitation over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 also it is expected that the global annual surface temperature is likely to increase by 1 4 5 8 c at the end of the twenty first century and consequently the occurrence and intensity of future extreme events will be intensified beniston et al 2007 ipcc 2007 in recent years increasing catastrophic losses due to the adverse consequences of extreme climatic events have aroused public awareness beniston and stephenson 2004 zolina et al 2004 presently climate change is imposing huge challenges to food security and water resources of 1 2 billion population in india extreme events are now more frequent goyal and surampalli 2018 the adverse consequences of extreme events may alter the spatio temporal characteristics e g frequency intensity and duration and the distribution of water availability jha et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 sharma and goyal 2020 singh et al 2018 is threatening india s agrarian economy chattopadhyay 2010 for instance a drought event in 2016 affected 330 million people yielding an economic loss of 100 billion assocham report 2016 in india similarly 268 flood events have been reported during 1950 2015 affecting 825 million people and this is a threefold rise in the extreme precipitation events during the same period over the central part of india roxy et al 2017 it is therefore of paramount importance to investigate the future variability of extreme weather events related to precipitation as this will provide insight into probable changes in the occurrence and magnitude of floods and droughts li et al 2015 this will then guide suitable adaptation strategies and disaster mitigation policies jhong and tung 2018 the outputs from the studies based on observational data suggest in high confidence that high temperature extremes have increased and low temperature extremes have decreased after the 1950s globally field et al 2012 at the continental level the results show that such changes have occurred in most of the regions in north america europe asia and australia portmann et al 2009 the study indicates that most of the land surface areas in the world depict rising occurrences of warm nights and declining cold nights similarly the same areas show a rising occurrence of warm days and declining cold days apart from a few regions in north and south america further several studies suggest that this rise and fall in the extremes is mostly due to climate change rather than the influence of internal variability fischer et al 2012 kim et al 2016 portmann et al 2009 to address possible changes in future climate extreme events global climate models gcms are a credible tool presently gcm datasets under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 can be analysed to obtain inferences about possible future climatic changes under different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios it should be noted that the variability of extreme weather events due to climate change is highly diverse at a regional scale the occurrence of extreme events such as floods droughts heatwaves etc is not only affected by the atmospheric processes but also the hydrology and ecology of the regions reichstein et al 2013 terrado et al 2014 therefore researchers around the globe have attempted to investigate possible changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events examples include but are not limited to studies by sillmann et al 2013 and sillmann et al 2013 who analysed changes in precipitation extremes globally using an ensemble of gcms and found an increase in extreme events except over central america australia south africa and mediterranean region donat et al 2013 performed an analysis of extreme precipitation events using hadex2 model outputs and found an increase in the extreme precipitation characteristics in most parts of the world zollo et al 2016 studied extreme precipitation indices over italy using high resolution climate model outputs under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and reported that extreme events are likely to increase over italy goswami et al 2018b examined extremes of precipitation over north sikkim himalayan region using multiple gcms and the results suggest a significant increase in the trend of precipitation extremes during 2006 2100 donat et al 2016 postulated an intensification of the daily precipitation extremes particularly over the world s dry regions as a consequence of projected global warming it is evident from these investigations that increased global warming is going to exacerbate precipitation extremes around the world further apart from the observed data the historical climate model simulations also confirm the extreme warming and cooling trends in the past sillmann et al 2013 the coupled model intercomparison projects phase 5 cmip5 data also reveal different behaviour of cold extremes as compared to the observational estimates field et al 2012 the study also suggests that the alterations in the precipitation extremes are usually more spatially varied relative to the temperature extremes the results obtained from the climate model simulations of the historical extremes also suggest rising rainfall extremes due to growing greenhouse gas emissions min et al 2011 as the increase in temperature trend has been recorded it is expected that the heat stress might also increase moreover regional heat stress is more affected by local humidity characteristics willett and sherwood 2012 showed that even if the humidity is less in some regions more intense heat stress can be still be observed moreover knutson and ploshay 2016 suggested significant evidence of the role of global climate change in summer heat stress the mean projected warming in different representative construction pathways rcps by the end of 2099 as compared to 1986 2005 are given as 0 3 c 1 7 c rcp 2 6 1 1 c 2 6 c rcp 4 5 2 6 c 4 8 c rcp 8 5 carlos timm et al 2006 field et al 2012 the results from cmip5 simulations in general indicate a local rise in the intensity of temperature extremes with global warming seneviratne et al 2016 in previous studies the probabilistic behaviour of extreme characteristics has been studied by frei and schär 2001 groisman 1999 palmer and räisänen 2002 to examine the stochastic nature of hydro meteorological variables a univariate approach technique is best used boo et al 2006 colombo et al 1999 katz and brown 1992 however the interdependency of one variable with another exists due to the stochastic nature of the variables univariate analyses may under overestimate the risk associated with the variable and consequently extreme events moreover the univariate analysis is not able to describe the complex dependency structure of hydro meteorological extremes kao and govindaraju 2007 therefore a multivariate analysis would be more useful in analysing meteorological and hydrological extremes kao and govindaraju 2010 as such the concept of copula is popularly used to model the dependency structure of the random variables sadegh et al 2017 in the fields of hydrology and climatology the application of copula methodology has gained popularity das et al 2020 de michele et al 2005 de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 goswami et al 2018a jha et al 2019a from the past studies it is well established that to incorporate the multivariate analysis copulas are flexible tools with no assumption and are widely used bargaoui bardossy 2015 ganguli reddy 2012 jha et al 2019b leonard et al 2008 shiau 2006 zhang singh 2007 among others the objective of this study is to analyse the spatio temporal variability and the joint probability behaviour of climate extremes using a copula based approach we have used observed daily precipitation from india meteorological department imd global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd dataset for daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature and statistically downscaled dataset nex gddp for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to identify the climate hotspot regions over india in past and future respectively future vulnerability maps are also generated which will help in improving resilience towards climate risk 2 study area and data sources in the present study 24 major river basins of india are delineated based on the classification of india wris 2014 fig 1 the study is conducted for 24 river basins of india except for some parts of the indus river basin and brahmaputra river basin lying in state of jammu and kashmir and arunachal pradesh as shown in fig 1 observed daily gridded precipitation data 0 5 0 5 across all the river basins from the india meteorological department imd during 1975 2019 is used daily maximum temperature tx and daily minimum temperature tn variables 0 25 0 25 used here for period of 1975 2016 are obtained from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd for land surface modelling by terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university sheffield et al 2006 this dataset integrates reanalysis products with latest observation based datasets it is a significantly improvement over the original reanalysis variables and can be used in a broad range of hydrological climatological and ecological applications sheffield et al 2006 the outputs from gcms are used to obtain future projections under different climate scenarios and thereby play an exemplary role in the assessment of impacts of global climate change the two climate change scenarios are proposed based on radiative forcing ipcc 2014 for instance the radiative forcing under rcp4 5 will increase for the first half of the century and then stabilizes to a value of 4 5 w m2 towards the end of the century stabilized scenario whereas radiative forcing under rcp8 5 extreme scenario increases throughout the 21st century before attaining a level of 8 5 w m2 taylor et al 2012 here we use nex gddp dataset which contains downscaled outputs daily precipitation daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature of 21 cmip5 gcms simulations taylor et al 2012 at a spatial resolution of 0 250 for the period 1950 2005 retrospective run and 2006 2100 prospective run under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table 1 the dataset is generated by application of bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd technique thrasher et al 2012 using global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd provided by terrestrial hydrology research group of princeton university sheffield et al 2006 the high resolution of nex gddp dataset facilitates the climate impact studies at a finer scale of towns watersheds thrasher et al 2012 moreover jain et al 2019 found that this dataset shows a substantial improvement over cmip5 and cordex dataset in seasonal and daily precipitation across india and also provides a realistic representation of climate extremes and henceforth can be used as a potential dataset for impact assessment studies at a regional scale the detailed information about the dataset can be obtained at https nex nasa gov nex projects 1356 in the present study we use daily precipitation daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature of 21 gcms from nex gddp dataset daily precipitation data are resampled using bilinear interpolation to 0 50 to match with observed daily precipitation dataset daily minimum temperature and daily maximum temperature are used at 0 250 matching with gmfd temperature data 1975 2016 3 methods the assessment of climate extremes is performed using univariate analysis and a bivariate probabilistic model as shown in fig 2 here the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 is utilized to detect statistically significant trends in time series of climate extreme indices and a non parametric test sen s slope is used to estimate the magnitude of this trend sen 1968 especially the bivariate analysis is carried out using the copula method which is an advanced and flexible tool to assess inherent probabilistic properties of climate extremes leonard et al 2008 salvadori and de michele 2004 xu et al 2020 zhang and singh 2007 moreover the reliability ensemble averaging rea technique is used to develop a multi model ensemble for each climate extreme indices the major building blocks of the proposed methodology i e climate extreme indices rea technique and copula method are explained in detail in the following sections 3 1 extreme climate indices extreme climate indices can describe the variation in intensity frequency and duration of precipitation events etccdi n d four extreme precipitation indices including number of very heavy precipitation days r20 total amount of extreme precipitation r95p consecutive wet days cwd and consecutive dry days cdd are selected to represent the precipitation extremes eight temperature indices including annual maximum tx txx annual maximum tn tnx hot days tx90p hot nights tn90p annual minimum tx txn annual minimum tn tnn cold days tx10p and cold nights tn10p are selected to describe temperature extremes the base period for calculation of percentile based precipitation and temperature extreme indices is 1989 2019 and 1985 2016 respectively the definition and unit of extreme indices are presented in table 2 based on the motivation of the study the joint probabilistic characteristics of ten combinations of extreme indices are selected the combinations associated with precipitation extremes are represented as r20 r95p cwd r95p r20 cdd cdd cwd and cdd r95p and the combinations related with temperature extremes are represented as txx tnn tn90p tx90p tx10p tn10p tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p the selected different combinations of extreme climatic indices in the present study represent different climate conditions the combinations representing precipitation extremes are formed to examine the dependence structure of drying and wetting conditions of different river basins to analyse the joint probability of very heavy precipitation and frequency of extreme precipitation r20 r95p is used for evaluation of the probability of concurrence of long wet periods with extreme precipitation frequency within a year cwd r95p combinations is constructed r20 cdd is used to reflect the concurrence changes in the very heavy precipitation and long dry periods and cdd cwd is chosen to examine the joint behaviour of long dry and wet periods within a year lastly to evaluate the probability of concurrence of long dry periods with extreme precipitation frequency within a year cdd r95p combination is used in general tn90p tx90p represents co occurrence of two hot extremes extreme number of hot days and nights in summer season in a year tx10p tn10p describes the co occurrence of two cold extremes extreme number of cold days and nights in winter season in a single year moreover txx tnn tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p represents co occurrence of a hot and a cold extreme within a single year txx tnn signifies the joint behaviour of txx hottest day in summer season and tnn coldest night in winter season and tx10p tx90p and tn10p tn90p are used to reflect the concurrence of extreme number of hot and cold days nights respectively in a year 3 2 reliability ensemble averaging rea uncertainties in the climate model outputs should be analysed through criteria based on the historical model performance wilby 2010 in this case reliability ensemble averaging rea is adopted to quantify model uncertainty since this method is used in precipitation and temperature for modelling uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple models ghosh and mujumdar 2009 giorgi and mearns 2002 while projecting for the future rea measures the multimodal uncertainty in the form of model performance and model convergence and assigns a weight to each model based on their ability to capture the observed climate and convergence of the simulated changes across gcms furthermore rea allows for a reduction in uncertainty range in the simulated series by minimizing the influence of outlier and poorly performing models this enables measurement of the reliability of the simulated series by fulfilling the model performance and convergence criteria following are the steps performed to quantify multi model uncertainty using rea i to evaluate the performance criteria root mean square error rmse is used for all the selected extreme indices for instance a time series of an extreme index say r95p is divided into 10 equal intervals of a cumulative distribution function cdf for the observed as well as for all the gcms during the historical period 1975 2005 ii then rmse is computed based on the values at each cdf points for all the gcms as compared to the observed values of r95p the inverse of rmse is used as weight proportionality for all the different gcms the higher weight suggests better performance of the particular gcm and vice versa iii the weights evaluated during the model performance criteria are considered as the initial weights to evaluate the performance criteria iv next the weighted mean cdf is computed by multiplying the future simulated values for r95p at each equal interval of the cdf and the weights separately for each gcm this weighted mean cdf is now considered as a reference and the rmse is computed with respect to the reference v subsequently step i is repeated the weights obtained for all the gcms are used in the next iteration to set the reference i e the weighted mean cdf vi the steps from iv to v are repeated until the weights obtained at n th iteration is same as the weights at n 1 th iteration the final weights for all the selected gcms are obtained from the convergence criteria it is worth mentioning that the process is performed over all the grid points and for all the selected climate extreme indices the convergence final weight for each gcm is multiplied with the particular extreme index using the weights obtained and the weighted ensemble of all the gcms for the index is considered for further analysis the analysis is performed for the periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 separately under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for each grid point and extreme indices for instance rea analysis at a grid point 32 00 lat 76 50 long for r95p is presented in table 3 moreover the evaluation of mean climate extreme indices obtained from multi model rea ensemble and observed datasets for the period 1975 2005 is also carried out the results of the comparison indicate that precipitation extreme indices r20 r95p cwd and cdd from ensemble show a good correlation with observed data ranging from 0 79 to 0 87 fig s13 and mean of temperature extreme indices txx tnx txn and tnn also show a good correlation which ranges from 0 98 to 0 99 fig s14 overall the performance of the multi model ensemble illustrates its substantial capability to simulate climate extreme indices moreover to quantify the uncertainty range 95 confidence interval here we followed the approach proposed by giorgi and mearns 2002 for ensemble mean and rea method see text s1 for details the uncertainty follows the spatial distribution of mean climate extreme indices i e lower the magnitude lower the uncertainty however it increases towards the end of the century 2065 2095 fig s15 to fig s21 across the country for both precipitation and temperature extreme indices corroborating with global scale findings from solomon et al 2007 the results reveal that uncertainty from ensemble mean is more than rea method across the country for future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for each climate extreme indices the comparison of uncertainty obtained from ensemble mean and rea method clearly indicates that rea method has relatively less inherent uncertainty for climate extremes indices in future this indicates the effectiveness of rea approach over traditional ensemble mean method furthermore the country average for uncertainty of mean precipitation extreme indices r20 cdd cwd obtained from rea method for future includes 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is 2 37 10 98 4 97 days respectively similarly country average for temperature extreme indices txx tnx txn tnn is 0 83 1 25 1 17 and 1 31 c respectively for period wise and scenario wise details see fig s15 to fig s21 and table s1 consequently the simulations from these multi models have been used to study the behaviour of climate extreme in future under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 3 copula based probabilistic model a major limitation of univariate analysis is that it might under overestimate the risk associated with extreme events furthermore the univariate analysis of extremes does not take into account the complex dependence of hydro meteorological extreme events kao and govindaraju 2007 it is crucial in the analysis of complex extreme events such as joint occurrence of two different kinds of extremes i e the magnitude of high precipitation and frequency of high precipitation therefore a multivariate approach would be more valuable for the assessment of such climate extremes generally used multivariate distributions are the extensions of univariate ones and suffer from many limitations salvadori and de michele 2004 shiau 2006 a crucial limitation of these traditional approaches is their inability to construct multivariate distributions from different types of marginals to rectify this marginals are modified to become normally or independently distributed which can considerably compromise the accuracy of the approach furthermore these methods also assume the stationarity property of involved variables which does not hold good in the context of climate studies and must be incorporated while studying extreme hydrologic events bracken et al 2018 das umamahesh 2017 khaliq et al 2006 these limitations can be tackled by incorporating the copula approach in multivariate analysis copula is an effective tool to model multivariate distribution among random variables and is independent of individual probabilistic specifications sklar 1959a this method is advantageous in modelling the joint distributions as the dependence structure is modelled independently of the marginal distributions several studies support the idea that copulas provide a robust methodology for studying hydro climatic events which can be referred for detailed information bracken et al 2018 goswami et al 2018b de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 gomez et al 2017 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 kao and govindaraju 2010 zhang et al 2013 3 3 1 marginal probability distribution the selection of a suitable marginal distribution is a vital step before formulating the joint probabilistic models in this study the selection of the marginal distributions is done based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test statistics massey 1951 performed over a set of selected theoretical distributions gumbel gamma exponential weibull and log normal distributions the goodness of fit is measured in terms of the maximum difference between the theoretical cumulative distribution functions cdfs and corresponding empirical cdfs at a significance level of 5 to assess the appropriate distribution for each index 3 3 2 background of copulas copulas are multi variate mathematical functions becoming popular due to the inherent ability to join or couple more than one time independent variable nelsen 2007 the copula functions can model the multi variate distributions efficiently separating the effect of involved marginals sadegh et al 2017 sklar 1959b proposed the term copula and provided the background of copula based analysis in statistical and mathematical context in the famous theorem named after him the major benefit of using copula in formulating the multivariate distribution lies in the fact that the formulation of multivariate distribution is simplified by incorporating the correlation of the random variables when the marginal distributions are given shiau et al 2007 since the parameters of marginal distributions are not used in defining the dependence structure therefore copula methodology adds versatility to the modelling of the dependency structure of two or more variables the joint probability distribution of two correlated variables x and y having marginal distributions f x x p x x and f y y p y y respectively can be defined as f x y x y p x x y y the copula association between these two marginals can be expressed as 1 f x y x y c f x x f y y the copula function c is unique if f and g are continuous further with the continuous marginal distribution f and g having u f x and v f y the associated copula can be established in terms of density function of copula c as 2 c u v 2 c u v u v in the present paper we have focused on bivariate copulas as bivariate analysis is commonly performed in hydro climatological literature though number of dimensions are limited in some copula families others can be extended to higher dimensions the readers are advised to refer joe 2014 and nelsen 2007 for detailed information regarding different copulas and their inherent properties moreover the copulas are characterised into different families among which elliptical and archimedean families are commonly used to study the joint behaviour of hydro climatic extremes miao et al 2016 in the present analysis the copula type namely frank copula from archimedean family gaussian copula from elliptical family and bivariate plackett family have been employed see details in table 4 the benefits of selecting the above copulas are i frank and plackett enable to incorporate variety of marginal processes chiou and tsay 2008 ii with single parameter the methodology to model the joint probability using the selected copulas in the present study is simple and flexible ganguli and reddy 2014 iii the selected copulas are capable of modelling the joint dependence of positively as well as negatively correlated variables zhang and singh 2007 the kendall tau correlation is used as the scale free measure of dependence to construct the corresponding copula function c for further information about copulas used in the study can be found in bouyé et al 2000 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 palaro and hotta 2006 trivedi and zimmer 2005 furthermore to find out the appropriate copula and the copula parameter akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 are used and can be defined as 3 aic 2 k 2 l 4 bic ln n k 2 l where kisthe number of parameters ni s the sample size and listhe maximum likelihood estimates for the copula the aic as a measure of goodness of fit incorporates both complexity of the model and also minimizes the error residuals the error residuals are independent and identically distributed with gaussian assumption and centered around zero moreover aic by adding penalty term based on the number of parameters minimizes the problem of over conditioning sadegh et al 2017 lower the aic and bic values better is the model fit additionally the aic and bic have proven to be very efficient measure of the relative quality of copula based bivariate probabilistic models in previous works such as cong and brady 2012 lasmar and berthoumieu 2014 3 3 3 bivariate joint return period generally the return period is characterised as the mean interarrival occurrence duration between two events in hydrology the return period concept is used to compute the return level corresponding to the return period for hydrological design purposes the frequency of co occurrence of extremes of any combinations of two climate extreme indices within the same year can be understood by examination of the bivariate joint return period in this study joint return period jrp for a combination extreme has been calculate using the following method salvadori and de michele 2004 5 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 1 f x x f y y f x y x y t x x y y is the jrp when x and y exceed certain thresholds for instance if x t and y t are t year marginal values of x and y respectively t x x t y y t has been denoted as t x y t in the paper for example t c d d c w d 10 signifies the return period of an extreme event when the combination cdd cwd exceeds their 10 year marginal values the joint return period jrp for each grid point is calculated for past precipitation extremes 1989 2019 and temperature extremes 1985 2016 and future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 3 3 4 change rate in joint return period the percentage change in joint return period cjrp for the future with respect to past 1989 2019 is represented as cjrp the change rate in joint return period jrp for each grid point was evaluated for future periods 6 cjrp t x y future t t x y past t t x y past t 100 where t x y future t t x y t for future periods t x y past t t x y t for past based on observed data cjrp change in joint return period 4 results 4 1 univariate assessment of climate extreme indices before the investigation of joint probabilistic behaviour of climate extremes a preliminary anaysis of precipitation and temperature extreme indices is carried out for the past 1989 2019 and 1985 2016 respectively and future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using the mean trend statstics using non parametric mann kendall test at 95 level of significance and sen s slope statistics based on z statistics the trends are classified as increasing 0 z 1 96 significantly increasing z 1 96 decreasing 1 96 z 0 and significantly decreasing z 1 96 and the magnitude of trend is evaluated using sen s slope 4 1 1 extreme precipitation indices in general r20 across the past and future is found to be high 20 days for northeast region and western ghats and low 1 5 days for the western region fig s1a during 1989 2019 r20 shows both decreasing ganga basin north east region godavari basin tapi basin and upper parts of indus basin and increasing parts of southern india central eastern and western region trends however it encompass a positive trend mostly between 0 and 0 25 days year in major segments of country in future fig s1b s1c under rcp4 5 it shows an increasing trend predominantly across the country in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 whereas some parts of western ghats central eastern and central region also attain significantly increasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 it follows a similar pattern increasing trend across the country along with an substantial increase in spatial extent of regions encompassing significantly increasing trend during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 most parts of peninsular india show a significantly increasing trend and during 2065 2095 north eastern and northern region also show a significantly increasing trend generally r95p attain a higher magnitude 500 mm in western ghats and northeastern region whereas western region encompass a lower magnitude 25 250 mm fig s2a during 1989 2019 around 50 of the country comprising of parts of central eastern western southernmost and central region show a positive trend mostly between 0 4 mm year fig s2b s2c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 it predominantly shows an increasing trend mostly between 0 4 mm year and significantly increasing trend mostly between 4 mm year across the country in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 respectively consequently cwd is generally high 25 days for western ghats northeast region and low 3 10 days for western region fig s3a and the overall trend in cwd across the country is decreasing

2025 2055 and 2065 2095 across the country the spatial pattern of mean trend and sen s slope of tn90p number of warm nights are similar to tx90p it also shows a positive trend in the past and future predominantly in the country during 1985 2016 tn90p ranges from 10 to 20 with an increasing significantly increasing trend 0 5 decade predominantly across the country except western region and some

under rcp8 5 during 2025 2055 tn90p shows a significantly increasing trend across the country with a rate of 5 to 10 decade in central western ganga river basin and 10 decade in some parts of northern north east southern region central eastern moreover during 2065 2095 it shows a significantly increasing trend mostly 5 to 10 decade across the country generally txn is found to be lower 24 c in northern central western north eastern central eastern regions and higher 24 c in southern region fig s9 during 1985 2016 txn shows an increasing trend 0 to 0 50 c decade across major portion of country additionally a significantly increasing trend 0 50 c decade is also detected for some parts of northern ganga basin and north east under rcp4 5 txn shows a significantly increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade in future in 2025 2055 and further shows an increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade towards 2065 2095 predominantly across the country on the other hand a few parts of central eastern india also indicate a decreasing trend 0 25 to 0 c decade during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 it shows a significantly increasing trend 0 0 50 c decade in 2025 2055 across country during 2065 2095 it shows a significantly increasing trend throughout the country with a rate of 0 50 c decade in northern central western north eastern central eastern regions and with 0 0 50 c decade in remaining parts of country it can be inferred from here that regions with lower txn show a higher increasing rate than other regions during 2065 2095 in the extreme rcp8 5 scenario generally tnn is lower 11 c in majority portion of country except southern region fig s10 during 1985 2016 it shows an increasing trend 0 to 0 50 c decade across indus basin western southern most central eastern region and a

significantly increasing trend 0 50 c decade in 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 mostly across country based upon sen s slope of tnn mostly 0 50 c decade and txn mostly 0 50 c decade under rcp8 5 it is found that tnn change rate is greater than txx change rate which might indicate that nights will get hotter at a greater pace than days in winter season mainly across the country additionally during 1985 2016 tx10p attains mean value of 10 with a decreasing significantly decreasing trend 1 decade mostly across the country and it continues to show a negative trend in future fig s11 under both rcp4 5

extremes precipitation and temperature extreme from past to the future firstly spatial distribution of observed jrp has been investigated for 10 25 50 100 year return period it has been found that the spatial pattern of observed jrp corresponding to different return periods resemble each other throughout india for every combination extreme therefore we have taken into consideration jrp at 10 year return period for spatio temporal assessment of the vulnerability towards climate extremes 4 2 1 precipitation extremes 1989 2019 the jrp of r20 r95p cwd r95p represents the potential risk of region towards floods and r20 cdd cdd cwd cdd r95p identifies the vulnerability of river basins towards co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year the terms floods and droughts has been used to indicate the possible implications of the precipitation extreme not necessarily the traditional definitions of floods and droughts the observed jrp at 10 year return period for the combination extreme r20 r95 t10 r20 r95 ranges from 12 to 70 years the regions acquiring lower t10 r20 r95 have a higher probability of occurrence of intense precipitation events representing higher susceptibility to floods the t10 r20 r95 suggests that north western id1 north eastern ids 2b 21 22 and southern region ids 4 5 17 18 19 are prone to floods fig 3 a t10 cwd r95p ranges from 22 to 661 years the regions exhibiting lower t10 cwd r95p are more likely to face intense wet spells and intense precipitation events which implies these regions bear greater risk to floods the regions having higher proneness towards floods pertaining to t10 cwd r95p shows a similar spatial pattern as t10 r20 r95 while excluding north eastern region and including western ghats id14 and westernmost regions id20 fig 3b t10 r20 cdd ranges from 25 to 5400 years the regions with lower t10 r20 cdd are more likely to face severe precipitation and severe dry spells in a single year and thus encounter a greater risk for the co occurrence of floods and droughts within the same year the t10 r20 cdd suggest that southern id4 and central eastern ids 6 7 8 15 region of the country have high susceptibility towards the co occurrence of floods and droughts fig 3c t10 cdd r95 ranges from 34 to 4000 years the regions with lower t10 cdd r95p have a higher possibility of co occurrence of intense dry spells and intense precipitation events within the same year this implies that the regions acquiring lower t10 cdd r95p withstand a greater risk of co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year the spatial pattern of the regions subjected to greater risk towards the occurrence of such extreme events according to t10 cdd r95p is found to be similar to t10 r20 cdd while also including the most parts of ganga basin fig 3e t10 cdd cwd ranges from 30 to 2500 years the regions acquiring lower t10 cdd cwd are more likely to face intense dry and intense wet spells within the same year which indicates the higher susceptibility of these regions towards co occurrence of floods and droughts t10 cdd cwd indicates that most parts of ganga basin north eastern ids 2c 21 western ids 10 11 20 and central ids 3 12 13 region are at risk towards the occurrence of such extreme events fig 3d 4 2 2 temperature extremes 1985 2016 t10 txx tnn signifies the co occurrence of 10 year return levels of txx hottest day in summer season and tnn coldest night in winter season within a single year the regions encompass low t10 txx tnn predominantly lies in indus river basin western central and some parts of central eastern region fig 4 t10 tn90p tx90p indicates concurrence of 10 year return levels of tn90p and tx90p within a single year which signifies the joint occurrence of extreme number of hot days and nights summer season t10 tn90p tx90p shows low magnitude mostly in southern and some parts of northern region t10 tn10p tx10p denotes the co occurrence of 10 year return levels of tx10p and tn10p within a single year which indicates the joint occurrence of extreme number of cold days and nights winter season it indicates that a large portion of country except few parts of central eastern southern and western region is vulnerable to such climatic extreme t10 tx10p tx90p denotes the concurrence of 10 year return levels of tx10p and tx90p within a single year which indicates the joint occurrence of extreme number of hot days summer season and cold days winter season t10 tx10p tx90p shows that only north eastern and some parts of southern region are vulnerable towards occurrence such an extreme t10 tn10p tn90p signifies the joint occurrence of 10 year return levels of tn10p and tn90p within a single year which indicates the co occurrence of extreme number of warm nights summer season and cold nights winter season t10 tn10p tn90p indicates that such event is highly unlikely return period 500 years to occur across the country except few parts of central india 4 3 change in joint return period cjrp in future the spatial and temporal distribution of change in joint return period can provide valuable insights on the variation of the joint probabilistic behaviour of climate extremes during the future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 with respect to the past 1989 2019 a decrease in the magnitude of jrp leads to negative cjrp which implies that the risk towards the occurrence of climate extremes would increase in future and the region would become more vulnerable relative to the past here we classify the cjrp into four categories as critically decreasing 50 decreasing 50 to 0 increasing 0 50 and critically increasing 50 trend in jrp 4 3 1 precipitation extremes under rcp4 5 during 2025 2055 t10 r20 r95 shows a negative trend decreasing critically

11 out of 24 river basins which mostly lie in north western id1 north eastern ids 2b 2c 22 central ids 12 13 central eastern ids 6 7 8 and western region id11 and this spatial distribution of cjrp remains similar during 2065 2095 where a large portion of 11 out of 24 river basins show a negative trend fig 5b mostly lying in north eastern ids 2b 2c 21 22 central ids 3 13 central eastern ids 6 7

portion of 12 out of 24 river basins show a negative trend mostly lying in central ids 3 11 central eastern ids 6 7 8 15 north eastern ids 22 western ids 11 20 and southern region ids 4 9 17 based upon magnitude of change in t10 cwd r95p the river basins in central tapi central eastern brahmani and baitarni subarnarekha and north eastern region mrfm are found to be highly sensitive to floods throughout the mid century and end of 21st century during both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 under rcp4 5 in the mid century t10 r20 cdd encompass a negative trend in major portion of 3 out of 24 river basins

mid century and end of 21st century under rcp4 5 during 2025 2055 t10 cdd cwd shows a negative trend in major parts of 6 out of 24 river basins predominantly lying in southern ids 5 9 16 18 central eastern id15 and north eastern region id21 fig 5d and during 2055 2095 t10 cdd cwd shows a negative trend in large parts of 15 out of 24 basins covering the entire country except parts of western region under rcp8 5 in the mid century a major portion of 7 out of 24 basins encompass a negative trend in t10 cdd cwd mostly lying in southern ids 5 9 16 18 19 central id3 and northwest region id1 whereas towards the end of 21st century a large portion of 13 out of 24 basins show a negative trend in t10 cdd cwd in most parts of country except ganga river basin and parts of central and central

during the period 2025 2055 whole country show a negative trend predominantly critical decreasing trend in t10 txx tnn with respect to joint return period for 1985 2016 fig 6 however during the period 2065 2095 the regions showing a negative trend mostly decreasing trend decreases which includes the parts of western central western ghats central central eastern lower ganga basin north east region under rcp8 5 the major portion of country show a critical decreasing trend for the period 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 for the combination extreme tn90p and tx90p change in t10 tn90p tx90p in future is similar as t10 txx tnn under rcp4 5 for period 2025 2055 it follows a negative trend decreasing critical decreasing across the country however for period 2065 2095 the regions encompassing negative trend mostly decreasing decreases slightly excluding few parts of central eastern central upper ganga basin and north eastern region under rcp8 5 it indicates a negative trend mostly critical decreasing across the whole country for 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 for the period 2025 2055 t10 tn10p tx10p shows decreasing trend mostly across the country except western parts of central eastern north east and ganga river basin however under rcp8 5 for the same period major portion of country encompass a decreasing trend on the other hand during 2065 2095 major parts of country show a positive trend mostly critical increasing t10 tx10p tx90p mostly shows critical increasing trend during 2025 2055 under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across the country however during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 the regions such as western northern central central eastern and a major portion of ganga river basin show a critically decreasing trend moreover during 2065 2095 under rcp8 5 the major portion of country encompass a critically increasing trend change in t10 tn10p tn90p show a similar spatial pattern as t10 tx10p tx90p for period 2025 2055 under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with major portion of country encompassing a critically increasing trend however it shows a negative trend for the period 2065 2095 in various parts of country under rcp4 5 during the period 2065 2095 major segment of country shows a critically decreasing trend whereas under rcp8 5 a large portion of country except central and central eastern region show a negative trend mostly critically decreasing 5 discussion despite growing concerns that climatic extremes would tend to increase and intensify in magnitude in the future beniston et al 2007 houghton et al 2001 ipcc 2007 regional investigations of the likelihood of the climate extremes are scarce in india here we study twelve climate extreme indices four precipitation indices and eight temperature indices capturing extreme climatic events from different perspectives firstly a preliminary analysis of climate extreme indices is carried out for past and future periods followed by quantification of joint return period of climatic extremes in this study joint return period of climatic extremes is evaluated by the application of a bivariate copula to find the joint dependence between different climate extreme indices during the historical period precipitation 1989 2019 temperature 1985 2016 and future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across india this enabled us to assess the probable changes in joint return period relative to the observed joint return period 1989 2019 for ten combinations five combinations representing precipitation and temperature extremes each from the climate extreme indices during 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 here we found that r20 and r95p are generally high 20 days 500 mm for northeast region and western ghats and low 1 5 days 25 250 mm for the western region during 1989 2019 the trends in r20 and r95p show similar spatial pattern around 50 of the country comprising of parts of central eastern western southern and central region show a positive trend mostly between 0 4 mm year in the future periods 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 r20 and r95p show an increasing trend in major segments of country under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in india predominantly precipitation occurs in monsoon season june to september the above findings are coherent with the studies conducted for monsoon season kumar et al 2011 rao et al 2014 revadekar et al 2011 where they found that there may be a significant increase in frequency of very heavy precipitation days and intensity of precipitation in the future moreover the trends in r95p and r10 obtained by rao et al 2014 for future corroborate with the trends in r95p and r20 evaluated in the present study respectively consequently cwd is generally high 25 days for western ghats northeast region and low 3 10 days for western region and the overall trend in cwd across the country is decreasing in the past and a large portion of the country exhibit an increasing trend in the future subsequently cdd is found mostly high 200 days in western region and low 34 100 days in parts of western ghats northernmost southernmost central eastern and northeastern region cdd shows a general increasing trend mostly between 0 and 1 days year and adecreasing trend in the past 1989 2019 and future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 in major segments of country which is coherent with the findings by rao et al 2014 for monsoon season further the identification of climatic hotspot regions in terms of precipitation extremes is carried out based upon t10 during 1989 2019 into regions prone to floods and co occurrence of floods and droughts the regions which encompass lower t10 r20 r95 and t10 cwd r95p have a higher likelihood of extreme precipitation events and are characterized as regions susceptible to floods the results indicate that north western indus north eastern brahmaputra mrfb mrfm southern krishna cauvery efrkpb efrpcb efrscb western ghats wfrst and westernmost regions wfkrsl are highly prone towards floods the change in t10 r20 r95p and t10 cwd r95p indicate that the river basins in western sabarmati central tapi central eastern brahmani and baitarni subarnarekha and north eastern region mrfm show increased risk towards floods in future the regions with lower t10 r20 cdd t10 cdd cwd and t10 cdd r95 have a greater risk of co occurrence of floods and droughts in a single year and further classified as regions at risk towards co occurrence of floods and droughts the results show that a large portion of the country is prone towards co occurrence of floods and droughts which includes most parts of ganga basin southern krishna central eastern subarnarekha brahmani and baitarni mahanadi efrmgb north eastern barak and others mrfb western mahi sabarmati wfkrsl and central region narmada tapi godavari the change in t10 r20 cdd t10 cdd cwd and t10 cdd r95p indicate river basins of southern region pennar cauvery efrpcb efrgkb north eastern region brahmaputra and north western region indus attain increased risk towards co occurrence of floods and droughts in future moreover it can be concluded from above discussion that many river basins which were less susceptible towards precipitation extremes during 1989 2019 would become vulnerable in the future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under the changing climate generally the results of univariate analysis of temperature extremes provide evidence of the increase in warm extremes tnx tx90p tn90p and increase in annual maximum day txn during summer and annual maximum night temperature tnn during winter season the results indicate a decrease in number of cold days tx10p and nights tn10p during 1985 2016 the findings of temperature extreme indices during 1985 2016 mostly corroborate with previous studies from india kumar et al 2017 panda et al 2014 asia caesar et al 2011 and also consistent with studies at the global scale alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013 field et al 2012 overall txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn are significantly increasing in future except increasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 predominantly across the country however tx10p and tn10p show a significantly decreasing in future except decreasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 across the country it can be inferred that number of hot days nights are projected to increase and number of cold days nights in a year would decrease in future in india which is mostly consistent with the previous studies kumar et al 2013 2020 the bivariate analysis of temperature extremes shows that t10 txx tnn is low in indus river basin western central and some parts of central eastern region during 1985 2016 and it shows an overall negative trend in future across the country t10 tn90p tx90p shows low magnitude mostly in southern and some parts of northern region during 1985 2016 whereas it also predominantly follows a negative trend in future across the country this suggests that along with the projected increase in hot days nights the probability of co occurrence of extreme number of hot days and nights in a single will also increase in future during 1985 2016 t10 tn10p tx10p illustrates that a large portion of country is vulnerable to such an extreme moreover it mostly shows a increasing and decreasing for 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively throughout the country this indicates that with the projected decrease in number of cold days nights the possibility of co occurrence of extreme number of cold days and nights will also decrease towards the end of century the magnitude of t10 tx10p tx90p and t10 tn10p tn90p is mostly more than 100 years across the country during 1985 2016 therefore the occurrence of such climate extremes is highly unlikely additionally t10 tx10p tx90p and t10 tn10p tn90p show a critically decreasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 mostly across the country and both show a critically increasing trend during 2025 2055 under rcp4 5 across the country 6 conclusion recent evidence suggests that changing climate is significantly influencing the hydrological cycle and consequently affecting behaviour of climate extremes such regional investigations about changing climate extremes are scarce in india and the present study is set out to fulfill this gap here a comprehensive assessment of climate extremes using an integrated statistical and probabilistic approach across india for past and future is carried out the copula method is employed to examine the bivariate characteristics of different climate extreme indices the datasets used to conduct the analysis for past are observed daily precipitation 1989 2019 from india meteorological department imd daily temperature from global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd 1985 2016 and the future examination is carried out using nex gddp nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections dataset which contains downscaled meteorological outputs of 21 cmip5 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario consequently multi model ensembles for the climate extreme indices from this dataset are developed using reliability ensemble averaging rea technique which are utilized to evaluate the climate extremes in future 2025 2055 and 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results obtained indicate that r20 r95p and cwd attain an increasing trend and cdd mostly shows a decreasing trend in major segments of the country in future based upon the 10 year joint return periods 1989 2019 of precipitation extreme combinations it is found that parts of north western north eastern southern western region and western ghats are highly prone to floods and a large portion of the country is vulnerable towards co occurrence of floods and droughts moreover the study shows that many regions with less vulnerability towards precipitation extremes would become more vulnerable in future furthermore txx tnx tx90p tn90p tnn and txn are found to be significantly increasing in future except increasing during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 predominantly across the country and tx10p and tn10p follow a significantly decreasing trend in future across the except exhibiting a decreasing trend during 2065 2095 under rcp4 5 throughout the country with the projected increase in hot days nights the frequency of concurrence of extreme number of hot days tx90p and nights tn90p within a year would increase in future across the country the present study about the probabilistic evaluation of climate extremes using copula improves our understanding of the extremes in the changing climate and provides valuable additional information for the development of disaster mitigation strategies in india a limitation of the study is that climate observations for the evaluation of joint return period of climate extremes are analysed under the assumption of a stationary climate the study considers two climate scenarios evaluation of joint return period for climate extremes for other climate scenarios may also be essential to study in future works future works on the similar aspect can emphasize upon utilization of higher dimensional copula to find the dependence between occurrences of different climate extremes and further explore the frequency of the co occurrence and its joint impacts credit authorship contribution statement nikhil kumar writing original draft manish kumar goyal

4621,the export of fixed carbon from peatlands is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystem productivity in head water streams here we studied the stream composition from three peatlands and the sub catchment containing these peatlands in response to a natural storm event we investigated the dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don mobilised by this event as well as the dissolved combined amino acids dcaas proteins peptides and free aas component of the doc don the storm pulse was characterised by a strong doc don dcaa pulse reflecting the mobilisation of materials from the peat profile through the storm cycle a transient increase in the c n ratio of the doc was observed ranging over 20 50 across the four sites likely reflecting the mobilisation of less decomposed material from higher in the peat soil profile by comparing the dcaa and don dynamics we show that a dcaa rich component fast dcaa is mobilised earlier in the storm cycle likely reflecting a higher mobility in the peat soil similarly comparison of the dcaa and doc dynamics suggests that at least part of the doc is mobilised more rapidly than fast dcaa fast doc while we may not expect the composition of a storm pulse to be uniform through the cycle this study shows that within the doc and don pools there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular groups proteins in principal represent both highly bioavailable n sources as well as potential biological trigger molecules so our work shows that these compounds are more dominant in the early part rising limb of the storm pulse this understanding of the changing composition of doc through a storm peak also provides greater insight into the concentration discharge c q response of peatlands our work shows that the activation of water paths higher in the peat profile at high flows leads to the mobilisation of different pools of doc such that the molecular characteristics of doc change through the storm cycle keywords peatlands dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen storm response dissolved combined amino acids 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a critically important component in natural waters performing both biotic e g energy and nutrient sources and abiotic e g sequestering trace elements electron transfer light attenuation functions wetzel 2001 while the dissolved organic carbon doc portion of dom has received a great deal of attention in terms of its composition bioavailability and movement in the landscape less attention has been focused on dissolved organic nitrogen don don is a potentially important n source in aquatic ecosystems wiegner et al 2006 and a major component of n export to oceans alvarez cobelas et al 2008 don includes a range of naturally occurring compounds such as urea free amino acids proteins peptides amino sugars nucleic acids and other n containing heterocyclic compounds some of which may be associated with other carbon containing molecules while don is commonly measured in aquatic studies it is rarely characterised further at the molecular level resulting in a poorly understood role of don in nutrient dynamics or the relative importance of the different molecular groups in food webs the precision of don measurement calculated by difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din can also be poor particularly when tdn and din are of similar magnitude saunders et al 2017 likely limiting the interpretation of don in many systems dissolved proteins peptides and free amino acids generally known together as dissolved combined amino acids dcaas can be a significant part of the don pool harris et al 2018 dissolved free amino acids dfaas are generally present at very low levels but the broader dcaa pool which includes dfaas can be substantially higher 50 1000 μg n l as reported across a range of hydrological environments rivers streams and lakes thurman 1985 and accounting for a substantial portion range 4 44 of don berman and bronk 2003 harris et al 2018 stepanauskas et al 2000 the bioavailability of dcaas in stream water has also been investigated as part of a wider study into the biodegradability of doc components volk et al 1997 revealing that while dcaa might be expected to be a more bioavailable doc fraction this is not necessarily the case and this may be related to binding of dcaa with humic like materials lytle and perdue 1981 in contrast dfaas are highly bioavailable and likely have an important role in microbial energy pathways in natural waters berggren et al 2010 pulse flow events in surface water in response to rainfall can mobilise high levels of doc especially in streams draining peatlands austnes et al 2010 clark et al 2007 worrall et al 2002 peatlands are highly productive hydrological components and the export of fixed carbon from these systems is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystems doc pulses during storm events are typically associated with high don expected given the molecular association with carbon although frequently the organic carbon mobilised in these events is nitrogen poor as revealed through higher doc don c n ratios austnes et al 2010 hagedorn et al 2000 similarly dcaa and particulate amino acids paa have been observed to be higher during high flow periods on the mississippi river duan and bianchi 2007 as well as during storm pulses fellman et al 2009 hagedorn et al 2000 in the later case accounting for 60 80 of don separation based analytical techniques hplc and lc ms provide amino acid specific data compared to the widely used excitation emission eem spectroscopy which is sensitive to only 2 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids fluorescent active tryptophan and tyrosine her et al 2003 or colorimetric methods which report a total protein concentration redmile gordon et al 2013 size exclusion separation techniques dulaquais et al 2018 provide valuable information about the distribution of nitrogen between molecular size classes but no information about dcaa composition the richer data provided by separation methods has not been highly exploited in any previous study in terms of understanding how proteins with different amino acid compositions move in the landscape relative to other don components this molecular level detail of timing and composition is likely important in understanding the response of peatlands to high flow events from both hydrologic and ecological perspectives in this work we have studied the export of dfaa dcaa don and doc from a set of peatlands in response to a high intensity rain event addressing the following questions i what are the relative contributions of dfaa and dcaa to don through the storm cycle ii how does the temporal response of dcaa to high flow compare with that for don and doc and iii does the dcaa composition change through a storm cycle we show evidence for spatial and temporal separation of different molecular groups that has implications for understanding the role of flow path in controlling doc characteristics during storm events as well as the delivery of organic carbon and nitrogen to downstream ecosystems 2 experimental methods this study site has been described previously in terms of long term behaviour silvester 2009 and groundwater dependent bryophyte communities mccartney et al 2013 the stream flows loads and ion balances of this particular storm event have also been described elsewhere karis et al 2016 a brief summary of the site and the storm event experiment is provided here 2 1 site description the study area was the watchbed creek catchment part of the bogong high plains near falls creek victoria australia figure s1 a the catchment area of watchbed creek is 3 35 km2 lawrence 1995 as defined by a gauging station near where watchbed creek drains into rocky valley storage dam figure s1 b the altitude of the catchment ranges from a maximum of 1810 m to 1625 m at the gauging station in this location the highest monthly temperatures occur in january mean minimum 8 9 c mean maximum 17 9 c and lowest monthly temperatures in july mean minimum 2 9 c mean maximum 1 2 c continuous snow cover typically occurs between june and october with an average annual precipitation rain and snow of 2425 mm site 83043 bureau of meterology 2021 four stream sampling locations were used in this work shown as sites a b c and d on figure s1 b sites a b and c were located at drainage points of discrete peatlands sub catchments within the watchbed creek catchment while site d was the gauging station for further details refer to karis et al 2016 the peatlands in these sub catchments are valley bogs with peat depths of up to 1 m and dominated by sphagnum moss sphagnum cristatum in association with candle heath richea continentis alpine baeckea baeckea gunniana and rope rush empodisma minus peatland coverage within each of the sub catchments as well as the overall watchbed creek catchment ranges between 16 and 18 livestock grazing occurred in the australian alps for over 100 years ceasing in the study area in 1994 lawrence 1995 some of these systems are still recovering from this disturbance and as a consequence are in a range of conditions for the peatlands that are the focus of this study the condition decreases in the order b c a based on peatland fragmentation and vegetation coverage as a consequence of these past land uses and future projections of a changing climate peatlands in the australian alps are classified as a nationally endangered ecological community alpine sphagnum bogs and associated fens under the environmental protection and biodiversity conservations epbc act 1999 department of the environment 2009 at each of the sampling sites a gauging weir v notch was used to measure stream flow at sites a b and c these were 300 mm high 90 v notch weir plates fabricated from 15 mm recycled plastic board figure s1 c the weir at site d is a permanent 120 v notch structure of height 1120 mm at sites a b and c a trutrack water height logger wt hr 500 trutrack ltd christchurch new zealand was installed to record water height stage water temperature and logger atmospheric temperature at 30 min intervals stream flows for sites a c were calculated from stage heights using a standard v notch weir equation for a sharp edged weir casey 1992 stream flows at site d were provided by agl energy ltd who maintain this site for measurement of hydroelectric storage inflows static rain gauges were installed at each of sites a b and c immediately prior to 12 h before the storm event the receiving vessels were acid washed prior to deployment to allow analysis of the rain composition a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo s rgb m002 linked to a hobo weather station h21 001 was also installed at site b with the rainfall binned in 30 min intervals groundwater samples were collected at a high flow groundwater source that emerges to the surface at site b prior to and after the storm event as part of a long term monitoring program at this site there are no similar sources for sites a or c so the groundwater collected at site b was taken to be representative for all peatlands in this work 2 2 the storm event the ionic and hydrologic responses of these systems to this storm event have been reported previously karis et al 2016 this current work describes the organic carbon and nitrogen species responses to this same event the rain event occurred in the austral summer on the 30th january 2012 and lasted for approximately 15 h all sites a d were sampled on the day prior to the rain event to provide a measure of base flow composition rainfall commenced at 3am on the 30th of january taken as zero storm time with samples collected every 4 5 h for the first 24 h and then less frequently in subsequent days a total of 109 mm of rain was recorded in the first 24 h storm time 0 24 h with a further 14 mm of rain occurring over 75 150 h karis et al 2016 high intensity rain events are relatively common in this region over the spring autumn period between november 2011 and april 2012 a total of five discrete events of greater than 100 mm occurred including two that occurred 3 weeks and 9 weeks prior to the event studied here two further events occurred 4 weeks and 5 weeks later bureau of meterology 2021 2 3

in any samples small amounts of tp were detected at peak flow but are not discussed further in this work 2 5 dissolved amino acids analysis all amino acids in this study are referred to using their standard three letter abbreviations see amino acids attributes table s1 dcaa hydrolyses were carried out in pyrolysed digestion tubes using 1 or 2 ml of sample with the sample volume selected based on the calculated don concentration samples were frozen at 70 c and then freeze dried at 50 c two hundred 200 µl of 6 n hcl containing 0 02 phenol was then added and the samples hydrolysed under an argon atmosphere at 110 c for 24 h weiss et al 1998 hydrolysed samples were transferred to 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes digestion tubed rinsed with 300 µl milli q water and the diluted hcl removed using a rotating vacuum concentrator rvc 4 5 h at 40 c martin christ germany dried samples were reconstituted with 80 µl of a 3 1 borate buffer milli q water mixture tagged with 20 µl of 6 aminoquinolyl n hydroxysuccinimyidyl carbamate aqc 3 mg ml in acetonitrile reagent and heated at 55 c for 10 min for tyrosine conversion tagged samples were diluted with 100 µl of 0 1 formic acid and centrifuged to remove any particulate material 7323g 5 min approximately 150 µl of supernatant was transferred into a 200 µl limited volume insert agilent the measurement of dfaas followed the same procedure as described for dcaa with the omission of the acid hydrolysis and acid removal steps for this measurement 2 ml of sample was used for the analysis of peat soils a 10 mg sample of freeze dried peat core was coarsely ground mortar and pestle and hydrolysed with 0 5 ml 6 n hcl following removal of hcl using rvc these samples were reconstituted with 5 ml of 0 1 formic acid and filtered 0 45 μm cellulose acetate a 20 μl sub sample was then tagged with aqc as described for dcaa tagged amino acid samples were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the lc ms ms system

calibration standards were made using amino acid standard h waters corporation spiked with l isomers of glutamine gln asparagine asn and tryptophan trp allowing measurement of all standard proteinogenic amino acids over the range 0 01 2 pmol µl equivalent to 0 01 2 µmol l a quality control sample of selected amino acids was prepared at 1 pmol µl containing his arg gln lys and ile blanks were included in each sample run including i a reagent blank consisting of 60 µl borate buffer 20 µl milli q water and 20 µl aqc ii a sample blank of milli q water hydrolysed and derivatized as detailed above and iii a 0 1 formic acid blank a sample of insulin bovine pancreas sigma aldrich st louis usa was also included in every hydrolysis set to check for consistency in amino acid recovery see table s2 to avoid potential effects of variations between batch runs duplicate samples were run in separate batches and with samples from different sites some amino acids are not recoverable following acid hydrolysis of proteins with 6 n hcl tryptophan is destroyed and cystine is typically poorly recovered from the hydrolysed samples fountoulakis and lahm 1998 during acid hydrolysis asparagine and glutamine are largely de aminated to aspartic acid and glutamic acid respectively making it impossible to determine the contributions of each of these amino acids individually as per convention these pairs of amino acids are referred to as asx and glx anders et al 2003 recovery of dfaas was typically better than 80 with the exception of his lys and met which were slightly lower see table s3 2 6 data analysis we used a permutational analysis of variance permanova to examine relationships between dcaa composition over time anderson 2001 across the 4 sites metric multidimensional scaling mmds of all sample bootstrap averages were used to fit 95 region estimates of the dcaa composition over time permanova and bootstrap averages were both implemented in the primer7 software permanova ver 1 0 5 primer e albany new zealand anderson et al 2008 in this analysis sites were designated as random factors and time as fixed factors all other data analysis was carried out using the open source software r v3 5 2 r core team 2013 and visualized using ggplot wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 temporal response of n species across the storm cycle for the temporal responses of the n species we show the results obtained for one site site a consistent with that shown in the earlier companion paper dealing with the same event karis et al 2016 equivalent plots and all data for all sites are provided in supplementary materials in general the n species responses observed at site a were common to all sites where difference were observed these are highlighted the discharge profile for the storm event at site a is shown in fig 1 a stream flow at peak was approximately 50 greater than pre storm levels and returned to base flow after 48 h equivalent profiles for all sites shown in figure s2 over the storm cycle total nitrogen tn at site a ranged between 120 and 330 µg n l with maximum concentrations occurring at maximum flow total dissolved nitrogen tdn not shown ranged between 90 and 200 µg n l over this same period the proportion of nitrogen partitioned to particulate fractions was highest at maximum flow likely because of the higher mobilisation of particulate materials under high flow conditions don ranged from 75 to 200 µg n l over the storm cycle with the maximum again coinciding with the discharge maximum fig 1b the behaviour of these three nitrogen components tdn tn don was similar at all sites although the ranges were less at site b see figures s3 s6 given that the concentration ranges for these species are broadly similar across all sites don loads scaled closely with discharge with maximum don loads ranging from 5 mg n s site a to 150 mg n s site d see figures s3 s6 dcaa concentrations at site a shown in both fig 1b and fig 1c followed a similar trend to don with maximum concentrations occurring around maximum flow but at a much lower concentration range 8 20 µg n l 0 6 1 4 µm nox species ranged between 2 and 6 µg n l but with a minimum concentration occurring at maximum flow fig 1c flow dilution of nox species during a storm cycle has been observed elsewhere inamdar et al 2015 ammonium nh4 concentrations were also very low throughout the storm cycle 4 5 µg n l data not shown but with no obvious response to the high flow conditions concentrations of these n species were similar across all sites except for dcaa at site b where the range was slightly lower 8 15 µg l nox at site d where the range was substantially higher 15 60 µg n l and nh4 at site d which was also higher than at other sites 12 18 µg n l in addition while a decrease in nox concentration was observed at site a and site d it was not observed at sites b and c where the concentrations were low approximately 2 µg n l method detection limit throughout the storm cycle dcaa concentrations in rainwater were low 3 2 1 0 µg n l compared to that measured in stream water whereas both nox 30 5 0 3 µg n l and nh4 23 5 4 2 µg n l concentrations were substantially higher fig 1c neither dcaa nor nh4 were detected in groundwater whereas nox specifically no3 was present at levels of 59 5 3 5 µg n l site b maximum dcaa loads ranged from 0 5 site a 20 site d mg n s and nox loads ranged from 0 1 site a 14 7 site d mg n s figures s3 s6 dfaa concentrations were extremely low at all points of the storm cycle ranging between 100 and 750 ng n l 7 55 nmol l across all sites fig 1d figure s7 maximum dfaa concentrations in general occurred at flow maximum as observed for all other organic n species the dfaa concentration in rainwater was 0 17 0 04 µg n l 12 nmol l while dfaa was not detected in groundwater dcaa concentrations shown in fig 1c include a contribution from dfaa but clearly dfaas comprise very small part of the dcaa concentration 2 so the dcaa measured here can be taken to represent dissolved proteins and peptides containing at least 2 amino acids 3 2 carbon to nitrogen ratios carbon to nitrogen c n ratios for the organic carbon fraction based on doc and don molar concentrations changed markedly through the storm cycle over a range of 17 1 44 1 at site a fig 2 a i with the maximum coinciding with the flow maximum slightly smaller c n ratio ranges were observed at sites c and d and a substantially smaller range but higher values at site b 39 1 47 1 fig 2b d i c n ratios for the separately measured dcaa component are substantially lower fig 2a d i reflecting the higher nitrogen composition of amino acids c n ratios for individual amino acids in the range 9 1 tyr phe to 1 5 1 arg and leading to a calculated dcaa c n ratio of approximately 3 5 across the storm cycle using these dcaa c n ratio values the c n ratio of the remaining doc non dcaa fraction can be calculated yielding slightly higher c n ratio values for all sites across the storm cycle fig 2a d i figure s3 s6 such high c n ratios show that apart from dcaa the organic carbon exported during the storm pulse is dominated by nitrogen poor material 3 3 dcaa contribution to don and doc in this work we have measured a defined group of compounds dcaa that contribute to both don and doc the dcaa dynamics can therefore be used as a temporal reference for the dynamics of the wider don and doc molecular pools we represent this by way of the percentage contribution of dcaa to don n dcaa and percentage contribution of dcaa to doc c dcaa note that the c n ratio is essentially a convolution of n dcaa and c dcaa i e c n c ndcaa n dcaa c dcaa except in as much that the amino acid distribution in dcaa and therefore c ndcaa is an independent variable at site a the n dcaa varied between 5 and 15 across the storm cycle fig 2a ii during the pre storm and rising limb of the discharge curve the n dcaa was near constant at 10 increasing slightly and essentially the same as under pre storm conditions an abrupt decrease in the n dcaa to 5 occurred between 30 and 40 h followed by a slower increase to pre storm levels and greater after 200 h the underlying cause of this pattern is the distinctly different profiles of dcaa and don dcaa concentrations decreased rapidly following maximum flow fig 1c while don concentrations decayed more slowly during the falling limb fig 1b this pattern in the n dcaa was observed at all sites although somewhat weaker in magnitude at site c and with higher noise in site d fig 2a d ii figures s3 s6 the less distinct pattern at site d is attributed to the effects of multiple paths of differing distances from this gauging weir assuming that don is uniformly distributed spatially across the peatlands prior to the storm event this temporal separation suggests different mobilities of don containing higher dcaa levels termed fast dcaa and the subsequent dcaa depleted don termed slow doc don fractions the equivalent plots for c dcaa reveal a very different patterns to that observed for n dcaa fig 2a d iii for example at site a c dcaa decreased from 2 at the start of the storm cycle to as low as 0 5 near flow maximum before returning more slowly to pre storm levels indicating the export of low dcaa content doc during the storm event broadly similar behaviour was observed at all sites although over slightly different c dcaa ranges fig 2a d iii figure s3 s6 at all sites the point at which doc starts to becomes depleted in dcaa i e c dcaa starts to decrease precedes that for n dcaa and suggests that there are doc compounds that are mobilised faster than the fast dcaa fraction this gives a third independently mobile fraction termed fast doc similar behaviour was observed at all sites although the profile at site d was less distinct as observed for n dcaa and at site b there is less evidence for fast doc with the c dcaa profile very similar to that observed for n dcaa as noted above the differences in n dcaa and c dcaa profiles between sites are reflected in the c n ratios for example site a with the earliest appearance of fast mobilised doc shows the largest change in c n ratio across the rising limb 3 4 amino acid distribution in dcaa the temporal behaviour of individual amino acids within the dcaa fraction are shown in figures s8 11 for sites a d when averaged across all time points of the storm cycle and all sites the 6 most abundant amino acids were gly glx ser asx ala thr each representing between 8 and 20 of dcaa n comparison with previous studies show that these are generally the most abundant amino acids measured in doc dittmar et al 2001 duan and bianchi 2007 hedges et al 1994 the least abundant were cys cys met tyr his ile phe each accounting for 3 of dcaa n fig 3 a the dcaa composition across the storm cycle showed a difference between sites but there was no interaction between sites and time demonstrating that the pattern of dcaa released from the sites over time followed the same trajectory irrespective of the site figure s12 despite this common trajectory there was only a weak and insignificant difference in dcaa composition between consecutive time points apart from between the 104 hrs and 204 hrs where a significant difference was observed table s4a over larger time steps a significant difference in dcaa composition was observed between peak flow approx 20 hrs compared to longer times 80 h but not between peak flow and pre storm conditions table s4b while our statistical analysis shows that in the early part of storm cycle the dcaa composition does not change significantly there is clear evidence for more rapid mobilisation of part of the dcaa fraction fig 2a d ii based on the measured amino acid composition of the dcaa fractions we have calculated an average hydrophobicity score using the hydropathy scale developed by kyte and doolittle 1982 in this scoring system more hydrophobic amino acids have more positive scores the scale is more typically employed as a running average to understand where sequences of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character occur in individual proteins the hydropathy score calculated on the average dcaa composition shows only a slight decrease in the hydrophobicity of the dcaa during peak flow at sites a and c and no significant change at sites b and d throughout the storm cycle figures s3 s6 3 5 characteristics of the peat soil profile doc and dcaa in stream water will be almost entirely derived from contact with peat soils that are in turn largely formed through microbial decomposition of the dominant sphagnum moss in these peatlands during the storm cycle a transient increase in the peat soil water table of approximately 250 mm was observed site b averaged across 4 piezometers plotted in fig 3c referenced to the vegetation surface the c n ratio of peat soil from both hummock and hollow locations from the same peatland site b range between 24 and 112 generally decreasing with depth fig 3d this compares to the c n ratio for live sphagnum moss of 60 10 fig 3d table s5 and suggests an initial increase in c n ratio for decomposing sphagnum moss near the top of the soil profile and a subsequent decrease with greater depth comparison of the water table response during the storm event fig 3c with the c n ratio profile in the peat soil profile indicates that during the storm cycle the water table would have been in contact with peat with a higher c n ratio than prior to the storm the protein content of the peat soil increased with depth as did the total n content of the soil with the result that protein contribution to soil nitrogen was near constant 25 3 data not shown and approximately twice the protein content of the don i e n dcaa released from these systems comparison of the aa composition of sphagnum moss peat soil and the dcaa released in stream water reveals significant differences between these samples fig 3a b relative to sphagnum peat soil is enriched in gly ser pro and cys cys and depleted in lys leu his phe and met relative to peat soils dcaas are enriched in gly glx ser and thr and depleted in pro lys val his phe and ile overall the changes in aa composition suggest a general trajectory during nutrient recycling aldous 2002 bridgham 2002 and microbial decomposition of sphagnum moss to form peat soils and mobile doc 4 discussion 4 1 storm hydrology and doc response in our previous work we showed that significant transient storage of rainfall occurs within the peat profile based on piezometer measurements at site b karis et al 2016 and accounting for 70 10 of the volume of water measured at site b weir over the period 0 200 h direct rainfall onto the peatland 4 2 ha 120 mm rainfall 5000 m3 accounts for 55 of stream flow over this same period so additional inflows must originate from increased groundwater flows and or over land runoff it is important to note that there is no direct overland path to the gauging weirs at sites a and b so for these systems all water must pass through the peatland to report to the weir where samples were collected this in not necessarily true for site c or d where direct terrestrial run off can occur the transient increase in the peat soil water table during the event approx 250 mm at site b fig 3c is presumably responsible for the pulse of doc observed here during the storm cycle based on similar studies elsewhere that have demonstrated increased availability of mobile doc higher in the soil profile bishop et al 2004 the doc concentrations exported from our systems are however very low for peatland dominated systems 1 6 6 6 mg c l across all sites and through the storm event thurman 1985 and more typical of shallow and or damaged peat deposits grand clement et al 2014 4 2 c n ratios the c n ratios of the doc originating from these peatlands spanned a range of 19 51 across all sites and through the storm cycle fig 2a i iv this range is broadly similar to that observed in other peatland dominated catchments including c n ratios 45 for peatlands from the scottish highlands chapman et al 2001 c n in the range 35 60 for boreal forest catchments schiff et al 1998 c n as high as 66 in finnish peatland dominated catchments kortelainen et al 2006 c n ratios in range 10 to 60 over a range of hydrological conditions reported for a peatland catchment from the pennines in northern england edokpa et al 2015 we observed a substantial change in the c n ratio through the storm cycle with all systems showing a c n ratio maximum coinciding closely with the maximum flow and therefore closely coupled with the maximum water table height see fig 3c the maximum c n value observed was similar in all systems 50 however the pre storm base flow values varied across a wider range 19 site a 43 site b fig 2a d i a further increase in the c n ratio was also observed at 80 100 h in all systems and is attributed to a delayed groundwater pulse evident in the piezometers at site b data not shown the changes observed in c n ratio through storm cycle are entirely consistent with that observed for the peat soil profile fig 3d a number of studies have reported increasing c n ratios of peat soil towards the surface including from depth to surface 29 42 wang et al 2015 20 100 with higher values up to 300 recorded at the surface due to aerobic decomposition of peat vegetation and loss of din kuhry and vitt 1996 20 60 tfaily et al 2014 20 80 grover and baldock 2013 these changes in c n ratio are widely attributed to the anaerobic decomposition of peatland vegetation the differential loss of carbon urban et al 2011 wang et al 2014 and the incorporation of nitrogen into more recalcitrant forms as revealed by 13c nmr and ftir spectroscopy tfaily et al 2014 it is therefore quite reasonable that the c n ratio should temporarily increase through the flow maximum as less decomposed organic material is mobilised from higher in the peat profile this has also been observed previously in other peatland storm response studies austnes et al 2010 the difference in pre storm c n ratios observed across these systems is presumably a result of differences in the extent of decomposition and the position of the water table under base flow conditions in each of these systems 4 3 nitrogen speciation and dcaa dynamics at sites a c more than 90 of tdn was in the form of don somewhat less was present as don at site d where nox species were at relatively higher concentrations the dominance of don forms of nitrogen from peatland systems is consistent with a range of other studies including from boreal forest catchments 50 90 schiff et al 1998 in a range of european bogs over a gradient of n deposition 66 82 bragazza and limpens 2004 from bogs peatlands over a range of discharge conditions 90 urban and eisenreich 1988 the export of don from these catchments is attributed to it being largely unavailable for biological processes and poorly retained fenn et al 1998 conversely the low levels of din species exported indicates strong retention of these species within the peatland most likely through microbial and plant uptake mitsch et al 2009 and similar to that observed in other peatland dominated catchments lovett et al 2002 urban et al 2011 both nox and nh4 were present in rainwater at relatively high levels 30 5 0 3 µg n l and 23 5 4 2 µg n l respectively and no3 was also present in the groundwater feeding these peatlands 59 5 3 5 µg n l nox concentrations were close to detection levels at peatland discharge points in sites a c 2 µg n l indicating that nox uptake is highly efficient in these systems long term monitoring of site b shows that nox is efficiently removed at all times of year silvester 2009 similarly ammonia was at levels close to detection limits 2 µg n l at sites a c through the storm cycle likely due to the strongly recycling and retention of this n species under anaerobic conditions in peat soils urban et al 2011 the percentage of don in the form of dcaa n n dcaa accounted for 5 16 mean value 9 7 of don across all sites through the storm cycle suggesting that a large proportion of don is present in non peptide forms this level of n dcaa is very similar to that observed for the mississippi river 5 23 duan and bianchi 2007 and a range of amazonian rivers 13 5 hedges et al 1994 but somewhat lower than that reported for rivers supplying the arctic ocean 38 dittmar et al 2001 the contribution of proteinaceous material to organic nitrogen in peat soils is typically higher 20 60 hagedorn et al 2000 90 yu et al 2002 and has been observed to go through a maximum in the fibric zone of the peat profile sowden et al 1978 here we obtained values in the range 20 30 mean value 25 3 for the amino acid content of our peat soil samples at the lower end of that reported previously 15n nmr analysis of a range of organic soils indicates that the majority of organically bound n is in the form of amino compounds including proteins peptides aminoquinones and aminosugars e g n acetyl glucosamine with lesser amounts of heterocyclic n compounds schulten and schnitzer 1997 thorn and cox 2009 it is very likely that the amino acid concentrations are underestimated due to poor recovery of some amino acids from acid hydrolysis e g trp and cys cys and there is some evidence that acid hydrolysis does not efficiently recover peptides in the presence of doc knicker and hatcher 1997 schulten and schnitzer 1997 even taking these effects into account it appears that the dcaa content of mobilised doc is less than in the peat soil from where it originates in general the carbon content of dcaa represents a very small part of the doc pool c dcaa values observed in this work range 0 5 2 8 mean value 1 1 were similar to that reported elsewhere 1 4 duan and bianchi 2007 2 4 calculated based on average amino acid carbon number of 5 2 dittmar et al 2001 1 3 thurman 1985 at all sites the c dcaa decreased during the storm cycle with a minimum value corresponding to maximum discharge and indicating the export of amino acid depleted doc from higher in the peat profile while we have not identified these doc components in this work it is likely material leached from decomposing sphagnum moss e g polysaccharides polyphenolics hájek et al 2011 4 4 temporal separation of dcaa doc and don comparison of n dcaa and c dcaa changes over the storm cycle suggests the presence of at least three independently mobile doc n fractions fast doc fast dcaa and slow doc don shown conceptually in fig 4 our interpretation of this behaviour centres around the initial rapid mobilisation of doc compounds containing very little nitrogen this is also evident from the c n ratios of the doc mobilised through the event so while carbon and nitrogen will largely co occur in the same molecules the early part of the doc pulse is more likely to contain highly mobile carbon rich organic molecules the fast dcaa represents relatively dcaa enriched material mobilised during the rising limb of the storm cycle and depleted soon after maximum flow wash out effect slow doc don is a relatively dcaa depleted material that is less mobile and appears in the later part of the storm cycle the decoupling of discharge and flux of dissolved constituents in storm flows has been observed previously in terms of a delayed delivery in doc and don edokpa et al 2015 and also through the early depletion of doc in a storm cycle in the later case this has been attributed to either the leaching of mobile doc from peat soil termed diffusion exhaustion worrall et al 2008 or the mixing of water from different paths evans and davies 1998 hagedorn et al 2000 here we provide evidence for different groups of doc don molecules mobilised by the changing water table in the peat profile that move through the peatland at different rates the presence of different molecular groups with different delivery timings offers a potential explanation for the observed c q behaviour in these systems with near equal concentrations of doc on both rising and falling limbs fig 1a figure s3 this behaviour can be explained by the mobilisation of different doc pools in the peat profile in response to activating flow paths higher in the peat profile as a consequence the molecular characteristics of mobilised doc change through the storm cycle for the dcaa containing material there are several feasible explanations for differential mobilities including i fast dcaa represents dcaa containing doc with a higher proportion of hydrophilic and therefore more water soluble amino acids ii the higher proportion of proteinaceous material in fast dcaa makes it more soluble and more mobile than slow doc don or iii fast dcaa represents a smaller molecular sized material that moves more rapidly through the peat soil across all sites there is very little evidence to support a difference in hydrophobicity between dcaa mobilised at different times during the storm cycle figures s3 s6 similarly while changes in the amino acid composition do occur over the storm cycle these differences were relatively small and only significant over larger time steps the second and third options seem more likely and the third also offers an explanation for the fast doc fraction that likely includes smaller and more mobile organic compounds e g low molecular weight organic acids the distribution of don over a range of molecular sizes is consistent with ultrafiltration separation of peatland drainage waters into low and high molecular weight categories with 25 of don partitioned into low molecular weight size class edokpa et al 2015 this idea could for example be tested through size exclusion chromatography that would likely reveal changes in the don distribution across molecular weight size classes through the storm cycle huber et al 2011 similarly direct analysis of low molecular weight doc e g organic acids would reveal whether these small and mobile molecules are eluted early in the storm pulse for example recent laboratory peat re wetting studies show an associated release burst of small reactive organic acids aristilde et al 2017 the direct measurement of these highly bioavailable components in stream waters has however not yet been attempted in any field based study to our knowledge 4 5 site differences and peatland condition the assessment of peatland condition is typically achieved using floristic characteristics e g vegetation types and cover or peat soil properties e g humification water holding capacity grover and baldock 2013 peatlands are locations of nutrient transformation and sources of organic carbon and it is likely that the molecular characteristics of doc exported from these systems reflect plant growth and peat soil processes for the three discrete peatland sites in this study a c the floristic and cover attributes indicate that peatland condition decreases in the order b c a across these three peatlands there are distinct differences in both the initial c n ratio of the exported doc as well as the c n ratio range over the storm cycle site a with the lowest initial c n ratio 17 1 also exhibited the widest c n range 17 1 44 1 suggesting a water table located low in the peat profile prior to the storm event and either a large movement of the water table in response to the storm event or a steeper c n gradient in the peat profile conversely site b had a high initial c n ratio 39 1 and a smaller c n range 39 1 47 1 over the storm cycle consistent with the condition order the c n ratio parameters of site c were intermediate between that of sites a and b in site b both the water table change during the storm cycle and peat c n ratios were measured fig 3c d and suggest that at peak flow the water table would have been in contact with peat soil with a much higher c n ratio approx 80 1 100 1 the significantly lower c n ratios observed in peak flow water likely reflect both the lower c n ratio of mobile doc as well as mixing with water from a range of depths in the profile an additional difference at site b compared to all other sites was the effective absence of fast doc component as indicated above this component likely includes small carbon rich molecules that are likely more bioavailable than larger doc molecules the apparent absence of this doc fraction at site b is consistent with a productive peatland system where these molecules are rapidly scavenged through microbial processes 4 6 conclusions in this work we have used the measurement of dcaa to explore the changing composition of doc and don exported from peatlands in response to a high intensity rain event through this approach we show that there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular fractions exported from these peatlands across the storm cycle during the rising limb the rapidly mobilised carbon rich compounds fast doc and protein rich fast dcaa are relatively more dominant whereas in the falling limb the slower mobilised doc don slow doc don compounds are more dominant the changing composition of doc is attributed to the activation of flow paths higher in the peat soil profile and likely reflects both changes in the characteristics of doc through the peat profile as well as differing mobilities of this doc the timing and delivery of doc from these peatlands likely has important implications for downstream headwater streams in terms of the delivery of bioavailable carbon and ecosystem responses while free proteins likely represent a highly available n source for in stream heterotrophic communities it remains unknown whether the protein peptides in the dcaa rich don fraction are more bioavailable it seems likely that this more mobile fraction represents smaller molecular sized doc n and or with a greater proportion of linked peptides in general the don exported from peatlands is not considered to be particularly bioavailable fenn et al 1998 urban et al 2011 however in a storm pulse don is mobilised from higher in the peat profile and likely represents less decomposed material that may be more bioavailable than don exported during base flows temporal separation of doc components is also potentially important if small molecules dominate the rising limb as they are more likely to include trigger molecules for ecological response in the associated streams derby and atema 1988 given the global interest in improving peatland restoration outcomes gorham and rochefort 2003 the assessment of condition through the analysis of the molecular composition of dissolved organic carbon offers an approach that is likely sensitive to peatland processes i e hydrology vegetation growth peat soil microbial processes our view is that further research into the molecular detail of doc in peatland drainage waters during base flow periods and

4621,the export of fixed carbon from peatlands is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystem productivity in head water streams here we studied the stream composition from three peatlands and the sub catchment containing these peatlands in response to a natural storm event we investigated the dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don mobilised by this event as well as the dissolved combined amino acids dcaas proteins peptides and free aas component of the doc don the storm pulse was characterised by a strong doc don dcaa pulse reflecting the mobilisation of materials from the peat profile through the storm cycle a transient increase in the c n ratio of the doc was observed ranging over 20 50 across the four sites likely reflecting the mobilisation of less decomposed material from higher in the peat soil profile by comparing the dcaa and don dynamics we show that a dcaa rich component fast dcaa is mobilised earlier in the storm cycle likely reflecting a higher mobility in the peat soil similarly comparison of the dcaa and doc dynamics suggests that at least part of the doc is mobilised more rapidly than fast dcaa fast doc while we may not expect the composition of a storm pulse to be uniform through the cycle this study shows that within the doc and don pools there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular groups proteins in principal represent both highly bioavailable n sources as well as potential biological trigger molecules so our work shows that these compounds are more dominant in the early part rising limb of the storm pulse this understanding of the changing composition of doc through a storm peak also provides greater insight into the concentration discharge c q response of peatlands our work shows that the activation of water paths higher in the peat profile at high flows leads to the mobilisation of different pools of doc such that the molecular characteristics of doc change through the storm cycle keywords peatlands dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen storm response dissolved combined amino acids 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a critically important component in natural waters performing both biotic e g energy and nutrient sources and abiotic e g sequestering trace elements electron transfer light attenuation functions wetzel 2001 while the dissolved organic carbon doc portion of dom has received a great deal of attention in terms of its composition bioavailability and movement in the landscape less attention has been focused on dissolved organic nitrogen don don is a potentially important n source in aquatic ecosystems wiegner et al 2006 and a major component of n export to oceans alvarez cobelas et al 2008 don includes a range of naturally occurring compounds such as urea free amino acids proteins peptides amino sugars nucleic acids and other n containing heterocyclic compounds some of which may be associated with other carbon containing molecules while don is commonly measured in aquatic studies it is rarely characterised further at the molecular level resulting in a poorly understood role of don in nutrient dynamics or the relative importance of the different molecular groups in food webs the precision of don measurement calculated by difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din can also be poor particularly when tdn and din are of similar magnitude saunders et al 2017 likely limiting the interpretation of don in many systems dissolved proteins peptides and free amino acids generally known together as dissolved combined amino acids dcaas can be a significant part of the don pool harris et al 2018 dissolved free amino acids dfaas are generally present at very low levels but the broader dcaa pool which includes dfaas can be substantially higher 50 1000 μg n l as reported across a range of hydrological environments rivers streams and lakes thurman 1985 and accounting for a substantial portion range 4 44 of don berman and bronk 2003 harris et al 2018 stepanauskas et al 2000 the bioavailability of dcaas in stream water has also been investigated as part of a wider study into the biodegradability of doc components volk et al 1997 revealing that while dcaa might be expected to be a more bioavailable doc fraction this is not necessarily the case and this may be related to binding of dcaa with humic like materials lytle and perdue 1981 in contrast dfaas are highly bioavailable and likely have an important role in microbial energy pathways in natural waters berggren et al 2010 pulse flow events in surface water in response to rainfall can mobilise high levels of doc especially in streams draining peatlands austnes et al 2010 clark et al 2007 worrall et al 2002 peatlands are highly productive hydrological components and the export of fixed carbon from these systems is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystems doc pulses during storm events are typically associated with high don expected given the molecular association with carbon although frequently the organic carbon mobilised in these events is nitrogen poor as revealed through higher doc don c n ratios austnes et al 2010 hagedorn et al 2000 similarly dcaa and particulate amino acids paa have been observed to be higher during high flow periods on the mississippi river duan and bianchi 2007 as well as during storm pulses fellman et al 2009 hagedorn et al 2000 in the later case accounting for 60 80 of don separation based analytical techniques hplc and lc ms provide amino acid specific data compared to the widely used excitation emission eem spectroscopy which is sensitive to only 2 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids fluorescent active tryptophan and tyrosine her et al 2003 or colorimetric methods which report a total protein concentration redmile gordon et al 2013 size exclusion separation techniques dulaquais et al 2018 provide valuable information about the distribution of nitrogen between molecular size classes but no information about dcaa composition the richer data provided by separation methods has not been highly exploited in any previous study in terms of understanding how proteins with different amino acid compositions move in the landscape relative to other don components this molecular level detail of timing and composition is likely important in understanding the response of peatlands to high flow events from both hydrologic and ecological perspectives in this work we have studied the export of dfaa dcaa don and doc from a set of peatlands in response to a high intensity rain event addressing the following questions i what are the relative contributions of dfaa and dcaa to don through the storm cycle ii how does the temporal response of dcaa to high flow compare with that for don and doc and iii does the dcaa composition change through a storm cycle we show evidence for spatial and temporal separation of different molecular groups that has implications for understanding the role of flow path in controlling doc characteristics during storm events as well as the delivery of organic carbon and nitrogen to downstream ecosystems 2 experimental methods this study site has been described previously in terms of long term behaviour silvester 2009 and groundwater dependent bryophyte communities mccartney et

surface at site b prior to and after the storm event as part of a long term monitoring program at this site there are no similar sources for sites a or c so the groundwater collected at site b was taken to be representative for all peatlands in this work 2 2 the storm event the ionic and hydrologic responses of these systems to this storm event have been reported previously karis et al 2016

responses of the n species we show the results obtained for one site site a consistent with that shown in the earlier companion paper dealing with the same event karis et al 2016 equivalent plots and all data for all sites are provided in supplementary materials in general the n species responses observed at site a were common to all sites where difference were observed these are highlighted the discharge profile for the storm event at site a is shown in fig 1 a stream flow at peak was approximately 50 greater than pre storm levels and returned to base flow after 48 h equivalent profiles for all sites shown in figure s2 over the storm cycle total nitrogen tn at site a ranged between 120 and 330 µg n l with maximum concentrations occurring at maximum flow total dissolved nitrogen tdn not shown ranged between 90 and 200 µg n l over this same period the proportion of nitrogen partitioned to particulate fractions was highest at maximum flow likely because of the higher mobilisation of particulate materials under high flow conditions don ranged from 75 to 200 µg n l over the storm cycle with the maximum again coinciding with the discharge maximum fig 1b the behaviour of these three nitrogen components tdn tn don was similar at all sites although the ranges were less at site b see figures s3 s6 given that the concentration ranges for these species are broadly similar across all sites don loads scaled closely with discharge with maximum don loads ranging from 5 mg n s site a to 150 mg n s site d see figures s3 s6 dcaa concentrations at site a shown in both fig 1b and fig 1c followed a similar trend to don with maximum concentrations occurring around maximum flow but at a much lower concentration range 8 20 µg n l 0 6 1 4 µm nox species ranged between 2 and 6 µg n l but with a minimum concentration occurring at maximum flow fig 1c flow dilution of nox species during a storm cycle has been observed elsewhere inamdar et al 2015 ammonium nh4 concentrations were also very low throughout the storm cycle 4 5 µg n l data not shown but with no obvious response to the high flow conditions concentrations of these n species were similar across all sites except for dcaa at site b where the range was slightly lower 8 15 µg l nox at site d where the range was substantially higher 15 60 µg n l and nh4 at site d which was also higher than at other sites 12 18 µg n l in addition while a decrease in nox concentration was observed at site a and site d it was not observed at sites b and c where the concentrations were low approximately 2 µg n l method detection limit throughout the storm cycle dcaa concentrations in rainwater were low 3 2 1 0 µg n l compared to that measured in stream water whereas both nox 30 5 0 3 µg n l and nh4 23 5 4 2 µg n l concentrations were substantially higher fig 1c neither dcaa nor nh4 were detected in groundwater whereas nox specifically no3 was present at levels of 59 5 3 5 µg n l site b maximum dcaa loads ranged from 0 5 site a 20 site d mg n s and nox loads ranged from 0 1 site a 14 7 site d mg n s figures s3 s6 dfaa concentrations were extremely low at all points of the storm cycle ranging between 100 and 750 ng n l 7 55 nmol l across all sites fig 1d figure s7 maximum dfaa concentrations in general occurred at flow maximum as observed for all other organic n species the dfaa concentration in rainwater was 0 17 0 04 µg n l 12 nmol l while dfaa was not detected in groundwater dcaa concentrations shown in fig 1c include a contribution from dfaa but clearly dfaas comprise very small part of the dcaa concentration 2 so the dcaa measured here can be taken to represent dissolved proteins and peptides containing at least 2 amino acids 3 2 carbon to nitrogen ratios carbon to nitrogen c n ratios for the organic carbon fraction based on doc and don molar concentrations changed markedly through the storm cycle over a range of 17 1 44 1 at site a fig 2 a i with the maximum coinciding with the flow maximum slightly smaller c n ratio ranges were observed at sites c and d and a substantially smaller range but higher values at site b 39 1 47 1 fig 2b d i c n ratios for the separately measured dcaa component are substantially lower fig 2a d i reflecting the higher nitrogen composition of amino acids c n ratios for individual amino acids in the range 9 1 tyr phe to 1 5 1 arg and leading to a calculated dcaa c n ratio of approximately 3 5 across the storm cycle using these dcaa c n ratio values the c n ratio of the remaining doc non dcaa fraction can be calculated yielding slightly higher c n ratio values for all sites across the storm cycle fig 2a d i figure s3 s6 such high c n ratios show that apart from dcaa the organic carbon exported during the storm pulse is dominated by nitrogen poor material 3 3 dcaa contribution to don and doc in this work we have measured a defined group of compounds dcaa that contribute to both don and doc the dcaa dynamics can therefore be used as a temporal reference for the dynamics of the wider don and doc molecular pools we represent this by way of the percentage contribution of dcaa to don n dcaa and percentage contribution of dcaa to doc c dcaa note that the c n ratio is essentially a convolution of n dcaa and c dcaa i e c n c ndcaa n dcaa c dcaa except in as much that the amino acid distribution in dcaa and therefore c ndcaa is an independent variable at site a the n dcaa varied between 5 and 15 across the storm cycle fig 2a ii during the pre storm and rising limb of the discharge curve the n dcaa was near constant at 10 increasing slightly and essentially the same as under pre storm conditions an abrupt decrease in the n dcaa to 5 occurred between 30 and 40 h followed by a slower increase to pre storm levels and greater after 200 h the underlying cause of this pattern is the distinctly different profiles of dcaa and don dcaa concentrations decreased rapidly following maximum flow fig 1c while don concentrations decayed more slowly during the falling limb fig 1b this pattern in the n dcaa was observed at all sites although somewhat weaker in magnitude at site c and with higher noise in site d fig 2a d ii figures s3 s6 the less distinct pattern at site d is attributed to the effects of multiple paths of differing distances from this gauging weir assuming that don is uniformly distributed spatially across the peatlands prior to the storm event this temporal separation suggests different mobilities of don containing higher dcaa levels termed fast dcaa and the subsequent dcaa depleted don termed slow doc don fractions the equivalent plots for c dcaa reveal a very different patterns to that observed for n dcaa fig 2a d iii for example at site a c dcaa decreased from 2 at the start of the storm cycle to as low as 0 5 near flow maximum before returning more slowly to pre storm levels indicating the export of low dcaa content doc during the storm event broadly similar behaviour was observed at all sites although over slightly different c dcaa ranges fig 2a d iii figure s3 s6 at all sites the point at which doc starts to becomes depleted in dcaa i e c dcaa starts to decrease precedes that for n dcaa and suggests that there are doc compounds that are mobilised faster than the fast dcaa fraction this gives a third independently mobile fraction termed fast doc similar behaviour was observed at all sites although the profile at site d was less distinct as observed for n dcaa and at site b there is less evidence for fast doc with the c dcaa profile very similar to that observed for n dcaa as noted above the differences in n dcaa and c dcaa profiles between sites are reflected in the c n ratios for example site a with the earliest appearance of fast mobilised doc shows the largest change in c n ratio across the rising limb 3 4 amino acid distribution in dcaa the temporal behaviour of individual amino acids within the dcaa fraction are shown in figures s8 11 for sites a d when averaged across all time points of the storm cycle and all sites the 6 most abundant amino acids were gly glx ser asx ala thr each representing between 8 and 20 of dcaa n comparison with previous studies show that these are generally the most abundant amino acids measured in doc dittmar et al 2001 duan and bianchi 2007 hedges et al 1994 the least abundant were cys cys met tyr his ile phe each accounting for 3 of dcaa n fig 3 a the dcaa composition across the storm cycle showed a difference between sites but there was no interaction between sites and time demonstrating that the pattern of dcaa released from the sites over time followed the same trajectory irrespective of the site figure s12 despite this common trajectory there was only a weak and insignificant difference in dcaa composition between consecutive time points apart from between the 104 hrs and 204 hrs where a significant difference was observed table s4a over larger time steps a significant difference in dcaa composition was observed between peak flow approx 20 hrs compared to longer times 80 h but not between peak flow and pre storm conditions table s4b while our statistical analysis shows that in the early part of storm cycle the dcaa composition does not change significantly there is clear evidence for more rapid mobilisation of part of the dcaa fraction fig 2a d ii based on the measured amino acid composition of the dcaa fractions we have calculated an average hydrophobicity score using the hydropathy scale developed by kyte and doolittle 1982 in this scoring system more hydrophobic amino acids have more positive scores the scale is more typically employed as a running average to understand where sequences of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character occur in individual proteins the hydropathy score calculated on the average dcaa composition shows only a slight decrease in the hydrophobicity of the dcaa during peak flow at sites a and c and no significant change at sites b and d throughout the storm cycle figures s3 s6 3 5 characteristics of the peat soil profile doc and dcaa in stream water will be almost entirely derived from contact with peat soils that are in turn largely formed through microbial decomposition of the dominant sphagnum moss in these peatlands during the storm cycle a transient increase in the peat soil water table of approximately 250 mm was observed site b averaged across 4 piezometers plotted in fig 3c referenced to the vegetation surface the c n ratio of peat soil from both hummock and hollow locations from the same peatland site b range between 24 and 112 generally decreasing with depth fig 3d this compares to the c n ratio for live sphagnum moss of 60 10 fig 3d table s5 and suggests an initial increase in c n ratio for decomposing sphagnum moss near the top of the soil profile and a subsequent decrease with greater depth comparison of the water table response during the storm event fig 3c with the c n ratio profile in the peat soil profile indicates that during the storm cycle the water table would have been in contact with peat with a higher c n ratio than prior to the storm the protein content of the peat soil increased with depth as did the total n content of the soil with the result that protein contribution to soil nitrogen was near constant 25 3 data not shown and approximately twice the protein content of the don i e n dcaa released from these systems comparison of the aa composition of sphagnum moss peat soil and the dcaa released in stream water reveals significant differences between these samples fig 3a b relative to sphagnum peat soil is enriched in gly ser pro and cys cys and depleted in lys leu his phe and met relative to peat soils dcaas are enriched in gly glx ser and thr and depleted in pro lys val his phe and ile overall the changes in aa composition suggest a general trajectory during nutrient recycling aldous 2002 bridgham 2002 and microbial decomposition of sphagnum moss to form peat soils and mobile doc 4 discussion 4 1 storm hydrology and doc response in our previous work we showed that significant transient storage of rainfall occurs within the peat profile based on piezometer measurements at site b karis et al 2016 and accounting for 70 10 of the volume of water measured at site b weir over the period 0 200 h direct rainfall onto the peatland 4 2 ha 120 mm rainfall 5000 m3 accounts for 55 of stream flow over this same period so additional inflows must originate from increased groundwater flows and or over land runoff it is important to note that there is no direct overland path to the gauging weirs at sites a and b so for these systems all water must pass through the peatland to report to the weir where samples were collected this in not necessarily true for site c or d where direct terrestrial run off can occur the transient increase in the peat soil water table during the event approx 250 mm at site b fig 3c is presumably responsible for the pulse of doc observed here during the storm cycle based on similar studies elsewhere that have demonstrated increased availability of mobile doc higher in the soil profile bishop et al 2004 the doc concentrations exported from our systems are however very low for peatland dominated systems 1 6 6 6 mg c l across all sites and through the storm event thurman 1985 and more typical of shallow and or damaged peat deposits grand clement et al 2014 4 2 c n ratios the c n ratios of the doc originating from these peatlands spanned a range of 19 51 across all sites and through the storm cycle fig 2a i iv this range is broadly similar to that observed in other peatland dominated catchments including c n ratios 45 for peatlands from the scottish highlands chapman et al 2001 c n in the range 35 60 for boreal forest catchments schiff et al 1998 c n as high as 66 in finnish peatland dominated catchments kortelainen et al 2006 c n ratios in range 10 to 60 over a range of hydrological conditions reported for a peatland catchment from the pennines in northern england edokpa et al 2015 we observed a substantial change in the c n ratio through the storm cycle with all systems showing a c n ratio maximum coinciding closely with the maximum flow and therefore closely coupled with the maximum water table height see fig 3c the maximum c n value observed was similar in all systems 50 however the pre storm base flow values varied across a wider range 19 site a 43 site b fig 2a d i a further increase in the c n ratio was also observed at 80 100 h in all systems and is attributed to a delayed groundwater pulse evident in the piezometers at site b data not shown the changes observed in c n ratio through storm cycle are entirely consistent with that observed for the peat soil profile fig 3d a number of studies have reported increasing c n ratios of peat soil towards the surface including from depth to surface 29 42 wang et al 2015 20 100 with higher values up to 300 recorded at the surface due to aerobic decomposition of peat vegetation and loss of din kuhry and vitt 1996 20 60 tfaily et al 2014 20 80 grover and baldock 2013 these changes in c n ratio are widely attributed to the anaerobic decomposition of peatland vegetation the differential loss of carbon urban et al 2011 wang et al 2014 and the incorporation of nitrogen into more recalcitrant forms as revealed by 13c nmr and ftir spectroscopy tfaily et al 2014 it is therefore quite reasonable that the c n ratio should temporarily increase through the flow maximum as less decomposed organic material is mobilised from higher in the peat profile this has also been observed previously in other peatland storm response studies austnes et al 2010 the difference in pre storm c n ratios observed across these systems is presumably a result of differences in the extent of decomposition and the position of the water table under base flow conditions in each of these systems 4 3 nitrogen speciation and dcaa dynamics at sites a c more than 90 of tdn was in the form of don somewhat less was present as don at site d where nox species were at relatively higher concentrations the dominance of don forms of nitrogen from peatland systems is consistent with a range of other studies including from boreal forest catchments 50 90 schiff et al 1998 in a range of european bogs over a gradient of n deposition 66 82 bragazza and limpens 2004 from bogs peatlands over a range of discharge conditions 90 urban and eisenreich 1988 the export of don from these catchments is attributed to it being largely unavailable for biological processes and poorly retained fenn et al 1998 conversely the low levels of din species exported indicates strong retention of these species within the peatland most likely through microbial and plant uptake mitsch et al 2009 and similar to that observed in other peatland dominated catchments lovett et al 2002 urban et al 2011 both nox and nh4 were present in rainwater at relatively high levels 30 5 0 3 µg n l and 23 5 4 2 µg n l respectively and no3 was also present in the groundwater feeding these peatlands 59 5 3 5 µg n l nox concentrations were close to detection levels at peatland discharge points in sites a c 2 µg n l indicating that nox uptake is highly efficient in these systems long term monitoring of site b shows that nox is efficiently removed at all times of year silvester 2009 similarly ammonia was at levels close to detection limits 2 µg n l at sites a c through the storm cycle likely due to the strongly recycling and retention of this n species under anaerobic conditions in peat soils urban et al 2011 the percentage of don in the form of dcaa n n dcaa accounted for 5 16 mean value 9 7 of don across all sites through the storm cycle suggesting that a large proportion of don is present in non peptide forms this level of n dcaa is very similar to that observed for the mississippi river 5 23 duan and bianchi 2007 and a range of amazonian rivers 13 5 hedges et al 1994 but somewhat lower than that reported for rivers supplying the arctic ocean 38 dittmar et al 2001 the contribution of proteinaceous material to organic nitrogen in peat soils is typically higher 20 60 hagedorn et al 2000 90 yu et al 2002 and has been observed to go through a maximum in the fibric zone of the peat profile sowden et al 1978 here we obtained values in the range 20 30 mean value 25 3 for the amino acid content of our peat soil samples at the lower end of that reported previously 15n nmr analysis of a range of organic soils indicates that the majority of organically bound n is in the form of amino compounds including proteins peptides aminoquinones and aminosugars e g n acetyl glucosamine with lesser amounts of heterocyclic n compounds schulten and schnitzer 1997 thorn and cox 2009 it is very likely that the amino acid concentrations are underestimated due to poor recovery of some amino acids from acid hydrolysis e g trp and cys cys and there is some evidence that acid hydrolysis does not efficiently recover peptides in the presence of doc knicker and hatcher 1997 schulten and schnitzer 1997 even taking these effects into account it appears that the dcaa content of mobilised doc is less than in the peat soil from where it originates in general the carbon content of dcaa represents a very small part of the doc pool c dcaa values observed in this work range 0 5 2 8 mean value 1 1 were similar to that reported elsewhere 1 4 duan and bianchi 2007 2 4 calculated based on average amino acid carbon number of 5 2 dittmar et al 2001 1 3 thurman 1985 at all sites the c dcaa decreased during the storm cycle with a minimum value corresponding to maximum discharge and indicating the export of amino acid depleted doc from higher in the peat profile while we have not identified these doc components in this work it is likely material leached from decomposing sphagnum moss e g polysaccharides polyphenolics hájek et al 2011 4 4 temporal separation of dcaa doc and don comparison of n dcaa and c dcaa changes over the storm cycle suggests the presence of at least three independently mobile doc n fractions fast doc fast dcaa and slow doc don shown conceptually in fig 4 our interpretation of this behaviour centres around the initial rapid mobilisation of doc compounds containing very little nitrogen this is also evident from the c n ratios of the doc mobilised through the event so while carbon and nitrogen will largely co occur in the same molecules the early part of the doc pulse is more likely to contain highly mobile carbon rich organic molecules the fast dcaa represents relatively dcaa enriched material mobilised during the rising limb of the storm cycle and depleted soon after maximum flow wash out effect slow doc don is a relatively dcaa depleted material that is less mobile and appears in the later part of the storm cycle the decoupling of discharge and flux of dissolved constituents in storm flows has been observed previously in terms of a delayed delivery in doc and don edokpa et al 2015 and also through the early depletion of doc in a storm cycle in the later case this has been attributed to either the leaching of mobile doc from peat soil termed diffusion exhaustion worrall et al 2008 or the mixing of water from different paths evans and davies 1998 hagedorn et al 2000 here we provide evidence for different groups of doc don molecules mobilised by the changing water table in the peat profile that move through the peatland at different rates the presence of different molecular groups with different delivery timings offers a potential explanation for the observed c q behaviour in these systems with near equal concentrations of doc on both rising and falling limbs fig 1a figure s3 this behaviour can be explained by the mobilisation of different doc pools in the peat profile in response to activating flow paths higher in the peat profile as a consequence the molecular characteristics of mobilised doc change through the storm cycle for the dcaa containing material there are several feasible explanations for differential mobilities including i fast dcaa represents dcaa containing doc with a higher proportion of hydrophilic and therefore more water soluble amino acids ii the higher proportion of proteinaceous material in fast dcaa makes it more soluble and more mobile than slow doc don or iii fast dcaa represents a smaller molecular sized material that moves more rapidly through the peat soil across all sites there is very little evidence to support a difference in hydrophobicity between dcaa mobilised at different times during the storm cycle figures s3 s6 similarly while changes in the amino acid composition do occur over the storm cycle these differences were relatively small and only significant over larger time steps the second and third options seem more likely and the third also offers an explanation for the fast doc fraction that likely includes smaller and more mobile organic compounds e g low molecular weight organic acids the distribution of don over a range of molecular sizes is consistent with ultrafiltration separation of peatland drainage waters into low and high molecular weight categories with 25 of don partitioned into low molecular weight size class edokpa et al 2015 this idea could for example be tested through size exclusion chromatography that would likely reveal changes in the don distribution across molecular weight size classes through the storm cycle huber et al 2011 similarly direct analysis of low molecular weight doc e g organic acids would reveal whether these small and mobile molecules are eluted early in the storm pulse for example recent laboratory peat re wetting studies show an associated release burst of small reactive organic acids aristilde et al 2017 the direct measurement of these highly bioavailable components in stream waters has however not yet been attempted in any field based study to our knowledge 4 5 site differences and peatland condition the assessment of peatland condition is typically achieved using floristic characteristics e g vegetation types and cover or peat soil properties e g humification water holding capacity grover and baldock 2013 peatlands are locations of nutrient transformation and sources of organic carbon and it is likely that the molecular characteristics of doc exported from these systems reflect plant growth and peat soil processes for the three discrete peatland sites in this study a c the floristic and cover attributes indicate that peatland condition decreases in the order b c a across these three peatlands there are distinct differences in both the initial c n ratio of the exported doc as well as the c n ratio range over the storm cycle site a with the lowest initial c n ratio 17 1 also exhibited the widest c n range 17 1 44 1 suggesting a water table located low in the peat profile prior to the storm event and either a large movement of the water table in response to the storm event or a steeper c n gradient in the peat profile conversely site b had a high initial c n ratio 39 1 and a smaller c n range 39 1 47 1 over the storm cycle consistent with the condition order the c n ratio parameters of site c were intermediate between that of sites a and b in site b both the water table change during the storm cycle and peat c n ratios were measured fig 3c d and suggest that at peak flow the water table would have been in contact with peat soil with a much higher c n ratio approx 80 1 100 1 the significantly lower c n ratios observed in peak flow water likely reflect both the lower c n ratio of mobile doc as well as mixing with water from a range of depths in the profile an additional difference at site b compared to all other sites was the effective absence of fast doc component as indicated above this component likely includes small carbon rich molecules that are likely more bioavailable than larger doc molecules the apparent absence of this doc fraction at site b is consistent with a productive peatland system where these molecules are rapidly scavenged through microbial processes 4 6 conclusions in this work we have used the measurement of dcaa to explore the changing composition of doc and don exported from peatlands in response to a high intensity rain event through this approach we show that there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular fractions exported from these peatlands across the storm cycle during the rising limb the rapidly mobilised carbon rich compounds fast doc and protein rich fast dcaa are relatively more dominant whereas in the falling limb the slower mobilised doc don slow doc don compounds are more dominant the changing composition of doc is attributed to the activation of flow paths higher in the peat soil profile and likely reflects both changes in the characteristics of doc through the peat profile as well as differing mobilities of this doc the timing and delivery of doc from these peatlands likely has important implications for downstream headwater streams in terms of the delivery of bioavailable carbon and ecosystem responses while free proteins likely represent a highly available n source for in stream heterotrophic communities it remains unknown whether the protein peptides in the dcaa rich don fraction are more bioavailable it seems likely that this more mobile fraction represents smaller molecular sized doc n and or with a greater proportion of linked peptides in general the don exported from peatlands is not considered to be particularly bioavailable fenn et al 1998 urban et al 2011 however in a storm pulse don is mobilised from higher in the peat profile and likely represents less decomposed material that may be more bioavailable than don exported during base flows temporal separation of doc components is also potentially important if small molecules dominate the rising limb as they are more likely to include trigger molecules for ecological response in the associated streams derby and atema 1988 given the global interest in improving peatland restoration outcomes gorham and rochefort 2003 the assessment of condition through the analysis of the molecular composition of dissolved organic carbon offers an approach that is likely sensitive to peatland processes i e hydrology vegetation growth peat soil microbial processes our view is that further research into the molecular detail of doc in peatland drainage waters during base flow periods and

4622,transpiration dynamics of karst ecosystems are not conditioned only by the shallow soil water status mainly because of the presence of deep water source pools formed within the underlying bedrock if trees can develop their deep roots to the pools however the strength of these relationships and how as well as why they can vary from an area to another and from season to season are poorly understood due primarily to high heterogeneity of karst ecosystems therefore the present study was conducted during 2018 2019 rainy and dry seasons in a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest

use patterns and water sources were investigated for ligustrum lucidum through high resolution monitoring of the micrometeorology sap flow and soil moisture data in combination with the carbon stable isotope composition of the tree leaves as well as oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of the tree stem soil and deep water our findings showed that high transpiration rates of ligustrum lucidum were mainly associated with the soil moisture during rainy seasons 87 in total but the low rates were associated primarily with the deep water sources during dry seasons 13 in total during the rainy season when plenty of water was available to the plant ligustrum lucidum tended to obtain water inexpensively through the soil layers on average 59 and consumed it profligately through reduction of its water use efficiency wuei mean wuei rainy season 82 6 μmol mol in contrast during the dry season when limited water was available to the plant resulting from the significant reduction in rainfall ligustrum lucidum had to obtain the water expensively albeit at a small amount through deep water source pools on average 62 and consumed it conservatively through increasing its wuei mean

deficiency will provide necessary information on the responses of the plant to variations in the atmospheric and soil moisture conditions greco and baldocchi 1996 oren and pataki 2001 the way through which the plants increase maintain or decrease transpiration all year round is different in karst areas than the non karst areas and usually depends on two key factors rooting depth and water availability in the lower root zone of the trees in the non karst areas where the soil layers can be thick roots can easily grow in the soil because of the sufficient water strongly influencing the plant transpiration alarcón et al 2000 oren and pataki 2001 however in karst areas despite the thin soil layer with limited water storage many endemic trees have been found to be relatively insensitive to the upper soil drought conditions due to the ability to have access to the water from deeper sources jackson et al 2000 querejeta et al 2007 schwinning 2010 huang et al 2011 estrada medina et al 2013 carrière et al 2020 for example pockman et al 2008 found that during the prolonged drought plants can take up to 60 of total daily transpiration through their deep roots from the bedrock fissure under the karst of the edwards plateau texas us additionally huang et al 2009 demonstrated that in a karst landscape vegetated by cyclobalanopsis glauca transpiration was high which the highest contribution of water source was from epikarst during the dry season in addition to the mechanism of deep root development mentioned above there are several other mechanisms and strategies that can influence the plant transpiration including the increase in intrinsic water use efficiency wuei moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 olano et al 2014 cao et al 2020 formation of the leaves with thicker cuticles or waxy layers and well developed epidermal hairs barbeta peñuelas 2016 decreasing the stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 rumman et al 2017 or even reducing the growth rate olano et al 2014 however the nature of transpiration dynamics transpired water sources and water use strategies for trees in the karst ecosystems may vary from an area to another as well as from season to season primarily due to high heterogeneity of karst ecosystems to date several techniques have been employed to explore the mechanisms and strategies adopted by plants a large number of studies have used plant wue the ratio of carbon assimilated to water transpired by plant inferred from δ13c signatures i e the ratio of 13c to 12c of plant leaves and other materials to analyze plant performance under different water stress conditions querejeta et al 2006 cernusak et al 2013 nie et al 2014 esmaeilpour et al 2016 rumman et al 2017 cao et al 2020 ding et al 2020 at the leaf scale wuei the ratio of net assimilation to stomatal conductance was included to identify photosynthetic properties independent of or at a common evaporative demand osmond et al 1980 a simplified linear model farquhar et al 1982 was often used to estimate the leaf scale wuei to the value of which it is negatively correlated with photosynthetic 13c discrimination δ and positively with ci ca i e the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 partial pressures besides this linear model could be explicitly linked the performance of plant wue with water availability in c3 plants craven et al 2013 whereby their high wue are reflected in less negative δ13c and low ci ca and vice versa farquhar richards 1984 dawson et al 2002 seibt et al 2008 therefore wuei derived from stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c of plant tissues is frequently used as indicator of long term trends in the internal regulation of carbon uptake and water loss of plants chaves et al 2004 seibt et al 2008 leonardi et al 2012 hu et al 2019 on the other hand analyses of stable oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h isotope ratios determine potential water sources used by plants white et al 1985 ehleringer and dawson 1992 ogle et al 2014 barbeta et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 2017 liu et al 2019 it has been assumed that no isotopic fractionation occurs when water enters the roots and therefore helps estimating the mixing ratio of xylem water from different water sources white et al 1985 ehleringer dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 mcdonnell 2014 evaristo et al 2017 carrière et al 2020 various mixing models based on dual isotope ratio approach have been developed for the apportioning of water sources used by plant including linear mixing models e g isosource phillips gregg 2003 and bayesian mixing model e g mixsiar stock semmens 2013 mixsir moore semmens 2008 and siar parnell et al 2010 and isotoper hopkins ferguson 2012 these multisource mixing models have been efficacious for the apportioning of plant water sources in complex natural ecosystems such as karst ecosystems where there are often more than two water sources for plant use mccole stern 2007 rong et al 2011 nie et al 2012 liu et al 2019 however a number of factors are at play to decide which stable isotope mixing model simm to apply including mixtures and sources assemblages of single or multiple populations sample sizes researcher s intended level of inference e g individual or population level and users familiarity with a particular framework to develop more efficient approaches for statistical analysis for example isotoper s user interface in r provides researchers with a user friendly tool for simm analysis and can incorporate all substantial simm features i e components of the model expressed in mathematical terms using a fully bayesian approach to more accurately infer relative contributions for sources hopkins ferguson 2012 this model also allows a user to make statistical inference on each individual in the population even when there may beonly one observation for each individual additionally the model structure allows for incorporating replicated observations of the same individual in the analysis process resulting in less influence from the population level and more accurate individual level estimates therefore the model has a hierarchical structure as its point estimates is contingent on the group or population s distribution hopkins ferguson 2012 notably like other simms this model adopts the same basic methodology for identifying plant water source apportionment for example a duel isotope e g δ18o and δ2h multiple endmember linear mixing model can be formulated for estimating the relative contribution f of multiple water sources 1 2 3 n to a mixture of stem water m based on the following mass balance equations schwarcz 1991 1 δ m 18 o f 1 δ 1 18 o f 2 δ 2 18 o f 3 δ 3 18 o f n δ n 18 o 2 δ m 2 h f 1 δ 1 2 h f 2 δ 2 2 h f 3 δ 3 2 h f n δ n 2 h 3 f 1 f 2 f 3 f n 1 where fi is the relative source contributions to a mixture m and δm i 18o and δm i 2h are the isotope signatures for mixtures and sources respectively quantifying stand scale transpiration via monitoring the sap flowof a single tree in a field has been another technique of interest in plant water use research for the past two decades wilson et al 2001 kumagai et al 2007 du et al 2011 chang et al 2014 miyazawa et al 2014 liu et al 2018 han et al 2019 the sap flow measurements which is not restricted by the spatio temporal variability link et al 2014 allows us to determine the total quantity of water transpired by tree species on a daily basis as well as to characterize the ecological and physiological mechanisms that tree species use to cope with limited availability of soil water pataki et al 2000 du et al 2011 huang et al 2011 berry et al 2017 although the combined use of these techniquesis strongly emphasized in exploring the mechanisms and strategies that tree species use to adapt and survive in environments with various water stresses it has not always been possible due to rising costs of sampling and analysis the present study was conducted during 2018 2019 rainy and dry seasons in a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest china to explore transpiration responses and water use strategies of a dominant woody plant species evergreen ligustrum lucidum growing in a habitat with the typical shallow soils using sap flow transpiration data leaf δ13c and xylem i e plant stem and source water δ2h and δ18o this study aimed to achieve the following 1 quantifying the amount of water transpired by the plant during different seasons 2 revealing the nature of potential water sources providing the water needed for plant transpiration during different seasons 3 determining the contributions and seasonal patterns of different potential water sources used by the plant and 4 determining the plant wuei and its seasonal patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the longfeng karst trough valley 106 25 22 106 28 06 e 29 45 35 29 49 02 n belonging to the northern part of the zhongliang mountain located in the guanyinxia anticline chongqing southwest china fig 1 a 1b was chosen as the site of this study the altitude of the longfeng karst trough valley ranges from 480 to 640 m and it covers an area of 11 7 km2 with three ridges and two valleys the limestone and dolomite components of the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f and middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l formed the karst trough valleys and the erosion resistant sandstone and shale components of t1 f and the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj formed the ridges fig 1b a dense network of open fractures has been developed in the limestone bedrock of the karst trough valleys providing the basic conditions for the development of karst forms such as fissures sinkholes karst pits and underground rivers rainwater and surface water are quickly discharged into karst aquifers through fissures sinkholes or karst pits and eventually into underground rivers which can limit the storage of available water for plants in shallow zones the longfeng valley is affected by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean air temperature of 18 2 c and precipitation of 1104 mm approximately 75 85 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season from april to october the soil in the study site is thin with a depth of 10 50 cm the soil types are mainly clay and silt which have covered most highly fractured bedrock outcrops the forest land is the main land use and its vegetation is mostly evergreen woody plant species ligustrum lucidum also known as chinese glossy privet cinnamomum camphora robinia pseudoacacia and celtis sinensis most trees are over 20 years of age detailed information regarding the study area was presented in liu et al 2019 fig 1 a geographic location of the study area b hydrological geology and sampling points in the study area c ligustrum lucidum d sap flow measurement 2 2 measurement of microclimatic parameters various climatic parameters including precipitation p air temperature t relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs were recorded at a frequency of once every 15 min throughout each sampling season july november 2018 february and april 2019 by an automatic microclimatic station campbell scientific inc logan ut usa this station was installed in an open place within the study site with a distance of 250 2500 m away from the sampling plots fig 1b and an elevation of 5 25 m higher than the canopy the accuracies of climate parameters were 0 1 mm 0 1 c 1 and 0 1 mjm 2 for p t rh and rs respectively meanwhile the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated using t and rh per hour according to the following formula yang et al 2015 4 vpd 0 611 e x p 17 502 t t 24 97 1 r h 2 3 measurement of sap flow sap flux density was determined based on the thermal diffusion principle cohen et al 1981 burgess et al 2001 for this two replicate woody species of ligustrum lucidum selected in the investigation plot 1 fig 1b c were instrumented with thermal dissipation probes ecomatik germany installed on the north facing side of plant stem avoiding direct sunlight at a height of 1 3 m with the distance of 10 cm between them fig 1d measurements were performed every 30 s and recorded as 15 averages for 20 days from 5th to 25th day during each sampling season july november 2018 february and april 2019 the measured dbh and sapwood area mean 1 sd were 13 1 1 8 cm and 86 3 19 4 cm2 respectively the instantaneous temperature difference between the probes was converted into a voltage value recorded by a data logger dl2e delta t devices uk sap flux density sfd of ligustrum lucidum in the investigation plot was calculated according to the following formula granier 1987 5 sfd 119 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where sfd was sap flux density gh2om 2 s 1 δt was the temperature difference between the two probes c and δtmax was the maximum value of δt recorded at the no transpiration period when sfd was near zero c to determine whole tree transpiration the obtained sfd data were normalized to minimize differences among replicated trees as described by du et al 2011 whole tree daily transpiration et kgh2oday 1 can be calculated by the

1000 is the constant for g converts to kg 2 4 plant tissue soil air and water sample collection six 0 01 ha 10 10 m plots that would cover almost the entire spatial heterogeneity study site were randomly established for plant and soil sampling fig 1b in each plot a healthy mature woody species of ligustrum lucidum similar in diameter to the other selected trees was selected for sampling in all seasons july november 2018 february and april 2019 in each season seven to ten leaves of each tree were collected using a pole pruner with no orientation when collecting them measurements were made using mature intact sunlit upper canopy leaves then all samples were dried in an oven at 70 c for 3 days frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder pass through a 100 mesh screen for the δ13c determination additionally within each season a 100 cm gas sample was collected using an air bag 300 ml at the elevation 5 25 m higher than that of all the sampling plots at the same meteorological station position representing the air of the upper canopy to measure the air co2 concentration for δ13ca determination see eqs 7 and 8 moreover three to five suberized branches of each tree were obtained from the canopy branches were chipped in the field and immediately placed in a capped vial and wrapped in parafilm to minimize the effect of evaporative enrichment by water loss through unsuberized stems until extraction ehleringer dawson 1992 to analyze the δ2h and δ18o at each plot three spots were randomly chosen for soil sampling soil samples were collected with a soil auger from depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm n 2 per soil layer at each sampling season all collected samples were immediately stored in the glass capped bottles wrapped with parafilm to prevent the evaporation and were kept frozen in a refrigerator until the δ2h and δ18o analysis on the other hand previous studies have shown liu et al 2019 cao et al 2020 that the general trends in soil moisture at depths of 0 20 and 0 40 cm in multiple spots of the study site during different seasons were almost similar and there was no significant difference between sampling spots p 0 05 therefore we selected only one out of six sampling plots for a high precision monitoring of soil moisture content smc for this two sensors av ec5 were placed at the depth of 0 20 smc0 20 and 20 40 cm soil smc20 40 with the accuracy of

season a total of six deep water i e epikarst water and groundwater samples were regularly gathered from the outlets of one epikarst spring n 2 and two underground rivers n 4 in the study site fig 1b for the δ18o and δ2h determination all water samples collected were sealed and stored in the same manner as the plant branches and soil samples all plant soil air and water measurements were replicated with an interval of approximately 10 15 days within each season 2 5 isotopic analyses water was extracted from the ligustrum lucidum branches stem and soil samples using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system ehleringer et al 2000 orlowski et al 2013 li 2100 lica beijing china extraction efficiency 99 transferred into 2 ml sealed brown bottles and stored at 4 c before conducting the δ2h and δ18o analyses the δ2h and δ18o values were measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia gla431 tlwia 912 0050 los gatos research usa at the national monitoring base for purple soil fertility and fertilizer efficiency chongqing china to avoid errors of isotope ratios induced by organic compounds millar et al 2018 west et al 2010 the spectral contamination identifier lwia sci post processing software los gatos research inc was employed to examine whether there was spectral interference in the isotope data from the extracted plant stem water and corrected using the standard curves created by the los gatos research engineers schultz et al 2011 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values were expressed as the per mil deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow accuracy for δ2h and δ18o 0 5 and 0 2 respectively the δ13c values of the leaves and air were determined through an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms usa at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences guiyang china the δ13c values were expressed as the delta notation per mil deviation from the standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb accuracy 0 2 2 6 data analysis the δ2h and δ18o values of xylem water can provide information on the water sources of plants jackson et al 1999 both epikarst spring and the underground river were considered as a deep water source because their water samples exhibited similar isotopic compositions and could be distinguished from other water sources i e soil water from upper lower soil layers we applied isotoper as a comprehensive bayesian mixing model to calculate relative contribution of each water source to the stem water of the woody plant the basic terms and formulas and prior distributions of the model with comparative analysis are presented by hopkins ferguson 2012 we first carried out several sensitivity analyses using the isotopic signatures i e δ18o and δ2h of mixture and source population to test the relative impact of 1 sample size 2 isotopic signature standard deviations sd in the mixture and source populations 3 the isotopic signature difference between the sources 4 analytical sd i e sd among replicated samples and 5 the value of inferences for different sources so as to find situations where the uncertainty of source proportion estimates could be minimized see e g phillips gregg 2001 accordingly we found that the population had a major effect on individual source estimates so that increasing the sample size especially when replicated measurements of the same individual were included significantly reduced the proportion variability sd and improved the inferences therefore we extended our model with a shared individual variance across populations it should be added that each individual had a unique mean and variance for each isotopic signature which were assumed to follow independent normal distributions semmens et al 2009 besides it was necessary to calculate an isotopic correlation coefficient for the mixtures and the sources to accurately estimate proportional source contributions because the δ18o and δ2h signatures in individual plant and soil water compartments are often highly correlated phillips gregg 2001 therefore we calculated these values using bayesian methods to correct the variance estimates for all the sources and then incorporated those as terms in the covariance matrix in addition to including these corrections we accounted for the error associated with measurement and incorporated it to each observation in our model however we did not include a residual error term to account for the uncertainty otherwise unaccounted for in the mixture and source populations in our estimation process as the correlation in the mixture population was accounted for by the correlation in the sources see e g hopkins ferguson 2012 following semmens et al 2009 a gibbs sampler a markov chain monte carlo algorithm was applied to perform the model with random effects to allow for individual variation within populations using 3 parallel chains in jags in the end we reported our estimates as average 1sd for the individual sources at the population level fig 4a photosynthetic 13c discrimination δ13c was calculated from the 13c 12c ratio in leaves according to farquhar and richards 1984 7 δ 13 c δ 13 c a δ 13 c p 1 δ 13 c p 1000 where δ13c a and δ13c p were the δ13c values of co2 in ambient air assumed to be 8 seibt et al 2008 and plant leaves respectively intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was estimated using the species mean δ13c according to a leaf scale model of c3 photosynthetic isotope discrimination farquhar et al 1989 8 wue i c a b δ 13 c 1 6 b a c a was the co2 concentration in the ambient air a was the 13co2 fractionation as a result of diffusion through stomata pores 4 4 o leary 1981 and b was the fractionation during carboxylation by the co2 fixing enzyme rubisco 27 farquhar richards 1984 notably this simplified linear model can also implicitly account for internal co2 transfer seibt et al 2008 which often leads to the overestimation of δ13c and thus underprediction of wuei and this deviation is augmented with assimilation rate especially in plant growth period when there is a high rate of assimilation and photosynthesis farquhar et al 1989 therefore we did take into account possible uncertainty associated with it although our main focus was not to estimate the actual value of wuei fitting of the model according to multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss statistics 25 ibm co ny usa it should be added that all variables in the regression analysis were standardized using a enter method and standardized coefficients were interpreted 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in precipitation and air temperature the total precipitation throughout the study period july 2018 april 2019 was 823 6 mm about 84 692 1 mm of which occurred between july and october 2018 and april 2019 i e the rainy season with the highest monthly precipitation amount occurring in july 199 mm most precipitation events during this period were relatively intense and frequent which would result in lower stress for plant water uptake approximately 16 of precipitation 131 5 mm occurred between november 2018 and march 2019 dry season with the lowest monthly precipitation amount occurring in february 2019 3 9 mm fig 2 a most precipitation events during this five month period were less intense with lower frequency which may increase the water stress on plants driving them to obtain water from different sources cao et al 2020 the monthly average estimated mean minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the study period were 19 5 7 1 and 36 6 c respectively the highest and lowest monthly average daily temperatures recorded were 32 3 and 11 1 c in july 2018 and february 2019 respectively fig 2a 3 2 seasonal variations in soil moisture content as shown in fig 2b there were significant differences in the soil moisture content smc of the upper and lower soil layers p 0 05 with average values of 23 4 and 28 5 throughout the study period july 2018 april 2019 respectively indicating that in the lower soil layer there was always during the different seasons more moisture content for plant uptake in addition there were significant temporal changes in the smc of both soil layers that were consistent with the seasonal variations in precipitation the average smc of the upper and lower soil layers were 32 3 and 26 1 during the rainy season and 24 7 and 20 7 during the dry season respectively this indicates a significant reduction in the smc of the soil layers due to the remarkable reduction in rainfall which could cause severe stress in plants when taking up water from the soil layers fig 2 daily variations in a precipitation p mm air temperature t c b soil

the average daily et of ligustrum lucidum in july and november 2018 and february and april 2019 were 15 5 varying from 5 2 to 22 9 kg h2o day 1 1 6 varying from 0 7 to 3 2 kg h2o day 1 1 8 varying from 0 9 to 3 8 kg h2o day 1 and 6 8 kgh2oday 1 varying from 1 9 to 10 kg h2o day 1 respectively accordingly the average proportions of plant water uptake occurring in july and november 2018 and february and april 2019 were 60 6 7 and 27 respectively these results indicated that the amount of plant water uptake during the rainy growing season especially in july 2018 was significantly higher than that during the dry season based on the standard multiple linear regression models presented below both the rainy and dry seasons the variations in et were affected by six environmental factors

xylem water samples in july and november 2018 and february and april 2019 were 69 8 47 4 45 2 and 52 8 respectively table 2 with an average value of 53 8 and their δ18o values were 9 8 7 5 8 2 and 8 4 respectively with an average value of 8 5 the isotopic values δ2h and δ18o of the soil water varied seasonally and with soil depth at the study area and the δ2h and δ18o values of the soil water samples from both soil layers were more positive during the dry season november 2018 and february 2019 than those during the rainy season july 2018 and april 2019 fig 3a 3b table 2 however the δ2h and δ18o values of soil water samples for the upper soil layer were more positive than those of the lower soil layer the δ2h values of the soil water samples of the upper soil layer in july and november 2018 and february and april 2019 were 77 4 46 9 40 4 and 53 3 respectively table 2 with an average value equal of 54 5 and their δ18o values were 9 3 7 4 7 3 and 9 0 respectively table 2 with an average value equal of 8 2 in contrast the δ2h values for the soil water samples from the lower soil layer in july and november 2018 and february and april 2019 were 80 1 52 2 48 6 and 64 5 respectively with an average value of 61 4 and the δ18o values were 10 7 8 1 8 5 and 10 4 respectively with an average value equal of 9 4 the δ2h and δ18o values of deep water epikarst water and groundwater samples during the rainy season were close to those during the dry season and varied less than those of the soil water samples the δ2h values of the deep water samples in july and november

average value equal of 7 8 these small variations in the δ2h and δ18o values of the deep water during the study period agreed with the results reported in other studies perrin et al 2003 mccole and

2019 all data were presented as average 1sd of replicates the isotoper mixing model was used to determine the proportions of various water sources used by ligustrum lucidum according to the isotoper outputs there were significant seasonal variations in the proportions of the various water sources for plant uptake fig 4b in july 2018 mid rainy season ligustrum lucidum mostly utilized water from the lower soil layer average 1sd proportions of 46 9 followed by the deep water pools i e epikarsts and underground river and upper soil layer average proportion of 36 3 and 18 7 respectively in november 2018 and february 2019 early to mid dry season the plant primarily extracted water from the deep water pools average proportions of 64 19 and 60 14 respectively followed by the lower average

and 114 59 μmol mol respectively 4 discussion 4 1 ecological significance of seasonal transpiration and its relationship with key environmental factors our results showed that the plant water use rate significantly varied from one season to another accordingly the plant taken up a remarkable amount of water approximately 87 of its total annual transpiration during the rainy growing season particularly during the middle of the rainy season july 2018 while it did much less during the dry season the high rate of transpiration was very important during the growing season as previous studies had also emphasized as it could mainly contribute to photosynthesis and plant growth oren and pataki 2001 yepez et al 2003 scott et al 2006 cavanaugh et al 2011 besides some studies have also shown that a small amount of transpiration during each dry season has been requiredto maintain the plant health and functioning until the next growing season biederman et al 2018 szutu papuga 2019 according to the results several potential reasons might have explained the high rate of water use during the rainy season the most popular of which was an increase in vpd frequently exceeding 1 kpa fig 2c resulting in more stomatal conductance and further escape of water molecules from plant leaves to form transpiration fetcher et al 1994 zheng wang 2014 the increase in t fig 2a was another significant factor as it would primarily enhance photosynthetic production and the plant growth hari et al 1986 nöjda et al 2017 we also found that the transpiration of the plant was sensitive to soil moisture in both soil layers especially lower soil layer as the soil moisture was the predominant source of the plant water uptake during the rainy season which would regularly replenish by significant rainfall with relatively high frequency keeping soil drought stress to a minimum however as we will explain in the next section soil moisture alone was not enough to supply all the water needed to be transpired by the plant during the rainy season and the rest on average 41 would come from deep water source pools overall these findings were in line with some previous studies which have shown that higher vpd and t at moist sites during growing season when ample water is available to the plant water uptake increase transpiration dynamics xu li 2006 clausnitzer et al 2011 zheng wang 2014 yan et al 2018 in contrast low transpiration during the dry season was the result of vpd rarely exceeding 1 kpa with rs fig 2c implying a strong stomatal control facing water stress schulze et al 1994 yan et al 2018 additionally it could be associated with a significant reduction in soil moisture due to a significant reduction in rainfall during the dry season as our results indicated that transpiration was not sensitive to any moisture in the two soil layers during this period time primarily because the plant extracted a significant fraction of little water required for its dry season transpiration from deep water source pools explained in the next section secondly and most importantly due to a strong stomatal control linked to limited available soil moisture as water stress has been found to increase the sensitivity of canopy stomatal control or plant hydraulic resistance to light and vapor pressure deficit during the drought periods zheng wang 2014 wang et al 2020 decreasing the water use from deep water source pools even if there was ample water in those pools to absorb similar findingshavealsobeenreportedfrompreviousstudies that there is a significant relationship between drought sensitivity and the relative reduction in the amount of water used by drought sensitive tree species during dry periods which has been associated with the deficit of soil moisture due to low and insufficient amount of rainfall sperry et al 2002 du et al 2011 chang et al 2014 nan et al 2019 accordingly the endemic woody plant species of ligustrum lucidum can be categorized as drought sensitive because its transpiration rate was significantly influenced by the seasonal variations in rainfall and soil moisture du et al 2011 yan et al 2018 4 2 the nature of seasonal water sources transpired by ligustrum lucidum the results showed that ligustrum lucidum utilized a combination of all of the potential water sources during all seasons thus during the rainy season july 2018 and april 2019 when the water stress was low and soil moisture content was high due to the sufficient rainfall capture by the soil layers this tree species predominantly utilized the soil water and used less deep water epikarst water and groundwater than it did during the dry season november 2018 and february 2019 in contrast during the dry season the fraction of deep water in the xylem water of ligustrum lucidum increased significantly with increasing water stress and decreasing soil moisture content due to the low rainfall and water holding capacity in the shallow soils of this heterogeneous karst area this indicates a clear seasonal shift in the water use strategy of ligustrum lucidum moreover it could also be a clear indicator of specialized dimorphic root systems for the plant allowing to extract water from shallow water sources growth pools during the rainy season and from deep water sources maintenance pools during the dry season ryel et al 2008 2010 some studies in karst areas with shallow soils have documented that the roots of plants are predominantly restricted to the upper 2 m of the soil bedrock profile querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 therefore it could be difficult for the plant to develop most of its shallow roots deep into the lower layers of the bedrock however several studies have reported that the roots of many plants in limestone karst areas with shallow soils can grow deep into the lower layers of the bedrock white et al 1985 jackson et al 1999 querejeta et al 2006 2007 schwinning 2008 nie et al 2011 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2014 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 recently liu et al 2019 reported similar seasonal water use strategies for two other native tree species in the same area implying flexibility in gaining access to shallow and deep water source pools during different seasons in this heterogeneous karst area to compensate for limited soil water storage particularly during the dry season the water use strategies due to changing environmental conditions are referred to as plasticity dimorphic root systems liu et al 2014 furthermore the analysis of the isotoper results indicated that despite the permanent and reliable access to deep water source pools in the rainy season providing more water storage for plant uptake than what was available in dry season ligustrum lucidum tended to use more of shallow water pools as we will explain in the next section this could likely be due to the fact that taking up water from deep water source pools by deep root systems requires more metabolic energy compared to the water that is captured by shallow root systems ksenzhek volkov 1998 some recent studies have also demonstrated that plants use deep water source pools only to maintain their growth and survival under drought stress conditions even when the pools can provide large amounts water for plant uptake ryel et al 2008 2010 bleby et al 2010 documented that deep roots depth of 20 m were approximately five times more active than the shallow roots depth of 0 0 5 m during drought periods when the shallow water supply was insufficient for plant use however after receiving rainfall and balancing shallow water storage the deep roots were immediately deactivated therefore ligustrum lucidum used shallow water source pools as an energy efficient options for supporting growth and used deep water source pools as energy demanding but safe options only for maintaining their survival water source pools as well as their proportion contributions of used by ligustrum lucidum were presented to compare in a conceptual model fig 4a b fig 4 a conceptual diagram of water source pools available for an endemic woody plant species ligustrum lucidum in a limestone karst area b proportions of the contributions of potential water sources upper and lower soil water and deep water used by ligustrum lucidum and c intrinsic water use efficiency wuei values of the woody plant during different seasons 2018 2019 all results were presented as average 1sd of replicates 4 3 relationship between transpiration with wuei and elucidation of seasonal ecohydrological events according to the results the ligustrum lucidum leaf δ13c values ranged from 28 33 to 32 20 similar to those of other dominant tree species in the same area 28 1 to 32 8 cao et al 2020 indicating that the photosynthetic pathway of this tree species belongs to c3 plants whose leaf δ13c values 20 to 35 differ from those of c4 plants 7 to 15 o leary 1981 as our results showed wuei and δ13c was low during the rainy season figs 3c 4c table 3 just when significant transpiration 87 of total annual transpiration occurred this implies a partial plant s leaves stomatal opening during this time period facilitating the release of water molecules in the form of unsaturated vapor and the entry of co2 molecules through plant leaves ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 as a result these interactions could intensify the plant s thirst ainsworth rogers 2007 hence prompting the plant to take up more water from the available water sources most researchers believe that the main role in the amount of water that can be taken up and its translocation from the roots to the leaves is related to transpiration which provides the formation of a hydrodynamic pressure gradient along the entire length of a plant due to the formation of negative pressure in its upper parts i e leaves hence allowing to pull sap through the plant xylem vessels without the need to spend any metabolic energy ksenzhek volkov 1998 thus the greater the intensity of transpiration the greater the amount of water pulled along the xylem vessels however the action of pulling water caused by the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is not sufficient to stimulate the plant s transport systems because the plant effectively employs a special force called root pressure capturing the water from the corresponding water source pools soil water and deep water through root systems and pumping it into the xylem vessels at the expense of a minimum metabolic energy ksenzhek volkov 1998 as described above during the rainy season ligustrum lucidum tended to obtain more water from the soil layers just when these water pools could be sufficiently fed by abundant rainfall with high frequency this suggests that water extraction from these shallow water source pools would likely be more time saving and energy efficient for the plant use compared to the deep water source pools as shorter transport from the shallow water pools probably needed to generate less root pressure for delivering the water to the xylem in addition to these physiological events the entry of co2 which is recognized as an essential component in the process of photosynthesis collatz et al 1991 could potentially help increase the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth ainsworth rogers 2007 thus during the rainy season minimum water stress associated with soil moisture deficit could occur and impact the normal plant water uptake process allowing the plant to maximize its growth and photosynthesis rates without reducing stomatal conductance and the transpiration rate this suggests that ligustrum lucidum might simultaneously benefit from profligate water use strategy during the rainy season nie et al 2014 cao et al 2020 accordingly under this water use strategy the water that the plant could easily cheaply obtain from soil layers through its shallow roots could also be easily profligately lost through its leaves during the rainy season in contrast during the dry season the plant would suffer from a shortage of soil water due to a significant reduction in rainfall according to our results it seems that the plant adopted a constructive strategy for managing this water stress during the dry season yan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as it had increased its wuei by an average of 15 and reduced its total transpiration rate by approximately one seventh of the rainy season transpiration i e equivalent to 13 of its total annual transpiration thus this sharp decrease in transpiration rate reflecting the partial stomatal closure of the plant s leaves limits the formation of a hydrodynamic pressure gradient hence preventing the plant from taking up too much water from the available water source pools huc guehl 1989 granier et al 1992 additionally given that most of its water needed during this time period comes from deep water source pools on average 62 capturing and pumping the same small amount water by deep root systems required more energy than the fraction of water that could be extracted from the soil water pools and delivered to its xylem vessels ksenzhek volkov 1998 however despite having the necessary tool dimorphic root system to extract deep water even if there was enough water in these pools the plant would be unable to lift much more water along its xylem vessels during the dry season for the same reason mentioned earlier i e the existence of a limited hydrodynamic pressure gradient due to very low transpiration granier et al 1992 as a result this mechanism would not allow the plant to alleviate all of the drought stress associated with the soil moisture deficit by taking up enough or more water from deep water source pools overall all of these ecohydrological events show that the plant tended to adopt a conservative water uptake strategy during the dry season consequently the plant had to extract uneasily expensively most of the required water albeit at a small amount through deep water source pools and consume it uneasily conservatively through increasing the wuei by reducing its leaves stomata in order to maintain its survival during the dry season 5 conclusions we investigated transpiration responses and water use strategies of a dominant evergreen tree species ligustrum lucidum growing in a karst habitat with the typical shallow soils which relies on various water sources the site chosen was a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest china toachieveourgoals we took into account seasonal variations in the sap flow transpiration rates leaf δ13c and δ2h and δ18o of the soil moisture upper and lower soil layers deep water epikarst water and groundwater and tree stem water samples using the sap flow and soil moisture data we found that ligustrum lucidum maintained its rainy growth season transpiration at high rates under the control of key environmental factors such as vpd and t in response to favorable soil moisture conditions however it reduced its dry season transpiration at very low rates under the control of vpd and rs due to sensitivity to unfavorable soil moisture conditions according to the results obtained from the isotoper model based on the δ2h and δ18o values it was revealed that during different seasons the plant used a combination of soil water and deep water so that the contribution of the water obtained from the soil water was higher than the deep water during the rainy season and vice versa during the dry season the signal of a seasonal shift in the pattern of the plant water uptake among different seasons was mainly attributed to the functionally dimorphic root system of ligustrum lucidum reflecting a greater degree of ecological plasticity of the plants in karst ecosystems meanwhile it highlights that the transpiration dynamics of ligustrum lucidum was largely a function of soil moisture and deep water during the rainy and dry seasons respectively using the seasonal patterns of wuei values based on the δ13c values we found that the plant water use efficiency was low and high during the rainy and dry seasons respectively signaling a seasonal shift in the water use strategy for the plant from a profligate water use pattern in the rainy season to a conservative water use pattern in the dry season thus ligustrum lucidum overall strategy for managing the water consumption was obtaining the water efficiently and consuming it profligately in order to maximize its growth and photosynthesis rate during the rainy growing season in contrast the plant had to extract the water using much energy and consume it conservatively in order to maintain its survival during the dry season thus applying a combined approach to understand the strategies and mechanisms of water use by plants especially in the heterogeneous karst areas can help us gain more insights partly rather than simply using the sap flow or isotopic techniques alone credit authorship

4622,transpiration dynamics of karst ecosystems are not conditioned only by the shallow soil water status mainly because of the presence of deep water source pools formed within the underlying bedrock if trees can develop their deep roots to the pools however the strength of these relationships and how as well as why they can vary from an area to another and from season to season are poorly understood due primarily to high heterogeneity of karst ecosystems therefore the present study was conducted during 2018 2019 rainy and dry seasons in a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest china to explore the functional responses to reduced water availability of evergreen ligustrum lucidum chinese glossy privet growing on the shallow soils seasonal variations in the transpiration water use patterns and water sources were investigated for ligustrum lucidum through high resolution monitoring of the micrometeorology sap flow and soil moisture data in combination with the carbon stable isotope composition of the tree leaves as well as oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of the tree stem soil and deep water our findings showed that high transpiration rates of ligustrum lucidum were mainly associated with the soil moisture during rainy seasons 87 in total but the low rates were associated primarily with the deep water sources during dry seasons 13 in total during the rainy season when plenty of water was available to the plant ligustrum lucidum tended to obtain water inexpensively through the soil layers on average 59 and consumed it profligately through reduction of its water use efficiency wuei mean wuei rainy season 82 6 μmol mol in contrast during the dry season when limited water was available to the plant resulting from the significant reduction in rainfall ligustrum lucidum had to obtain the water expensively albeit at a small amount through deep water source pools on average 62 and consumed it conservatively through increasing its wuei mean wuei rainy season 108 6 μmol mol our findings can provide the insights into temporal transpiration dynamics as well as the strategies and mechanisms adopted by the plants to counteract the seasonal drought stress associated with the shallow soils in karst ecosystems keywords seasonal transpiration sap flow stable isotopes wuei deep water limestone karst area 1 introduction karst landforms are a major natural landscape covering an area of over 22 million km2 worldwide ford and williams 2007 a unique karst limestone landscape can be found in southwest china with an area of approximately 500 000 km2 yuan 1994 this area is highly heterogeneous with non continuous shallow soil average depth of less than 50 cm from the underlying limestone rong et al 2011 liu et al 2019 additionally shallow soils are often underlain by fractured bedrock resulting in a high percolation capacity and low water holdingcapacity in the soil layers rong et al 2011 jiang et al 2014 yan et al 2019 although this humid subtropical monsoon region receives an average annual rainfall of over 1000 mm it experiencesan annual four or five month drought often between november and march nie et al 2012 these conditions may individually lead to drought water stress that can limit the survival growth and distribution of karst vegetation species particularly duringprolonged drought periods white et al 1985 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 rong et al 2011 heilman et al 2014 nie et al 2011 2014 cao et al 2020 transpiration is a critical physiological mechanism involved in water conservation strategies which allows for plant growth and survival nobel 2005 muñoz villers et al 2018 thus investigating the transpiration process under the conditions of water deficiency will provide necessary information on the responses of the plant to variations in the atmospheric and soil moisture conditions greco and baldocchi 1996 oren and pataki 2001 the way through which the plants increase maintain or decrease transpiration all year round is different in karst areas than the non karst areas and usually depends on two key factors rooting depth and water availability in the lower root zone of the trees in the non karst areas where the soil layers can be thick roots can easily grow in the soil because of the sufficient water strongly influencing the plant transpiration alarcón et al 2000 oren and pataki 2001 however in karst areas despite the thin soil layer with limited water storage many endemic trees have been found to be relatively insensitive to the upper soil drought conditions due to the ability to have access to the water from deeper sources jackson et al 2000 querejeta et al 2007 schwinning 2010 huang et al 2011 estrada medina et al 2013 carrière et al 2020 for example pockman et al 2008 found that during the prolonged drought plants can take up to 60 of total daily transpiration through their deep roots from the bedrock fissure under the karst of the edwards plateau texas us additionally huang et al 2009 demonstrated that in a karst landscape vegetated by cyclobalanopsis glauca transpiration was high which the highest contribution of water source was from epikarst during the dry season in addition to the mechanism of deep root development mentioned above there are several other mechanisms and strategies that can influence the plant transpiration including the increase in intrinsic water use efficiency wuei moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 olano et al 2014 cao et al 2020 formation of the leaves with thicker cuticles or waxy layers and well developed epidermal hairs barbeta peñuelas 2016 decreasing the stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 rumman et al 2017 or even reducing the growth rate olano et al 2014 however the nature of transpiration dynamics transpired water sources and water use strategies for trees in the karst ecosystems may vary from an area to another as well as from season to season primarily due to high heterogeneity of karst ecosystems to date several techniques have been employed to explore the mechanisms and strategies adopted by plants a large number of studies have used plant wue the ratio of carbon assimilated to water transpired by plant inferred from δ13c signatures i e the ratio of 13c to 12c of plant leaves and other materials to analyze plant performance under different water stress conditions querejeta et al 2006 cernusak et al 2013 nie et al 2014 esmaeilpour et al 2016 rumman et al 2017 cao et al 2020 ding et al 2020 at the leaf scale wuei the ratio of net assimilation to stomatal conductance was included to identify photosynthetic properties independent of or at a common evaporative demand osmond et al 1980 a simplified linear model farquhar et al 1982 was often used to estimate the leaf scale wuei to the value of which it is negatively correlated with photosynthetic 13c discrimination δ and positively with ci ca i e the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 partial pressures besides this linear model could be explicitly linked the performance of plant wue with water availability in c3 plants craven et al 2013 whereby their high wue are reflected in less negative δ13c and low ci ca and vice versa farquhar richards 1984 dawson et al 2002 seibt et al 2008 therefore wuei derived from stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c of plant tissues is frequently used as indicator of long term trends in the internal regulation of carbon uptake and water loss of plants chaves et al 2004 seibt et al 2008 leonardi et al 2012 hu et al 2019 on the other hand analyses of stable oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h isotope ratios determine potential water sources used by plants white et al 1985 ehleringer and dawson 1992 ogle et al 2014 barbeta et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 2017 liu et al 2019 it has been assumed that no isotopic fractionation occurs when water enters the roots and therefore helps estimating the mixing ratio of xylem water from different water sources white et al 1985 ehleringer dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 mcdonnell 2014 evaristo et al 2017 carrière et al 2020 various mixing models based on dual isotope ratio approach have been developed for the apportioning of water sources used by plant including linear mixing models e g isosource phillips gregg 2003 and bayesian mixing model e g mixsiar stock semmens 2013 mixsir moore semmens 2008 and siar parnell et al 2010 and isotoper hopkins ferguson 2012 these multisource mixing models have been efficacious for the apportioning of plant water sources in complex natural ecosystems such as karst ecosystems where there are often more than two water sources for plant use mccole stern 2007 rong et al 2011 nie et al 2012 liu et al 2019 however a number of factors are at play to decide which stable isotope mixing model simm to apply including mixtures and sources assemblages of single or multiple populations sample sizes researcher s intended level of inference e g individual or population level and users familiarity with a particular framework to develop more efficient approaches for statistical analysis for example isotoper s user interface in r provides researchers with a user friendly tool for simm analysis and can incorporate all substantial simm features i e components of the model expressed in mathematical terms using a fully bayesian approach to more accurately infer relative contributions for sources hopkins ferguson 2012 this model also allows a user to make statistical inference on each individual in the population even when there may beonly one observation for each individual additionally the model structure allows for incorporating replicated observations of the same individual in the analysis process resulting in less influence from the population level and more accurate individual level estimates therefore the model has a hierarchical structure as its point estimates is contingent on the group or population s distribution hopkins ferguson 2012 notably like other simms this model adopts the same basic methodology for identifying plant water source apportionment for example a duel isotope e g δ18o and δ2h multiple endmember linear mixing model can be formulated for estimating the relative contribution f of multiple water sources 1 2 3 n to a mixture of stem water m based on the following mass balance equations schwarcz 1991 1 δ m 18 o f 1 δ 1 18 o f 2 δ 2 18 o f 3 δ 3 18 o f n δ n 18 o 2 δ m 2 h f 1 δ 1 2 h f 2 δ 2 2

quantifying stand scale transpiration via monitoring the sap flowof a single tree in a field has been another technique of interest in plant water use research for the past two decades wilson et al 2001 kumagai et al 2007 du et al 2011 chang et al 2014 miyazawa et al 2014 liu et al 2018 han et al 2019 the sap flow measurements which is not restricted by the spatio temporal variability link et al 2014 allows us to determine the total quantity of water transpired by tree species on a daily basis as well as to characterize the ecological and physiological mechanisms that tree species use to cope with limited availability of soil water pataki et al 2000 du et al 2011 huang et al 2011 berry et al 2017 although the combined use of these techniquesis strongly emphasized in exploring the mechanisms and strategies that tree species use to adapt and survive in environments with various water stresses it has not always been possible due to rising costs of sampling and analysis the present study was conducted during 2018 2019 rainy and dry seasons in a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest china to explore transpiration responses and water use strategies of a dominant woody plant species evergreen ligustrum lucidum growing in a habitat with the typical shallow soils using sap flow transpiration data leaf δ13c and xylem i e plant stem and source water δ2h and δ18o this study aimed to achieve the following 1 quantifying the amount of water transpired by the plant during different seasons 2 revealing the nature of potential water sources providing the water needed for plant transpiration during different seasons 3 determining the contributions and seasonal patterns of different potential water sources used by the plant and 4 determining the plant wuei

located in the guanyinxia anticline chongqing southwest china fig 1 a 1b was chosen as the site of this study the altitude of the longfeng karst trough valley ranges from 480 to 640 m and it covers an area of 11 7 km2 with three ridges and two valleys the limestone and dolomite components of the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f and middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l formed the karst trough valleys and the erosion resistant sandstone and shale components of t1 f and the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj formed the ridges fig 1b a dense network of open fractures has been developed in the limestone bedrock of the karst trough valleys providing the basic conditions for the development of karst forms such as fissures sinkholes karst pits and underground rivers rainwater and surface water are quickly discharged into karst aquifers through fissures sinkholes or karst pits and eventually into underground rivers which can limit the storage of available water for plants in shallow zones the longfeng valley is affected by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean air temperature of 18 2 c and precipitation of 1104 mm approximately 75 85 of the annual

thermal diffusion principle cohen et al 1981 burgess et al 2001 for this two replicate woody species of ligustrum lucidum selected in the investigation plot 1 fig 1b c were instrumented with thermal dissipation probes ecomatik germany installed on the north facing side of plant stem avoiding direct sunlight at a height of 1 3 m with the distance of 10 cm between them fig 1d measurements were performed every 30 s and recorded as 15 averages for 20 days from 5th to 25th day during each sampling season july november 2018 february and april 2019 the measured dbh and sapwood area mean 1 sd

randomly established for plant and soil sampling fig 1b in each plot a healthy mature woody species of ligustrum lucidum similar in diameter to the other selected trees was selected for sampling in all seasons july november 2018 february and april 2019 in each season seven to ten leaves of each tree were collected using a pole pruner with no orientation when collecting them measurements were made using mature intact sunlit upper canopy leaves then all samples were dried in an oven at 70 c for 3 days frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder pass through a 100 mesh screen for the δ13c determination additionally within each season a 100 cm gas sample was collected using an air bag 300 ml at the elevation 5 25 m higher than that of all the sampling plots at the same meteorological station position representing the air of the upper canopy to measure the air co2 concentration for δ13ca determination see eqs 7 and 8 moreover three to five suberized branches of each tree were obtained from the canopy branches were chipped in the field and immediately placed in a capped vial and wrapped in parafilm to minimize the effect of evaporative enrichment by water loss through unsuberized stems until extraction ehleringer dawson 1992 to analyze the δ2h and δ18o at each plot three spots were randomly chosen for soil sampling soil samples were collected with a soil auger from depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm n 2 per soil layer at each sampling season all collected samples were immediately stored in the glass capped bottles wrapped with parafilm to prevent the evaporation and were kept frozen in a refrigerator until the δ2h and δ18o analysis on the other hand previous studies have shown liu et al 2019 cao et al 2020 that the general trends in soil moisture at depths of 0 20 and 0 40 cm in multiple spots of the study site during different seasons were almost similar and there was no significant difference between sampling spots p 0 05 therefore we selected only one out of six sampling plots for a high precision monitoring of soil moisture content smc for this two sensors av ec5 were placed at the depth of 0 20 smc0 20 and 20 40 cm soil smc20 40 with the accuracy of

season a total of six deep water i e epikarst water and groundwater samples were regularly gathered from the outlets of one epikarst spring n 2 and two underground rivers n 4 in the study site fig 1b for the δ18o and δ2h determination all water samples collected were sealed and stored in the same manner as the plant branches and soil samples all plant soil air and water measurements were replicated with an interval of approximately 10 15 days within each season 2 5 isotopic analyses water was extracted from the ligustrum lucidum branches stem and soil samples using a cryogenic vacuum

fertility and fertilizer efficiency chongqing china to avoid errors of isotope ratios induced by organic compounds millar et al 2018 west et al 2010 the spectral contamination identifier lwia sci post processing software los gatos research inc was employed to examine whether there was spectral interference in the isotope data from the extracted plant stem water and corrected using the standard curves created by the los gatos research engineers schultz et al 2011 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values were expressed as the per mil deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow accuracy for δ2h and δ18o 0 5 and 0 2 respectively the δ13c values of the leaves and air were determined through an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms usa at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences guiyang china the δ13c values were expressed as the delta notation per mil deviation from the standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb accuracy 0 2 2 6 data analysis the δ2h and δ18o values of xylem water can provide information on the water sources of plants jackson et al 1999 both epikarst spring and the underground river were considered as a deep water source because their water samples exhibited similar isotopic compositions and could be distinguished from other water sources i e soil water from upper lower soil layers we applied isotoper as a comprehensive bayesian mixing model to calculate relative contribution of each water source to the stem water of the woody plant the basic terms and formulas and prior distributions of the model with comparative analysis are presented by hopkins ferguson 2012 we first carried out several sensitivity analyses using the isotopic signatures i e δ18o and δ2h of mixture and source population to test the relative impact of 1 sample size 2 isotopic signature standard deviations sd in the mixture and source populations 3 the isotopic signature difference between the sources 4 analytical sd i e sd among replicated samples and 5 the value of inferences for different sources so as to find situations where the uncertainty of source proportion estimates could be minimized see e g phillips gregg 2001 accordingly we found that the population had a major effect on individual source estimates so that increasing the sample size especially when replicated measurements of the same individual were included significantly reduced the proportion variability sd and improved the inferences therefore we extended our model with a shared individual variance across populations it should be added that each individual had a unique mean and variance for each isotopic signature which were assumed to follow independent normal distributions semmens et al 2009 besides it was necessary to calculate an isotopic correlation coefficient for the mixtures and the sources to accurately estimate proportional source contributions because the δ18o and δ2h signatures in individual plant and soil water compartments are often highly correlated phillips gregg 2001 therefore we calculated these values using bayesian methods to correct the variance estimates for all the sources and then incorporated those as terms in the covariance matrix in addition to including these corrections we accounted for the error associated with measurement and incorporated it to each observation in our model however we did not include a residual error term to account for the uncertainty otherwise unaccounted for in the mixture and source populations in our estimation process as the correlation in the mixture population was accounted for by the correlation in the sources see e g hopkins ferguson 2012 following semmens et al 2009 a gibbs sampler a markov chain monte carlo algorithm was applied to perform the model with random effects to allow for individual variation within populations using 3 parallel chains in jags in the end we reported our estimates as average 1sd for the individual sources at the population level fig 4a photosynthetic 13c discrimination δ13c was calculated from the 13c 12c ratio in leaves according to farquhar and richards 1984 7 δ

rubisco 27 farquhar richards 1984 notably this simplified linear model can also implicitly account for internal co2 transfer seibt et al 2008 which often leads to the overestimation of δ13c and thus underprediction of wuei and this deviation is augmented with assimilation rate especially in plant growth period when there is a high rate of assimilation and photosynthesis farquhar et al 1989 therefore we did take into account possible uncertainty associated with it although our main focus was not to estimate the actual value of wuei fitting of the model according to multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss statistics 25 ibm co ny usa it should be added that all variables in the regression analysis were standardized using a enter method and standardized coefficients were interpreted 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in precipitation and air temperature the total precipitation throughout the study period july 2018 april 2019 was 823 6 mm about 84 692 1 mm of which occurred between july and october 2018 and april 2019 i e the rainy season with the highest monthly precipitation amount occurring in july 199 mm most precipitation events during this period were relatively intense and frequent which would result in lower stress for plant water uptake approximately 16 of precipitation 131 5 mm occurred between november 2018 and march 2019 dry season with the lowest monthly precipitation amount occurring in february 2019 3 9 mm fig 2 a most precipitation events during this five month period were less intense with lower frequency which may increase the water stress on plants driving them to obtain water from different sources cao et al 2020 the monthly average estimated mean minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the study period were 19 5 7 1 and 36 6 c respectively the highest and lowest monthly average daily temperatures recorded were 32 3 and 11 1 c in july 2018 and february 2019 respectively fig 2a 3 2 seasonal variations in soil moisture content as shown in fig 2b there were significant differences in the soil moisture content smc of the upper and lower soil layers p 0 05 with average values of 23 4 and 28 5 throughout the study period july 2018 april 2019 respectively indicating that in the lower soil layer there was always during the different seasons more moisture content for plant uptake in addition there were significant temporal changes in the smc of both soil layers that were consistent with the seasonal variations in precipitation the average smc of the upper and lower soil layers were 32 3 and 26 1 during the rainy season and 24 7 and 20 7 during the dry season respectively this indicates a significant reduction in the smc of the soil layers due to the remarkable reduction in rainfall which could cause severe stress in plants when taking up water from the soil layers fig 2 daily variations in a precipitation p mm air temperature t c b soil

respectively with an average value of 61 4 and the δ18o values were 10 7 8 1 8 5 and 10 4 respectively with an average value equal of 9 4 the δ2h and δ18o values of deep water epikarst water and

outputs there were significant seasonal variations in the proportions of the various water sources for plant uptake fig 4b in july 2018 mid rainy season ligustrum lucidum mostly utilized water from the lower soil layer average 1sd proportions of 46 9 followed by the deep water pools i e epikarsts and underground river and upper soil layer average proportion of 36 3 and 18 7 respectively in

and 114 59 μmol mol respectively 4 discussion 4 1 ecological significance of seasonal transpiration and its relationship with key environmental factors our results showed that the plant water use rate significantly varied from one season to another accordingly the plant taken up a remarkable amount of water approximately 87 of its total annual transpiration during the rainy growing season particularly during the middle of the rainy season july 2018 while it did much less during the dry season the high rate of transpiration was very important during the growing season as previous studies had also emphasized as it could mainly contribute to photosynthesis and plant growth oren and pataki 2001 yepez et al 2003 scott et al 2006 cavanaugh et al 2011 besides some studies have also shown that a small amount of transpiration during each dry season has been requiredto maintain the plant health and functioning until the next growing season biederman et al 2018 szutu papuga 2019 according to the results several potential reasons might have explained the high rate of water use during the rainy season the most popular of which was an increase in vpd frequently exceeding 1 kpa fig 2c resulting in more stomatal conductance and further escape of water molecules from plant leaves to form transpiration fetcher et al 1994 zheng wang 2014 the increase in t fig 2a was another significant factor as it would primarily enhance photosynthetic production and the plant growth hari et al 1986 nöjda et al 2017 we also found that the transpiration of the plant was sensitive to soil moisture in both soil layers especially lower soil layer as the soil moisture was the predominant source of the plant water uptake during the rainy season which would regularly replenish by significant rainfall with relatively high frequency keeping soil drought stress to a minimum however as we will explain in the next section soil moisture alone was not enough to supply all the water needed to be transpired by the plant during the rainy season and the rest on average 41 would come from deep water source pools overall these findings were in line with some previous studies which have shown that higher vpd and t at moist sites during growing season when ample water is available to the plant water uptake increase transpiration dynamics xu li 2006 clausnitzer et al 2011 zheng wang 2014 yan et al 2018 in contrast low transpiration during the dry season was the result of vpd rarely exceeding 1 kpa with rs fig 2c implying a strong stomatal control facing water stress schulze et al 1994 yan et al 2018 additionally it could be associated with a significant reduction in soil moisture due to a significant reduction in rainfall during the dry season as our results indicated that transpiration was not sensitive to any moisture in the two soil layers during this period time primarily because the plant extracted a significant fraction of little water required for its dry season transpiration from deep water source pools explained in the next section secondly and most importantly due to a strong stomatal control linked to limited available soil moisture as water stress has been found to increase the sensitivity of canopy stomatal control or plant hydraulic resistance to light and vapor pressure deficit during the drought periods zheng wang 2014 wang et al 2020 decreasing the water use from deep water source pools even if there was ample water in those pools to absorb similar findingshavealsobeenreportedfrompreviousstudies that there is a significant relationship between drought sensitivity and the relative reduction in the amount of water used by drought sensitive tree species during dry periods which has been associated with the deficit of soil moisture due to low and insufficient amount of rainfall sperry et al 2002 du et al 2011 chang et al 2014 nan et al 2019 accordingly the endemic woody plant species of ligustrum lucidum can be categorized as drought sensitive because its transpiration rate was significantly influenced by the seasonal variations in rainfall and soil moisture du et al 2011 yan et al 2018 4 2 the nature of seasonal water sources transpired by ligustrum lucidum the results showed that ligustrum lucidum utilized a combination of all of the potential water sources during all seasons thus during the rainy season july 2018 and april 2019 when the water stress was low and soil moisture content was high due to the sufficient rainfall capture by the soil layers this tree species predominantly utilized the soil water and used less deep water epikarst water and groundwater than it did during the dry season november 2018 and february 2019 in contrast during the dry season the fraction of deep water in the xylem water of ligustrum lucidum increased significantly with increasing water stress and decreasing soil moisture content due to the low rainfall and water holding capacity in the shallow soils of this heterogeneous karst area this indicates a clear seasonal shift in the water use strategy of ligustrum lucidum moreover it could also be a clear indicator of specialized dimorphic root systems for the plant allowing to extract water from shallow water sources growth pools during the rainy season and from deep water sources maintenance pools during the dry season ryel et al 2008 2010 some studies in karst areas with shallow soils have documented that the roots of plants are predominantly restricted to the upper 2 m of the soil bedrock profile querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 therefore it could be difficult for the plant to develop most of its shallow roots deep into the lower layers of the bedrock however several studies have reported that the roots of many plants in limestone karst areas with shallow soils can grow deep into the lower layers of the bedrock white et al 1985 jackson et al 1999 querejeta et al 2006 2007 schwinning 2008 nie et al 2011 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2014 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 recently liu et al 2019 reported similar seasonal water use strategies for two other native tree species in the same area implying flexibility in gaining access to shallow and deep water source pools during different seasons in this heterogeneous karst area to compensate for limited soil water storage particularly during the dry season the water use strategies due to changing environmental conditions are referred to as plasticity dimorphic root systems liu et al 2014 furthermore the analysis of the isotoper results indicated that despite the permanent and reliable access to deep water source pools in the rainy season providing more water storage for plant uptake than what was available in dry season ligustrum lucidum tended to use more of shallow water pools as we will explain in the next section this could likely be due to the fact that taking up water from deep water source pools by deep root systems requires more metabolic energy compared to the water that is captured by shallow root systems ksenzhek volkov 1998 some recent studies have also demonstrated that plants use deep water source pools only to maintain their growth and survival under drought stress conditions even when the pools can provide large amounts water for plant uptake ryel et al 2008 2010 bleby et al 2010 documented that deep roots depth of 20 m were approximately five times more active than the shallow roots depth of 0 0 5 m during drought periods when the shallow water supply was insufficient for plant use however after receiving rainfall and balancing shallow water storage the deep roots were immediately deactivated therefore ligustrum lucidum used shallow water source pools as an energy efficient options for supporting growth and used deep water source pools as energy demanding but safe options only for maintaining their survival water source pools as well as their proportion contributions of used by ligustrum lucidum were presented to compare in a conceptual model fig 4a b fig 4 a conceptual diagram of water source pools available for an endemic woody plant species ligustrum lucidum in a limestone karst area b proportions of the contributions of potential water sources upper and lower soil water and deep water used by ligustrum lucidum and c intrinsic water use efficiency wuei values of the woody plant during different seasons 2018 2019 all results were presented as average 1sd of replicates 4 3 relationship between transpiration with wuei and elucidation of seasonal ecohydrological events according to the results the ligustrum lucidum leaf δ13c values ranged from 28 33 to 32 20 similar to those of other dominant tree species in the same area 28 1 to 32 8 cao et al 2020 indicating that the photosynthetic pathway of this tree species belongs to c3 plants whose leaf δ13c values 20 to 35 differ from those of c4 plants 7 to 15 o leary 1981 as our results showed wuei and δ13c was low during the rainy season figs 3c 4c table 3 just when significant transpiration 87 of total annual transpiration occurred this implies a partial plant s leaves stomatal opening during this time period facilitating the release of water molecules in the form of unsaturated vapor and the entry of co2 molecules through plant leaves ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 as a result these interactions could intensify the plant s thirst ainsworth rogers 2007 hence prompting the plant to take up more water from the available water sources most researchers believe that the main role in the amount of water that can be taken up and its translocation from the roots to the leaves is related to transpiration which provides the formation of a hydrodynamic pressure gradient along the entire length of a plant due to the formation of negative pressure in its upper parts i e leaves hence allowing to pull sap through the plant xylem vessels without the need to spend any metabolic energy ksenzhek volkov 1998 thus the greater the intensity of transpiration the greater the amount of water pulled along the xylem vessels however the action of pulling water caused by the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is not sufficient to stimulate the plant s transport systems because the plant effectively employs a special force called root pressure capturing the water from the corresponding water source pools soil water and deep water through root systems and pumping it into the xylem vessels at the expense of a minimum metabolic energy ksenzhek volkov 1998 as described above during the rainy season ligustrum lucidum tended to obtain more water from the soil layers just when these water pools could be sufficiently fed by abundant rainfall with high frequency this suggests that water extraction from these shallow water source pools would likely be more time saving and energy efficient for the plant use compared to the deep water source pools as shorter transport from the shallow water pools probably needed to generate less root pressure for delivering the water to the xylem in addition to these physiological events the entry of co2 which is recognized as an essential component in the process of photosynthesis collatz et al 1991 could potentially help increase the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth ainsworth rogers 2007 thus during the rainy season minimum water stress associated with soil moisture deficit could occur and impact the normal plant water uptake process allowing the plant to maximize its growth and photosynthesis rates without reducing stomatal conductance and the transpiration rate this suggests that ligustrum lucidum might simultaneously benefit from profligate water use strategy during the rainy season nie et al 2014 cao et al 2020 accordingly under this water use strategy the water that the plant could easily cheaply obtain from soil layers through its shallow roots could also be easily profligately lost through its leaves during the rainy season in contrast during the dry season the plant would suffer from a shortage of soil water due to a significant reduction in rainfall according to our results it seems that the plant adopted a constructive strategy for managing this water stress during the dry season yan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as it had increased its wuei by an average of 15 and reduced its total transpiration rate by approximately one seventh of the rainy season transpiration i e equivalent to 13 of its total annual transpiration thus this sharp decrease in transpiration rate reflecting the partial stomatal closure of the plant s leaves limits the formation of a hydrodynamic pressure gradient hence preventing the plant from taking up too much water from the available water source pools huc guehl 1989 granier et al 1992 additionally given that most of its water needed during this time period comes from deep water source pools on average 62 capturing and pumping the same small amount water by deep root systems required more energy than the fraction of water that could be extracted from the soil water pools and delivered to its xylem vessels ksenzhek volkov 1998 however despite having the necessary tool dimorphic root system to extract deep water even if there was enough water in these pools the plant would be unable to lift much more water along its xylem vessels during the dry season for the same reason mentioned earlier i e the existence of a limited hydrodynamic pressure gradient due to very low transpiration granier et al 1992 as a result this mechanism would not allow the plant to alleviate all of the drought stress associated with the soil moisture deficit by taking up enough or more water from deep water source pools overall all of these ecohydrological events show that the plant tended to adopt a conservative water uptake strategy during the dry season consequently the plant had to extract uneasily expensively most of the required water albeit at a small amount through deep water source pools and consume it uneasily conservatively through increasing the wuei by reducing its leaves stomata in order to maintain its survival during the dry season 5 conclusions we investigated transpiration responses and water use strategies of a dominant evergreen tree species ligustrum lucidum growing in a karst habitat with the typical shallow soils which relies on various water sources the site chosen was a subtropical limestone karst area on southwest china toachieveourgoals we took into account seasonal variations in the sap flow transpiration rates leaf δ13c and δ2h and δ18o of the soil moisture upper and lower soil layers deep water epikarst water and groundwater and tree stem water samples using the sap flow and soil moisture data we found that ligustrum lucidum maintained its rainy growth season transpiration at high rates under the control of key environmental factors such as vpd and t in response to favorable soil moisture conditions however it reduced its dry season transpiration at very low rates under the control of vpd and rs due to sensitivity to unfavorable soil moisture conditions according to the results obtained from the isotoper model based on the δ2h and δ18o values it was revealed that during different seasons the plant used a combination of soil water and deep water so that the contribution of the water obtained from the soil water was higher than the deep water during the rainy season and vice versa during the dry season the signal of a seasonal shift in the pattern of the plant water uptake among different seasons was mainly attributed to the functionally dimorphic root system of ligustrum lucidum reflecting a greater degree of ecological plasticity of the plants in karst ecosystems meanwhile it highlights that the transpiration dynamics of ligustrum lucidum was largely a function of soil moisture and deep water during the rainy and dry seasons respectively using the seasonal patterns of wuei values based on the δ13c values we found that the plant water use efficiency was low and high during the rainy and dry seasons respectively signaling a seasonal shift in the water use strategy for the plant from a profligate water use pattern in the rainy season to a conservative water use pattern in the dry season thus ligustrum lucidum overall strategy for managing the water consumption was obtaining the water efficiently and consuming it profligately in order to maximize its growth and photosynthesis rate during the rainy growing season in contrast the plant had to extract the water using much energy and consume it conservatively in order to maintain its survival during the dry season thus applying a combined approach to understand the strategies and mechanisms of water use by plants especially in the heterogeneous karst areas can help us gain more insights partly rather than simply using the sap flow or isotopic techniques alone credit authorship

downstream has been the key factor in river basin flood management in this paper a framework is developed to optimize the flood diversion siting and operating policy of a detention basin which consists of three modules 1 the flood simulation module which simulates the flood routing and flood diversion process via a one dimensional and two dimensional coupled hydrodynamic model 2 the cost and benefit calculation module which estimates the flood damage in the detention basin and the flood control benefit in flood protected regions based on the results of the flood simulation model with the diversion structure cost considered and 3 the optimization module which optimizes the diversion siting and control strategy with the objective of the maximum system benefit by balancing the flood loss in the detention basin and flood control benefit of the protected area the framework is applied to the huayanghe detention basin the most downstream detention basin along the yangtze river basin china the results state that gate control upstream is the optimal strategy to decrease the flood losses in the detention basin but the potential flood losses of the protected region increase significantly under this policy moreover an operating policy that balances moderately the flooding losses in the detention basin and the flood control benefit of flood protected regions downstream is provided though the framework overall this study highlights flood simulations and optimization approaches represent a promising solution for filling the gap of densely populated detention basin modeling and real world management decision making keywords flood management flood detention basin flood loss estimation yangtze river balance of benefits and losses 1 introduction detention basins refer to the low lying areas along rivers that are surrounded by dikes these basins are used to reduce the levee failure risk and the potential inundation losses in their flood protected regions by temporarily diverting a certain volume of floodwater when the flood exceeds the river flood discharge capacity chow et al 1988 as an important component of flood control systems detention basins have been widely used in large river basins worldwide to achieve the maximum flood control benefit of the system vorogushyn et al 2012 park et al 2012 bellu et al 2016 terêncio et al 2020 as of 2011 china constructed 94 detention basins along major rivers with a total area of 33716 5 km2 china s detention basins are intensively populated economic development regions holding approximately 16 56 million people and contributing more than 100 billion yuan gross domestic product gdp in 2011 zhang and song 2014 enormous losses would be caused if these basins were used to divert flood water lin et al 2010 zhang and song 2014 zhang et al 2016 a shift in detention basin management policy occurred at 2012 with the flood storage and detention area design specification ministry of water resources prc which stipulate that appropriate flood diversion operating policy should be selected according to the topography water flow size and inhabitant of the detention basin this shift provides further space to control the amount of flood storage in detention basin however a larger flood loss in the protected region may be generated by levee failure without the implementation of those detention basin therefore it is a key and a dilemma in basin flood management to balance the flood loss of detention basins and flood control benefits of protected regions and to seek a scientific utilization strategy for detention basins vorogushyn et al 2012 tung 2017 york and jacob 2020 the benefits refer to the flood damage reduction in the protected region resulted from the flood diversion by the detention basin for a detention basin river protected region system the location size and operation policy of the detention basin will significantly affect the probability and consequences of downstream levee failure as well as the construction cost of the system in this system the location and size of the detention basin which determine the drainage area and the storage volume are the most essential parameters mays and bedient 1982 ngo et al 2016 terêncio et al 2020 while the operating policy refers to the siting and the control strategy of the flood diversion which influence the flood hazard mitigation of protected region and flood losses in the detention basin breach control weir control and gate control are the common control strategies in flood diversion of detention basins sanders et al 2006 as the most essential parameters to design the optimal location and size have been investigated by a multitude of works mays and bedient 1982 proposed an optimal model based on dynamic programming to design the size and location of detention basins within a watershed under the objective of minimum system construction costs bennett and mays 1985 improved the previous model by taking into account the costs of the outlet structures of detention basins and downstream channels in the design process by utilizing this model taur et al 1987 successfully optimized the detention basin system in the walnut creek watershed austin texas travis and mays 2008 optimized the location and sizing of retention basins in a watershed with the objective of minimizing the total cost which includes the engineering construction cost the project maintenance cost and the sediment cleaning cost later various optimization algorithms genetic algorithm simulated annealing etc and detailed increased engineering cost calculations were introduced in the optimal design of a detention basin river protected region system yeh and labadie 1997 behera et al 1999 perez pedini et al 2005 park et al 2012 in summary the above publications only considered the engineering cost and primarily focused on the size of the detention basin but there is still a risk of levee failure downstream even if the storage volume of the detention basin meets the design requirement due to flood uncertainties oxley and mays 2014 in fact even though the peak water level decreased below the critical water level by flood diversion there is still levee failure possibility downstream due to the uncertainty of the system itself d oria et al 2019 thus the consequence of the levee failure has been considered in the optimal design of the flood detention basins afterwards utilizing hydrology and hydrodynamic models to simulate flood routing processes in flood control systems evaluating flood risk and levee failure consequences of the system according to the simulation results and optimizing system design is an effective measure for flood management zhu et al 2007 ravazzani et al 2014 vieira et al 2018 dupuits et al 2019 chen et al 2007 evaluated the flood control benefits that feng hua detention ponds brought to the tainan scientific base industrial park based on the calculation results of a one dimensional 1 d and two dimensional 2 d coupled hydrodynamic model vorogushyn et al 2012 combined a 1 d and 2 d coupled model and a probability model to simulate the flood process in a channel dike detention basin system and analyzed the impact of detention basins on the probability of levee failure and flood loss in the protected region downstream del giudice et al 2014 proposed a simple analytical method that allows a preliminary efficiency evaluation of a detention basin system either in series or parallel in a specific target section cunha et al 2016 incorporated the storm water management model swmm model and simulated an annealing algorithm to optimize the number of flood storage units and their location size and orifice dimensions in any case the key hydraulic variables describing the dynamics of the inundation typically flood depth and flood stage are evaluated through suitable hydrodynamic models which are usually validated against historical flood data guida et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 moura rezende et al 2019 for the completed flood detention basin the flood diversion site and its operating strategy are the key factors that affect the flood diversion process and the peak flow mitigation efficiency and are also essential for the comprehensive and effective management of flood consequences yang et al 2010 d oria et al 2019 jaffe and sanders 2001 implemented a 2 d hydrodynamic model to analyze the impacts of flood plain storage breach size flood discharge flood duration and breach timing on the reduction in the peak flood stages in river channels when an engineered levee breach is adopted to control the flood diversion process and then proposed a strategy for the levee breach design sanders et al 2006 analyzed the performance of breach passive control gate active control and weir control strategies with respect to flood diversion for river flood stage reduction and the results indicated that gate control is remarkably effective kim et al 2016 proposed a design procedure for determining the optimal length of the flood diversion control weir based on a numerical simulation nevertheless the aforementioned methodologies are typically based on idealized numerical experiments that can be prohibitive for wide river domains and complex topographies through contemporary studies have provided valuable tools methods and insights for the optimal design of the location size and operating policy of detention basins there are obvious difference between the condition of china and other countries generally flood detention basins have a single purpose of flood control whereas in china as a result of the development of population and economic in flood detention basins there are two purposes flood control and human habitat zhang and song 2014 in china the flood diversion siting and control strategy must account the trade offs between the flood control benefits downstream areas the flood losses in the detention basins and engineering costs of the flood diversion control structures however few studies have focused on the impacts of the flood diversion location and operating strategy on flood losses in detention basins this paper proposes a framework for optimizing flood diversion sites and operating strategies for detention basin river protected region systems which combines a flood simulation model a cost and benefit evaluation model and an optimization model based on this framework the scheme of flood diversion detention basins can be optimized by comprehensively calculating the flood loss flood control benefits and construction costs finally the framework is applied to the huayanghe detention basin hdb in the yangtze river basin the results demonstrate that the integrated 1 d and 2 d coupled modeling cost benefit calculation and optimization can provide great flexibility to the formulation of water management for densely populated detention basins and enhance the interpretability of the optimized results since a model like mike can comprehensively simulate the hydraulic variables in detention basin river protected regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions 2 methodology the general framework for the methodology introduced in this study is presented in fig 1 which encompasses three modules i the flood simulation module ii the cost benefit analysis module and iii the optimization module the flood simulation module simulates the flood routing process of the river flood diversion gate detention basin by a 1 d and 2 d coupled hydrodynamic model then the model provides the inundated depth distribution of the detention basin water level and flood discharge of the river to the cost benefit analysis module the cost mainly includes the flood losses of the detention basin the flood control benefits for the protected region and the diversion structure construction cost finally the optimization module sets up the objective and constrains equations to select the best siting and control strategy for flood diversion 2 1 flood simulation module to simulate the inundated depth distribution in the detention basin and the flood stage reduction of the downstream river after flood diversion a 1 d and 2 d coupled flood simulation model is constructed based on mike mike is a well known hydrodynamic model developed by dhi and has been implemented to simulate water movement in rivers lakes and oceans wang et al 2019a 2019b mike 11 mike 21 fm and mike flood modules have been widely applied to the flood simulation of river levee flood detention systems liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in this study the 1 d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 11 module is used to simulate flood routing in the river channel and the 2 d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 21 fm module is used to simulate flood routing in the detention basin the 1 d and 2 d models are coupled by the mike flood module using different linkage modes at candidate locations for flood diversion and the corresponding structures in the mike 11 model such as the sluice structure and broad crested weir structure are set to reflect the effects of the operating policies the mike 11 module calculates the transport of water by solving continuous equation 1 and momentum equation 2 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g q q c 2 a r 0 where x and t denote the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively a is the area of river cross sections q and z denote the discharge and water level of the river cross section respectively q is the lateral

equation of a three dimensional 3 d incompressible fluid which is subject to the boussinesq hypothesis and the hydrostatic pressure hypothesis the control equations used in this model are given as follows continuity equation 3 h t h u x h v y h s momentum equation of the x direction 4 h u t h u 2 x h vu y f v h g h η x h ρ 0 p a x g h 2 2 ρ 0 ρ x τ sx ρ 0 τ bx ρ 0 1 ρ s xx x s xy x x h t xx x h

flood routing process simulation the distributed inundation depth of the detention basin and flood stage of the river channel are extracted to calculate the flood losses and flood control benefits of the detention basin river protected region system the flood loss evaluation of the detention basin is based on the stage damage function dias et al 2018 dutta et al 2003 tang et al 1992 wang et al 2018 the method establishes the loss rate function of various sectors under different submerged depths this study adopts a segmented loss rate function 6 f j a j 1 0 h s h 1 a j 2 h 1 h s h 2 a ji h i 1 h s h i where f j is the loss rate of sector j and a ji denotes the loss ratio of sector j when the water depth h s is between h i 1 and h i the loss rate is the ratio between the loss of various kinds of properties and the original or normal property and the parameters affected by the topography landform flood characteristics property types disaster seasons and emergency measures the total inundation loss l d in the detention basin is determined by the calculated loss rate f and the total gdp g of all sectors 7 l d i n j m f j g i j where l d is the total loss of the detention basin and g i j is the gdp of sector j in calculation unit i 2 2 2 flood control benefits evaluation in addition to overtopping piping and erosion may also lead to fluvial levee failure before the water level reaches the crests of the levees bhowmik and demissie 1982 vorogushyn et al 2009 dierauer et al 2012 the probability of levee failure is affected by the uncertainty of the geometric parameters and the rock soil characteristics that indicate the intrinsic properties of the structure of the levee additionally the probability even more directly depends on the peak level and duration of the flood in the river which refers to hydraulic loading the levee failure function that we used was based on a stochastic levee failure function that the united states army corps of engineers usace used to calculate the average reliability of levees in the planning studies the probability of failure p f varies smoothly between 0 when the flood water level h is at or below the levee toe h min and 1 when h reaches the levee crest h max usace 1999 dierauer et al 2012 pinter et al 2016 8 p f 0 36 tan 1 10 3 h h min h max h min 7 2 0 52 where h refers to the water surface elevations of the stream channel and h max denotes the elevation of the levee crest the potential flood losses of the protected areas are determined by the probability and consequences of the levee failure of the levees along those areas as mentioned above the failure consequences calculation needs to obtain the submerged depth and corresponding loss rate in the target area however in the detention basin river flood protected region system the immense area of the protected region brings a large challenge to the simulation of flood routing via the 2 d hydrodynamic model previous studies have shown that the total flood losses are closely related to the flood magnitudes reflected by the return periods t and the relationship can be reflected by the recurrence interval loss rate curve dierauer et al 2012 pinter et al 2016 since the detention basin and the downstream protected region are in the same levee system the loss rates of the detention basin for all flood recurrence intervals are already calculated in section 2 2 1 therefore the total loss rate of the downstream protection area is assumed to be equal to that of the detention basin under the same flood conditions with the purpose of simplifying the calculations however the application of detention basins reduced the flood flow downstream a proportional coefficient r which refers to the proportion of the diversion flood volume of the detention basin to the total exceeding flood volume is used to express the impact of the reduced flood volume by the detention basin on the levee failure consequences of the protected region finally the losses of the downstream protection region are calculated as follows 9 l p g p f f t r 1 2 10 f t l d t g d 11 r v c v d v c where l p is the total loss of the protected region downstream g is the gdp of the protected region downstream and p f refers to the failure probably of the levee downstream which is calculated by formula 8 l d t is the average total loss of the detention basin under t years of flooding and g d is the gdp of the detention basin v d is the volume of flood diversion and v c is the flood volume that exceeds the capacity of the river both of them can be acquired from the results of the 1 d model the flood control benefits that the detention basin brings to the protected region are obtained by comparing the potential flood loss of the protected region with and without the utilization of the detention basin therefore the flood control benefits of the downstream protected region under a certain flood diversion strategy can be calculated as follows 12 b i l p l p i where b i is the flood control benefits under the flood diversion strategy i l p is the potential flood loss of the protected region without the implementation of the detention basin and l p i denotes the potential flood loss of the protected region under the flood diversion strategy i 2 2 3 construction and maintenance cost at present the flood diversion control methods of detention basins include gate control breach control and side weir control vorogushyn et al 2012 sanders et al 2006 among them the gate control needs to be built the gate project and the flood diversion channel the construction cost of the first investment is relatively large and is seldom used at present breach control means that when the water level in the river exceeds the warning stage the levee will be breached artificially at the designated location and repaired after the flood receded the operation of this method is convenient and the construction investment is low so this approach has been widely used in detention basins without inhabitants the cost of the breach structure mainly refers to the levee repair costs within the breach which are determined by the breach width and the per meter cost the gate structure cost not only includes the structure construction cost which is determined by the gate width and the per meter cost but also includes the cost of the flood diversion aqueduct behind the gate the annualized cost of the flood diversion structure of a detention basin is then estimated as follows 13 c 1 n c i w d c c l c where c is the average construction cost n donates the total years that the structure expected to run c i is the per meter cost of structure i structure w d represents the width of the structure c c is the length of the flood diversion aqueduct and l c denotes the per meter cost of the flood diversion channel 2 3 optimization module to adequately address the merits and demerits of the flood diversion scheme the expected annual damage ead is adopted in this study which can comprehensively reflect the system risk lekuthai and vongvisessomjai 2001 the ead is calculated by integrating the damage estimates over their occurrence probabilities of the corresponding floods which is equal to the area underneath a damage probability curve fig 2 a it can be seen that the large damages under rare flooding events are weighted less whereas small damages associated with frequent events are weighted proportionally in the ead 14 ead 0 1 d p f d p f where p f denotes the annual exceedance probability of the flood event p f 1 t and d pf is the damage corresponding to the flood based on the ead method the expected annual benefit eab of the detention basin is estimated by the benefit probability curve since the dike itself can resist frequent floods the flood control benefit of the detention basin is close to 0 when encounter an extremely frequent flood event in consistent with the damage probability curve the detention basin can hardly bring flood control benefits to protected areas that encounter a very rare flood event therefore it is assumed that the flood control benefit decreases as the return periods t increase and the benefit probability curve is shown in fig 2b similarly the eab of the detention basin system is estimated as follows 15 eab 0 1 b p f d p f where b p f is the corresponding flood control benefit for the flood protected region taking the detention basin river protected region system as the study object and comprehensively considering the flood losses in the detention basin the flood diversion structure construction cost and the potential flood losses in the downstream flood protected region we propose a flood diversion siting and its operating policy optimization model the objective function is the maximum flood control benefit of the system 16 m a x b sys e a b i j e a d i j c inlet i j where i represents the operating policies of the flood diversion such as the weir gate and breach and j represents the gate location to reduce the inundation damage in the detention basin the amount of the flood that is diverted should be properly controlled the trade off between the flood losses of the detention basin and the flood control benefit of the protected region can be balanced by the following constraints 17 p l t p l i j t n d i j t m b i j t where p l t is the levee failure probability of the protected region without the operation of the detention basin for a t year flood p l i j t is the levee failure probability of the protected region with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood the parameter n is a constant that is greater than 0 and less than 1 indicating the maximum increase in the risk of the downstream dike d i j t denotes the flood damage of the detention basin with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood b i j t denotes the flood control benefits of the protected region with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood 3 case study 3 1 research area the hdb is the last detention basin of the yangtze river basin which located in the middle of the jiujiang and datong hydrology stations with a total area of 1721 km2 there are three connected lakes in the detention basin fig 3 the major function of the hdb is to alleviate the peak flood stage of the yangtze river mitigate the risk of levee failure and then guarantee the safety of life and property of important cities downstream when yangtze river encountering floods that exceed the design norm according to early planning the hdb will be opened to storage flood water once the water level of the hukou station reaches 20 6 m however there are currently 26 towns and villages in the hdb with approximately 640 000 residents and 67593 ha2 of farmland and most towns and farmlands which are protected by embankments are located in low lying areas around lakes with elevations of 11 20 m tremendous economic losses will occur once hdb is opened according to the relevant plan the flood diversion gate may be adopted to control flood diversion in the immediate future and the historical levee breach locations of the yangtze river chengying cy wangzhou wz and zhanjialuan zjl which nearing to the lakes in hdb were selected as the candidate locations for flood diversion changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources 2012 the cities along the yangtze river which breach between the hdb and datong station are the main protected regions of the hdb the largest city among them is anqing city with an annual gdp of approximately 270 billion yuan which is shown in fig 3 3 2 data and hydrodynamic model construction 1 geographical data the digital elevation model of the hdb with a resolution of 1 10 000 and topographic data of 280 cross sections from the jiujiang station to the datong station in the main stream of the yangtze river with an average distance of 1000 river mileage meters 2 hydrology data 100 year and 300 year design flood hydrographs of the jiujiang and datong gauging stations and the rating curve of the datong station cross section 3 social economic data the gdp of the agricultural industrial and commercial areas of 26 towns in the hdb 2013 the collected 280 cross sections of the reach between jiujiang and datong were used to reflect the river topography change in the 1 d model the model was calibrated and validated against two severe flood events with an approximately 50 year return period that occurred from june to september 1998 and june to september 2012 in the yangtze river to this end the inflow hydrograph at the jiujiang gauging station and lateral inflow of the tributary at the hukou gauging station were imposed at the upstream boundary while the rating curve of the datong gauging station was used as the downstream boundary condition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was used to evaluate the model the calibrated roughness coefficients n of the main channel and floodplains of the yangtze river were 0 024 and 0 033 respectively and the corresponding nses all exceeded 0 8 it is a challenge to establish an effective 2 d hydrodynamic model due to not only the extremely complex boundary conditions of the detention basin include roads bridges channels rivers houses arable lands lakes and embankments but also the corresponding spatial resolution requirement for the flood loss calculation the detention basin was discreted through an unstructured triangular 2 d mesh the advantage of this method is that the mesh size can be flexibly changed according to the importance of the topography in order to enhance the computational efficiency of the model we enlarged the grid scale of land use area with a wide and flat landscape such as arable lands settlements and water bodies meanwhile the grids around railways highways and embankments which show linear features were refined to represent the baffling function in flood routing in this case the length of the mesh changes from 20 m to 300 m which is capable of reflecting the topographic elements that could significantly affect flood propagation such as levees or road embankments as well as describing the topography of lakes due to the lack of observed flood diversion data the 2 d model of the hdb could not be validated in detail the modeling experience of the authors in a similar basin by the mike 21 and the proposals provided by local authorities were adopted wang et al 2019a 2019b as a result the calibrated roughness coefficients n were 0 045 for agricultural fields 0 08 for residential areas and 0 028 for lakes the 1 d and 2 d models are coupled by the mike flood module using the standard linkage mode at the candidate flood diversion locations of the hdb the corresponding structures sluice structure and broad crested weir structure are selected in the 1 d model to reflect the effects of operating policies and the flood diversion channel is built in the 2 d model 3 3 scenarios three candidate locations i e cy wz and zjl were selected for flood diversion and gate control strategy and breach control strategy were evaluated for each location finally six flood diversion schemes were investigated flood diversion begin when the water level of the hukou station reaches 20 6 m for gate control strategy the gate will be opened when the water level higher than 20 6 m and the total diversion volume less than 2 5 billion m3 and the flow rate is controlled at less than 6000 m3 s for the breach control strategy once the levee breached the breach will not be restored until the end of the flood and the breach lengths of the three candidate locations were all equal to 1 5 km the hdb is designed to reduce the flood peak of rare floods t greater than 100 in the yangtze river the probability of the occurrence of a flood with t greater than 300 in the yangtze river basin is low according to relevant studies which contribute little to the ead liu et al 2019a 2019b therefore only floods with t 100 and 300 are analyzed in summary 12 scenarios are investigated in the present study table 1 3 4 data processing and calculation the numerical flood simulations were performed imposing 100 year and 300 year return period 100 year and 300 year flood events synthetic design hydrographs at the upstream boundaries jiujiang and hukou gauging stations of the 1 d hydrodynamic model after simulating the inundations related to each scenario through the hydrodynamic model the average inundation depth of each town in the hdb is calculated based on the 2 d model results then the total flood losses l d of the hdb under all scenarios were calculated using formulas 6 and 7 to obtain the levee failure probability p f by equation 8 the maximum flood stage of the protected reach under each scenario was extracted from the results of the 1 d model in this study the river water level h level crest h max and levee toe h min were the averages of the protected reach the flood routing processes of the yangtze river without the use of the hdb under 100 year and 300 year floods were also simulated by the 1 d model as the reference condition for 12 investigated scenarios and the exceeding flood water v c of the two flood events were calculated it is also assumed that the flood loss rate f t in the protected region is the same as that of the hdb under the same flood events the gdp g of anqing in 2013 32 98 billion yuan was used to estimate the potential flood losses of the protected regions finally the flood control benefit could be calculated using equations 9 12 the objective of the optimization model in this study is to maximize the total benefits of the river detention basin protection region system theoretically the ead is used to analyze the comprehensive risk of the system under different flood diversion schemes and an accurate loss probability curve needs to be drawn however this requires a long time of flood observation data which is often difficult to achieve in actual cases therefore previous case studies usually used the flood loss of several specific flood recurrence periods t 50 100 300 to draw the curve and calculate the ead de moel et al 2014 foudi et al 2015 the lowest probability of flood detected in this study is 0 003 t 300 and the highest is 0 01 t 100 the damage values at the bounds of the integral for calculating the ead are arbitrarily set at 0 for a probability of 1 and at 150 of the damage estimated for a probability of 0 003 for the zero probability foudi et al 2015 in this case we assumed that the construction costs of the gate in the three candidate locations are equal to simplify the calculation of the construction cost according to the relevant planning the construction cost of a gate with 6000 m3 s flood diversion capacity flood is approximately 1 billion yuan the unit repair costs of levees vary between 22 million yuan km and 44 million yuan km according to their shape and function zhu et al 2007 referring to the previous research and the functions of the yangtze river embankment the maintenance cost of 30 million yuan km was used in this case and the width of each breach was set as 1 2 km 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood losses of the detention basin after simulating the inundations related to each flood diversion scenario through the hydrodynamic model the maximum inundation depth distribution of the hdb can be obtained from the numerical results panels a c in fig 4 show the 100 year flood maps of the gate control at cy wz and zjl of the maximum inundation depth for the case study notably from fig 4 both the extent of the flooded area and the maximum inundation depth of the hdb increase significantly when the diversion location near to downstream however a reverse situation appears in the breach control strategies fig 4d f and there are very small differences between wz fig 4e and zjl fig 4f moreover the right panels in fig 4 illustrate that water depths occur in all the low lying areas around the lakes under breach control while only several villages near the diversion channel of the gate have been inundated see left panels in fig 4 this phenomenon confirms that gate control has more prominent efficiency in flood peak eliminate which is in accordance with the results of previous study sanders et al 2006 fig 5 presents the maximum inundation depth distribution of the hdb under the 300 year flood event the villages located in the southeast are all inundated both in gate control fig 5a c and breach control fig 5d f strategies it is worth noting that the inundation distributions are very similar for different diversion locations under the same strategy which illustrates that the diverted flood will not be affected by the location when encountering a severe flood nonetheless the gate control strategy can still reduce the flood depth of the detention basin agricultural industrial and commercial sector losses are the main calculation objects of the hdb flood losses and the loss rate of each sector was divided into 5 levels table 2 according to the inundation depth lu et al 2018 the results illustrate that the gate control strategy decreased the losses for all flood events in comparison to breach control strategy for the 100 year flood the total flood losses of the hdb reached 1 43 billion yuan 2 25 billion yuan and 3 41 billion yuan at cy wz and zjl respectively using the gate control strategy which were reduced by 84 47 61 74 and 34 52 respectively in comparison to the breach operation strategy fig 6 for a 300 year flood the total flood losses were also relatively reduced by 50 67 44 16 and 42 61 in addition the closer the flood diversion gate is to the upstream the smaller the flood losses are in the detention basin under the gate operation strategy which mainly because of the higher flood stage reduction efficiency of an upstream flood diversion for example when the yangtze river encounters a 100 year flood the flood losses under the gate operation strategy at cy wz and zjl are 0 638 billion yuan 1 24 billion yuan and 2 3492 billion yuan respectively under the same flood event especially the relatively frequent one t 100 the gate control strategy can significantly reduce the flood losses in the detention basin because the hdb only needs to divert a small amount of the floodwater to keep the flood stage of the hk station below 20 60 m however in the levee breach scenarios the flood diversion process will not be stopped until the yangtze river water level is lower than the levee breach bottom elevation which leads to serious losses in the hdb even under small floods i e scenarios 3 7 and 11 as shown in fig 7 the gate controlled flood diversion at cy under the 100 year flood only lasts for three 113 h and the corresponding diverted flood water is 0 32 billion m3 under the breach strategy the diversion time exceeded 400 h and diverted flood water reached 6 72 billion m3 table 3 which definitely brings more severe losses to the hdb the flood diversion processes presented in fig 7 demonstrate that the diversion time and amount of diverted flood water increase when the diversion locate closer to the downstream which is in accordance with the change in inundated extent and flood losses in the hdb this change is attributed to the greater withdrawal rates when diverted floods are upstream and the same conclusion was addressed in the research of engineered breach control jaffe and sanders 2001 although gate control strategy is beneficial to the hdb especially under 100 year flood event up panels of fig 7 but the flood stage of the yangtze river exceeds its critical state 20 6 m under 300 year flood event down panels of fig 7 which is adverse to the flood control of the protected region it is obviously implicated that properly controlling flood diversion in a relatively small flood event not only reduces flood damage in the detention basin but also meets the flood control target of the river 4 2 flood control benefits of the downstream protected areas the flood routing processes of the yangtze river without the use of the hdb under 100 year and 300 year floods were simulated by the 1 d model as the reference condition for each scenario the maximum flood stage of each cross section in the protected reach 84 000 238 000 river mileage in meters of the yangtze river from jiujiang station the average maximum flood level of the protected reach and the decrease in the average maximum flood level caused by the hdb in each scenario are shown in table 4 the maximum flood levels of the protected reach have been reduced significantly through flood diversion by the hdb for all flood events the average maximum flood level reductions are between 0 19 m scenario 1 and 0 36 m scenario 7 for the 100 year flood and between 0 11 m scenario 10 and 0 39 m scenario 4 for the 300 year flood fig 8 presents the maximum flood stage reductions in different flood diversion strategies relative to the scenario without the use of the hdb under the 100 year flood the largest and least reductions of flood stage were occurred when the flood diversion siting at wz and cy respectively regardless of the control strategy these stage reductions are the primary mechanism that contributes to the alleviation of the potential flood losses in the protected region downstream furthermore the stage reduction decreases more significantly at the same location under the breach control strategy which can be attributed to the largest discharge and the total amount of flood diversion are not limited in this strategy fig 8 for the 100 year flood the flood control benefits brought by the construction of the diversion gates at cy wz and zjl to the protected area are 5 67 billion yuan 8 91 billion yuan and 9 59 billion yuan respectively fig 9 in comparison the flood control benefits of the protected region under breach control strategies at the three locations increased by 126 23 32 61 and 21 02 respectively however different control strategies at the same location only lead to a slight effect on the levee failure probability downstream for the 100 year flood the downstream levee failure probability the location selected at cy wz and zjl only changed by 0 7 1 47 and 1 84 respectively table 5 the increased flood control benefits is mainly due to the larger diverted flood water amount under breach control strategies than that of gate control strategies while also causes more flood losses in the detention basin for the 300 year flood the flood control benefits brought to the protected area by the construction of gates at cy wz and zjl are 12 24 billion yuan 10 44 billion yuan and 11 84 billion yuan respectively with small variation this result is because during large flood events the diverted flood water reached the limitation of 2 5 billion m3 the flood control benefits produced by the hdb of the breach at cy wz and zjl are 18 55 billion yuan 14 78 billion yuan and 14 15 billion yuan respectively which illustrates that the closer breach is to the upstream the greater flood control benefit will be in the protected regions on comparison the probability of levee failure in the downstream was eliminated by 7 27 4 21 and 12 75 under the breach control strategy table 5 which obviously improved the safety of the downstream area in summary under small floods the total amount of flood water stored by the detention basin should be appropriately controlled to decrease the probability of levee failure in the downstream protection area and reduce the loss of life and property within the detention basin for large infrequent flood events the detention basin should store as much flood water as possible 4 3 construction cost the diversion gate construction and breach repair costs calculated by equation 13 are 1 billion yuan and 45 million yuan respectively since the hdb project is expected to operate for 100 years the annual cost of the gate project is 0 01 billion yuan c g 1 100 0 01 moreover the flood control object of the hdb is a 100 year flood and the expected times that a breach occurs during the project operation is 1 so the expected annual cost of the breach is 0 45 million yuan c b 45 100 0 45 which is much less than that of the gate 4 4 optimization of the flood diversion method the ead of the hdb and the edb of the protected region downstream under various scenarios are shown in table 6 regardless of the constraints i e ignoring the flood losses in the hdb breaching the levee of the yangtze river at cy is the best flood diversion strategy that satisfies the objective function of maximizing the system benefit the annual benefit of the hdb yangtze river protected region system is 4 41 billion yuan in scenario 2 however the ead of the hdb reached a surprisingly high level of 2 08 billion yuan which brings a tremendous threat to the safety of the lives and property of residents in the hdb according to the analysis in section 4 2 in a relatively frequent flood event t 100 the hdb only needs to divert a small amount of flood water to ensure the safe flood stage of the yangtze river to reasonably mitigate the internal losses of the hdb under a frequent flood event in this study the parameters m and n in formula 17 are taken as 0 25 and 30 respectively that is the submerged loss of the hdb should not be less than 0 5 times the flood control benefit of the protection area and the probability of levee failure downstream should not exceed 30 in conclusion the final optimized flood diversion location and strategy is to build a flood diversion gate at wz with an annual benefit of 3 84 billion yuan an hdb ead of 0 64 billion yuan and a flood protected area eab of 4 49 billion yuan in contrast to previous studies mays and bedient 1982 bennett and mays 1985 the construction cost shows little effect on the optimization results for the detention basin river protected region system the optimization framework provides inputs to detention basin operation when the consequence and the flood control benefit of the flood diversion are considered the application results also demonstrate that the flood losses in the detention basin must be considered during the design phase the characteristics of the detention basin such as topography water flow size and inhabitant china s design specification ministry of water resources prc 2012 can be reflected via the flood loss estimation module in our framework although most detention basins in other countries are sparsely populated the proposed framework could be expended to those basins by specifying cost and benefit between the detention basin and the protected regions downstream in different basins more accurate flood diversion operation can be undertaken through further research which is of great significance to optimize the co benefits of flood control and ecological restoration or maintenance in detention basins 5 conclusions flood detention basins in china are confronting challenges of both flood mitigation and regional development this paper proposes a comprehensive methodology that combined the flood routing simulation module cost benefit assessment module and optimization module for the optimization of flood diversion siting and its operating strategy of a populated detention basin attention was focused on the location and control strategy of flood diversion due to the significant influence that these factors have on the dynamics of the subsequent inundation and on the flood stage reduction the spatial inundation depth and flood stage conducted on the numerical results of the hydrodynamic model allows the following economic elements to be generated for a design flood event of a given return period 1 the flood losses of the detention basin 2 the potential losses of the protected region and 3 the flood control benefit that the detention basin brings to the protected region in addition the construction cost of the diversion structure was also considered similar to conventional optimization research however unlike conventional optimization methodology which typically designs the detention basin system on the basis of a largest flood state reduction or minimum engineering cost the trade off between cost and benefit was also considered the methodology was successfully applied to the hdb in the yangtze river the results demonstrate that the gate control strategy can significantly reduce the inundation loss in the detention basin for a relatively small flood t 100 the flood control benefits of the downstream protected regions are high when the breach control strategy was adopted but the substantial flood losses of the detention basin may result from a small flood in the river with this strategy it was found that the closer the flood diversion gate is to the upstream the higher the flood control benefit is in the protected region and the greater the flood losses are in the detention basin the construction of the flood diversion gate at wz can not only guarantee a higher expected annual benefit of the hdb yangtze river protected region system 3 86 billion yuan but also reduce the ead of the hdb 0 64 billion yuan the proposed detention basin flood diversion optimization methodology could help resolve the conflicts between detention basins and protected regions and has high flexibility extending to other detention basins in china and the floodplains in other countries credit

4623,utilizing detention basin to store flood water and reduce the risk of levee failure as well as guarantee the security of important regions downstream is an important flood control measure in some large river catchments however the populated and economic detention basins in china are facing the dual challenges of protecting the safety of lives and property and alleviating the pressure of flood control downstream maximizing the total benefits of a flood control system by balancing the flooding losses in the detention basin and the flood control benefit of the flood protected regions downstream has been the key factor in river basin flood management in this paper a framework is developed to optimize the flood diversion siting and operating policy of a detention basin which consists of three modules 1 the flood simulation module which simulates the flood routing and flood diversion process via a one dimensional and two dimensional coupled hydrodynamic model 2 the cost and benefit calculation module which estimates the flood damage in the detention basin and the flood control benefit in flood protected regions based on the results of the flood simulation model with the diversion structure cost considered and 3 the optimization module which optimizes the diversion siting and control strategy with the objective of the maximum system benefit by balancing the flood loss in the detention basin and flood control benefit of the protected area the framework is applied to the huayanghe detention basin the most downstream detention basin along the yangtze river basin china the results state that gate control upstream is the optimal strategy to decrease the flood losses in the detention basin but the potential flood losses of the protected region increase significantly under this policy moreover an operating policy that balances moderately the flooding losses in the detention basin and the flood control benefit of flood protected regions downstream is provided though the framework overall this study highlights flood simulations and optimization approaches represent a promising solution for filling the gap of densely populated detention basin modeling and real world management decision making keywords flood management flood detention basin flood loss estimation yangtze river balance of benefits and losses 1 introduction detention basins refer to the low lying areas along rivers that are surrounded by dikes these basins are used to reduce the levee failure risk and the potential inundation losses in their flood protected regions by temporarily diverting a certain volume of floodwater when the flood exceeds the river flood discharge capacity chow et al 1988 as an important component of flood control systems detention basins have been widely used in large river basins worldwide to achieve the maximum flood control benefit of the system vorogushyn et al 2012 park et al 2012 bellu et al 2016 terêncio et al 2020 as of 2011 china constructed 94 detention basins along major rivers with a total area of 33716 5 km2 china s detention basins are intensively populated economic development regions holding approximately 16 56 million people and contributing more than 100 billion yuan gross domestic product gdp in 2011 zhang and song 2014 enormous losses would be caused if these basins were used to divert flood water lin et al 2010 zhang and song 2014 zhang et al 2016 a shift in detention basin management policy occurred at 2012 with the flood storage and detention area design specification ministry of water resources prc which stipulate that appropriate flood diversion operating policy should be selected according to the topography water flow size and inhabitant of the detention basin this shift provides further space to control the amount of flood storage in detention basin however a larger flood loss in the protected region may be generated by levee failure without the implementation of those detention basin therefore it is a key and a dilemma in basin flood management to balance the flood loss of detention basins and flood control benefits of protected regions and to seek a scientific utilization strategy for detention basins vorogushyn et al 2012 tung 2017 york and jacob 2020 the benefits refer to the flood damage reduction in the protected region resulted from the flood diversion by the detention basin for a detention basin river protected region system the location size and operation policy of the detention basin will significantly affect the probability and consequences of downstream levee failure as well as the construction cost of the system in this system the location and size of the detention basin which determine the drainage area and the storage volume are the most essential parameters mays and bedient 1982 ngo et al 2016 terêncio et al 2020 while the operating policy refers to the siting and the control strategy of the flood diversion which influence the flood hazard mitigation of protected region and flood losses in the detention basin breach control weir control and gate control are the common control strategies in flood diversion of detention basins sanders et al 2006 as the most essential parameters to design the optimal location and size have been investigated by a multitude of works mays and bedient 1982 proposed an optimal model based on dynamic programming to design the size and location of detention basins within a watershed under the objective of minimum system construction costs bennett and mays 1985 improved the previous model by taking into account the costs of the outlet structures of detention basins and downstream channels in the design process by utilizing this model taur et al 1987 successfully optimized the detention basin system in the walnut creek watershed austin texas travis and mays 2008 optimized the location and sizing of retention basins in a watershed with the objective of minimizing the total cost which includes the engineering construction cost the project maintenance cost and the sediment cleaning cost later various optimization algorithms genetic algorithm simulated annealing etc and detailed increased engineering cost calculations were introduced in the optimal design of a detention basin river protected region system yeh and labadie 1997 behera et al 1999 perez pedini et al 2005 park et al 2012 in summary the above publications only considered the engineering cost and primarily focused on the size of the detention basin but there is still a risk of levee failure downstream even if the storage volume of the detention basin meets the design requirement due to flood uncertainties oxley and mays 2014 in fact even though the peak water level decreased below the critical water level by flood diversion there is still levee failure possibility downstream due to the uncertainty of the system itself d oria et al 2019 thus the consequence of the levee failure has been considered in the optimal design of the flood detention basins afterwards utilizing hydrology and hydrodynamic models to simulate flood routing processes in flood control systems evaluating flood risk and levee failure consequences of the system according to the simulation results and optimizing system design is an effective measure for flood management zhu et al 2007 ravazzani et al 2014 vieira et al 2018 dupuits et al 2019 chen et al 2007 evaluated the flood control benefits that feng hua detention ponds brought to the tainan scientific base industrial park based on the calculation results of a one dimensional 1 d and two dimensional 2 d coupled hydrodynamic model vorogushyn et al 2012 combined a 1 d and 2 d coupled model and a probability model to simulate the flood process in a channel dike detention basin system and analyzed the impact of detention basins on the probability of levee failure and flood loss in the protected region downstream del giudice et al 2014 proposed a simple analytical method that allows a preliminary efficiency evaluation of a detention basin system either in series or parallel in a specific target section cunha et al 2016 incorporated the storm water management model swmm model and simulated an annealing algorithm to optimize the number of flood storage units and their location size and orifice dimensions in any case the key hydraulic variables describing the dynamics of the inundation typically flood depth and flood stage are evaluated through suitable hydrodynamic models which are usually validated against historical flood data guida et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 moura rezende et al 2019 for the completed flood detention basin the flood diversion site and its operating strategy are the key factors that affect the flood diversion process and the peak flow mitigation efficiency and are also essential for the comprehensive and effective management of flood consequences yang et al 2010 d oria et al 2019 jaffe and sanders 2001 implemented a 2 d hydrodynamic model to analyze the impacts of flood plain storage breach size flood discharge flood duration and breach timing on the reduction in the peak flood stages in river channels when an engineered levee breach is adopted to control the flood diversion process and then proposed a strategy for the levee breach design sanders et al 2006 analyzed the performance of breach passive control gate active control and weir control strategies with respect to flood diversion for river flood stage reduction and the results indicated that gate control is remarkably effective kim et al 2016 proposed a design procedure for determining the optimal length of the flood diversion control weir based on a numerical simulation nevertheless the aforementioned methodologies are typically based on idealized numerical experiments that can be prohibitive for wide river domains and complex topographies through contemporary studies have provided valuable tools methods and insights for the optimal design of the location size and operating policy of detention basins there are obvious difference between the condition of china and other countries generally flood detention basins have a single purpose of flood control whereas in china as a result of the development of population and economic in flood detention basins there are two purposes flood control and human habitat zhang and song 2014 in china the flood diversion siting and control strategy must account the trade offs between the flood control benefits downstream areas the flood losses in the detention basins and engineering costs of the flood diversion control structures however few studies have focused on the impacts of the flood diversion location and operating strategy on flood losses in detention basins this paper proposes a framework for optimizing flood diversion sites and operating strategies for detention basin river protected region systems which combines a flood simulation model a cost and benefit evaluation model and an optimization model based on this framework the scheme of flood diversion detention basins can be optimized by comprehensively calculating the flood loss flood control benefits and construction costs finally the framework is applied to the huayanghe detention basin hdb in the yangtze river basin the results demonstrate that the integrated 1 d and 2 d coupled modeling cost benefit calculation and optimization can provide great flexibility to the formulation of water management for densely populated detention basins and enhance the interpretability of the optimized results since a model like mike can comprehensively simulate the hydraulic variables in detention basin river protected regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions 2 methodology the general framework for the methodology introduced in this study is presented in fig 1 which encompasses three modules i the flood simulation module ii the cost benefit analysis module and iii the optimization module the flood simulation module simulates the flood routing process of the river flood diversion gate detention basin by a 1 d and 2 d coupled hydrodynamic model then the model provides the inundated depth distribution of the detention basin water level and flood discharge of the river to the cost benefit analysis module the cost mainly includes the flood losses of the detention basin the flood control benefits for the protected region and the diversion structure construction cost finally the optimization module sets up the objective and constrains equations to select the best siting and control strategy for flood diversion 2 1 flood simulation module to simulate the inundated depth distribution in the detention basin and the flood stage reduction of the downstream river after flood diversion a 1 d and 2 d coupled flood simulation model is constructed based on mike mike is a well known hydrodynamic model developed by dhi and has been implemented to simulate water movement in rivers lakes and oceans wang et al 2019a 2019b mike 11 mike 21 fm and mike flood modules have been widely applied to the flood simulation of river levee flood detention systems liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in this study the 1 d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 11 module is used to simulate flood routing in the river channel and the 2 d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 21 fm module is used to simulate flood routing in the detention basin the 1 d and 2 d models are coupled by the mike flood module using different linkage modes at candidate locations for flood diversion and the corresponding structures in the mike 11 model such as the sluice structure and broad crested weir structure are set to reflect the effects of the operating policies the mike 11 module calculates the transport of water by solving continuous equation 1 and momentum equation 2 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g q q c 2 a r 0 where x and t denote the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively a is the area of river cross sections q and z denote the discharge and water level of the river cross section respectively q is the lateral

equation of a three dimensional 3 d incompressible fluid which is subject to the boussinesq hypothesis and the hydrostatic pressure hypothesis the control equations used in this model are given as

flood routing process simulation the distributed inundation depth of the detention basin and flood stage of the river channel are extracted to calculate the flood losses and flood control benefits of the detention basin river protected region system the flood loss evaluation of the detention basin is based on the stage damage function dias et al 2018 dutta et al 2003 tang et al 1992 wang et al 2018 the method establishes the loss rate function of various sectors under different submerged depths this study adopts a segmented loss rate function 6 f j a j 1 0 h s h 1 a j 2 h 1 h s h 2 a ji h i 1 h s h i where f j is the loss rate of sector j and a ji denotes the loss ratio of sector j when the water depth h s is between h i 1 and h i the loss rate is the ratio between the loss of various kinds of properties and the original or normal property and the parameters affected by the topography landform flood characteristics property types disaster seasons and emergency measures the total inundation loss l d in the detention basin is determined by the calculated loss rate f and the total gdp g of all sectors 7 l d i n j m f j g i j where l d is the total loss of the detention basin and g i j is the gdp of sector j in calculation unit i 2 2 2 flood control benefits evaluation in addition to overtopping piping and erosion may also lead to fluvial levee failure before the water level reaches the crests of the levees bhowmik and demissie 1982 vorogushyn et al 2009 dierauer et al 2012 the probability of levee failure is affected by the uncertainty of the geometric parameters and the rock soil characteristics that indicate the intrinsic properties of the structure of the levee additionally the probability even more directly depends on the peak level and duration of the flood in the river which refers to hydraulic loading the levee failure function that we used was based on a stochastic levee failure function that the united states army corps of engineers usace used to calculate the average reliability of levees in the planning studies the probability of failure p f varies smoothly between 0 when the flood water level h is at or below the levee toe h min and 1 when h reaches the levee crest h max usace 1999 dierauer et al 2012 pinter et al 2016 8 p f 0 36 tan 1 10 3 h h min h max h min 7 2 0 52 where h refers to the water surface elevations of the stream channel and h max denotes the elevation of the levee crest the potential flood losses of the protected areas are determined by the probability and consequences of the levee failure of the levees along those areas as mentioned above the failure consequences calculation needs to obtain the submerged depth and corresponding loss rate in the target area however in the detention basin river flood protected region system the immense area of the protected region brings a large challenge to the simulation of flood routing via the 2 d hydrodynamic model previous studies have shown that the total flood losses are closely related to the flood magnitudes reflected by the return periods t and the relationship can be reflected by the recurrence interval loss rate curve dierauer et al 2012 pinter et al 2016 since the detention basin and the downstream protected region are in the same levee system the loss rates of the detention basin for all flood recurrence intervals are already calculated in section 2 2 1 therefore the total loss rate of the downstream protection area is assumed to be equal to that of the detention basin under the same flood conditions with the purpose of simplifying the calculations however the application of detention basins reduced the flood flow downstream a proportional coefficient r which refers to the proportion of the diversion flood volume of the detention basin to the total exceeding flood volume is used to express the impact of the reduced flood volume by the detention basin on the levee failure consequences of the protected region finally the losses of the downstream protection region are calculated as follows 9 l p g p f f t r 1 2 10 f t l d t g d 11 r v c v d v c where l p is the total loss of the protected region downstream g is the gdp of the protected region downstream and p f refers to the failure probably of the levee downstream which is calculated by formula 8 l d t is the average total loss of the detention basin under t years of flooding and g d is the gdp of the detention basin v d is the volume of flood diversion and v c is the flood volume that exceeds the capacity of the river both of them can be acquired from the results of the 1 d model the flood control benefits that the detention basin brings to the protected region are obtained by comparing the potential flood loss of the protected region with and without the utilization of the detention basin therefore the flood control benefits of the downstream protected region under a certain flood diversion strategy can be calculated as follows 12 b i l p l p i where b i is the flood control benefits under the flood diversion strategy i l p is the potential flood loss of the protected region without the implementation of the detention basin and l p i denotes the potential flood loss of the protected region under the flood diversion strategy i 2 2 3 construction and maintenance cost at present the flood diversion control methods of detention basins include gate control breach control and side weir control vorogushyn et al 2012 sanders et al 2006 among them the gate control needs to be built the gate project and the flood diversion channel the construction cost of the first investment is relatively large and is seldom used at present breach control means that when the water level in the river exceeds the warning stage the levee will be breached artificially at the designated location and repaired after the flood receded the operation of this method is convenient and the construction investment is low so this approach has been widely used in detention basins without inhabitants the cost of the breach structure mainly refers to the levee repair costs within the breach which are determined by the breach width and the per meter cost the gate structure cost not only includes the structure construction cost which is determined by the gate width and the per meter cost but also includes the cost of the flood diversion aqueduct behind the gate the annualized cost of the flood diversion structure of a detention basin is then estimated as follows 13 c 1 n c i w d c c l c where c is the average construction cost n donates the total years that the structure expected to run c i is the per meter cost of structure i structure w d represents the width of the structure c c is the length of the flood diversion aqueduct and l c denotes the per meter cost of the flood diversion channel 2 3 optimization module to adequately address the merits and demerits of the flood diversion scheme the expected annual damage ead is adopted in this study which can comprehensively reflect the system risk lekuthai and vongvisessomjai 2001 the ead is calculated by integrating the damage estimates over their occurrence probabilities of the corresponding floods which is equal to the area underneath a damage probability curve fig 2 a it can be seen that the large damages under rare flooding events are weighted less whereas small damages associated with frequent events are weighted proportionally in the ead 14 ead 0 1 d p f d p f where p f denotes the annual exceedance probability of the flood event p f 1 t and d pf is the damage corresponding to the flood based on the ead method the expected annual benefit eab of the detention basin is estimated by the benefit probability curve since the dike itself can resist frequent floods the flood control benefit of the detention basin is close to 0 when encounter an extremely frequent flood event in consistent with the damage probability curve the detention basin can hardly bring flood control benefits to protected areas that encounter a very rare flood event therefore it is assumed that the flood control benefit decreases as the return periods t increase and the benefit probability curve is shown in fig 2b similarly the eab of the detention basin system is estimated as follows 15 eab 0 1 b p f d p f where b p f is the corresponding flood control benefit for the flood protected region taking the detention basin river protected region system as the study object and comprehensively considering the flood losses in the detention basin the flood diversion structure construction cost and the potential flood losses in the downstream flood protected region we propose a flood diversion siting and its operating policy optimization model the objective function is the maximum flood control benefit of the system 16 m a x b sys e a b i j e a d i j c inlet i j where i represents the operating policies of the flood diversion such as the weir gate and breach and j represents the gate location to reduce the inundation damage in the detention basin the amount of the flood that is diverted should be properly controlled the trade off between the flood losses of the detention basin and the flood control benefit of the protected region can be balanced by the following constraints 17 p l t p l i j t n d i j t m b i j t where p l t is the levee failure probability of the protected region without the operation of the detention basin for a t year flood p l i j t is the levee failure probability of the protected region with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood the parameter n is a constant that is greater than 0 and less than 1 indicating the maximum increase in the risk of the downstream dike d i j t denotes the flood damage of the detention basin with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood b i j t denotes the flood control benefits of the protected region with flood diversion at location j and operation policy i for a t year flood 3 case study 3 1 research area the hdb is the last detention basin of the yangtze river basin which located in the middle of the jiujiang and datong hydrology stations with a total area of 1721 km2 there are three connected lakes in the detention basin fig 3 the major function of the hdb is to alleviate the peak flood stage of the yangtze river mitigate the risk of levee failure and then guarantee the safety of life and property of important cities downstream when yangtze river encountering floods that exceed the design norm according to early planning the hdb will be opened to storage flood water once the water level of the hukou station reaches 20 6 m however there are currently 26 towns and villages in the hdb with approximately 640 000 residents and 67593 ha2 of farmland and most towns and farmlands which are protected by embankments are located in low lying areas around lakes with elevations of 11 20 m tremendous economic losses will occur once hdb is opened according to the relevant plan the flood diversion gate may be adopted to control flood diversion in the immediate future and the historical levee breach locations of the yangtze river chengying cy wangzhou wz and zhanjialuan zjl which nearing to the lakes in hdb were selected as the candidate locations for flood diversion changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources 2012 the cities along the yangtze river which breach between the hdb and datong station are the main protected regions of the hdb the largest city among them is anqing city with an annual gdp of approximately 270 billion yuan which is shown in fig 3 3 2 data and hydrodynamic model construction 1 geographical data the digital elevation model of the hdb with a resolution of 1 10 000 and topographic data of 280 cross sections from the jiujiang station to the datong station in the main stream of the yangtze river with an average distance of 1000 river mileage meters 2 hydrology data 100 year and 300 year design flood hydrographs of the jiujiang and datong gauging stations and the rating curve of the datong station cross section 3 social economic data the gdp of the agricultural industrial and commercial areas of 26 towns in the hdb 2013 the collected 280 cross sections of the reach between jiujiang and datong were used to reflect the river topography change in the 1 d model the model was calibrated and validated against two severe flood events with an approximately 50 year return period that occurred from june to september 1998 and june to september 2012 in the yangtze river to this end the inflow hydrograph at the jiujiang gauging station and lateral inflow of the tributary at the hukou gauging station were imposed at the upstream boundary while the rating curve of the datong gauging station was used as the downstream boundary condition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was used to evaluate the model the calibrated roughness coefficients n of the main channel and floodplains of the yangtze river were 0 024 and 0 033 respectively and the corresponding nses all exceeded 0 8 it is a challenge to establish an effective 2 d hydrodynamic model due to not only the extremely complex boundary conditions of the detention basin include roads bridges channels rivers houses arable lands lakes and embankments but also the corresponding spatial resolution requirement for the flood loss calculation the detention basin was discreted through an unstructured triangular 2 d mesh the advantage of this method is that the mesh size can be flexibly changed according to the importance of the topography in order to enhance the computational efficiency of the model we enlarged the grid scale of land use area with a wide and flat landscape such as arable lands settlements and water bodies meanwhile the grids around railways highways and embankments which show linear features were refined to represent the baffling function in flood routing in this case the length of the mesh changes from 20 m to 300 m which is capable of reflecting the topographic elements that could significantly affect flood propagation such as levees or road embankments as well as describing the topography of lakes due to the lack of observed flood diversion data the 2 d model of the hdb could not be validated in detail the modeling experience of the authors in a similar basin by the mike 21 and the proposals provided by local authorities were adopted wang et al 2019a 2019b as a result the calibrated roughness coefficients n were 0 045 for agricultural fields 0 08 for residential areas and 0 028 for lakes the 1 d and 2 d models are coupled by the mike flood module using the standard linkage mode at the candidate flood diversion locations of the hdb the corresponding structures sluice structure and broad crested weir structure are selected in the 1 d model to reflect the effects of operating policies and the flood diversion channel is built in the 2 d model 3 3 scenarios three candidate locations i e cy wz and zjl were selected for flood diversion and gate control strategy and breach control strategy were evaluated for each location finally six flood diversion schemes were investigated flood diversion begin when the water level of the hukou station reaches 20 6 m for gate control strategy the gate will be opened when the water level higher than 20 6 m and the total diversion volume less than 2 5 billion m3 and the flow rate is controlled at less than 6000 m3 s for the breach control strategy once the levee breached the breach will not be restored until the end of the flood and the breach lengths of the three candidate locations were all equal to 1 5 km the hdb is designed to reduce the flood peak of rare floods t greater than 100 in the yangtze river the probability of the occurrence of a flood with t greater than 300 in the yangtze river basin is low according to relevant studies which contribute little to the ead liu et al 2019a 2019b therefore only floods with t 100 and 300 are analyzed in summary 12 scenarios are investigated in the present study table 1 3 4 data processing and calculation the numerical flood simulations were performed imposing 100 year and 300 year return period 100 year and 300 year flood events synthetic design hydrographs at the upstream boundaries jiujiang and hukou gauging stations of the 1 d hydrodynamic model after simulating the inundations related to each scenario through the hydrodynamic model the average inundation depth of each town in the hdb is calculated based on the 2 d model results then the total flood losses l d of the hdb under all scenarios were calculated using formulas 6 and 7 to obtain the levee failure probability p f by equation 8 the maximum flood stage of the protected reach under each scenario was extracted from the results of the 1 d model in this study the river water level h level crest h max and levee toe h min were the averages of the protected reach the flood routing processes of the yangtze river without the use of the hdb under 100 year and 300 year floods were also simulated by the 1 d model as the reference condition for 12 investigated scenarios and the exceeding flood water v c of the two flood events were calculated it is also assumed that the flood loss rate f t in the protected region is the same as that of the hdb under the same flood events the gdp g of anqing in 2013 32 98 billion yuan was used to estimate the potential flood losses of the protected regions finally the flood control benefit could be calculated using equations 9 12 the objective of the optimization model in this study is to maximize the total benefits of the river detention basin protection region system theoretically the ead is used to analyze the comprehensive risk of the system under different flood diversion schemes and an accurate loss probability curve needs to be drawn however this requires a long time of flood observation data which is often difficult to achieve in actual cases therefore previous case studies usually used the flood loss of several specific flood recurrence periods t 50 100 300 to draw the curve and calculate the ead de moel et al 2014 foudi et al 2015 the lowest probability of flood detected in this study is 0 003 t 300 and the highest is 0 01 t 100 the damage values at the bounds of the integral for calculating the ead are arbitrarily set at 0 for a probability of 1 and at 150 of the damage estimated for a probability of 0 003 for the zero probability foudi et al 2015 in this case we assumed that the construction costs of the gate in the three candidate locations are equal to simplify the calculation of the construction cost according to the relevant planning the construction cost of a gate with 6000 m3 s flood diversion capacity flood is approximately 1 billion yuan the unit repair costs of levees vary between 22 million yuan km and 44 million yuan km according to their shape and function zhu et al 2007 referring to the previous research and the functions of the yangtze river embankment the maintenance cost of 30 million yuan km was used in this case and the width of each breach was set as 1 2 km 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood losses of the detention basin after simulating the inundations related to each flood diversion scenario through the hydrodynamic model the maximum inundation depth distribution of the hdb can be obtained from the numerical results panels a c in fig 4 show the 100 year flood maps of the gate control at cy wz and zjl of the maximum inundation depth for the case study notably from fig 4 both the extent of the flooded area and the maximum inundation depth of the hdb increase significantly when the diversion location near to downstream however a reverse situation appears in the breach control strategies fig 4d f and there are very small differences between wz fig 4e and zjl fig 4f moreover the right panels in fig 4 illustrate that water depths occur in all the low lying areas around the lakes under breach control while only several villages near the diversion channel of the gate have been inundated see left panels in fig 4 this phenomenon confirms that gate control has more prominent efficiency in flood peak eliminate which is in accordance with the results of previous study sanders et al 2006 fig 5 presents the maximum inundation depth distribution of the hdb under the 300 year flood event the villages located in the southeast are all inundated both in gate control fig 5a c and breach control fig 5d f strategies it is worth noting that the inundation distributions are very similar for different diversion locations under the same strategy which illustrates that the diverted flood will not be affected by the location when encountering a severe flood nonetheless the gate control strategy can still reduce the flood depth of the detention basin agricultural industrial and commercial sector losses are the main calculation objects of the hdb flood losses and the loss rate of each sector was divided into 5 levels table 2 according to the inundation depth lu et al 2018 the results illustrate that the gate control strategy decreased the losses for all flood events in comparison to breach control strategy for the 100 year flood the total flood losses of the hdb reached 1 43 billion yuan 2 25 billion yuan and 3 41 billion yuan at cy wz and zjl respectively using the gate control strategy which were reduced by 84 47 61 74 and 34 52 respectively in comparison to the breach operation strategy fig 6 for a 300 year flood the total flood losses were also relatively reduced by 50 67 44 16 and 42 61 in addition the closer the flood diversion gate is to the upstream the smaller the flood losses are in the detention basin under the gate operation strategy which mainly because of the higher flood stage reduction efficiency of an upstream flood diversion for example when the yangtze river encounters a 100 year flood the flood losses under the gate operation strategy at cy wz and zjl are 0 638 billion yuan 1 24 billion yuan and 2 3492 billion yuan respectively under the same flood event especially the relatively frequent one t 100 the gate control strategy can significantly reduce the flood losses in the detention basin because the hdb only needs to divert a small amount of the floodwater to keep the flood stage of the hk station below 20 60 m however in the levee breach scenarios the flood diversion process will not be stopped until the yangtze river water level is lower than the levee breach bottom elevation which leads to serious losses in the hdb even under small floods i e scenarios 3 7 and 11 as shown in fig 7 the gate controlled flood diversion at cy under the 100 year flood only lasts for three 113 h and the corresponding diverted flood water is 0 32 billion m3 under the breach strategy the diversion time exceeded 400 h and diverted flood water reached 6 72 billion m3 table 3 which definitely brings more severe losses to the hdb the flood diversion processes presented in fig 7 demonstrate that the diversion time and amount of diverted flood water increase when the diversion locate closer to the downstream which is in accordance with the change in inundated extent and flood losses in the hdb this change is attributed to the greater withdrawal rates when diverted floods are upstream and the same conclusion was addressed in the research of engineered breach control jaffe and sanders 2001 although gate control strategy is beneficial to the hdb especially under 100 year flood event up panels of fig 7 but the flood stage of the yangtze river exceeds its critical state 20 6 m under 300 year flood event down panels of fig 7 which is adverse to the flood control of the protected region it is obviously implicated that properly controlling flood diversion in a relatively small flood event not only reduces flood damage in the detention basin but also meets the flood control target of the river 4 2 flood control benefits of the downstream protected areas the flood routing processes of the yangtze river without the use of the hdb under 100 year and 300 year floods were simulated by the 1 d model as the reference condition for each scenario the maximum flood stage of each cross section in the protected reach 84 000 238 000 river mileage in meters of the yangtze river from jiujiang station the average maximum flood level of the protected reach and the decrease in the average maximum flood level caused by the hdb in each scenario are shown in table 4 the maximum flood levels of the protected reach have been reduced significantly through flood diversion by the hdb for all flood events the average maximum flood level reductions are between 0 19 m scenario 1 and 0 36 m scenario 7 for the 100 year flood and between 0 11 m scenario 10 and 0 39 m scenario 4 for the 300 year flood fig 8 presents the maximum flood stage reductions in different flood diversion strategies relative to the scenario without the use of the hdb under the 100 year flood the largest and least reductions of flood stage were occurred when the flood diversion siting at wz and cy respectively regardless of the control strategy these stage reductions are the primary mechanism that contributes to the alleviation of the potential flood losses in the protected region downstream furthermore the stage reduction decreases more significantly at the same location under the breach control strategy which can be attributed to the largest discharge and the total amount of flood diversion are not limited in this strategy fig 8 for the 100 year flood the flood control benefits brought by the construction of the diversion gates at cy wz and zjl to the protected area are 5 67 billion yuan 8 91 billion yuan and 9 59 billion yuan respectively fig 9 in comparison the flood control benefits of the protected region under breach control strategies at the three locations increased by 126 23 32 61 and 21 02 respectively however different control strategies at the same location only lead to a slight effect on the levee failure probability downstream for the 100 year flood the downstream levee failure probability the location selected at cy wz and zjl only changed by 0 7 1 47 and 1 84 respectively table 5 the increased flood control benefits is mainly due to the larger diverted flood water amount under breach control strategies than that of gate control strategies while also causes more flood losses in the detention basin for the 300 year flood the flood control benefits brought to the protected area by the construction of gates at cy wz and zjl are 12 24 billion yuan 10 44 billion yuan and 11 84 billion yuan respectively with small variation this result is because during large flood events the diverted flood water reached the limitation of 2 5 billion m3 the flood control benefits produced by the hdb of the breach at cy wz and zjl are 18 55 billion yuan 14 78 billion yuan and 14 15 billion yuan respectively which illustrates that the closer breach is to the upstream the greater flood control benefit will be in the protected regions on comparison the probability of levee failure in the downstream was eliminated by 7 27 4 21 and 12 75 under the breach control strategy table 5 which obviously improved the safety of the downstream area in summary under small floods the total amount of flood water stored by the detention basin should be appropriately controlled to decrease the probability of levee failure in the downstream protection area and reduce the loss of life and property within the detention basin for large infrequent flood events the detention basin should store as much flood water as possible 4 3 construction cost the diversion gate construction and breach repair costs calculated by equation 13 are 1 billion yuan and 45 million yuan respectively since the hdb project is expected to operate for 100 years the annual cost of the gate project is 0 01 billion yuan c g 1 100 0 01 moreover the flood control object of the hdb is a 100 year flood and the expected times that a breach occurs during the project operation is 1 so the expected annual cost of the breach is 0 45 million yuan c b 45 100 0 45 which is much less than that of the gate 4 4 optimization of the flood diversion method the ead of the hdb and the edb of the protected region downstream under various scenarios are shown in table 6 regardless of the constraints i e ignoring the flood losses in the hdb breaching the levee of the yangtze river at cy is the best flood diversion strategy that satisfies the objective function of maximizing the system benefit the annual benefit of the hdb yangtze river protected region system is 4 41 billion yuan in scenario 2 however the ead of the hdb reached a surprisingly high level of 2 08 billion yuan which brings a tremendous threat to the safety of the lives and property of residents in the hdb according to the analysis in section 4 2 in a relatively frequent flood event t 100 the hdb only needs to divert a small amount of flood water to ensure the safe flood stage of the yangtze river to reasonably mitigate the internal losses of the hdb under a frequent flood event in this study the parameters m and n in formula 17 are taken as 0 25 and 30 respectively that is the submerged loss of the hdb should not be less than 0 5 times the flood control benefit of the protection area and the probability of levee failure downstream should not exceed 30 in conclusion the final optimized flood diversion location and strategy is to build a flood diversion gate at wz with an annual benefit of 3 84 billion yuan an hdb ead of 0 64 billion yuan and a flood protected area eab of 4 49 billion yuan in contrast to previous studies mays and bedient 1982 bennett and mays 1985 the construction cost shows little effect on the optimization results for the detention basin river protected region system the optimization framework provides inputs to detention basin operation when the consequence and the flood control benefit of the flood diversion are considered the application results also demonstrate that the flood losses in the detention basin must be considered during the design phase the characteristics of the detention basin such as topography water flow size and inhabitant china s design specification ministry of water resources prc 2012 can be reflected via the flood loss estimation module in our framework although most detention basins in other countries are sparsely populated the proposed framework could be expended to those basins by specifying cost and benefit between the detention basin and the protected regions downstream in different basins more accurate flood diversion operation can be undertaken through further research which is of great significance to optimize the co benefits of flood control and ecological restoration or maintenance in detention basins 5 conclusions flood detention basins in china are confronting challenges of both flood mitigation and regional development this paper proposes a comprehensive methodology that combined the flood routing simulation module cost benefit assessment module and optimization module for the optimization of flood diversion siting and its operating strategy of a populated detention basin attention was focused on the location and control strategy of flood diversion due to the significant influence that these factors have on the dynamics of the subsequent inundation and on the flood stage reduction the spatial inundation depth and flood stage conducted on the numerical results of the hydrodynamic model allows the following economic elements to be generated for a design flood event of a given return period 1 the flood losses of the detention basin 2 the potential losses of the protected region and 3 the flood control benefit that the detention basin brings to the protected region in addition the construction cost of the diversion structure was also considered similar to conventional optimization research however unlike conventional optimization methodology which typically designs the detention basin system on the basis of a largest flood state reduction or minimum engineering cost the trade off between cost and benefit was also considered the methodology was successfully applied to the hdb in the yangtze river the results demonstrate that the gate control strategy can significantly reduce the inundation loss in the detention basin for a relatively small flood t 100 the flood control benefits of the downstream protected regions are high when the breach control strategy was adopted but the substantial flood losses of the detention basin may result from a small flood in the river with this strategy it was found that the closer the flood diversion gate is to the upstream the higher the flood control benefit is in the protected region and the greater the flood losses are in the detention basin the construction of the flood diversion gate at wz can not only guarantee a higher expected annual benefit of the hdb yangtze river protected region system 3 86 billion yuan but also reduce the ead of the hdb 0 64 billion yuan the proposed detention basin flood diversion optimization methodology could help resolve the conflicts between detention basins and protected regions and has high flexibility extending to other detention basins in china and the floodplains in other countries credit

4624,the effects of interactions between natural factors on the genesis of high arsenic groundwater on a global scale remain poorly understood this paper develops a neural network model of global groundwater arsenic contamination using 26 indicators including climate soil physical and chemical properties and more than 70 612 data points worldwide to identify and quantify typical interaction effect importance analysis shows that the pivotal main effects are produced by climate and soil texture indicators among these main effects seven true and six second order interactions with five related to precipitation in the latter were identified to be responsible for about 10 5 of the variation in the occurrence probability of high arsenic groundwater for the second order interactions the interaction strength in the torrid zone is stronger than that in the temperate zone on a global scale high precipitation is more likely to generate a dramatic interaction with such interactions less likely to occur at the low end of the interactive indicators high probabilities of elevated arsenic concentration are usually accompanied by synergy and vice versa keywords arsenic interaction effect global model artificial neural network 1 introduction high arsenic as groundwater as 10 μg l 1 who 2011 is widespread and has been recognized as a worldwide public health problem due to the carcinogenicity of arsenic and the fact that 50 of the world s drinking water is sourced from groundwater argos et al 2010 zektser and everett 2004 smith et al 2000 an estimated 94 to 220 million people worldwide are potentially exposed to high arsenic groundwater on any given day murcott et al 2012 podgorski and berg 2020 although natural processes such as reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides and desorption under alkaline conditions have been known as the main causes for groundwater arsenic contamination smedley and kinniburgh 2002 and anthropogenic factors such as groundwater pumping harvey et al 2002 and well structure erickson et al 2018 may be locally important there has been little work on identification and quantification of the potential interactions between the drivers hindering the understanding and prediction of the risks of high arsenic groundwater as demonstrated in different studies on natural systems the interactive effect of two or more independent variables could be either significantly stronger or much weaker than their sum or individual bairey et al 2016 basu et al 2018 mayfield and stouffer 2017 most of the variation in model response can be explained by the accumulation of important main effects while the remaining variation can be attributed to interaction effects thus there is a knowledge gap in understanding of the interactions between various factors controlling the hydrobiogeochemical behavior of arsenic in groundwater systems prediction models using surface or three dimensional observed or simulated variables as explanatory indicators have been used at various scales to assist in the identification of potential areas with high arsenic concentrations amini et al 2008 ayotte et al 2016 2017 bindal and singh 2019 podgorski et al 2017 podgorski and berg 2020 winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 all of these models especially the few large scale ones amini et al 2008 podgorski and berg 2020 have contributed to alerting the risk of high arsenic groundwater in regions with no data while improving model predictive performance is an important and necessary consideration a prior goal in geoscience problems is to discover physical pathways hidden in data that can serve as building blocks for scientific models of geoscience unlike physical models machine learning models do not directly consider the mechanisms behind the processes despite performance imbalances and overfitting of some models supplementary table s1 the satisfactory performance of most machine learning models means that the models successfully capture main characteristics of the predicted objects in their own ways therefore mining models may help fill some knowledge gaps to provide new insights into the genesis of high arsenic groundwater and contribute to the performance improvement of the physical models and statistical models geoscience processes show a high degree of variability in space and time leading to heterogeneity in geoscience variables at various scales at present in space the potential indicators are usually available at large scales but not at the same time at high resolution horizontal or vertical which limits the establishment of large scale high resolution prediction models although surface indicators do not satisfy the need to obtain high resolution spatial distributions e g variations between adjacent wells they are sufficient for the exploration of heterogeneity in geoscience variables and drivers on a larger scale one of the main advantages of neural networks is the ability to model complex interactions between features based on the above insights we developed a global artificial neural network model hereafter called gganet to capture the relationship between arsenic levels and environmental indicators and a global predictive map was produced from gganet to find areas in which arsenic concentrations exceed the who guideline of 10 μg l 1 then the permutation importance method and the classification and regression tree method were combined to identify important indicators whose interactions were then identified and quantified by the neural interaction detective algorithm framework 2 material and methods the framework of the methods used in this study is shown in fig 1 the detailed description of the method is given below 2 1 arsenic dataset the data used for modeling consists of two parts 1 groundwater arsenic concentration data more than 140 000 groundwater arsenic data points were collected worldwide from multiple literatures and public datasets supplementary fig s1 and table s2 the samples were collected between 1989 and 2015 with 90 collected after 2000 2 the indicators representing various climatic geologic soil and other parameters known or hypothesized to be related to the hydrogeochemistry of arsenic among the existing studies logistic regression ayotte et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 tree based methods bindal and singh 2019 erickson et al 2018 frederick et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 and neural network chang et al 2010 park et al 2015 are the most commonly used methods among statistical models used to create models between response and explanatory variables these studies screened out effective indicators based on principal component analysis or univariate feature selection or significance of regression coefficients or classifiers of classification trees or model accuracy decrease caused by random allocation of indicators values based on above previous research a total of 26 natural factors supplementary table s3 representing climate hydrology soil properties and geophysical aspects were selected as potential indicators of groundwater arsenic although the time frame of the arsenic data is not exactly the same as the explanatory data in general predictors are largely representative of long term average conditions due to differences in resolution data format and projections the indicators were converted to raster format at 5 arc minutes spatial resolution to maintain uniformity among indicators given the fact that some of the arsenic data points have only the concentration range information arsenic data points were not aggregated to one arsenic concentration per pixel to fit with the resolution of the indicators layers therefore the full set of indicator values was directly assigned to the arsenic data points and then duplicates and missing data were deleted the minmax normalization was performed on all indicators the final dataset consisted of 138 056 observations 35 306 25 6 of which represent occurrences of high arsenic groundwater events this low incidence is common events and nonevents in most studies are very uneven and this leads to an imbalance with respect to sensitivity and specificity supplementary table s1 to avoid such problems 35 306 observations were randomly selected from nonevents and added to the event dataset 70 612 combined observations to from a balance dataset 2 2 artificial neural network model and model uncertainty considering the large volume high dimensions and strong nonlinearity of the data and the need for subsequent analysis artificial neural network was employed as the modeling procedure the artificial neural network ann is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles a human brain and thus can model complex relationships between variables ann consists of two or more layers of neurons including input layer hidden layer and output layer which are connected by links with varying weights the neuron data are multiplied by the weights to compute the signal strength and then are transferred to the next neuron in the network where linear or nonlinear transfer functions are used to transform the signal the input layer neurons accept the input data and forward the signals to the next layer according to the connection this process is continued until the signals reach the output layer after the errors between prediction and observation are evaluated according to the loss function the weight will be updated by learning algorithm to make a better prediction until the model satisfies the performance goal in general for neural networks it is necessary to try different topologies namely the number of hidden layers and neurons to determine the best parameters the accuracy sensitivity the ability to identify events specificity the ability to identify events nonevents positive predictive value ppv the percentage of true events in predicted events negative predictive value npv the percentage of true nonevents in predicted nonevents auc area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and cohen s kappa of the model on the test set were used as evaluation criteria of model performance using the above criteria after some trial and error our feedforward neural network gganet comprises four hidden layers with 8 18 24 and 12 neurons respectively the softmax transfer function was used between hidden layer and output layer softmax transfer function is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes goodfellow et al 2016 hyperbolic tangent transfer function the most commonly used sigmoid type functions was used for connection of other layers han and morag 1995 the combination of bayesian regularization mackay 1991 foresee and hagan 1997 and validation stopping maximum validation failures 100 were used to prevent overfitting mean square error was employed as the performance function the dataset for modeling was randomly divided into training 90 validation 5 and test 5 datasets in addition the model uncertainty was also used as the evaluation criterion when the structure of the model remains deterministic the uncertainty of the input samples is the main source of prediction uncertainty kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2012 ideally large and non repeated samples should be drawn from a population in order to create a sampling distribution for a statistic in practice however only one single sample of the population may be available in this case this single sample can serve as a mini population and bootstrapping a resampling method can be used to estimate the population parameters or estimate the uncertainty tibshirani 1996 bootstrapping is loosely based on the law of large numbers which states that if sampling with replacement is performed repeatedly data should approximate the true population data bootstrapping follows four steps 1 resampling mini population b times usually 20 200 with b as large as possible if conditions allow sample size was n n is usually the same as the original data size 2 b models were trained with b bootstrap samples 3 the above b models were used to predict the test samples respectively 4 a statistic was calculated for each test sample as a measure of uncertainty in this study 1000 samples 50 events were randomly selected from the balance dataset as the test samples and the remaining samples are 69 712 50 events in this study b and n were selected as 100 and 69712 respectively the standard deviation of predictions is chosen as the measure of uncertainty neural network design and implementation and all other data analysis were performed using matlab 2 3 importance of indicators the importance of indicators can be measured based on different methods and metrics consistency between the results obtained by different methods can make indicator importance ranking more reliable which is crucial because this ranking is the basis for subsequent analysis this study combined the permutation importance method pi fisher and rosenblum 2016 and classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 to measure the importance of indicators pi is based on a straightforward idea of measuring indicator importance by calculating the increase in the model s prediction error after permuting the indicator eq 1 1 i i e rand i e orig where ii is the importance of the i th indicator ei rand is the model error after permuting the i th indicator and eorig is the original trained model error the larger the i the more important the indicator for the cart the interaction test loh 2002 was specified for splitting predictors to prevent the standard cart algorithm from preferring to split the predictors with more levels thus creating an unbiased tree nodes split criterion was specified as gini s impurity eq 2 2 gini s impurity 1 i p i 2 where the sum is over the classes i at the node and p i is the proportion of observations with class i that reach the node a node with just one class a pure node has gini s impurity 0 otherwise the gini s impurity is positive the indicator importance can be estimated by summing changes in gini s impurity weighted by the node probability due to splits on every indicator and dividing the sum by the number of branch nodes the node probability is the proportion of observations from the original data that satisfy the conditions for the node pi and cart each conducted 50 repeated calculations to obtain the mean value of importance measures of indicators equal weight synthesis of the results of the two methods was used to obtain the final importance ranking 2 4 the main effect of indicator the global relationship between indicators and model response can be shown by a partial dependence plot pdp welch et al 2000 and individual conditional expectation ice ayotte et al 2017 erickson et al 2018 an accumulated local effects ale plot adopted in this study is an excellent alternative to a pdp and uses conditional distribution rather than marginal distribution and avoids the generation of unrealistic data points due to violation of the assumption of independence apley and zhu 2016 the core of the ale is to calculate the differences in predictions 1 the indicator was divided into intervals for the samples in an interval the difference in the prediction is calculated when the indicator value is replaced by the upper and lower limit of the interval 2 differences in predictions of all samples within an interval were added up and this sum was divided by the number of samples in this interval to obtain the average difference of the predictions for this interval that is the local effect of the indicator these local effects were later accumulated and centered resulting in the ale curve the interval lengths were selected to make the length of each interval and the number of data within the interval were as even as possible so as to minimize the impact of data distribution on ale 2 5 interaction effect the effect heredity principle wu and hamada 2000 states interactions can be considered only if the lower order item preceding the interaction effectively explains the change in response the focus is therefore on the potential interaction between important representative indicators these important indicators were used as input features of the neural network known here as inet which is part of the framework for detecting interactions in feedforward neural networks like inet interactions between input features are created by the non additive effect of nonlinear activation functions and the influences of the interactions are propagated layer by layer along a certain path to the final output and paths are encoded in weight matrices the neural interaction detective nid algorithm framework detects any order or form of interaction captured by the feedforward neural network using the weight matrix tsang et al 2018 nid only quantifies interactions created at the first hidden layer which is important for fast interaction detection and sufficient for high detection performance based on empirical evaluation according to nid interaction detection consists of three main steps 1 train the feedforward network inet the configuration of inet is the same as gganet except it has three hidden layers 20 12 and 4 neurons 2 nid first finds potential interaction items from inet and ranks them according to their interaction strength and 3 then the generalized additive model gam the last component of nid framework is used to exclude spurious interactions from potential interaction items to preserve the true interactions interaction strength ω i i of a potential interaction i at the i th unit in the first hidden layer is defined as eq 3 and 4 3 z w y w l w l 1 w 2 4 ω i i z i min w i i where the aggregated weight z is defined to represent the influence of a hidden unit that is the weight of the path wy and wl are absolute values of weight matrices of output layer and l th hidden layer l is the number of hidden layers respectively and so on the min w i i is the minimum value of the absolute value of the weight between the indicators constituting the interaction i and the i th hidden unit the nid traverses the learned input weight matrix across hidden neurons the final interaction strengths are obtained by selecting the top ranked interactions of every order based on interaction strengths and summing their respective strengths across hidden units allowing variable order interaction candidates to be ranked gam consists of two types of small feedforward networks that capture the main effects and interactions respectively networks that model main effects and interactions consisted of one hidden layer with size of 1 neuron and one hidden layer with size of 10 neurons respectively the configuration of networks is the same as gganet except the relu transfer function was used between hidden layer and output layer top ranked interactions are gradually added to the gam until performance on a test set plateaus or approaches that of inet at which point the interactions that have been added are considered to be a true interaction by comparing the performance of gam and inet with respect to gam without any interactions the relative performance improvement obtained by including detected interactions can be computed nid screened out interactions according to their strength and contribution to gam performance improvement but it failed to provide information on interaction types namely synergy or antagonism the ale plot apley and zhu 2016 was used to visualize the interaction effect only second order interactions were explored considering the visualization limitation and poor interpretability of higher order interactions groundwater arsenic data are collected from diverse environments and the interaction type of a certain interaction i may be heterogeneous therefore for each second order interaction the total data was divided into 4 subsets and then the 2d ale plot was used to visualize the interaction effect of each subset the 2d ale plot which can show the interaction effect of two indicators is calculated on the same principle as ale for single indicator but it works with rectangular cells instead of intervals because effects in two dimensions are needed to accumulate apley and zhu 2016 the cutoff values required for splitting data set were determined by genetic algorithm which minimizes the standard deviation of the 4 subsets data size that is to make the data size the most even so as to avoid the over interpretation of the subset with less data 3 results and discussion 3 1 global prediction of groundwater arsenic gganet contains 26 indicators related to climate hydrology soil properties topography and geophysics and the model performance was evaluated using the test dataset the accuracy sensitivity specificity fig 2 a area under the curve auc fig 2b and cohen s kappa 0 61 jointly indicate a satisfactory model although the distribution of data in space is uneven the structure of residual distributions in different regions is consistent fig 2c indicating no geographic bias against a certain region in gganet the margin of error of the predicted probability of the test samples is 0 099 0 003 95 confidence interval and the standard deviation of the predicted values is shown in fig s2 a global high arsenic groundwater probability map was generated based on gganet fig 3 extremely high risk areas 8 7 are distributed across all continents with the highest and most widespread in eurasia currently known high arsenic groundwater regions such as bangladesh harvey et al 2002 datong xie et al 2008 inner mongolia guo et al 2008 vietnam postma et al 2012 cambodia phan et al 2010 texas haque and johannesson 2006 california ayotte et al 2016 and india chowdhury et al 2000 are reproduced by the model two examples given fig 4 a and 4c areas identified by the model as high risk but currently lacking field survey data are mainly located in central asia russia and ukraine which aligns with other models amini et al 2008 podgorski et al 2017 two sets of data from songnen plain bian et al 2012 fig 4b and uttar bindal and singh 2019 fig 4d not involved in the modeling process show arsenic concentrations consistent with model predictions demonstrating the applicability of the model to identify potential risk areas 3 2 importance of indicators indicator importance ranking is instructive for understanding the main processes responsible for prediction there is cointegration 5 significance level among the results of pi and cart supplementary fig s3 which indicates that the relative importance of indicators obtained from pi is statistically consistent with that from cart the top indicators in the comprehensive ranking mainly include climate soil moisture and soil carbon and nitrogen fig 5 three climate indicators precipitation prcyr evapotranspiration etact and aridity index aridity average yearly precipitation divided by average yearly potential evapotranspiration show paramount importance which has also been recognized in previous regional and global scale models climate conditions that are favorable for groundwater recharge more precipitation less evapotranspiration shorten the residence time for groundwater and thus hinder the accumulation of arsenic amini et al 2008 ayotte et al 2017 frederick et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 however extremely high precipitation significantly increases the risk of elevated arsenic fig 6 and the mean values for soil organic carbon and topographic slope in such regions are larger than the overall dataset organic matter in the vadose zone can be transported by precipitation into aquifers and promote the release of arsenic by competitive adsorption and or fueling microbial reduction mailloux et al 2013 mcdonough et al 2019 soil texture indicators including soil drainage drain the higher the value the poorer the drainage and soil moisture capacity smax the higher the value the lower the soil moisture capacity are the second most important following the climate indicators fig 5 soil texture can be a proxy for current and past drainage conditions in various sedimentary environments and is closely related to local hydrogeological settings of aquifers winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 poor drainage and larger soil moisture capacity usually accompany high clay content and may therefore suggest the importance of reductive dissolution aziz et al 2008 yang et al 2014 poorer drainage may also cause stronger evaporation that leads to higher salinity and higher ph welch et al 2000 welch and stollenwerk 2003 and thus promotes the release of arsenic extremely poor drainage however is associated with a sharp decrease in the probability of high arsenic groundwater possibly because high clay content indicates a low energy sedimentary environment in which young sediments aquifers are often rare and thus groundwater is withdrawn from deeper older aquifers with low arsenic content winkel et al 2008 high levels of soil organic carbon are associated with higher probability of high arsenic groundwater fig 6 oc t cp s scss but again extremely high oc t is associated with a lower probability of high arsenic concentration similar patterns also occur in the indus plain podgorski et al 2017 indicating that the reductive dissolution process may not be dominant higher cation exchange capacity ce t often means a higher proportion of clay and organic matter particles both of which have a net negative charge and thus hold cations therefore ce t shows a general trend similar to drain and smax fig 6 base saturation bs t represents the proportion of the soil cation exchange capacity occupied by basic cations e g k na mg ca and is positively correlated with soil ph high soil ph promotes arsenic desorption and can be indicative of an evaporative environment podgorski et al 2017 which may partly explain why higher bs t predicts a higher probability of high arsenic groundwater as soil ph is far less important than bs fig 5 the remaining indicators mainly include the carbon nitrogen and ion characteristics of soil with less importance and little differences between them 3 3 interaction effect of indicators the heterogeneity of ice trajectories supplementary fig s4 strongly indicates interaction effects among various indicators based on the effect heredity principle wu and hamada 2000 only interactions between the following representative indicators were explored prcyr etact drain oc t bs t scss and nn s atypical interactions in which the interaction effect explains the change in response but the main effect does not were not considered since they rarely occur in real data a total of 114 potential interactions were detected by the nid the effect sparsity principle wu and hamada 2000 holds that only a few interactions are true in other words they capture significant changes in response the potential interactions can be clearly divided into two groups according to the interaction strength with the top six interactions distinctly different from the others fig 7 the performance of the gam indicates only the top seven interactions are considered true items fig 7 in terms of accuracy the interaction effect explains about 10 5 of the variation in the probability of high arsenic groundwater six of the seven interactions are second order showing the interaction hierarchy wu and hamada 2000 the higher the degree of interaction the less likely it explains the change in response although the unique seventh order interaction may be pseudo higher order interactions should be carefully included as they have been shown to exist in nature bairey et al 2016 prcyr occurs in five of the six second order interactions again demonstrating its paramount importance pi and cart automatically take into account interactions when measuring the importance of indicators for pi permuting the indicator breaks the relationship between indicators which inherently includes interactions tree based models are also often considered to capture pure interactions elith et al 2008 lampa et al 2014 the importance of prcyr may therefore be derived in large part from its interaction with soil indicators this is quite in line with expectations precipitation can connect the surface with the subterranean environment in most cases soil is the medium through which precipitation affects the quantity and quality of groundwater the influence indicator effect of precipitation and soil properties on groundwater as thus is likely to be non additive on a global scale heatmaps of total effect fig 8 a d have multiple hot spots high probability with no uniform pattern of hot spot distribution the main hot spots are located in areas with low prcyr low oc t high prcyr medium oc t high prcyr low nn s high prcyr etact high prcyr poor drain high prcyr high bs t and poor drain low nn s the patterns for the torrid and temperate zones are similar to the global case data for the frigid zone are not sufficient 1000 to make an evaluation a 2d ale plot only shows the interaction effect for two indicators apley and zhu 2016 the interaction effect can be either synergistic or antagonistic on a global scale synergy and antagonism coexist in all interactions fig 8a high precipitation is more likely to generate dramatic interaction while such interactions are less likely to occur in the low value areas of the two indicators more specifically high precipitation usually combines with low and high values of another indicator to create synergy and antagonism respectively unlike total effect the pattern of interaction effects in the torrid and temperate zones is different from the global pattern fig 8b c in terms of absolute interaction strength i e considering only strength regardless of antagonism or synergy the interaction effect in the torrid zone is stronger than that in the temperate zone with 90 confidence fig 8e much of this may be due to stronger rainfall in the tropics a comparison of the total effect and interaction effect shows that all of the four possible combinations exist high probability synergy high probability antagonism low probability synergy and low probability antagonism fig 8a c consistent with intuition whether on global scale or in torrid zone or temperate regions non hotspots of total effect are usually accompanied by non obvious interactions or antagonism while hotspots are almost always accompanied by synergy therefore synergy may promote groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding the limit of 10 μg l 1 here the observed tropical data were used as an example to verify the predicted interaction the interaction plot was used to show possible interactions in the observed data fig 9 this type of plot displays the high arsenic probability on the y axis while the x axis shows the values of the first indicator meanwhile the various lines represent values of the second indicator parallel lines indicate that there is no interaction effect while different slopes suggest that one might be present take the interaction between precipitation and organic carbon as an example to illustrate the verification fig 9a the model predicts that there is antagonism between precipitation and oc t at high oc t and the antagonism strength increased with the increase of precipitation fig 8b according to the observed data fig 9a in the case of low precipitation the increase of precipitation corresponds to the decrease of the high arsenic probability for the samples with lower oc t 1 2 2 while the opposite is true for the sample with higher oc t 2 this indicates that the effect of precipitation is enhanced by the increase of oc t that is there is synergy between them in the same way in the case of high precipitation the effect of precipitation is obviously inhibited by the increase of oc t that is there is antagonism between them therefore although the predicted interaction is incorrect at low precipitation the predicted trend is consistent with the observation that is the antagonism strength increased with the increase of precipitation the validation of the rest of interactions can be explained in the same way for drain nn s dividing too many intervals creates some interval with no data drain and nn s were thus only divided into well drained poorly drained and nn s 0 08 nn s 0 08 fig 9f respectively overall the interactions identified by the model are confirmed by the observed data it should also be noted that the same conclusions can be derived by switching the indicators of various lines and x axis in fig 9 4 conclusions compared with the existing high arsenic groundwater models this study has made some substantial advancement from the application perspective the well performing global model established in this study is one of the few large scale predictive models available and thus can facilitate monitoring in high risk areas the present study first identified and quantified interactions between high arsenic groundwater indicators contributing to a complete understanding of the formation of high arsenic groundwater although the number of indicators in our modeling is still limited and the relationship between them and the response not necessarily causal climate and soil properties and their interactions are clearly essential indicators for risk prediction of arsenic contamination of groundwater therefore in the study of high arsenic groundwater it can be a mistake to assess only the main effects when designing experiments or interpreting experimental and field data and the main effects cannot be interpreted without considering the interactions taking interactions into account is therefore expected to enable improvements in both the physical model by adding more processes and statistical models by for example taking interactions as predictors for types of geogenic contamination such as geogenic high arsenic groundwater more complete physical models may help with pollution remediation by providing guidance for the artificial regulation of geochemical processes in addition for prediction purposes interaction items may be used as potential effective predictors to simplify the model and improve prediction performance credit authorship contribution statement hailong cao conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft xianjun

4624,the effects of interactions between natural factors on the genesis of high arsenic groundwater on a global scale remain poorly understood this paper develops a neural network model of global groundwater arsenic contamination using 26 indicators including climate soil physical and chemical properties and more than 70 612 data points worldwide to identify and quantify typical interaction effect importance analysis shows that the pivotal main effects are produced by climate and soil texture indicators among these main effects seven true and six second order interactions with five related to precipitation in the latter were identified to be responsible for about 10 5 of the variation in the occurrence probability of high arsenic groundwater for the second order interactions the interaction strength in the torrid zone is stronger than that in the temperate zone on a global scale high precipitation is more likely to generate a dramatic interaction with such interactions less likely to occur at the low end of the interactive indicators high probabilities of elevated arsenic concentration are usually accompanied by synergy and vice versa keywords arsenic interaction effect global model artificial neural network 1 introduction high arsenic as groundwater as 10 μg l 1 who 2011 is widespread and has been recognized as a worldwide public health problem due to the carcinogenicity of arsenic and the fact that 50 of the world s drinking water is sourced from groundwater argos et al 2010 zektser and everett 2004 smith et al 2000 an estimated 94 to 220 million people worldwide are potentially exposed to high arsenic groundwater on any given day murcott et al 2012 podgorski and berg 2020 although natural processes such as reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides and desorption under alkaline conditions have been known as the main causes for groundwater arsenic contamination smedley and kinniburgh 2002 and anthropogenic factors such as groundwater pumping harvey et al 2002 and well structure erickson et al 2018 may be locally important there has been little work on identification and quantification of the potential interactions between the drivers hindering the understanding and prediction of the risks of high arsenic groundwater as demonstrated in different studies on natural systems the interactive effect of two or more independent variables could be either significantly stronger or much weaker than their sum or individual bairey et al 2016 basu et al 2018 mayfield and stouffer 2017 most of the variation in model response can be explained by the accumulation of important main effects while the remaining variation can be attributed to interaction effects thus there is a knowledge gap in understanding of the interactions between various factors controlling the hydrobiogeochemical behavior of arsenic in groundwater systems prediction models using surface or three dimensional observed or simulated variables as explanatory indicators have been used at various scales to assist in the identification of potential areas with high arsenic concentrations amini et al 2008 ayotte et al 2016 2017 bindal and singh 2019 podgorski et al 2017 podgorski and berg 2020 winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 all of these models especially the few large scale ones amini et al 2008 podgorski and berg 2020 have contributed to alerting the risk of high arsenic groundwater in regions with no data while improving model predictive performance is an important and necessary consideration a prior goal in geoscience problems is to discover physical pathways hidden in data that can serve as building blocks for scientific models of geoscience unlike physical models machine learning models do not directly consider the mechanisms behind the processes despite performance imbalances and overfitting of some models supplementary table s1 the satisfactory performance of most machine learning models means that the models successfully capture main characteristics of the predicted objects in their own ways therefore mining models may help fill some knowledge gaps to provide new insights into the genesis of high arsenic groundwater and contribute to the performance improvement of the physical models and statistical models geoscience processes show a high degree of variability in space and time leading to heterogeneity in geoscience variables at various scales at present in space the potential indicators are usually available at large scales but not at the same time at high resolution horizontal or vertical which limits the establishment of large scale high resolution prediction models although surface indicators do not satisfy the need to obtain high resolution spatial distributions e g variations between adjacent wells they are sufficient for the exploration of heterogeneity in geoscience variables and drivers on a larger scale one of the main advantages of neural networks is the ability to model complex interactions between features based on the above insights we developed a global artificial neural network model hereafter called gganet to capture the relationship between arsenic levels and environmental indicators and a global predictive map was produced from gganet to find areas in which arsenic concentrations exceed the who guideline of 10 μg l 1 then the permutation importance method and the classification and regression tree method were combined to identify important indicators whose interactions were then identified and quantified by the neural interaction detective algorithm framework 2 material and methods the framework of the methods used in this study is shown in fig 1 the detailed description of the method is given below 2 1 arsenic dataset the data used for modeling consists of two parts 1 groundwater arsenic concentration data more than 140 000 groundwater arsenic data points were collected worldwide from multiple literatures and public datasets supplementary fig s1 and table s2 the samples were collected between 1989 and 2015 with 90 collected after 2000 2 the indicators representing various climatic geologic soil and other parameters known or hypothesized to be related to the hydrogeochemistry of arsenic among the existing studies logistic regression ayotte et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 tree based methods bindal and singh 2019 erickson et al 2018 frederick et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 and neural network chang et al 2010 park et al 2015 are the most commonly used methods among statistical models used to create models between response and explanatory variables these studies screened out effective indicators based on principal component analysis or univariate feature selection or significance of regression coefficients or classifiers of classification trees or model accuracy decrease caused by random allocation of indicators values based on above previous research a total of 26 natural factors supplementary table s3 representing climate hydrology soil properties and geophysical aspects were selected as potential indicators of groundwater arsenic although the time frame of the arsenic data is not exactly the same as the explanatory data in general predictors are largely representative of long term average conditions due to differences in resolution data format and projections the indicators were converted to raster format at 5 arc minutes spatial resolution to maintain uniformity among indicators given the fact that some of the arsenic data points have only the concentration range information arsenic data points were not aggregated to one arsenic concentration per pixel to fit with the resolution of the indicators layers therefore the full set of indicator values was directly assigned to the arsenic data points and then duplicates and missing data were deleted the minmax normalization was performed on all indicators the final dataset consisted of 138 056 observations 35 306 25 6 of which represent occurrences of high arsenic groundwater events this low incidence is common events and nonevents in most studies are very uneven and this leads to an imbalance with respect to sensitivity and specificity supplementary table s1 to avoid such problems 35 306 observations were randomly selected from nonevents and added to the event dataset 70 612 combined observations to from a balance dataset 2 2 artificial neural network model and model uncertainty considering the large volume high dimensions and strong nonlinearity of the data and the need for subsequent analysis artificial neural network was employed as the modeling procedure the artificial neural network ann is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles a human brain and thus can model complex relationships between variables ann consists of two or more layers of neurons including input layer hidden layer and output layer which are connected by links with varying weights the neuron data are multiplied by the weights to compute the signal strength and then are transferred to the next neuron in the network where linear or nonlinear transfer functions are used to transform the signal the input layer neurons accept the input data and forward the signals to the next layer according to the connection this process is continued until the signals reach the output layer after the errors between prediction and observation are evaluated according to the loss function the weight will be updated by learning algorithm to make a better prediction until the model satisfies the performance goal in general for neural networks it is necessary to try different topologies namely the number of hidden layers and neurons to determine the best parameters the accuracy sensitivity the ability to identify events specificity the ability to identify events nonevents positive predictive value ppv the percentage of true events in predicted events negative predictive value npv the percentage of true nonevents in predicted nonevents auc area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and cohen s kappa of the model on the test set were used as evaluation criteria of model performance using the above criteria after some trial and error our feedforward neural network gganet comprises four hidden layers with 8 18 24 and 12 neurons respectively the softmax transfer function was used between hidden layer and output layer softmax transfer function is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes goodfellow et al 2016 hyperbolic tangent transfer function the most commonly used sigmoid type functions was used for connection of other layers han and morag 1995 the combination of bayesian regularization mackay 1991 foresee and hagan 1997 and validation stopping maximum validation failures 100 were used to prevent overfitting mean square error was employed as the performance function the dataset for modeling was randomly divided into training 90 validation 5 and test 5 datasets in addition the model uncertainty was also used as the evaluation criterion when the structure of the model remains deterministic the uncertainty of the input samples is the main source of prediction uncertainty kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2012 ideally large and non repeated samples should be drawn from a population in order to create a sampling distribution for a statistic in practice however only one single sample of the population may be available in this case this single sample can serve as a mini population and bootstrapping a resampling method can be used to estimate the population parameters or estimate the uncertainty tibshirani 1996 bootstrapping is loosely based on the law of large numbers which states that if sampling with replacement is performed repeatedly data should approximate the true population data bootstrapping follows four steps 1 resampling mini population b times usually 20 200 with b as large as possible if conditions allow sample size was n n is usually the same as the original data size 2 b models were trained with b bootstrap samples 3 the above b models were used to predict the test samples respectively 4 a statistic was calculated for each test sample as a measure of uncertainty in this study 1000 samples 50 events were randomly selected from the balance dataset as the test samples and the remaining samples are 69 712 50 events in this study b and n were selected as 100 and 69712 respectively the standard deviation of predictions is chosen as the measure of uncertainty neural network design and implementation and all other data analysis were performed using matlab 2 3 importance of indicators the importance of indicators can be measured based on different methods and metrics consistency between the results obtained by different methods can make indicator importance ranking more reliable which is crucial because this ranking is the basis for subsequent analysis this study combined the permutation importance method pi fisher and rosenblum 2016 and classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 to measure the importance of indicators pi is based on a straightforward idea of measuring indicator importance by calculating the increase in the model s prediction error after permuting the indicator eq 1 1 i i e rand i e orig where ii is the importance of the i th indicator ei rand is the model error after permuting the i th indicator and eorig is the original trained model error the larger the i the more important the indicator for the cart the interaction test loh 2002 was specified for splitting predictors to prevent the standard cart algorithm from preferring to split the predictors with more levels thus creating an unbiased tree nodes split criterion was specified as gini s impurity eq 2 2 gini s impurity 1 i p i 2 where the sum is over the classes i at the node and p i is the proportion of observations with class i that reach the node a node with just one class a pure node has gini s impurity 0 otherwise the gini s impurity is positive the indicator importance can be estimated by summing changes in gini s impurity weighted by the node probability due to splits on every indicator and dividing the sum by the number of branch nodes the node probability is the proportion of observations from the original data that satisfy the conditions for the node pi and cart each conducted 50 repeated calculations to obtain the mean value of importance measures of indicators equal weight synthesis of the results of the two methods was used to obtain the final importance ranking 2 4 the main effect of indicator the global relationship between indicators and model response can be shown by a partial dependence plot pdp welch et al 2000 and individual conditional expectation ice ayotte et al 2017 erickson et al 2018 an accumulated local effects ale plot adopted in this study is an excellent alternative to a pdp and uses conditional distribution rather than marginal distribution and avoids the generation of unrealistic data points due to violation of the assumption of independence apley and zhu 2016 the core of the ale is to calculate the differences in predictions 1 the indicator was divided into intervals for the samples in an interval the difference in the prediction is calculated when the indicator value is replaced by the upper and lower limit of the interval 2 differences in predictions of all samples within an interval were added up and this sum was divided by the number of samples in this interval to obtain the average difference of the predictions for this interval that is the local effect of the indicator these local effects were later accumulated and centered resulting in the ale curve the interval lengths were selected to make the length of each interval and the number of data within the interval were as even as possible so as to minimize the impact of data distribution on ale 2 5 interaction effect the effect heredity principle wu and hamada 2000 states interactions can be considered only if the lower order item preceding the interaction effectively explains the change in response the focus is therefore on the potential interaction between important representative indicators these important indicators were used as input features of the neural network known here as inet which is part of the framework for detecting interactions in feedforward neural networks like inet interactions between input features are created by the non additive effect of nonlinear activation functions and the influences of the interactions are propagated layer by layer along a certain path to the final output and paths are encoded in weight matrices the neural interaction detective nid algorithm framework detects any order or form of interaction captured by the feedforward neural network using the weight matrix tsang et al 2018 nid only quantifies interactions created at the first hidden layer which is important for fast interaction detection and sufficient for high detection performance based on empirical evaluation according to nid interaction detection consists of three main steps 1 train the feedforward network inet the configuration of inet is the same as gganet except it has three hidden layers 20 12 and 4 neurons 2 nid first finds potential interaction items from inet and ranks them according to their interaction strength and 3 then the generalized additive model gam the last component of nid framework is used to exclude spurious interactions from potential interaction items to preserve the true interactions interaction strength ω i i of a potential interaction i at the i th unit in the first hidden layer is defined as eq 3 and 4 3 z w y w l w l 1 w 2 4 ω i i z i min w i i where the aggregated weight z is defined to represent the influence of a hidden unit that is the weight of the path wy and wl are absolute values of weight matrices of output layer and l th hidden layer l is the number of hidden layers respectively and so on the min w i i is the minimum value of the absolute value of the weight between the indicators constituting the interaction i and the i th hidden unit the nid traverses the learned input weight matrix across hidden neurons the final interaction strengths are obtained by selecting the top ranked interactions of every order based on interaction strengths and summing their respective strengths across hidden units allowing variable order interaction candidates to be ranked gam consists of two types of small feedforward networks that capture the main effects and interactions respectively networks that model main effects and interactions consisted of one hidden layer with size of 1 neuron and one hidden layer with size of 10 neurons respectively the configuration of networks is the same as gganet except the relu transfer function was used between hidden layer and output layer top ranked interactions are gradually added to the gam until performance on a test set plateaus or approaches that of inet at which point the interactions that have been added are considered to be a true interaction by comparing the performance of gam and inet with respect to gam without any interactions the relative performance improvement obtained by including detected interactions can be computed nid screened out interactions according to their strength and contribution to gam performance improvement but it failed to provide information on interaction types namely synergy or antagonism the ale plot apley and zhu 2016 was used to visualize the interaction effect only second order interactions were explored considering the visualization limitation and poor interpretability of higher order interactions groundwater arsenic data are collected from diverse environments and the interaction type of a certain interaction i may be heterogeneous therefore for each second order interaction the total data was divided into 4 subsets and then the 2d ale plot was used to visualize the interaction effect of each subset the 2d ale plot which can show the interaction effect of two indicators is calculated on the same principle as ale for single indicator but it works with rectangular cells instead of intervals because effects in two dimensions are needed to accumulate apley and zhu 2016 the cutoff values required for splitting data set were determined by genetic algorithm which minimizes the standard deviation of the 4 subsets data size that is to make the data size the most even so as to avoid the over interpretation of the subset with less data 3 results and discussion 3 1 global prediction of groundwater arsenic gganet contains 26 indicators related to climate hydrology soil properties topography and geophysics and the model performance was evaluated using the test dataset the accuracy sensitivity specificity fig 2 a area under the curve auc fig 2b and cohen s kappa 0 61 jointly indicate a satisfactory model although the distribution of data in space is uneven the structure of residual distributions in different regions is consistent fig 2c indicating no geographic bias against a certain region in gganet the margin of error of the predicted probability of the test samples is 0 099 0 003 95 confidence interval and the standard deviation of the predicted values is shown in fig s2 a global high arsenic groundwater probability map was generated based on gganet fig 3 extremely high risk areas 8 7 are distributed across all continents with the highest and most widespread in eurasia currently known high arsenic groundwater regions such as bangladesh harvey et al 2002 datong xie et al 2008 inner mongolia guo et al 2008 vietnam postma et al 2012 cambodia phan et al 2010 texas haque and johannesson 2006 california ayotte et al 2016 and india chowdhury et al 2000 are reproduced by the model two examples given fig 4 a and 4c areas identified by the model as high risk but currently lacking field survey data are mainly located in central asia russia and ukraine which aligns with other models amini et al 2008 podgorski et al 2017 two sets of data from songnen plain bian et al 2012 fig 4b and uttar bindal and singh 2019 fig 4d not involved in the modeling process show arsenic concentrations consistent with model predictions demonstrating the applicability of the model to identify potential risk areas 3 2 importance of indicators indicator importance ranking is instructive for understanding the main processes responsible for prediction there is cointegration 5 significance level among the results of pi and cart supplementary fig s3 which indicates that the relative importance of indicators obtained from pi is statistically consistent with that from cart the top indicators in the comprehensive ranking mainly include climate soil moisture and soil carbon and nitrogen fig 5 three climate indicators precipitation prcyr evapotranspiration etact and aridity index aridity average yearly precipitation divided by average yearly potential evapotranspiration show paramount importance which has also been recognized in previous regional and global scale models climate conditions that are favorable for groundwater recharge more precipitation less evapotranspiration shorten the residence time for groundwater and thus hinder the accumulation of arsenic amini et al 2008 ayotte et al 2017 frederick et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 however extremely high precipitation significantly increases the risk of elevated arsenic fig 6 and the mean values for soil organic carbon and topographic slope in such regions are larger than the overall dataset organic matter in the vadose zone can be transported by precipitation into aquifers and promote the release of arsenic by competitive adsorption and or fueling microbial reduction mailloux et al 2013 mcdonough et al 2019 soil texture indicators including soil drainage drain the higher the value the poorer the drainage and soil moisture capacity smax the higher the value the lower the soil moisture capacity are the second most important following the climate indicators fig 5 soil texture can be a proxy for current and past drainage conditions in various sedimentary environments and is closely related to local hydrogeological settings of aquifers winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 poor drainage and larger soil moisture capacity usually accompany high clay content and may therefore suggest the importance of reductive dissolution aziz et al 2008 yang et al 2014 poorer drainage may also cause stronger evaporation that leads to higher salinity and higher ph welch et al 2000 welch and stollenwerk 2003 and thus promotes the release of arsenic extremely poor drainage however is associated with a sharp decrease in the probability of high arsenic groundwater possibly because high clay content indicates a low energy sedimentary environment in which young sediments aquifers are often rare and thus groundwater is withdrawn from deeper older aquifers with low arsenic content winkel et al 2008 high levels of soil organic carbon are associated with higher probability of high arsenic groundwater fig 6 oc t cp s scss but again extremely high oc t is associated with a lower probability of high arsenic concentration similar patterns also occur in the indus plain podgorski et al 2017 indicating that the reductive dissolution process may not be dominant higher cation exchange capacity ce t often means a higher proportion of clay and organic matter particles both of which have a net negative charge and thus hold cations therefore ce t shows a general trend similar to drain and smax fig 6 base saturation bs t represents the proportion of the soil cation exchange capacity occupied by basic cations e g k na mg ca and is positively correlated with soil ph high soil ph promotes arsenic desorption and can be indicative of an evaporative environment podgorski et al 2017 which may partly explain why higher bs t predicts a higher probability of high arsenic groundwater as soil ph is far less important than bs fig 5 the remaining indicators mainly include the carbon nitrogen and ion characteristics of soil with less importance and little differences between them 3 3 interaction effect of indicators the heterogeneity of ice trajectories supplementary fig s4 strongly indicates interaction effects among various indicators based on the effect heredity principle wu and hamada 2000 only interactions between the following representative indicators were explored prcyr etact drain oc t bs t scss and nn s atypical interactions in which the interaction effect explains the change in response but the main effect does not were not considered since they rarely occur in real data a total of 114 potential interactions were detected by the nid the effect sparsity principle wu and hamada 2000 holds that only a few interactions are true in other words they capture significant changes in response the potential interactions can be clearly divided into two groups according to the interaction strength with the top six interactions distinctly different from the others fig 7 the performance of the gam indicates only the top seven interactions are considered true items fig 7 in terms of accuracy the interaction effect explains about 10 5 of the variation in the probability of high arsenic groundwater six of the seven interactions are second order showing the interaction hierarchy wu and hamada 2000 the higher the degree of interaction the less likely it explains the change in response although the unique seventh order interaction may be pseudo higher order interactions should be carefully included as they have been shown to exist in nature bairey et al 2016 prcyr occurs in five of the six second order interactions again demonstrating its paramount importance pi and cart automatically take into account interactions when measuring the importance of indicators for pi permuting the indicator breaks the relationship between indicators which inherently includes interactions tree based models are also often considered to capture pure interactions elith et al 2008 lampa et al 2014 the importance of prcyr may therefore be derived in large part from its interaction with soil indicators this is quite in line with expectations precipitation can connect the surface with the subterranean environment in most cases soil is the medium through which precipitation affects the quantity and quality of groundwater the influence indicator effect of precipitation and soil properties on groundwater as thus is likely to be non additive on a global scale heatmaps of total effect fig 8 a d have multiple hot spots high probability with no uniform pattern of hot spot distribution the main hot spots are located in areas with low prcyr low oc t high prcyr medium oc t high prcyr low nn s high prcyr etact high prcyr poor drain high prcyr high bs t and poor drain low nn s the patterns for the torrid and temperate zones are similar to the global case data for the frigid zone are not sufficient 1000 to make an evaluation a 2d ale plot only shows the interaction effect for two indicators apley and zhu 2016 the interaction effect can be either synergistic or antagonistic on a global scale synergy and antagonism coexist in all interactions fig 8a high precipitation is more likely to generate dramatic interaction while such interactions are less likely to occur in the low value areas of the two indicators more specifically high precipitation usually combines with low and high values of another indicator to create synergy and antagonism respectively unlike total effect the pattern of interaction effects in the torrid and temperate zones is different from the global pattern fig 8b c in terms of absolute interaction strength i e considering only strength regardless of antagonism or synergy the interaction effect in the torrid zone is stronger than that in the temperate zone with 90 confidence fig 8e much of this may be due to stronger rainfall in the tropics a comparison of the total effect and interaction effect shows that all of the four possible combinations exist high probability synergy high probability antagonism low probability synergy and low probability antagonism fig 8a c consistent with intuition whether on global scale or in torrid zone or temperate regions non hotspots of total effect are usually accompanied by non obvious interactions or antagonism while hotspots are almost always accompanied by synergy therefore synergy may promote groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding the limit of 10 μg l 1 here the observed tropical data were used as an example to verify the predicted interaction the interaction plot was used to show possible interactions in the observed data fig 9 this type of plot displays the high arsenic probability on the y axis while the x axis shows the values of the first indicator meanwhile the various lines represent values of the second indicator parallel lines indicate that there is no interaction effect while different slopes suggest that one might be present take the interaction between precipitation and organic carbon as an example to illustrate the verification fig 9a the model predicts that there is antagonism between precipitation and oc t at high oc t and the antagonism strength increased with the increase of precipitation fig 8b according to the observed data fig 9a in the case of low precipitation the increase of precipitation corresponds to the decrease of the high arsenic probability for the samples with lower oc t 1 2 2 while the opposite is true for the sample with higher oc t 2 this indicates that the effect of precipitation is enhanced by the increase of oc t that is there is synergy between them in the same way in the case of high precipitation the effect of precipitation is obviously inhibited by the increase of oc t that is there is antagonism between them therefore although the predicted interaction is incorrect at low precipitation the predicted trend is consistent with the observation that is the antagonism strength increased with the increase of precipitation the validation of the rest of interactions can be explained in the same way for drain nn s dividing too many intervals creates some interval with no data drain and nn s were thus only divided into well drained poorly drained and nn s 0 08 nn s 0 08 fig 9f respectively overall the interactions identified by the model are confirmed by the observed data it should also be noted that the same conclusions can be derived by switching the indicators of various lines and x axis in fig 9 4 conclusions compared with the existing high arsenic groundwater models this study has made some substantial advancement from the application perspective the well performing global model established in this study is one of the few large scale predictive models available and thus can facilitate monitoring in high risk areas the present study first identified and quantified interactions between high arsenic groundwater indicators contributing to a complete understanding of the formation of high arsenic groundwater although the number of indicators in our modeling is still limited and the relationship between them and the response not necessarily causal climate and soil properties and their interactions are clearly essential indicators for risk prediction of arsenic contamination of groundwater therefore in the study of high arsenic groundwater it can be a mistake to assess only the main effects when designing experiments or interpreting experimental and field data and the main effects cannot be interpreted without considering the interactions taking interactions into account is therefore expected to enable improvements in both the physical model by adding more processes and statistical models by for example taking interactions as predictors for types of geogenic contamination such as geogenic high arsenic groundwater more complete physical models may help with pollution remediation by providing guidance for the artificial regulation of geochemical processes in addition for prediction purposes interaction items may be used as potential effective predictors to simplify the model and improve prediction performance credit authorship contribution statement hailong cao conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft xianjun
