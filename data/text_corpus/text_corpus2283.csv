11415,the suka kollus considered among the most important hydraulic structures of ancestral andean technology are used as a technique for crop production in flood prone soils enabling subsurface irrigation of crops by means of drainage channels they also generate a thermoregulatory effect depending on the channel ridge ratio and the total size of the infrastructure they could be a valuable way of making use of marginal soils if some of the drainage channels are replaced by underground drains to increase the area of cultivation this work was therefore undertaken to study the flow of water under a mixed drainage system surface and subsurface drainage adapted to the suka kollus system the work was carried out in marginals in the kallutaca area la paz bolivia the potato cultivar imilla negra solanum tuberosum ssp andigena was used in four treatments with different platform widths t1 control the traditional system in which all drainage was via open channels and t2 t3 and t4 where one two and three channels were respectively replaced by drains the study describes the comparison between t1 treatment with open drains at a depth of 1 m and platform width of 6 5 m t1 with the other treatments i e subsurface pipe drains at a depth of 1 2 m and a platform widths of respectively 12 m t2 where one channel was replaced by a drain 18 m t3 where two channels were replaced by drains and 25 m t4 where three channels were replaced by drains the results showed that the distance of 6 5 m between drainage channels commonly used in traditional suka kollus was less than the calculated distances as such it was possible to expand the area of the platforms by setting the drainage channels between 10 and 14 m apart crops yield in the t2 and t3 treatments 10 67 11 35 mg ha respectively are significantly higher compared to the traditional open drainage system t1 8 33 mg ha and the wider platform width of 25 m t4 7 3 mg ha due to the higher height of plants and the greater number of tubers per plant compared to the control likewise the high clay percentage of the second stratum of the t3 treatment could be beneficial in terms of greater retention of water at the root level mainly for periods of water deficit the crop water requirements were covered by the upward flows from the water table and by precipitation demonstrating that the suka kollus system is sustainable under current climatic conditions keywords subsurface irrigation andean region water table pre hispanic technology potato crop 1 introduction the ridges featured in our study are raised platforms of agricultural land measuring 1 20 m wide 10 100 m long 0 5 1 m high and surrounded by channels measuring 1 4 m wide with a depth of between 0 5 and 1 m roldan ca√±as and chipana rivera 2011 these raised fields called suka kollus in aymara or waru waru in quechua were built to deal with floods by draining off excess water and to use for subsurface irrigation at the same time they were intended to raise the ambient temperature as a way of protecting against frost thus helping to create a less vulnerable agroecosystem the suka kollus are one of the most important traditional combined sub irrigation and drainage system based on ancestral technology developed in the andean regions of bolivia and peru ortloff 1999 this technique is often found in areas surrounding lake titicaca where the water table is close to the surface one of their main functions was presumably drainage prosuko 2008 and used to produce crops in flood prone lands at the same time they provide subsurface irrigation to the crops cultivated on the platforms and can also generate a thermoregulatory effect depending on the channel ridge ratio and the total size of the structure kolata and ortloff 1989 according to erickson 1992 the suka kollus create a microclimate that helps to produce high yields mitigate the effects of frost on the crops and recycle the nutrients contained in the organic matter of the channels huanca 1996 did not observe significant differences in average temperature between the suka kollus systems and the surrounding area or pampas measured at 3 different heights 10 50 80 cm above ground level differences of less than 1 c were recorded despite the extensive surface area dedicated to suka kollus 10 ha lhomme and vacher 2003 in experiments carried out over two years 1994 and 1995 in linear fluvial suka kollus covering about 8 ha in the kallutaca area observed temperatures varying between 2 and 10 c the minimum temperature in suka kollus was always between 1 and 2 c higher than that registered in the pampas control indicating frost mitigation their findings were similar in the following agricultural season with the temperature in the suka kollus higher by about 1 c but the temperatures were not as low between 0 c and 4 c with regard to water movement colque 2000 pointed out that at the beginning of an agricultural season when water is fed into the channels water quickly accumulates there and begins to flow slowly some of this water penetrates the inside of the ridges while some leaves the system through deep percolation as well as by the discharge channels stache 2000 showed that water movement is preferably upward in suka kollus whereas water flow is predominantly downward in the surrounding area and very dependent on rainfall according to erickson 1986 these ridges are generally found in areas prone to permanent or seasonal flooding in the case of the ridges surrounding lake titicaca bolivia and most other known ridge systems extensive drainage of water was not a common practice indeed limited drainage was probably carried out in order to oxygenate the root system of the crops due to the lack of information with respect to drainage subsurface flow and the effect of the hydraulic regime as well as the hydrophysical properties of the soil in this system in the bolivian altiplano some farmers have opted to fill some channels with soil in order to increase the area of cultivation and to gain more space for their agricultural operations in view of this situation there is a critical need to consider management options which allow farmers to keep the benefits associated with this production system while also expanding the surface of the platforms through subsurface drainage and without affecting the productivity of the suka kollus these raised fields could be a valuable way of making use of marginal soils if some of the drainage channels are replaced by underground drains to increase the area of cultivation but it is necessary to study the water movement behaviour in the soil depending on the different subsurface drainage configurations the objective of this work was to study water flows in a mixed drainage system surface and subsurface drainage adapted to the suka kollus system determining the factors that affect water movement in the soil and their contribution to the crop water requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and weather the study was carried out at the kallutaca experimental centre located 30 km southeast of la paz in the laja region los andes province bolivia 16 31 10s 68 19 05w altitude 3892 m the study area was in low lying flood prone land where native lowland vegetation predominates such as grasses of the poa genus calamagrostis and bromus and other species such as plantago chiji distichlis trifolium pilli hypochaeris and totorilla scirpus the local climatology is typically semiarid and cold with an average annual precipitation of 600 mm being december and january the wettest months of the year 113 and 141 mm the mean annual temperature is 7 1 c extreme minimum temperatures occur between june and july with lows of 10 8 to 11 0 c while extreme maximum temperatures are recorded in the months of november and december with highs of 21 6 22 3 c the mean annual relative humidity is 53 3 the highest relative humidity rh is registered between december and march summer with values of 64 5 71 0 while the lowest values occur with 40 42 0 as well as the longest frost period occurred in the months of june to august winter climatic data such as temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as well as precipitation are collected from weather station located 1 km from the study site 2 2 plant material due to the prevailing low temperatures in the study area the native species of potato cultivar imilla negra solanum tuberosum ssp andigena was used an amount of 536 kg of seed potato seeds was sown over an area of about 1000 m2 potato was planted on 30 november 2009 in furrows along the top of the platforms to a depth of 0 25 m in 0 70 m row with tubers spaced 0 40 m apart the duration of the cropping period was 135 days until tuberization harvested on 11 april 2010 during which time 272 4 mm of rainfall was registered and 8 days with frost 2 3 drainage treatments with different platform widths setting up the experiment involved removing some of the drainage channels that were originally in the suka kollus replacing them with subsurface drainage through perforated pipes and filling in the gaps with soil in order to increase the cultivation area of the platforms four treatments with different platform widths were tested t1 control in which drainage was provided by channels t2 consists in a replacement of two channels by a drain t3 with two channels replaced by drains and t4 with three channels replaced by drains fig 1 shows the dimensions of the ridges in the four treatments since the platform widths are different they have different production areas depending on the number of channels that have been covered with earth and replaced by a 100 mm pvc drainage pipe all the platforms are 14 m long in order to provide a filtration zone internal subsurface drainage was installed using 100 mm pvc pipes with 1 cm wide holes drilled along the upper half the tubes were covered with approximately 10 cm of selected gravel the first stratum was composed of 25 37 5 mm gravel sand was gradually added up to the surface and it was then covered over with material extracted from the central channel fig 2 shows the layout of the different treatments in the field with two units that is two replications for each treatment resulting in a total of 12 subsurface drainage lines for the entire experiment 2 4 hydrophysical properties of the soil the main physical parameters and the moisture retention capacity in the different treatments were determined through laboratory analysis using samples extracted at depths of 0 15 15 38 and 38 50 cm the samples were used to determine the texture apparent density moisture content at field capacity and permanent wilting point mean values of these parameters standard deviation and variance for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 5 calculation of the distance between drains the distance between the drains was calculated using the glover dumm eq 1 ritzema 1994 which is the most suitable formula for establishing the spacing l or appropriate distance between parallel drains in a variable regime taking into account flow

measurement on point 1 was taken at a depth of 15 cm and point 2 at a depth of 30 cm thus z1 15 cm z2 30 cm using these data the moisture flow in the four treatments was determined as a function of

evapotranspiration eto and simple crop coefficient kc of potato as specified byallen et al 1998 the procedure consisted in identifying experimentally the different growth stages of the crop the duration of each one and selecting the corresponding kc values the kc values were adjusted according to the wetting frequency and or climatic conditions in each stage and the kc curve was drawn accordingly using the coefficient curve daily and weekly kc values were determined and assigned to the different growth stages the weekly etc was calculated as the product of the weekly kc and eto the flow of water into the channels of the suka kollus system was measured using cipolleti type weir plates having established an average inflow rate of approximately 5 l s to ensure a minimum depth of water in the channels and height of the water table in the platforms the excess water was controlled by means of an outlet channel with an average flow rate of approximately 4 l s the values of the

the level of the drains ho the elevation of the water table above the level of the drains after time t ht the distance between drains l and the density of water flow in the soil were calculated from the measured values of texture apparent density soil moisture matrix potential depth of the impermeable layer d precipitation and water flow in the channels plant height and number of tubers per plant were measured for the plants in the central furrow of each treatment the height of the plants was measured monthly in all repetitions of three randomly selected plants potato was harvested on 11 april 2010 plants within each plot were harvested to determine potato yield in kg per plot and tuber number the yield was then converted to mg ha within the perimeter of the suka kollus without taking into account the effect of the edges on the total yield 2 8 statistical analysis the experimental error has been estimated as the deviation of the measured value from the estimated real value and the sampling error is the error that would have arisen when choosing the samples of the population of plants the statistical units were 8 4 treatments with 2 repetitions therefore 7 degrees of freedom the subunits which would be the platforms were 24 therefore 23 degrees of freedom analysis of variance f test for mean plant height for the number of tubers per plant and for the potato yield have been done to study whether there are significant differences between units and between treatments at 5 level of significance Œ± 0 05 the duncan test was applied to comparing the means of the different treatments at 5 level of significance and to stablish whether are not significantly different from each other 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the layout of the drains inside the platform located at a depth of 1 2 m below the soil surface and 1 8 m above the impermeable layer the distance between drains is calculated so as to leave an area free of 0 6 m for root development at the least favourable point the average annual rainfall 600 mm falls between december and march 120 days if it is assumed that rainfall falls uniformly 5 mm day and that instantly recharges the soil profile it will take 7 days for the water table to return to its initial level when it is assumed a maximum rainfall height of 35 mm table 1 shows that the lowest soil storage capacity is recorded in treatment t1 although the value improves with the depth increases this treatment has a sal texture that facilitates water drainage however since there are relatively fewer capillary pores this affects moisture retention in this stratum in t2 and t3 the clay loam soils cl have similar hydrophysical properties the water storage capacity values Œ¥Œ∏ of the middle stratum reveal that t4 having a loam texture l has the best storage capacity followed by t2 effective porosity v is determined based on the values in table 1 substituting it into eq 4 yields the hydraulic conductivity ks values in each treatment and stratum table 2 table 2 shows the values of the water table height above the water level in the drain after time t ht and the water table drawdown or the difference between the maximum or initial height of the water table above the water level in the drain and ht Œ¥h calculated for the least favourable stratum in each treatment as well as the mean for each treatment and an overall average for all treatments for example in t1 treatment the first stratum is the least favourable ks 0 271 m d and v 0 181 instantaneous recharge causes a rise in water table of about 0 19 m a height that should fall over the following 7 days with the height of the water table after 7 days ht thus being 0 41 m applying eq 2 with the values from the first stratum of t1 treatment with r 0 06m gives a distance between drains l of 14 16 m accordingly in the least favourable conditions platforms of up to approximately 14 m in size can be used without the need for intermediate subsurface drains under the same conditions but taking total average values for hydraulic conductivity 0 097 m d or 4 042 mm h and effective porosity 0 133 the space between drains is reduced to 7 30 m roldan ca√±as and chipana rivera 2011 found that in different conditions with greater hydraulic conductivity and at a greater distance from the impermeable layer and with a longer return time 12 days the space between drains could be up to 30 15 m as a third option in order to incorporate the variation in the physical characteristics in the different treatments estimations were carried out using the average hydraulic conductivity ks and effective porosity v in each treatment at the three different depths table 2 in this case the t1 treatment becomes the least favourable due to higher values for ks and v resulting in a greater distance between drains 10 06 m than the distance calculated using the mean values of the other three treatments 6 12 m for t2 treatment 5 57 m for t3 treatment and 6 35 m for t4 treatment approaching the problem from the other direction it can be ascertained whether the maximum allowable height ho 0 6 m is exceeded for each drain spacing thus with l value of 10 06 m the ho value is not exceeded in the other treatments table 2 in this case there are marked differences in the water table drawdown Œ¥h between treatments with the greatest Œ¥h value 0 30 m recorded in the t3 treatment when the distance between drains is determined using average values of all the treatments l 7 30 m the t1 treatment exceeds the established drawdown while the other treatments register a smaller difference closer to the established drawdown table 2 under our experimental conditions the underground drainage pipes are located approximately 6 5 m between the axes fig 1 in this case t1 treatment records the greatest water table drawdown height fig 5 exceeding the maximum possible height ho 0 6 m while the treatments t4 t2 and t3 are close to the maximum possible height ho fig 5 which means it would not be acceptable on the other hand the drain spacing of 14 16 m calculated using the highest ks value from the t1 treatment is greater than that between the channels in t2 treatment 13 m between the external drainage axes whereas the 10 06 m spacing calculated with the average ks value is less than the platform width in the t2 treatment high water table drawdown levels such as those in t1 treatment above the maximum level established indicate a saturation of the porous spaces of the soil creating waterlogged conditions and a lack of oxygen in the root area which results in a low yield in these cases the design of the drainage must be improved so that drainage occurs through the channels surface drainage and the buried pipes subsurface drainage consequently a distance between drains or a minimum platform width of 10 m can be established taking into account the fact that the least favourable stratum which is in t1 treatment does not substantially affect this result since it is an upper stratum 0 15 cm 0 45 m from the established level moisture retention curves were drawn for the depths of 0 15 15 38 and 38 50 cm using laboratory determined values for the four treatments fig 6 shows the curves for the different strata and treatments looking at fig 6 different textural classes can be seen sandy loam sal and loam l table 1 in the upper strata 0 15 cm of treatments t1 and t3 respectively and while the middle stratum 15 38 cm of the t3 treatment turns to clay c in the t1 treatment the middle and lower strata show similar retention curves in the t2 treatment the lower stratum turns to clay loam cl while in the t4 treatment the middle stratum and the upper stratum show a similar pattern to loam soil l the t4 and t2 treatments in that order have the best average water storage capacity in t4 however loam is the predominant textural class while this facilitates drainage it also results in a lower moisture retention capacity compared to t2 which has clay loam in its lower stratum similarly t3 treatment in addition to the clay loam in its lower stratum also has clay texture in its middle stratum thus benefiting from the higher content of micropores that facilitate the longer term retention of soil moisture fig 7 illustrates the variation in the moisture flow measured via the tensiometers installed at depths of 15 and 30 cm the data show high moisture flow values for control treatment t1 between the first and third week of march being 72 27 and 67 33 l m2 respectively slightly above the corresponding values for treatments t3 and t2 in the same weeks whereas t3 treatment registers its maximum water flow values between the third week of february with 69 l m2 and the first week of march with 69 35 l m2 for the period between the 4th week of february and the 1 st week of march from the end of flowering to the start of ripening increased flow is recorded in almost all treatments however there was still rainfall during these periods as shown in fig 8 the flow diminished as the vegetative cycle came to an end coinciding with a lack of precipitation in the first week of april one week before harvesting fig 8 shows the weekly variation in crop evapotranspiration with a total of 347 mm recorded over 18 weeks along with accumulated rainfall of 272 4 mm furthermore from december to the end of april 274 mm of rain was registered whereas the historical average for this period is 454 mm since the only source of water during the 18 week period had been from precipitation additional water requirements would have been registered during the fourth week of january and the third week of february and between the first and the second week of march thus it can be assumed that those water requirements were covered by the stored water from rainfall prior to the periods in question and by upward flows from the water table in fact the comparison of crop water requirements fig 8 with soil moisture flow fig 7 indicates that these water requirements have generally been covered by upward flows between the second and third week of february a lower increase in upward water flows is observed in treatments t1 and t4 while a decrease is observed in treatments t2 and t3 this pattern reflects both a slight increase treatments t1 and t4 and a reduction treatments t2 and t3 in water consumption from the water table in these treatments for this period however the higher consumption demands may be met by water stored in previous periods fig 8 when there was more precipitation than evapotranspiration table 3 reports the results of the analysis of variance f test for mean plant height with no significant differences observed between units and between treatments at 5 probability Œ± 0 05 according to the duncan test when comparing the means of the different treatments there was a significant difference between plant heights in t3 treatment 60 cm compared to plant heights in t2 52 23 cm t4 49 52 cm and t1 46 cm treatments but no significant difference between treatments t2 t4 and t1 treatments at the 5 level of significance the coefficient of variation cv of 6 70 indicates that the experiment results are reliable with respect to the variable being plant height in the analysis of variance for the number of tubers per plant shown in table 4 no significant differences at 5 are observed between treatments or between units the cv of 6 3 indicates that the experiment results are reliable with respect to the variable being number of tubers per plant the highest yield was achieved in t3 treatment with 11 3 t ha followed by t2 treatment 10 7 t ha while the lowest yield was recorded in t4 treatment 7 3 t ha below even the control treatment yield 8 3 t ha although the t2 treatment with a platform width of 11 45 m and 13 m between the water channel axes complies with the maximum space determined of 14 m its production was lower than that of t3 treatment despite the fact that the platform width in t3 treatment 17 95 m is greater than the maximum spacing between external drains 14 m this may be due to differences in the hydrophysical properties of the soil in t3 treatment as compared to those in t2 treatment the higher percentage of clay 45 registered in the second stratum 15 38 cm of the t3 treatment can be beneficial in terms of water retention at the root level and may have exerted a positive influence on plant development as well as yield mainly during periods of water deficit table 5 shows the results of the analysis of variance for the potato yield with no significant differences observed between treatments or between units furthermore a coefficient of variation of 17 is reported which allows us to infer that there is a notable variability as a result of the different applied treatments the duncan multiple range test at 5 probability level indicates that the t2 and t3 treatments was not significantly different table 6 potato yields of t1 and t4 treatments were not also significantly different p 0 05 also the fact that t2 and t3 treatments provide better yields than those in t1 and t4 treatments may be related to the availability and supply of water in the root zone since the calculations made were only to ensure adequate drainage overall it can be noted that the yields obtained are within the expected range bearing in mind that the crop was grown in flood prone areas with marginal soils and a predominance of native grasses chipana rivera et al 2016 4 conclusions the water requirements of the potato crop were covered by the upward flows from the water table and by precipitation which shows that the suka kollus system is sustainable under current climatic conditions the highest potato yield was achieved in treatment with two drains t3 followed by the one with one drain t2 this may have been due to either better water supply from the water table or the platform width which allowed to obtain plants with greater height and greater number of tubers per plant compared to the control in addition in this treatment the second stratum of the soil being clayey retained a greater quantity of water at the root level they can be considered good yields bearing in mind the fact that the crops were cultivated in marginal flood prone soils the distance of 6 5 m between drainage channels commonly used in traditional suka kollus was less than the distances calculated on the basis of the mean values of the hydrophysical properties of the soil therefore it is possible to expand the area of the platforms by incorporating subsurface drainage and placing the drainage channels by drains between 10 and 14 m apart depending on whether the maximum value of the hydraulic conductivity or the mean value respectively are considered accordingly suka kollus could be a valuable way of making use of marginal soils being able to even double the width of the cultivation platforms if some of the drainage channels are replaced by underground drains to increase the area of cultivation and thus improve their management acknowledgments the research reported in this paper was supported by the establishment of the training and research center in

drains and 25 m t4 where three channels were replaced by drains the results showed that the distance of 6 5 m between drainage channels commonly used in traditional suka kollus was less than the calculated distances as such it was possible to expand the area of the platforms by setting the drainage channels between 10 and 14 m apart crops yield in the t2 and t3 treatments 10 67 11 35 mg ha respectively are significantly higher compared to the traditional open drainage system t1 8 33 mg ha and the wider platform width of 25 m t4 7 3 mg ha due to the higher height of plants and the

province bolivia 16 31 10s 68 19 05w altitude 3892 m the study area was in low lying flood prone land where native lowland vegetation predominates such as grasses of the poa genus calamagrostis and bromus and other species such as plantago chiji distichlis trifolium pilli hypochaeris and totorilla scirpus the local climatology is typically semiarid and cold with an average annual precipitation of 600 mm being december and january the wettest months of the year 113 and 141 mm the mean annual temperature is 7 1 c extreme minimum temperatures occur between june and july with lows of 10 8 to 11 0 c while extreme maximum temperatures are recorded in the months of november and december with highs of 21 6 22 3 c the mean annual relative humidity is 53 3 the highest relative humidity rh is registered between december and march summer with values of 64 5 71 0 while the lowest values occur with 40 42 0 as well as the longest frost period occurred in the months of june to august winter climatic data such as temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as well as precipitation are collected from weather station located 1 km from the study site 2 2 plant material due to the prevailing low temperatures in the study area the native species of potato cultivar imilla negra solanum tuberosum ssp andigena was used an amount of 536 kg of seed potato seeds was sown over an area of about 1000 m2 potato was planted on 30 november 2009 in furrows along the top of the platforms to a depth of 0 25 m in 0 70 m row with tubers spaced 0 40 m apart the duration of the cropping period was 135 days until tuberization harvested on 11 april 2010 during which time 272 4 mm of rainfall was registered and 8 days with frost 2 3 drainage treatments with different platform widths setting up the experiment involved removing some of the drainage channels that were originally in the suka kollus replacing them with subsurface drainage through perforated pipes and filling in the gaps with soil in order to increase the cultivation area of the platforms four treatments with different platform widths were tested t1 control in which drainage was provided by channels t2 consists in a replacement of two channels by a drain t3 with two channels replaced by drains and t4 with three channels replaced by drains fig 1 shows the dimensions of the ridges in the four treatments since the platform widths are different they have different production areas depending on the number of channels that have been covered with earth and replaced by a 100 mm pvc drainage pipe all the platforms are 14 m long in order to provide a filtration zone internal subsurface drainage was installed using 100 mm pvc pipes with 1 cm wide holes drilled along the upper half the tubes were covered with approximately 10 cm of selected gravel the first stratum was composed of 25 37 5 mm gravel sand was gradually added up to the surface and it was then covered over with material extracted from the central channel fig 2 shows the layout of the different treatments in the field with two units that is two replications for each treatment resulting in a total of 12 subsurface drainage lines for the entire experiment 2 4 hydrophysical properties of the soil the main physical parameters and the moisture retention capacity in the different treatments were determined through laboratory analysis using samples extracted at depths of 0 15 15 38 and 38 50 cm the samples were used to determine the texture apparent density moisture content at field capacity and permanent wilting point mean values of these parameters standard deviation and variance for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 5 calculation of the distance between drains the distance between the drains was calculated using the glover dumm eq 1 ritzema 1994 which is the most suitable formula for establishing the spacing l or appropriate distance between parallel drains in a variable regime taking into account flow

this non saturated medium hydraulic conductivity k Œ∏ values were estimated using the van genuchten 1980 model the model parameters were based on the dominant subsoil texture class with respect to the

and z2 respectively to determine the soil matric potential two tensiometers with mercury manometers were installed for each treatment in the root zone of the crop in the central part of the platforms measurement on point 1 was taken at a depth of 15 cm and point 2 at a depth of 30 cm thus z1 15 cm z2 30 cm using these data the moisture flow in the four treatments was determined as a function of the hydraulic conductivity and the variation in the matric potential each week in addition the values of k Œ∏ obtained with eq 3 for different average matric potentials œàm have been converted to a

evapotranspiration eto and simple crop coefficient kc of potato as specified byallen et al 1998 the procedure consisted in identifying experimentally the different growth stages of the crop the duration of each one and selecting the corresponding kc values the kc values were adjusted according to the wetting frequency and or climatic conditions in each stage and the kc curve was drawn accordingly using the coefficient curve daily and weekly kc values were determined and assigned to the different growth stages the weekly etc was calculated as the product of the weekly kc and eto the flow of water into the channels of the suka kollus system was measured using cipolleti type weir plates having established an average inflow rate of approximately 5 l s to ensure a minimum depth of water in the channels and height of the water table in the platforms the excess water was controlled by means of an outlet channel with an average flow rate of approximately 4 l s the values of the

the level of the drains ho the elevation of the water table above the level of the drains after time t ht the distance between drains l and the density of water flow in the soil were calculated from the measured values of texture apparent density soil moisture matrix potential depth of the impermeable layer d precipitation and water flow in the channels plant height and number of tubers per plant were measured for the plants in the central furrow of each treatment the height of the plants was measured monthly in all repetitions of three randomly selected plants potato was harvested on 11 april 2010 plants within each plot were harvested to determine potato yield in kg per plot and tuber number the yield was then converted to mg ha within the perimeter of the suka kollus without taking into account the effect of the edges on the total yield 2 8 statistical analysis the experimental error has been estimated as the deviation of the measured value from the estimated real value and the sampling error is the error that would have arisen when choosing the samples of the population of plants the statistical units were 8 4 treatments with 2 repetitions therefore 7 degrees of freedom the subunits which would be the platforms were 24 therefore 23 degrees of freedom analysis of variance f test for mean plant height for the number of tubers per plant and for the potato yield have been done to study whether there are significant differences between units and between treatments at 5 level of significance Œ± 0 05 the duncan test was applied to comparing the means of the different treatments at 5 level of significance and to stablish whether are not significantly different from each other 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the layout of the drains inside the platform located at a depth of 1 2 m below the soil surface and 1 8 m above the impermeable layer the distance between drains is calculated so as to leave an area free of 0 6 m for root development at the least favourable point the average annual rainfall 600 mm falls between december and march 120 days if it is assumed that rainfall falls uniformly 5 mm day and that instantly recharges the soil profile it will take 7 days for the water table to return to its initial level when it is assumed a maximum rainfall height of 35 mm table 1 shows that the lowest soil storage capacity is recorded in treatment t1 although the value improves with the depth increases this treatment has a sal texture that facilitates water drainage however since there are relatively fewer capillary pores this affects moisture retention in this stratum in t2 and t3 the clay loam soils cl have similar hydrophysical properties the water storage capacity values Œ¥Œ∏ of the middle stratum reveal that t4 having a loam texture l has the best storage capacity followed by t2 effective porosity v is determined based on the values in table 1 substituting it into eq 4 yields the hydraulic conductivity ks values in each treatment and stratum table 2 table 2 shows the values of the water table height above the water level in the drain after time t ht and the water table drawdown or the difference between the maximum or initial height of the water table above the water level in the drain and ht Œ¥h calculated for the least favourable stratum in each treatment as well as the mean for each treatment and an overall average for all treatments for example in t1 treatment the first stratum is the least favourable ks 0 271 m d and v 0 181 instantaneous recharge causes a rise in water table of about 0 19 m a height that should fall over the following 7 days with the height of the water table after 7 days ht thus being 0 41 m applying eq 2 with the values from the first stratum of t1 treatment with r 0 06m gives a distance between drains l of 14 16 m accordingly in the least favourable conditions platforms of up to approximately 14 m in size can be used without the need for intermediate subsurface drains under the same conditions but taking total average values for hydraulic conductivity 0 097 m d or 4 042 mm h and effective porosity 0 133 the space between drains is reduced to 7 30 m roldan ca√±as and chipana rivera 2011 found that in different conditions with greater hydraulic conductivity and at a greater distance from the impermeable layer and with a longer return time 12 days the space between drains could be up to 30 15 m as a third option in order to incorporate the variation in the physical characteristics in the different treatments estimations were carried out using the average hydraulic conductivity ks and effective porosity v in each treatment at the three different depths table 2 in this case the t1 treatment becomes the least favourable due to higher values for ks and v resulting in a greater distance between drains 10 06 m than the distance calculated using the mean values of the other three treatments 6 12 m for t2 treatment 5 57 m for t3 treatment and 6 35 m for t4 treatment approaching the problem from the other direction it can be ascertained whether the maximum allowable height ho 0 6 m is exceeded for each drain spacing thus with l value of 10 06 m the ho value is not exceeded in the other treatments table 2 in this case there are marked differences in the water table drawdown Œ¥h between treatments with the greatest Œ¥h value 0 30 m recorded in the t3 treatment when the distance between drains is determined using average values of all the treatments l 7 30 m the t1 treatment exceeds the established drawdown while the other treatments register a smaller difference closer to the established drawdown table 2 under our experimental conditions the underground drainage pipes are located approximately 6 5 m between the axes fig 1 in this case t1 treatment records the greatest water table drawdown height fig 5 exceeding the maximum possible height ho 0 6 m while the treatments t4 t2 and t3 are close to the maximum possible height ho fig 5 which means it would not be acceptable on the other hand the drain spacing of 14 16 m calculated using the highest ks value from the t1 treatment is greater than that between the channels in t2 treatment 13 m between the external drainage axes whereas the 10 06 m spacing calculated with the average ks value is less than the platform width in the t2 treatment high water table drawdown levels such as those in t1 treatment above the maximum level established indicate a saturation of the porous spaces of the soil creating waterlogged conditions and a lack of oxygen in the root area which results in a low yield in these cases the design of the drainage must be improved so that drainage occurs through the channels surface drainage and the buried pipes subsurface drainage consequently a distance between drains or a minimum platform width of 10 m can be established taking into account the fact that the least favourable stratum which is in t1 treatment does not substantially affect this result since it is an upper stratum 0 15 cm 0 45 m from the established level moisture retention curves were drawn for the depths of 0 15 15 38 and 38 50 cm using laboratory determined values for the four treatments fig 6 shows the curves for the different strata and treatments looking at fig 6 different textural classes can be seen sandy loam sal and loam l table 1 in the upper strata 0 15 cm of treatments t1 and t3 respectively and while the middle stratum 15 38 cm of the t3 treatment turns to clay c in the t1 treatment the middle and lower strata show similar retention curves in the t2 treatment the lower stratum turns to clay loam cl while in the t4 treatment the middle stratum and the upper stratum show a similar pattern to loam soil l the t4 and t2 treatments in that order have the best average water storage capacity in t4 however loam is the predominant textural class while this facilitates drainage it also results in a lower moisture retention capacity compared to t2 which has clay loam in its lower stratum similarly t3 treatment in addition to the clay loam in its lower stratum also has clay texture in its middle stratum thus benefiting from the higher content of micropores that facilitate the longer term retention of soil moisture fig 7 illustrates the variation in the moisture flow measured via the tensiometers installed at depths of 15 and 30 cm the data show high moisture flow values for control treatment t1 between the first and third week of march being 72 27 and 67 33 l m2 respectively slightly above the corresponding values for treatments t3 and t2 in the same weeks whereas t3 treatment registers its maximum water flow values between the third week of february with 69 l m2 and the first week of march with 69 35 l m2 for the period between the 4th week of february and the 1 st week of march from the end of flowering to the start of ripening increased flow is recorded in almost all treatments however there was still rainfall during these periods as shown in fig 8 the flow diminished as the vegetative cycle came to an end coinciding with a lack of precipitation in the first week of april one week before harvesting fig 8 shows the weekly variation in crop evapotranspiration with a total of 347 mm recorded over 18 weeks along with accumulated rainfall of 272 4 mm furthermore from december to the end of april 274 mm of rain was registered whereas the historical average for this period is 454 mm since the only source of water during the 18 week period had been from precipitation additional water requirements would have been registered during the fourth week of january and the third week of february and between the first and the second week of march thus it can be assumed that those water requirements were covered by the stored water from rainfall prior to the periods in question and by upward flows from the water table in fact the comparison of crop water requirements fig 8 with soil moisture flow fig 7 indicates that these water requirements have generally been covered by upward flows between the second and third week of february a lower increase in upward water flows is observed in treatments t1 and t4 while a decrease is observed in treatments t2 and t3 this pattern reflects both a slight increase treatments t1 and t4 and a reduction treatments t2 and t3 in water consumption from the water table in these treatments for this period however the higher consumption demands may be met by water stored in previous periods fig 8 when there was more precipitation than evapotranspiration table 3 reports the results of the analysis of variance f test for mean plant height with no significant differences observed between units and between treatments at 5 probability Œ± 0 05 according to the duncan test when comparing the means of the different treatments there was a significant difference between plant heights in t3 treatment 60 cm compared to plant heights in t2 52 23 cm t4 49 52 cm and t1 46 cm treatments but no significant difference between treatments t2 t4 and t1 treatments at the 5 level of significance the coefficient of variation cv of 6 70 indicates that the experiment results are reliable with respect to the variable being plant height in the analysis of variance for the number of tubers per plant shown in table 4 no significant differences at 5 are observed between treatments or between units the cv of 6 3 indicates that the experiment results are reliable with respect to the variable being number of tubers per plant the highest yield was achieved in t3 treatment with 11 3 t ha followed by t2 treatment 10 7 t ha while the lowest yield was recorded in t4 treatment 7 3 t ha below even the control treatment yield 8 3 t ha although the t2 treatment with a platform width of 11 45 m and 13 m between the water channel axes complies with the maximum space determined of 14 m its production was lower than that of t3 treatment despite the fact that the platform width in t3 treatment 17 95 m is greater than the maximum spacing between external drains 14 m this may be due to differences in the hydrophysical properties of the soil in t3 treatment as compared to those in t2 treatment the higher percentage of clay 45 registered in the second stratum 15 38 cm of the t3 treatment can be beneficial in terms of water retention at the root level and may have exerted a positive influence on plant development as well as yield mainly during periods of water deficit table 5 shows the results of the analysis of variance for the potato yield with no significant differences observed between treatments or between units furthermore a coefficient of variation of 17 is reported which allows us to infer that there is a notable variability as a result of the different applied treatments the duncan multiple range test at 5 probability level indicates that the t2 and t3 treatments was not significantly different table 6 potato yields of t1 and t4 treatments were not also significantly different p 0 05 also the fact that t2 and t3 treatments provide better yields than those in t1 and t4 treatments may be related to the availability and supply of water in the root zone since the calculations made were only to ensure adequate drainage overall it can be noted that the yields obtained are within the expected range bearing in mind that the crop was grown in flood prone areas with marginal soils and a predominance of native grasses chipana rivera et al 2016 4 conclusions the water requirements of the potato crop were covered by the upward flows from the water table and by precipitation which shows that the suka kollus system is sustainable under current climatic conditions the highest potato yield was achieved in treatment with two drains t3 followed by the one with one drain t2 this may have been due to either better water supply from the water table or the platform width which allowed to obtain plants with greater height and greater number of tubers per plant compared to the control in addition in this treatment the second stratum of the soil being clayey retained a greater quantity of water at the root level they can be considered good yields bearing in mind the fact that the crops were cultivated in marginal flood prone soils the distance of 6 5 m between drainage channels commonly used in traditional suka kollus was less than the distances calculated on the basis of the mean values of the hydrophysical properties of the soil therefore it is possible to expand the area of the platforms by incorporating subsurface drainage and placing the drainage channels by drains between 10 and 14 m apart depending on whether the maximum value of the hydraulic conductivity or the mean value respectively are considered accordingly suka kollus could be a valuable way of making use of marginal soils being able to even double the width of the cultivation platforms if some of the drainage channels are replaced by underground drains to increase the area of cultivation and thus improve their management acknowledgments the research reported in this paper was supported by the establishment of the training and research center in

after previous crop harvest in late june hoed manually to 5 cm in mid august and cultivated with a rotary tiller to 20 cm in september before planting wheat straw cut to a length of 5 10 cm was applied at the soil surface by hand before winter wheat planting in lsm and hsm in september of every year in fsm wheat straw was applied immediately after previous crop harvest in late june and removed from the soil surface manually before planting in september as the presence of decayed wheat straw can affect the germination and growth of winter wheat chen et al 2009 wheat straw was removed at planting with fsm 2 2 crop management winter wheat cultivar chuangwu 134 was sown in late september or early october each year at seed rate of 165 kg ha 1 using a no till disk drill with 20 cm row spacing and harvested in late june in the following year at planting n fertilizer as urea 46 n at 135 kg n ha 1 and phosphorus p fertilizer as calcium superphosphate 20 p at 39 kg p ha 1 were broadcast and then incorporated to a depth of 20 cm using the rotary tiller potassium chloride fertilizer was not applied because of high potassium k content in the soil according to the soil test all fertilizers were applied before straw mulching with hsm and lsm and after removing mulch with fsm or no mulching with ck in september hand weeding was done as needed to control weeds during wheat growing and fallow periods no irrigation was applied 2 3 measurements during the wheat growing season seedling number plant number tiller per plant and spike number were measured from two 1 m2 areas randomly within the plot in late october early december late march and late june respectively in late june total aboveground biomass grains stems and leaves was harvested by cutting all plants at a height of 2 cm above the ground manually from the entire plot without returning crop residues to the soil and weighed a portion of the biomass was weighed dried at 70 c for 3 d to a uniform moisture level wang et al 2011 and weighed again to determine dry matter yield from which total biomass yield was determined grain yield was determined by threshing plants on the ground and measuring the yield on oven dried basis after drying a subsample at 70 c for 3 d harvest index was calculated by dividing grain yield by total aboveground biomass yield soil water content was measured to a depth of 2 m at both planting swp and harvest swh in each year with a neutron probe the neutron probe was placed in the center of the plot and calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water content water content was measured at 0 1 m intervals for the 0 1 m layer and at 0 2 m intervals for the 1 2 m layer total soil water storage to 2 m was determined by adding water contents from all depth intervals daily total precipitation was recorded by an automatic weather station throughout the experimental period there were boarder dikes around each plot to prevent water flow so the surface runoff was considered negligible no irrigation was applied during the experimental period the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 60 m belowground li 1983 according to our previous study soil water within 2 m profile was not recharged completely after the summer fallow in most years for winter wheat monoculture system at the experimental site wang et al 2011 therefore both drainage and the upward flow into the root zone was not considered the intensity of the precipitation received was not high enough to observe significant drainage at the research site since precipitation is the sole water supply in the rainfed areas of the loess plateau the pse nielsen and vigil 2010 wang et al 2011 was calculated as 1 pse swp swh pf where pf is the total precipitation during the fallow period and swp and swh are soil water at wheat planting and at harvest of previous year s wheat respectively as wheat was grown during the winter water losses due to plant interception and evaporation from plant surfaces were considered negligible nielsen and vigil 2010 wang et al 2013 therefore the et and wue during the winter wheat growing season were calculated as 2 et mm swp swh pg 3 wue kg ha 1 mm

in 2013 2104 and harvest index and thousand grain weight were greater in 2011 2012 than other years 3 4 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the et did not vary among treatments but varied among years table 2 the wue varied among treatments and years with a significant treatment year interaction the wue was lower with lsm in 2008 2009 but greater with ck in 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014

across years wue was greater with ck than other treatments table 2 averaged across treatments et and wue were greater in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 than other years table 3 the wue decreased as pse increased for all treatments except for hsm fig 1 4 discussion straw mulching increased swp by 3 4 and pse by 8 16 compared with no mulching and the effect was more obvious in below average precipitation years than above average precipitation years suggesting that straw mulching could be a good water conservation strategy for dry areas higher soil water storage with straw mulching may result from reducing evaporation by providing an insulation layer baumhardt and jones 2002 and lowering the daily soil temperature and or from increasing rainfall infiltration and hydraulic conductivity during the summer period scott et al 2010 awe et al 2015 higher rate of straw mulching conserved more soil water until crop harvest than mulching during fallow or no mulching as shown by greater swh with hsm than ck and fsm this is in agreement with that reported by stagnari et al 2014 in a mediterranean environment decomposition of wheat residue due to higher soil temperature and water content during fallow and shorter duration of mulching probably reduced the effectiveness of fsm to conserve soil water at wheat harvest in the present study only 24 28 of the total precipitation during summer fallow was stored in the soil table 2 a case similar to that reported by wang et al 2011 in the loess plateau of china straw mulching applied either at lower rate throughout the year or at higher rate during fallow was more effective in increasing pse than no mulching a result of reduced water loss due to evaporation baumhardt et al 2013 also found that pse was greater with wheat residue cover than without under cotton gossipium hirsutum l in the southern high plain of usa straw mulching during fallow period increased pse during years with wet fallows in contrast year round mulching specifically hsm increased pse during years with a dry fallow such as in 2009 2010 tables 1 and 3 however increased pse due to straw mulching did not improve wue leading to low or no effects on wheat yield fig 1 it is likely that some of the wheat straw used for mulching contributed to soil organic matter accumulation and thereby increased swp and pse iqbal et al 2011 wang et al 2011 it may take several years to see the effects of increased soil organic matter due to straw mulching to show difference in water use efficiency higher pse with mulching generally resulted in greater soil water storage at planting table 2 which can enhance the germination and growth of wheat in dryland farming systems but may not be enough to support yield formation and increase wue deng et al 2006 increased swp and pse with lsm and hsm translated into enhanced wheat plant stand and tiller numbers tables 2 and 4 probably due to greater soil water availability for early growth of the crop the lower seedling number with hsm appeared to be a result of death of some seedlings due to lower soil temperature at planting from high rate of mulching a case similar to that observed by several researchers gao and li 2005 awe et al 2015 this occurred specifically during years with dry growing season such as 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 tables 1 and 5 straw mulching during fallow fsm appeared to have a beneficial effect in increasing wheat spike number with heavier grains table 4 a result of increased soil water availability table 2 such effects were pronounced more during the normal or dry years than the wet years tables 5 and 6 straw mulching throughout the year lsm and hsm reduced wheat grain yield and harvest index at the cost of biomass yield compared with ck and fsm table 4 it is likely that increased soil water availability due to straw mulching throughout the year favored early biomass growth due to increased plant and tiller numbers but soil may not have stored enough moisture to continue yield formation studies show that water deficit in any period of winter wheat development can result in a substantial decline in the yield and efficiency with which soil water reserves are utilized verda et al 2014 besides straw mulching also affects soil nutrient dynamics and thereby wheat yield lu et al 2015 although we did not measure soil n content straw mulch applied at planting possibly immobilized soil inorganic n thereby reducing n availability and grain yield in southern australia scott et al 2010 found that the concentration of nitrate n in soil solution decreased as the rate of straw amount as mulch increased addition of crop residue with high c n ratio such as wheat straw can reduce n availability to crops by increasing n immobilization lu et al 2015 gao et al 2009 reported that straw mulching favored more wheat vegetative than reproductive growth compared with no mulching straw mulching during fallow however produced similar grain yield and harvest index compared with no mulching suggesting that straw mulching is only beneficial when applied during the fallow period and that additional n fertilization may be needed to increase wheat grain yield when mulch is applied the effectiveness of year round straw mulching in increasing grain and biomass yields was evident during the dry years such as in 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 when grain and biomass yields were greater with hsm or lsm than other treatments tables 1 and 6 the trends reversed in the wet years this suggests that straw mulching is beneficial in sustaining wheat yield only during dry periods several researchers chen et al 2013 lu et al 2014 2015 have reported that wheat straw mulching increased winter wheat yields compared with no mulching when soil water content is low balwinder singh et al 2011 found that mulching improved crop growth and yield attributes when water was limiting in northwest india however this only led to significantly higher yield when there was prolonged water stress prior to anthesis in a meta analysis of the effect of straw mulching on soil water content and wheat yield wang et al 2015 found that wheat straw mulching improved winter wheat yield compared with no mulching when annual precipitation was 250 mm straw mulching during fallow or no mulching increased harvest index than other treatments in most years by enhancing grain yield relative to total biomass yield in this study although straw mulching increased swp it did not affect et table 2 suggesting that wheat consumed similar amount of water regardless of treatments greater amount of water may have used in early biomass growth leading to greater biomass in mulched treatments but no difference in grain yield and reduced wue with lsm and hsm compared with other treatments some researchers huang et al 2005 lenssen et al 2014 have reported linear relationship between wheat grain yield and wue our results however were in contrast to those reported for greater wue with straw mulching than without in the semiarid areas deng et al 2006 chakraborty et al 2010 straw mulching reduced wue compared with no mulching specifically during years with 500 mm annual precipitation above average growing season precipitation increased pse but reduced wheat growth and yield parameters as well as wue in 2014 2015 than other years tables 1 3 5 and 6 increased soil water recharge during the fallow increased pse in 2014 2015 this followed by increased precipitation during the growing season resulted in anaerobic condition which may have reduced wheat growth yield and wue in 2014 2015 straw mulching appears to be beneficial compared with no mulching for increasing pse during the dry years but not necessarily increase wue and wheat yield during years with 500 mm annual precipitation wheat straw mulching could be a good strategy to mitigate drought impacts in drylands of loess plateau and similar agroecosystems 5 conclusions wheat straw mulching increased swp pse winter wheat seedling growth plant and tiller numbers compared with no mulching in the semiarid loess plateau of china mulching throughout the year however reduced spike number grain yield thousand grain weight harvest index and water use efficiency at the expense of aboveground biomass yield but mulching during summer fallow maintained grain yield compared with no mulching mulching rate had little effect on soil water storage and wheat characteristics further study may confirm the benefit of straw mulching on n fertilization and soc accrual this revealed benefit of straw mulching on precipitation storage and wheat yield compared with no mulching specifically during the dry years it did not increase wue and wheat yield during years with 500 mm annual precipitation because of increased precipitation storage efficiency and similar wheat yields straw mulching should be applied during fallow period or at low rate throughout the year in dry years to increase soil water conservation and improve agricultural sustainability in drylands acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of

that mulching did not have a significant effect on wheat yield when soil water content at planting was high in the loess plateau of china similarly lu et al 2014 reported that straw mulching increased soil water content but reduced corn zea mays l yield and wue compared with no mulching in silty clay loam soil in northeastern china with an annual precipitation of 573 mm the neutral or negative effect of straw mulching may attribute to the potential seedlings death due to lower soil temperature in the early period gao and li 2005 gao et al 2009 awe et al 2015 and the reduction of soil n availability to crops by increasing n immobilization with straw application in the later growth stage lu et al 2015 the loess plateau of china with a 6000 yr old agricultural history encompasses a

station in the loess plateau 107 44 70 e 35 12 79 n in changwu county shaanxi province of china the experimental site is 1220 m above the sea level and has a slope of 1 the site is located in the warm temperate zone with a continental monsoon climate the average annual air temperature is 9 2 c the 24 yr average annual precipitation is 574 mm more than half of which occurs from july to september table 1 the mean frost free period is 194 d and the annual open pan evaporation is 1440 mm the soil is a light silt loam heilutu series which corresponds to a calcarid regosol in the fao unesco classification system fao unesco 1988 the soil is with 35 g kg 1 sand 656 g kg 1 silt and 309 g kg 1 clay at the 0 20 cm depth the average field capacity saturation point and soil wilting point are 0

three replications treatments included control with no mulching ck wheat straw mulching throughout the year at 4500 kg ha 1 lsm and 9000 kg ha 1 hsm and wheat straw mulching during the summer fallow period july to mid september at 9000 kg ha 1 fsm the plot size for each treatment was 6 7 m wide by 10 m long plots were tilled with a moldboard plow yili 1l 220 shandong yili co to a depth of 20 cm after previous crop harvest in late june hoed manually to 5 cm in mid august and cultivated with a rotary tiller to 20 cm in september before planting wheat straw cut to a length of 5 10 cm was applied at the soil surface by hand before winter wheat planting in lsm and hsm in september of every year in fsm wheat straw was applied immediately after previous crop harvest in late june and removed from the soil surface manually before planting in september as the presence of decayed wheat straw can affect the germination and growth of winter wheat chen et al 2009 wheat straw was removed at planting with fsm 2 2 crop management winter wheat cultivar chuangwu 134 was sown in late september or early october each year at seed rate of 165 kg ha 1 using a no till disk drill with 20 cm row spacing and harvested in late june in the following year at planting n fertilizer as urea 46 n at 135 kg n ha 1 and phosphorus p fertilizer as calcium superphosphate 20 p at 39 kg p ha 1 were broadcast and then incorporated to a depth of 20 cm using the rotary tiller potassium chloride fertilizer was not applied because of high potassium k content in the soil according to the soil test all fertilizers were applied before straw mulching with hsm and lsm and after removing mulch with fsm or no mulching with ck in september hand weeding was done as needed to control weeds during wheat growing and fallow periods no irrigation was applied 2 3 measurements during the wheat growing season seedling number plant number tiller per plant and spike number were measured from two 1 m2 areas randomly within the plot in late october early december late march and late june respectively in late june total aboveground biomass grains stems and leaves was harvested by cutting all plants at a height of 2 cm above the ground manually from the entire plot without returning crop residues to the soil and weighed a portion of the biomass was weighed dried at 70 c for 3 d to a uniform moisture level wang et al 2011 and weighed again to determine dry matter yield from which total biomass yield was determined grain yield was determined by threshing plants on the ground and measuring the yield on oven dried basis after drying a subsample at 70 c for 3 d harvest index was calculated by dividing grain yield by total aboveground biomass yield soil water content was measured to a depth of 2 m at both planting swp and harvest swh in each year with a neutron probe the neutron probe was placed in the center of the plot and calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water content water content was measured at 0 1 m intervals for the 0 1 m layer and at 0 2 m intervals for the 1 2 m layer total soil water storage to 2 m was determined by adding water contents from all depth intervals daily total precipitation was recorded by an automatic weather station throughout the experimental period there were boarder dikes around each plot to prevent water flow so the surface runoff was considered negligible no irrigation was applied during the experimental period the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 60 m belowground li 1983 according to our previous study soil water within 2 m profile was not recharged completely after the summer fallow in most years for winter wheat monoculture system at the experimental site wang et al 2011 therefore both drainage and the upward flow into the root zone was not considered the intensity of the precipitation received was not high enough to observe significant drainage at the research site since precipitation is the sole water supply in the rainfed areas of the loess plateau the pse nielsen and vigil 2010 wang et al 2011 was calculated as 1 pse swp swh pf where pf is the total precipitation during the fallow period and swp and swh are soil water at wheat planting and at harvest of previous year s wheat respectively as wheat was grown during the winter water losses due to plant interception and evaporation from plant surfaces were considered negligible nielsen and vigil 2010 wang et al 2013 therefore the et and wue during the winter wheat growing season were calculated as 2 et mm swp swh pg 3 wue kg ha 1 mm

precipitations precipitation year type was classified as the wet normal and dry when di is 0 35 0 35 0 35 and 0 35 respectively xing et al 2001 similarly the dis for precipitation during fallow and growing periods were calculated to assess the status in seasonal precipitation among different years 2 4 data analysis data for soil water and wheat parameters were analyzed using the mixed procedure of sas littell et al 1996 mulching year and mulching year interaction were considered as fixed effects and replication as the random effect means were separated by using the fisher s protected least significant difference test when treatments and interactions were significant unless otherwise stated the differences among treatments and treatment year interaction were considered significant at p 0

and hsm in 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the 1000 grain weight was greater with lsm or hsm than other treatments in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 the 1000 grain weight was greater with fsm than hsm in 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 but greater with ck than other treatments in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 harvest index was lower with lsm than other treatments in 2008 2009 in 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 harvest index was greater with ck than hsm in 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 harvest index was greater with ck and fsm than lsm and hsm averaged across years seedling number was greater with ck than hsm table 4 tiller and plant numbers were greater with lsm and hsm than ck and fsm but the trend reversed for grain yield and harvest index spike number and thousand grain weight were greater with fsm than other treatments aboveground biomass yield was greater with hsm than ck grain yield was not significantly different between ck and fsm and they were greater than hsm and lsm among years number of seedling plant tiller and spike were respectively greater in 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2013 2014 than other years table 5 grain yield and aboveground biomass were greater in 2013 2104 and harvest index and thousand grain weight were greater in 2011 2012 than other years 3 4 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the et did not vary among treatments but varied among years table 2 the wue varied among treatments and years with a significant treatment year interaction the wue was lower with lsm in 2008 2009 but greater with ck in 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 15 than other treatments table 3 the wue was greater with hsm than fsm in 2009 2010 and greater with ck than lsm in 2011 2012 in 2013 2014 wue was greater with ck and fsm than lsm and hsm averaged across years wue was greater with ck than other treatments table 2 averaged across treatments et and wue were greater in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 than other years table 3 the wue decreased as pse increased for all treatments except for hsm fig 1 4 discussion straw mulching increased swp by 3 4 and pse by 8 16 compared with no mulching and the effect was more obvious in below average precipitation years than above average precipitation years suggesting that straw mulching could be a good water conservation strategy for dry areas higher soil water storage with straw mulching may result from reducing evaporation by providing an insulation layer baumhardt and jones 2002 and lowering the daily soil temperature and or from increasing rainfall infiltration and hydraulic conductivity during the summer period scott et al 2010 awe et al 2015 higher rate of straw mulching conserved more soil water until crop harvest than mulching during fallow or no mulching as shown by greater swh with hsm than ck and fsm this is in agreement with that reported by stagnari et al 2014 in a mediterranean environment decomposition of wheat residue due to higher soil temperature and water content during fallow and shorter duration of mulching probably reduced the effectiveness of fsm to conserve soil water at wheat harvest in the present study only 24 28 of the total precipitation during summer fallow was stored in the soil table 2 a case similar to that reported by wang et al 2011 in the loess plateau of china straw mulching applied either at lower rate throughout the year or at higher rate during fallow was more effective in increasing pse than no mulching a result of reduced water loss due to evaporation baumhardt et al 2013 also found that pse was greater with wheat residue cover than without under cotton gossipium hirsutum l in the southern high plain of usa straw mulching during fallow period increased pse during years with wet fallows in contrast year round mulching specifically hsm increased pse during years with a dry fallow such as in 2009 2010 tables 1 and 3 however increased pse due to straw mulching did not improve wue leading to low or no effects on wheat yield fig 1 it is likely that some of the wheat straw used for mulching contributed to soil organic matter accumulation and thereby increased swp and pse iqbal et al 2011 wang et al 2011 it may take several years to see the effects of increased soil organic matter due to straw mulching to show difference in water use efficiency higher pse with mulching generally resulted in greater soil water storage at planting table 2 which can enhance the germination and growth of wheat in dryland farming systems but may not be enough to support yield formation and increase wue deng et al 2006 increased swp and pse with lsm and hsm translated into enhanced wheat plant stand and tiller numbers tables 2 and 4 probably due to greater soil water availability for early growth of the crop the lower seedling number with hsm appeared to be a result of death of some seedlings due to lower soil temperature at planting from high rate of mulching a case similar to that observed by several researchers gao and li 2005 awe et al 2015 this occurred specifically during years with dry growing season such as 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 tables 1 and 5 straw mulching during fallow fsm appeared to have a beneficial effect in increasing wheat spike number with heavier grains table 4 a result of increased soil water availability table 2 such effects were pronounced more during the normal or dry years than the wet years tables 5 and 6 straw mulching throughout the year lsm and hsm reduced wheat grain yield and harvest index at the cost of biomass yield compared with ck and fsm table 4 it is likely that increased soil water availability due to straw mulching throughout the year favored early biomass growth due to increased plant and tiller numbers but soil may not have stored enough moisture to continue yield formation studies show that water deficit in any period of winter wheat development can result in a substantial decline in the yield and efficiency with which soil water reserves are utilized verda et al 2014 besides straw mulching also affects soil nutrient dynamics and thereby wheat yield lu et al 2015 although we did not measure soil n content straw mulch applied at planting possibly immobilized soil inorganic n thereby reducing n availability and grain yield in southern australia scott et al 2010 found that the concentration of nitrate n in soil solution decreased as the rate of straw amount as mulch increased addition of crop residue with high c n ratio such as wheat straw can reduce n availability to crops by increasing n immobilization lu et al 2015 gao et al 2009 reported that straw mulching favored more wheat vegetative than reproductive growth compared with no mulching straw mulching during fallow however produced similar grain yield and harvest index compared with no mulching suggesting that straw mulching is only beneficial when applied during the fallow period and that additional n fertilization may be needed to increase wheat grain yield when mulch is applied the effectiveness of year round straw mulching in increasing grain and biomass yields was evident during the dry years such as in 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 when grain and biomass yields were greater with hsm or lsm than other treatments tables 1 and 6 the trends reversed in the wet years this suggests that straw mulching is beneficial in sustaining wheat yield only during dry periods several researchers chen et al 2013 lu et al 2014 2015 have reported that wheat straw mulching increased winter wheat yields compared with no mulching when soil water content is low balwinder singh et al 2011 found that mulching improved crop growth and yield attributes when water was limiting in northwest india however this only led to significantly higher yield when there was prolonged water stress prior to anthesis in a meta analysis of the effect of straw mulching on soil water content and wheat yield wang et al 2015 found that wheat straw mulching improved winter wheat yield compared with no mulching when annual precipitation was 250 mm straw mulching during fallow or no mulching increased harvest index than other treatments in most years by enhancing grain yield relative to total biomass yield in this study although straw mulching increased swp it did not affect et table 2 suggesting that wheat consumed similar amount of water regardless of treatments greater amount of water may have used in early biomass growth leading to greater biomass in mulched treatments but no difference in grain yield and reduced wue with lsm and hsm compared with other treatments some researchers huang et al 2005 lenssen et al 2014 have reported linear relationship between wheat grain yield and wue our results however were in contrast to those reported for greater wue with straw mulching than without in the semiarid areas deng et al 2006 chakraborty et al 2010 straw mulching reduced wue compared with no mulching specifically during years with 500 mm annual precipitation above average growing season precipitation increased pse but reduced wheat growth and yield parameters as well as wue in 2014 2015 than other years tables 1 3 5 and 6 increased soil water recharge during the fallow increased pse in 2014 2015 this followed by increased precipitation during the growing season resulted in anaerobic condition which may have reduced wheat growth yield and wue in 2014 2015 straw mulching appears to be beneficial compared with no mulching for increasing pse during the dry years but not necessarily increase wue and wheat yield during years with 500 mm annual precipitation wheat straw mulching could be a good strategy to mitigate drought impacts in drylands of loess plateau and similar agroecosystems 5 conclusions wheat straw mulching increased swp pse winter wheat seedling growth plant and tiller numbers compared with no mulching in the semiarid loess plateau of china mulching throughout the year however reduced spike number grain yield thousand grain weight harvest index and water use efficiency at the expense of aboveground biomass yield but mulching during summer fallow maintained grain yield compared with no mulching mulching rate had little effect on soil water storage and wheat characteristics further study may confirm the benefit of straw mulching on n fertilization and soc accrual this revealed benefit of straw mulching on precipitation storage and wheat yield compared with no mulching specifically during the dry years it did not increase wue and wheat yield during years with 500 mm annual precipitation because of increased precipitation storage efficiency and similar wheat yields straw mulching should be applied during fallow period or at low rate throughout the year in dry years to increase soil water conservation and improve agricultural sustainability in drylands acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of

11417,to explore low cost high yielding and environment friendly rainfed farming technology is critical for sustainable agricultural development in semiarid east african plateau eap an innovative ridge furrow mulching system rfms was first introduced to eap with a two year field experiment using maize cultivar kdvi in a typical semiarid site of kenya from 2012 to 2013 nine treatments were designed including ridge furrow cultivation with black plastic mulching rfb straw mulching rfs and without mulching rf under high 375 kg ha 1 conventional 225 kg ha 1 and zero fertilization rates we found rfb and rfs significantly increased soil water storage 0 40 cm by 10 2 and 4 8 while lowered evapotranspiration rate and improved thermal status compared to rf across two growing seasons importantly rfb and rfs increased soil organic carbon and c n ratio soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen by 7 8 and 4 9 7 2 and 5 1 respectively following two growing seasons of farming practice as expected grain yield and water use efficiency wue were averagely increased by 63 3 and 63 8 27 5 and 35 9 in rfb and rfs than those of rf respectively additionally net income and economic output to input ratio were significantly greater in rfb and rfs than those of rf on the other hand conventional fertilization rate achieved similar grain yield and wue as high fertilization did considering environmental and economic benefits the rfms farming system with conventional fertilization may act as a promising option to upgrade local dryland agricultural system in eap keywords rainfed farming soil quality economic benefit maize east african plateau 1 introduction in semiarid east african plateau eap increasing land degradation and population growth has received extensive concerns over last decades particularly in the semiarid rainfed agricultural areas conway and toenniessen 2003 soil conservation and rainwater collection are two major issues affecting land degradation and food security in this region m√ºller et al 2011 most of rainfall events frequently take place in the form of short duration but high intensity storm which results in serious non productive surface runoff and soil erosion hatibu et al 2003 particularly in the great rift valley of kenya there are a large number of slope farmlands for agricultural production which actually enhance the challenges for rainwater retention and surface runoff management rockstr√∂m 2000 local agricultural productivity universally remains at low level due to inefficient rainwater management pretty et al 2011 historically large area reclamation for agricultural production further aggravated the environmental problems aforementioned brown 1981 therefore to upgrade local rainfed farming technology is crucial for soil and water conservation and ecosystem sustainability in semiarid eap currently only 10 15 rainwater resource is used productively for crop production in eap breman et al 2001 exploring in situ rainwater harvesting technologies rhts is a promising solution for improving rainfall runoff collection and utilization in this region for instance in situ rhts such as terraced fields in ethiopia adgo et al 2013 trench style rainwater storage technique in tanzania makurira et al 2009 half moons style rainwater saving practice in kenya nyangito et al 2008 stone bunds in kenya and uganda ellis jones and tengberg 2000 all displayed substantial advantages to improve rainwater infiltration and utilization via collecting surface runoff during rainy season apart from improving soil water storage in situ rhts can act as a robust approach for smallholders to manage farmland soil and cope with soil erosion and land degradation together with fertilization application getnet and macalister 2012 as expected in situ rhts in eap have been viewed as an effective strategy to reduce the risk of crop failure through improving water availability in fragile soil systems karpouzoglou and barron 2014 and thus provide smallholder farmers with a crucial climate adaptation base for enhancing resilience against dry spells additionally in situ rhts is usually endowed with low cost high efficient and easy operated advantages compared to other micro and macro catchment water collection technologies from perspective of technology adoption in situ rhts are therefore more easily accepted by small farmers in rainfed agricultural region of eap recha et al 2015 despite a few rhts has been so far tested and applied in semiarid eap there is still weaker than expected environmental and economic benefits achieved by these indigenous technologies this was mainly due to the mulching materials used by local farmers such as crop straw gravel and sand did not achieve enough evaporation preventing effects as desired in semiarid eap myburgh 2013 it is estimated that up to 80 of the rainfall falling on rain fed farms has been lost as evaporation before it is used by the plants hatibu et al 2006 therefore the application of in situ rhts combined with effective mulching should be an advanced strategy to renew local dryland farming system in eap ridge furrow mulching system rfms is a soil and water conservation technique which has been used commonly in semiarid and semihumid asian especially in northwest china and south korea arnhold et al 2013 gan et al 2013 as early in 1980s this sort of innovative rfms has been tested and in late 1990s extended to a large area in the semiarid loess plateau china the extensive application of rfms achieved good effectiveness on reducing runoff erosion and surface evaporation over last two decades in china gan et al 2013 mo et al 2013 currently the predominant rainfed cultivation technology is flat planting without any mulching and fertilization is marginally applied in rainfed agricultural areas of eap biazin et al 2012 we hypothesized that the rfms may achieve the same effectiveness in semiarid eap particularly in kenya theoretically the rhts in combination with least fertilization could achieve high yield and high efficiency but economic and environmental benefits need to be evaluated at field scale mo et al 2013 gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014 however it is still unclear how integrated mulching materials and fertilization management would exert the effects under local climatic and soil circumstance in the semiarid eap such as kenya in this study we first introduced rfms to semiarid kenya and investigated if this innovative farming technology could exert agronomic economic and environmental benefits as expected according to our previous observations mulching the soil with straw and black film can decrease topsoil temperature and hence avoid high temperature stress at the late stage of growth mo et al 2013 we tested three different mulching treatments such as black plastic film grass straw and zero mulching at a typical semiarid rainfed site of southeast kenya eap from 2012 to 2013 the objectives were 1 to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of introduced rfms on rainwater collection soil thermal dynamics soil surface evapotranspiration soil quality and its related parameters 2 to investigate the differences in grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits under the rfms and 3 to identify an optimized strategy of the rhts management at field scale in semiarid kenya and other similar areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and general description field experiment was carried out at a semiarid slope 10 farmland of katumani research centre kenya agriculture research institute kari 1 35 s 37 14 e southeast kenya over two growing seasons from 2012 to 2013 the study site is located in eap with an elevation of 1600 m mean annual rainfall of 655 mm and evaporation amount of about 1800 mm as well as mean annual temperature of 19 2 c rainfall pattern is characterized as bimodal curve in two distinct rainy seasons the long rainy reason was from march to july of each year and short rainy season was from october to next january maize is local major staple crop and can be planted in short and long rainy seasons soil type belongs to sandy clay loam and is classified as chromic luvisols kibe et al 1981 maximum soil depth is only 120 cm major physical and chemical properties of farmland soil at 0 30 cm layer are as follows soil organic carbon of 10 1 g kg 1 total soil nitrogen of 0 64 g kg 1 readily available phosphorus concentration of 8 5 mg kg 1 total salinity content of 0 324 g kg 1 with ph 6 0 respectively 2 2 rfms implementation there are two core configurations in rfms including alternative ridge furrow units and the relevant mulching materials the ridge furrow units are used as on field rain water harvesting storage system within the units the ridges are aimed to channelize rainwater into furrows and to minimize surface runoff the furrows are allocated at the junction between two adjacent ridges and used as storing water and sowing crops in practice two adjacent ridges are different from width and height according to local rainfall and thermal conditions the wide but low ridge is generally 0 6 m wide and 0 15 m high and the narrow high one is 0 4 m wide and 0 3 m high respectively considering the convenience of field work the wide low ridges are designed for walking and field operation two sorts of ridges are alternatively assembled and represent the most effective gauge for maize production the ridge furrow farming system is preferably applicable for the farmlands with the slopes ranging from 6 to 12 on the other hand there are different types of materials mulching on the soil surface to reduce evaporation modify soil thermal balance and suppress weeds the materials mainly include plastic film gravel and sand rock fragments crop straw etc in semiarid regions plastic film mulching is viewed as a preferable approach to maximize growth yield and water use efficiency wue in rfms due to its outstanding effects on suppressing evaporation and runoff before rfms implementation some necessary land management such as plowing field breaking up clods and clearing weeds would be performed to facilitate the establishment of ridge furrow configuration based on the predetermined size the ridges and furrows can be set up with a manual machine the ridge furrow system is predominantly oriented perpendicular to the main slope direction of field sites to intercept runoff after the completion of ridges and furrows various mulching materials can be covered by hand immediately in order to reduce soil water evaporation for example plastic sheet is laid out over the plot where two pieces of plastic films are jointed in the midline between wide and narrow ridges and the joint is fixed stably by placing soil on the top of film grass straw can also be applied with a given rate 2 3 experimental design we selected a typical dryland site with the slope angle of about 10 and the slope length of about 50 m in the experimental farm of kari katumani research center a 3 3 farming pattern was conducted using a randomized complete block design the three farming patterns comprised of rfb ridge and furrow with black plastic mulching fig 1 a rfs ridge and furrow with grass straw mulching fig 1b and rf bare ridge and furrow fig 1c the size of ridge furrow unit in each farming pattern was identical detailed information in the schematic diagram fig 1 before the setup of ridges and furrows three different rates of compound fertilizer n p k 1 1 1 were applied including high f2 375 kg ha 1 medium conventional f1 225 kg ha 1 and zero f0 respectively for each predeterminated plot according to local fertilization level in early may and november 2012 ridge furrow units in each plot were built manually perpendicular to the main slope direction of field thereafter plastic film and straw were covered by hand immediately in order to prevent any water evaporation from soil the polyethylene film 0 008 mm thick used in this study was produced by lanzhou green garden corporation of china grass straw was harvested from the meadow nearby then cut by hand into 5 10 cm length and air dried the dried grass straw in all plots was applied manually at the rate of 6 t ha 1 in both growing seasons ultimately a total of 27 plots 3 3 3 were established on the slope land each plot was 5 m long and 5 m wide being surrounded by the ridges to prevent possible surface runoff in the vertical direction along with the field slope after the implementation of rfms and fertilization a local maize hybrid kdvi was sown in the furrows using a hole sowing machine at a planting density of 125 plants plot 1 equal to 50 000 plants ha 1 with spacing of 40 cm inter plant distance along the furrows on 17 may 2012 first growing season and 17 november 2012 second growing season respectively manual weeding was performed in each plot if needed all plants were harvested at early september 2012 and late february 2013 respectively after harvesting all the plastic residues were completely cleared by hand in all plots the lands remained clean to avoid any other influences on soil and water conservation in next growing season 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 temperature and rainfall daily mean air temperature and rainfall data were collected from the katumani centre meteorological station kenya hourly mean soil temperature at 10 cm depth was periodically recorded using an automatic temperature logger microlite u fourier usa which was buried in the central between two plants in the furrows of each plot 2 4 2 soil water storage evapotranspiration and water use efficiency wue soil moisture status was expressed by total soil water storage sws mm which was periodically determined at soil depths of 0 120 cm before sowing soil bulk density was measured for each 20 cm increment average bulk density was 1 48 gcm 3 in soil to a depth of 0 120 cm for each plot soil samples were taken from three random points located in the central between two plants in the furrows using a soil auger 8 cm diameter 20 cm height at each 20 cm increment for each 14 days interval throughout growing season for each sample soil water content gsw was then measured and calculated using the gravimetric method finally soil water storage sws mm was calculated by following equation at the vertical profile of a given point for each plot total soil water storage was evaluated through averaging the values from three sampling points 1 s w s m m g s w œÅ b g c m 3 s d mm where œÅb was soil bulk density and sd referred to as soil depth et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and the isotope measurements demonstrate that the transpiration is the larger component to et the experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions and no irrigation was provided during growing season each plot was surrounded by high ridges to prevent the occurrence of runoff it was noted that local rainfall was generally low and did not cause the underground drainage below the depth of 120 cm we therefore calculated evapotranspiration et mm at field scale using the following formula 2 e t p Œ¥ s w s p mm was total rainfall amount across growing season and Œ¥sws mm was the difference in soil water storage 0 120 cm between the beginning and the end of growing season water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 has different definitions in agronomy and plant physiology in present study wue was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to crop water consumption 3 w u e y e t where y was grain yield kg ha 1 and et mm is evapotranspiration within growing season 2 4 3 parameters related to soil quality in each plot three soil samples at 0 30 cm depth were taken randomly in the central between two plants in the furrows before sowing and after harvesting over two growing seasons fresh soil samples were air dried under room temperature and pressed to pass a 2 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen stn was measured by dry combustion 450 c method using a chns analyzer elementar vario el ele mentar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany soil available phosphorus sap was extracted with 0 5 m nahco3 and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer c n was then calculated as the ratio of soc to stn for each sample 2 4 4 grain yield and components at maturity twelve corn ears in each plot were randomly harvested from the inner rows for the determination on yield components such as ear length ear diameter and 1000 kernel weight at silking six plants grown in inner rows were tagged in each plot and potential kernels per ear were determined by counting the number of spikelet for each ear the aborted kernels per ear were simultaneously quantified the kernel abortion ratio was therefore calculated as the proportion of aborted kernels to potential kernels per ear grain yield was determined by harvesting all the ears from the middle 6 rows equal to 15 m 2 of plants the harvested ears were shelled manually and the grain was air dried for the determination on yield per unit area 2 4 5 economic benefit evaluation economic benefit was calculated via counting the input values briefly consisted of labor input material expenditure such as plastic film seeds and fertilizer costs and output value economic yield such as grain yield and forage in various treatments thereafter net income can be quantified by calculating the difference between output and input values finally the ratio of total output to total input was calculated to assess the economic effectiveness generated from each farming technology in our study 2 5 data analysis the analysis of variances anova was performed on all the data across two growing seasons the differences of mean values between treatments were compared by least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of temperature and rainfall amount under rfm system historical trends and seasonal characteristics of temperatures and rainfall patterns were presented in fig 2 daily air temperature ranged from 14 7 to 21 5 c with an average value of 16 4 c in 2012 growing season indicating a relatively cool season in 2013 growing season it was increased to 20 9 c ranging from 18 5 to 23 8 c fig 2 considering the mean value of past 10 years during the corresponding period mean daily temperature was 0 6 and 0 5 c higher in 2012 and 2013 respectively as for rainfall pattern 2012 growing season had less rainfall amount with a high variability 18 4 i e equivalent of 29 9 mm lower than historic average value 192 3 mm critically more than 66 1 rainfall occurred at seedling stage of maize which to some extent help early vegetative growth and promoted the construction of seedling architecture while only 23 9 rainfall was distributed in late growth stage maize plant still can resist drought stress and complete the reproductive growth in virtue of basal biomass established in early stage in contrast rainfall distribution was relatively well proportioned in 2013 growing season while total rainfall amount within growing season was 181 7 mm also obviously lower than historical mean value of 200 4 mm however the rainfall amount at early stage was obviously lower in 2013 than that of 2012 implying that early vegetative growth was worse in 2013 than 2012 additionally the rainfall events with less than 5 mm accounted for 50 0 and 57 7 of total rainfall frequency in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 conventionally less than 5 mm rainfall was viewed as ineffective rainfall event which was merely 6 5 and 11 9 of total in season rainfall in 2012 and 2013 season respectively on the contrary the frequency of more than 20 mm events reached up to 28 6 and 15 4 of total rainfall times which contributed up to 77 0 and 44 7 of total rainfall amount within growing season in 2012 and 2013 respectively clearly in semiarid agricultural ecosystem of eap the total amount of rainfall is composed primarily of sporadic heavy rainfall events with concomitant irregular distribution during crop growing season this could pose very high risk for increased incidence of surface runoff and hence added challenge for collection utilization of rainwater at field scale 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of soil hydro thermal status both mulching materials and fertilization rates to most extent affected the dynamics of soil water storage within 0 120 cm soil profile during experimental seasons while the magnitudes varied with growth stages and soil depths fig 3 independent of fertilization levels rfb consistently produced the highest soil water storage within 0 40 cm profile topsoil fig 3a revealing a striking capacity to collect surface runoff and retain rainwater to soil for the water storage in subsoil 41 80 cm rfb led to a significant increase at early growth stages but a significant decline during late growth periods fig 3b there were no detectable differences between rfs and rf across growing seasons deepsoil 81 120 water storage in rfb was significant lower than these in rfs and rf at late growth stages fig 3c as a whole rfb obtained significantly higher soil water storage within 0 120 cm profile at early growth stages fig 3d irrespective of mulching treatments fertilization rates did not significantly affect the changes in topsoil and deepsoil water storage in most cases fig 3e and g however the dynamics of subsoil water condition clearly indicated a significant decrease for both f2 and f1 especially during late growth periods fig 3f this partially supported the point that maize plant obtained better growth status due to increased fertilize application and accordingly consumed more soil water in semiarid rainfed agricultural area of eap such as kenya intensive non productive water loss is widely recognized as major driving factor causing land degradation gachene et al 1997 heavy but hurry rainfall events would increase the incidence of surface runoff particularly in slope land gachene et al 1997 in this area although a total rainfall within growing in theory is not too scarce to threaten crop development dry spell occurrences between and during seasons often negatively impact on crop yields and soil fertility mainly due to significant insufficiency on rainfall harvesting and utilization biazin et al 2012 the rfms has been proved to be effective as an in situ rainwater harvesting technology to increase rainwater storage and infiltration in most semiarid regions of asia arnhold et al 2013 ren et al 2010 in our study site we also found that both rft and rfs help to significantly increase soil moisture in top and sub soil layers and prolong the water availability in early developmental stages effectively the rfms act as a measure to mitigate the impacts of dry spells on the other hand under conventional flatting cultivation farmland located at steep slopes usually suffer higher erosion rates compared to plain field pimentel et al 1995 as for our introduced ridge furrow mulching approach no detectable surface erosion was occurred in each sloping plot during both growing seasons due mainly to the fact that the setup of ridges could intercept the runoff from different rainfall events during growing season and the furrows provided a place for water storage through direct penetration in additional mulching the soil with various materials especially the plastic sheet provided a reliable physical barriers to prevent the washing of rainfall to bared soils in general no detectable changes in topsoil 10 cm depth temperature were recorded among fertilization treatments and instead mulching materials significantly altered top temperature in both seasons in 2012 rfs consistently maintained the lowest soil temperature 0 44 c lower than rf across growing season fig 4 a soil temperature was significantly increased under rfb at seedling and vegetative stages but a clear reduction during reproductive period diurnal changes in average soil temperature indicated that the warming effects of rfb at early and mid growth stages were mainly resulted from elevated night temperatures while cooling effects of rfb at late growth stages ultimately rely on decreased daytime temperatures similarly rfs led to the lowest soil temperature 1 63 c lower than rf throughout 2013 growing season fig 4b rfb significantly increased soil temperature by 1 25 c at seedling stage but reduced by 0 36 c at vegetative stage in semiarid agricultural ecosystem of eap heat stress occurred at late stages of crop development often bring about unacceptable economic losses and climate associated environmental issues the cooling effects of straw black polyethylene film mulching may mitigate any adverse consequences to a great extent as another environmental threat to dryland agriculture system in eap heat stress frequently took place in most time of growing season which played a negative role in yield formation and farmer s livelihood cairns et al 2013 it is widely acknowledged that mulching the soil surface with different materials modify soil thermal balance and thus determine crop development and yield performance lal 1978 in our technology system two different materials were applied to investigate the changes on soil thermal dynamic throughout two growing seasons we noticed that grass straw produced a most obvious temperature decrease compared to non mulched treatment followed by black film ai et al 2005 also observed that the coverage with black film as blocking the passage of most solar radiation clearly reduced soil temperature compared to the unmulched treatments as a whole in the early growing season both black film and grass straw could lead to a significant lower soil temperature compared to un mulched plots while the difference tended to be smaller in late growing season being probably attributable to canopy closure that intercepted the majority of solar energy and thus minimized any effect from mulches moreno and moreno 2008 in semiarid eap drought and high temperature often occur simultaneously during early maize growing season hatibu et al 2006 so far a large majority of traditional in situ rhts designed only to address the single environmental stress have exhibited a declined tendency of technology extension due mainly to the insignificant improvements on seedling establishment and hence yield performance rollins et al 2013 thus novel design on in situ rhts aiming to improve crop development during early stages should take into full consideration the combined effect of both drought and heat stresses in our system along with the significant increase in soil moisture through improving rainwater harvesting by ridge furrow configuration and reducing evaporation with soil mulching soil temperatures were lowered clearly by the coverage of both straw and black film to a more reasonable range for early maize development compared to these traditional techniques such as terraced fields trench style rainwater storage technique and stone bunds solely focusing on the issue of rainwater collection the biggest advantage of our novel system is the improvement of coordination between water availability and thermal balance which may provide better base for final yield output 3 3 soil nutrients in general soc within each growing season showed an obvious decreasing tendency in mulching treatments over two growing seasons except for rf in 2013 greater decline of soc was observed in rfb than rfs fig 5 a averaged to both seasons the decreasing magnitudes in in season soc were 0 75 and 0 55 g kg 1 for rfb and rfs respectively oppositely for both rrb and rfs soc tended to increase during fallow seasons but more so for rfs 0 55 g kg 1 compared to rfb 0 40 g kg 1 regardless of mulching treatments increased fertilization application suppressed the decline of soc contents in first growing season subsequently promoted the soc increase during second growing season across both seasons soc in f2 was 0 36 and 0 35 g kg 1 higher than that in f1 and f0 respectively fig 5b on the other hand stn showed a steady decrease in three mulching treatments as the growing season progresses in both years fig 5c in most cases however there were no significant differences in stn contents between treatments compared to the respective starting basal values of stn i e stn contents at sowing stage in 2012 in each treatment a clear decline in stn 0 06 0 04 and 0 09 g kg 1 for rfb rfs and rf respectively was detected at the end of fallow stage in 2013 independent of mulching patterns increased fertilization level achieved greater stn contents in both growing and fallow seasons fig 5d in comparison with f0 f2 and f1 significantly increased stn contents by 12 7 and 9 8 across both years additionally both mulching and fertilization had an insignificant effect on sap at most of developmental stages fig 5g and h but an overall increasing tread was observed over the whole study period obviously fertilization induced improvements in soil quality mainly including soc and stn could be a positive measure to relieve the soil erosion caused by local serious surface runoff in semiarid eap soc plays a critical role in maintaining soil carbon pool and boost soil restoration for fragile dryland agriculture system especially in semiarid eap where soil fertility depletion and loss has been described as one of the most serious environmental problem and hence the most important constraint to food security bationo et al 2007 in our study the soc content displayed rapidly decline within growing season as a result of plastic mulching this was due to the fact that under plastic mulching condition enhanced microbial biomass during growing season helps decompose soil organic matter more effectively across growing seasons liu et al 2009 for the grass straw mulching a significant increase on soc was recorded in both growing season revealing that returning crop residue to soil played an increasingly positive effect on soil carbon level rasmussen et al 1998 as a result of changes in soc and snp c n ratio was also generally affected by either mulching patterns fig 5e or fertilization rates fig 5f compared to rfb and rf rfs produced a insignificantly greater c n ratio in 2012 growing season while a significant higher c n value when it come to the end of 2012 fallow stage overall rfb maintained the lowest level of c n ratio across both years although increased fertilization application did not significantly affect c n ratios during both growing seasons a significant increase in c n value was found under f0 at the end of both fallow seasons compared to f1 and f2 soil c n ratio is another sensitive sign of soil nitrogen mineralization capacity high c n ratio may slow down the decomposition rates of organic matter and organic nitrogen by limiting soil microbial activities whereas lowered soil c n ratio could accelerate the process of microbial decomposition regarding organic matter and nitrogen our study indicated that by the end of each growing season c n ratio declined rapidly in plastic mulching treatments indicating an accelerated mineralization of soil organic n which usually resulted from improved water thermal balance 3 4 grain yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency evapotranspiration et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which was strongly correlated with mulching patterns and fertilization rates as indicated in fig 6 compared to rf rfb and rfs led to a lower et in early growing stages mainly due to significant retardation on soil evaporation by mulching materials fig 6a when it turned to vegetative stages especially during 29th 56th days after sowing however rfb and rfs produced a greater et than rf this was because plant in mulched plots obtained better growth status and accordingly consumed more soil water increased fertilization further enhanced et at same period fig 6b consequently water use efficiency wue was significantly affected by mulching patterns while not by fertilization rates wue in rfb and rfs was increased across both seasons by 63 8 and 35 9 compared to rf respectively table 2 grain yield was strongly influenced by mulching patterns and fertilization rates but the effects differed from growing seasons table 2 in 2012 grain yield was generally increased by 51 7 and 20 7 in rfb and rfs in comparison with rf the yield was further improved by compound fertilizer application with an increase of 26 3 in f2 and 12 0 in f1 relative to f0 in 2013 grain yield was significantly affected by mulching patterns but not by fertilization rates irrespective of fertilization grain yields in rfb and rfs were 75 0 and 34 3 higher than that in rf the optimization in major yield related components to a large extent accounted for the enhancements in grain yield by either plastic sheet or grass straw mulching in both seasons compared to rf kernel number per ear kernel weight per ear and 100 grain weight were significantly increased averaged over 3 fertilization rates by 24 6 and 10 0 66 7 and 27 9 24 6 and 11 5 for rfb and rfs across both seasons meanwhile kernel abortion in rfb and rfs was 35 1 and 17 1 lower than that in rf respectively besides the runoff intercept by rfms mulching soil with black film and grass straw reduce soil evaporation and provide a better water base for crop transpiration li et al 2008 wang et al 2011 evapotranspiration et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and the isotope measurements demonstrate that the transpiration is the larger component of et at field scale jasechko et al 2013 our study indicated that the et under rfb and rfs was significantly lower at early growth stages compared to no mulching due mainly to the suppression effect on soil evaporation by film and straw with crop development both mulched treatments were able to produce a greater et by virtue of adequate water storage accumulated at early stages these results were in good agreement of previous studies conducted for alfalfa jia et al 2006 potato zhao et al 2014 and wheat hu et al 2012 in dryland farming system in northwest china and south korea based on the theoretical formula wue was jointly driven by crop yield output and estimated et value throughout growing season at field scale in present study wues under rfb and rfs were increased across both seasons by 63 8 and 35 9 compared to rf respectively decreased et along with increased grain yield can be deemed as direct evidences for improved wues under both treatments as discussed above indirectly however the mechanisms responsible for the differential wue among the treatments are also attributable to improved soil water availability fertilizer use efficiency and reproductive success which are critical contributors for crop development and yield formation physiologically the increased crop yield under rfm system is primarily attributable to three aspects in first differences in grain yield in most cases can be attributed to differences in synchronization of plant growth with rainwater supply in dryland farming system of semiarid eap barron et al 2003 high variability in rainfall occurrence and amounts together with high evaporative demand frequently create low soil water availability and inadequate growth however the shape of alternating ridges and furrows increases rainfall collection in rainy season and prevents water loss through surface runoff moreover mulching soil with straw and film sheet directly inhibits water evaporation from the soil surface promotes the upward flow of soil water by vapor transfer and eventually enhances the topsoil water content especially during critical stages of crop growth secondly the declined temperatures due to straw and black film mulching not only reduce the evaporation but also keep on crops thriving during early developmental stages under high temperatures the cooling effect with rfm system is extremely crucial for maize production in the equatorial regions of eap where reproductive development and yield formation are usually compromised by failure of maize seedling establishment and biomass accumulation at vegetative stages lastly improved water and thermal conditions under rfm system increase fertilizer use efficiency and nutrient availability gan et al 2013 our data also revealed that rfm system especially using film mulching together with a least fertilization application could achieved an comparable yield output when compared to the high fertilizer rate 3 5 economic benefit for both rfb and rfs labor inputs were increased averaged to two growing seasons by 72 3 and 22 1 us due to extra labor costs in film and grass straw mulching fig 7 also an additional input with 194 8 us was needed for rfb to purchase the plastic sheet increased fertilization brought about higher input values mainly owing to fertilizer costs 121 0 and 72 6 us higher in f2 and f1 as compared with f0 respectively as a result total input in rfb and rfs was 91 0 and 7 5 higher than that in rfs when averaged to three fertilizer treatments independent of mulching patterns f2 and f1 produced 37 2 and 22 3 higher input value compared to f0 on the other hand the improvements in soil hydro thermal status and fertility due to mulching and fertilization substantially enhanced grain yield and hence economic output across both seasons total output value was averagely increased by 63 3 and 27 5 in rfb and rfs compared to rf f2 and f1 also increased total output value regardless of mulching by 27 1 and 14 1 respectively consequently net economic income was significantly improved by either mulching patterns or fertilization application in two growing seasons despite all the above a highest ratio of output to input 4 6 in 2012 and 3 7 in 2013 growing seasons was consistently achieved by the technique combination of rfs and f0 in both experimental seasons the implementation of effective and successful dryland farming strategies that ensure food security represents one of the most crucial issues in semiarid eap small household farmers in eap who are to a large extent both poor and vulnerable are eager to obtain cheap but efficient rainfed farming technology to produce more food to improve livelihood in our study grain yield and net revenue under rfms were significantly improved in both growing seasons 4 conclusion to introduce low cost but high yielding rainfed farming technology is critical in semiarid east african plateau eap where rainwater harvesting use efficiency remains at long term low level in this study an innovative rainfed farming technology rfms ridge furrow mulching system was firstly introduced to eap and its environmental and economic benefits were systemically evaluated at field scale over two growing seasons it suggested that the rfms played a critical role in significantly improving soil water storage field evapotranspiration soil thermal balance soil organic carbon and yield components which led to a great increase in grain yield per unit area and water use efficiency in dryland maize more importantly the farming practice of rfms can produce higher economic ratio of output to input additionally fertilization treatments further improved yield components grain yields and water use efficiencies on the basis of sole rfms treatments in summary innovative ridge furrow mulching system might be a promising technology strategy to tackle a series of environmental issues as rainfall harvesting water retention water soil erosion and eventually promote rainfed maize productivity and economic benefit in sloping field of semiarid eap considering the best technology strategy in relation to environmental friendliness and economic sustainability we therefore recommended that under rfms the alternation use of black film and grass straw mulching together with a least fertilization application may provide an advanced option to successfully confront the gathering environmental threats in dryland agriculture system of eap acknowledgements this research was funded by international cooperation program of ministry of science and technology of china 2015dfg31840 and 2014dfg32090

11417,to explore low cost high yielding and environment friendly rainfed farming technology is critical for sustainable agricultural development in semiarid east african plateau eap an innovative ridge furrow mulching system rfms was first introduced to eap with a two year field experiment using maize cultivar kdvi in a typical semiarid site of kenya from 2012 to 2013 nine treatments were designed including ridge furrow cultivation with black plastic mulching rfb straw mulching rfs and without mulching rf under high 375 kg ha 1 conventional 225 kg ha 1 and zero fertilization rates we found rfb and rfs significantly increased soil water storage 0 40 cm by 10 2 and 4 8 while lowered evapotranspiration rate and improved thermal status compared to rf across two growing seasons importantly rfb and rfs increased soil organic carbon and c n ratio soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen by 7 8 and 4 9 7 2 and 5 1 respectively following two growing seasons of farming practice as expected grain yield and water use efficiency wue were averagely increased by 63 3 and 63 8 27 5 and 35 9 in rfb and rfs than those of rf respectively additionally net income and economic output to input ratio were significantly greater in rfb and rfs than those of rf on the other hand conventional fertilization rate achieved similar grain yield and wue as high fertilization did considering environmental and economic benefits the rfms farming system with conventional fertilization may act as a promising option to upgrade local dryland agricultural system in eap keywords rainfed farming soil quality economic benefit maize east african plateau 1 introduction in semiarid east african plateau eap increasing land degradation and population growth has received extensive concerns over last decades particularly in the semiarid rainfed agricultural areas conway and toenniessen 2003 soil conservation and rainwater collection are two major issues affecting land degradation and food security in this region m√ºller et al 2011 most of rainfall events frequently take place in the form of short duration but high intensity storm which results in serious non productive surface runoff and soil erosion hatibu et al 2003 particularly in the great rift valley of kenya there are a large number of slope farmlands for agricultural production which actually enhance the challenges for rainwater retention and surface runoff management rockstr√∂m 2000 local agricultural productivity universally remains at low level due to inefficient rainwater management pretty et al 2011 historically large area reclamation for agricultural production further aggravated the environmental problems aforementioned brown 1981 therefore to upgrade local rainfed farming technology is crucial for soil and water conservation and ecosystem sustainability in semiarid eap currently only 10 15 rainwater resource is used productively for crop production in eap breman et al 2001 exploring in situ rainwater harvesting technologies rhts is a promising solution for improving rainfall runoff collection and utilization in this region for instance in situ rhts such as terraced fields in ethiopia adgo et al 2013 trench style rainwater storage technique in tanzania makurira et al 2009 half moons style rainwater saving practice in kenya nyangito et al 2008 stone bunds in kenya and uganda ellis jones and tengberg 2000 all displayed substantial advantages to improve rainwater infiltration and utilization via collecting surface runoff during rainy season apart from improving soil water storage in situ rhts can act as a robust approach for smallholders to manage farmland soil and cope with soil erosion and land degradation together with fertilization application getnet and macalister 2012 as expected in situ rhts in eap have been viewed as an effective strategy to reduce the risk of crop failure through improving water availability in fragile soil systems karpouzoglou and barron 2014 and thus provide smallholder farmers with a crucial climate adaptation base for enhancing resilience against dry spells additionally in situ rhts is usually endowed with low cost high efficient and easy operated advantages compared to other micro and macro catchment water collection technologies from perspective of technology adoption in situ rhts are therefore more easily accepted by small farmers in rainfed agricultural region of eap recha et al 2015 despite a few rhts has been so far tested and applied in semiarid eap there is still weaker than expected environmental and economic benefits achieved by these indigenous technologies this was mainly due to the mulching materials used by local farmers such as crop straw gravel and sand did not achieve enough evaporation preventing effects as desired in semiarid eap myburgh 2013 it is estimated that up to 80 of the rainfall falling on rain fed farms has been lost as evaporation before it is used by the plants hatibu et al 2006 therefore the application of in situ rhts combined with effective mulching should be an advanced strategy to renew local dryland farming system in eap ridge furrow mulching system rfms is a soil and water conservation technique which has been used commonly in semiarid and semihumid asian especially in northwest china and south korea arnhold et al 2013 gan et al 2013 as early in 1980s this sort of innovative rfms has been tested and in late 1990s extended to a large area in the semiarid loess plateau china the extensive application of rfms achieved good effectiveness on reducing runoff erosion and surface evaporation over last two decades in china gan et al 2013 mo et al 2013 currently the predominant rainfed cultivation technology is flat planting without any mulching and fertilization is marginally applied in rainfed agricultural areas of eap biazin et al 2012 we hypothesized that the rfms may achieve the same effectiveness in semiarid eap particularly in kenya theoretically the rhts in combination with least fertilization could achieve high yield and high efficiency but economic and environmental benefits need to be evaluated at field scale mo et al 2013 gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014 however it is still unclear how integrated mulching materials and fertilization management would exert the effects under local climatic and soil circumstance in the semiarid eap such as kenya in this study we first introduced rfms to semiarid kenya and investigated if this innovative farming technology could exert agronomic economic and environmental benefits as expected according to our previous observations mulching the soil with straw and black film can decrease topsoil temperature and hence avoid high temperature stress at the late stage of growth mo et al 2013 we tested three different mulching treatments such as black plastic film grass straw and zero mulching at a typical semiarid rainfed site of southeast kenya eap from 2012 to 2013 the objectives were 1 to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of introduced rfms on rainwater collection soil thermal dynamics soil surface evapotranspiration soil quality and its related parameters 2 to investigate the differences in grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits under the rfms and 3 to identify an optimized strategy of the rhts management at field scale in semiarid kenya and other similar areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and general description field experiment was carried out at a semiarid slope 10 farmland of katumani research centre kenya agriculture research institute kari 1 35 s 37 14 e southeast kenya over two growing seasons from 2012 to 2013 the study site is located in eap with an elevation of 1600 m mean annual rainfall of 655 mm and evaporation amount of about 1800 mm as well as mean annual temperature of 19 2 c rainfall pattern is characterized as bimodal curve in two distinct rainy seasons the long rainy reason was from march to july of each year and short rainy season was from october to next january maize is local major staple crop and can be planted in short and long rainy seasons soil type belongs to sandy clay loam and is classified as chromic luvisols kibe et al 1981 maximum soil depth is only 120 cm major physical and chemical properties of farmland soil at 0 30 cm layer are as follows soil organic carbon of 10 1 g kg 1 total soil nitrogen of 0 64 g kg 1 readily available phosphorus concentration of 8 5 mg kg 1 total salinity content of 0 324 g kg 1 with ph 6 0 respectively 2 2 rfms implementation there are two core configurations in rfms including alternative ridge furrow units and the relevant mulching materials the ridge furrow units are used as on field rain water harvesting storage system within the units the ridges are aimed to channelize rainwater into furrows and to minimize surface runoff the furrows are allocated at the junction between two adjacent ridges and used as storing water and sowing crops in practice two adjacent ridges are different from width and height according to local rainfall and thermal conditions the wide but low ridge is generally 0 6 m wide and 0 15 m high and the narrow high one is 0 4 m wide and 0 3 m high respectively considering the convenience of field work the wide low ridges are designed for walking and field operation two sorts of ridges are alternatively assembled and represent the most effective gauge for maize production the ridge furrow farming system is preferably applicable for the farmlands with the slopes ranging from 6 to 12 on the other hand there are different types of materials mulching on the soil surface to reduce evaporation modify soil thermal balance and suppress weeds the materials mainly include plastic film gravel and sand rock fragments crop straw etc in semiarid regions plastic film mulching is viewed as a preferable approach to maximize growth yield and water use efficiency wue in rfms due to its outstanding effects on suppressing evaporation and runoff before rfms implementation some necessary land management such as plowing field breaking up clods and clearing weeds would be performed to facilitate the establishment of ridge furrow configuration based on the predetermined size the ridges and furrows can be set up with a manual machine the ridge furrow system is predominantly oriented perpendicular to the main slope direction of field sites to intercept runoff after the completion of ridges and furrows various mulching materials can be covered by hand immediately in order to reduce soil water evaporation for example plastic sheet is laid out over the plot where two pieces of plastic films are jointed in the midline between wide and narrow ridges and the joint is fixed stably by placing soil on the top of film grass straw can also be applied with a given rate 2 3 experimental design we selected a typical dryland site with the slope angle of about 10 and the slope length of about 50 m in the experimental farm of kari katumani research center a 3 3 farming pattern was conducted using a randomized complete block design the three farming patterns comprised of rfb ridge and furrow with black plastic mulching fig 1 a rfs ridge and furrow with grass straw mulching fig 1b and rf bare ridge and furrow fig 1c the size of ridge furrow unit in each farming pattern was identical detailed information in the schematic diagram fig 1 before the setup of ridges and furrows three different rates of compound fertilizer n p k 1 1 1 were applied including high f2 375 kg ha 1 medium conventional f1 225 kg ha 1 and zero f0 respectively for each predeterminated plot according to local fertilization level in early may and november 2012 ridge furrow units in each plot were built manually perpendicular to the main slope direction of field thereafter plastic film and straw were covered by hand immediately in order to prevent any water evaporation from soil the polyethylene film 0 008 mm thick used in this study was produced by lanzhou green garden corporation of china grass straw was harvested from the meadow nearby then cut by hand into 5 10 cm length and air dried the dried grass straw in all plots was applied manually at the rate of 6 t ha 1 in both growing seasons ultimately a total of 27 plots 3 3 3 were established on the slope land each plot was 5 m long and 5 m wide being surrounded by the ridges to prevent possible surface runoff in the vertical direction along with the field slope after the implementation of rfms and fertilization a local maize hybrid kdvi was sown in the furrows using a hole sowing machine at a planting density of 125 plants plot 1 equal to 50 000 plants ha 1 with spacing of 40 cm inter plant distance along the furrows on 17 may 2012 first growing season and 17 november 2012 second growing season respectively manual weeding was performed in each plot if needed all plants were harvested at early september 2012 and late february 2013 respectively after harvesting all the plastic residues were completely cleared by hand in all plots the lands remained clean to avoid any other influences on soil and water conservation in next growing season 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 temperature and rainfall daily mean air temperature and rainfall data were collected from the katumani centre meteorological station kenya hourly mean soil temperature at 10 cm depth was periodically recorded using an automatic temperature logger microlite u fourier usa which was buried in the central between two plants in the furrows of each plot 2 4 2 soil water storage evapotranspiration and water use efficiency wue soil moisture status was expressed by total soil water storage sws mm which was periodically determined at soil depths of 0 120 cm before sowing soil bulk density was measured for each 20 cm increment average bulk density was 1 48 gcm 3 in soil to a depth of 0 120 cm for each plot soil samples were taken from three random points located in the central between two plants in the furrows using a soil auger 8 cm diameter 20 cm height at each 20 cm increment for each 14 days interval throughout growing season for each sample soil water content gsw was then measured and calculated using the gravimetric method finally soil water storage sws mm was calculated by following equation at the vertical profile of a given point for each plot total soil water storage was evaluated through averaging the values from three sampling points 1 s w s m m g s w œÅ b g c m 3 s d mm where œÅb was soil bulk density and sd referred to as soil depth et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and the isotope measurements demonstrate that the transpiration is the larger component to et the experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions and no irrigation was provided during growing season each plot was surrounded by high ridges to prevent the occurrence of runoff it was noted that local rainfall was generally low and did not cause the underground drainage below the depth of 120 cm we therefore calculated evapotranspiration et mm at field scale using the following formula 2 e t p Œ¥ s w s p mm was total rainfall amount across growing season and Œ¥sws mm was the difference in soil water storage 0 120 cm between the beginning and the end of growing season water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 has different definitions in agronomy and plant physiology in present study wue was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to crop water consumption 3 w u e y e t where y was grain yield kg ha 1 and et mm is evapotranspiration within growing season 2 4 3 parameters related to soil quality in each plot three soil samples at 0 30 cm depth were taken randomly in the central between two plants in the furrows before sowing and after harvesting over two growing seasons fresh soil samples were air dried under room temperature and pressed to pass a 2 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen stn was measured by dry combustion 450 c method using a chns analyzer elementar vario el ele mentar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany soil available phosphorus sap was extracted with 0 5 m nahco3 and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer c n was then calculated as the ratio of soc to stn for each sample 2 4 4 grain yield and components at maturity twelve corn ears in each plot were randomly harvested from the inner rows for the determination on yield components such as ear length ear diameter and 1000 kernel weight at silking six plants grown in inner rows were tagged in each plot and potential kernels per ear were determined by counting the number of spikelet for each ear the aborted kernels per ear were simultaneously quantified the kernel abortion ratio was therefore calculated as the proportion of aborted kernels to potential kernels per ear grain yield was determined by harvesting all the ears from the middle 6 rows equal to 15 m 2 of plants the harvested ears were shelled manually and the grain was air dried for the determination on yield per unit area 2 4 5 economic benefit evaluation economic benefit was calculated via counting the input values briefly consisted of labor input material expenditure such as plastic film seeds and fertilizer costs and output value economic yield such as grain yield and forage in various treatments thereafter net income can be quantified by calculating the difference between output and input values finally the ratio of total output to total input was calculated to assess the economic effectiveness generated from each farming technology in our study 2 5 data analysis the analysis of variances anova was performed on all the data across two growing seasons the differences of mean values between treatments were compared by least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of temperature and rainfall amount under rfm system historical trends and seasonal characteristics of temperatures and rainfall patterns were presented in fig 2 daily air temperature ranged from 14 7 to 21 5 c with an average value of 16 4 c in 2012 growing season indicating a relatively cool season in 2013 growing season it was increased to 20 9 c ranging from 18 5 to 23 8 c fig 2 considering the mean value of past 10 years during the corresponding period mean daily temperature was 0 6 and 0 5 c higher in 2012 and 2013 respectively as for rainfall pattern 2012 growing season had less rainfall amount with a high variability 18 4 i e equivalent of 29 9 mm lower than historic average value 192 3 mm critically more than 66 1 rainfall occurred at seedling stage of maize which to some extent help early vegetative growth and promoted the construction of seedling architecture while only 23 9 rainfall was distributed in late growth stage maize plant still can resist drought stress and complete the reproductive growth in virtue of basal biomass established in early stage in contrast rainfall distribution was relatively well proportioned in 2013 growing season while total rainfall amount within growing season was 181 7 mm also obviously lower than historical mean value of 200 4 mm however the rainfall amount at early stage was obviously lower in 2013 than that of 2012 implying that early vegetative growth was worse in 2013 than 2012 additionally the rainfall events with less than 5 mm accounted for 50 0 and 57 7 of total rainfall frequency in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 conventionally less than 5 mm rainfall was viewed as ineffective rainfall event which was merely 6 5 and 11 9 of total in season rainfall in 2012 and 2013 season respectively on the contrary the frequency of more than 20 mm events reached up to 28 6 and 15 4 of total rainfall times which contributed up to 77 0 and 44 7 of total rainfall amount within growing season in 2012 and 2013 respectively clearly in semiarid agricultural ecosystem of eap the total amount of rainfall is composed primarily of sporadic heavy rainfall events with concomitant irregular distribution during crop growing season this could pose very high risk for increased incidence of surface runoff and hence added challenge for collection utilization of rainwater at field scale 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of soil hydro thermal status both mulching materials and fertilization rates to most extent affected the dynamics of soil water storage within 0 120 cm soil profile during experimental seasons while the magnitudes varied with growth stages and soil depths fig 3 independent of fertilization levels rfb consistently produced the highest soil water storage within 0 40 cm profile topsoil fig 3a revealing a striking capacity to collect surface runoff and retain rainwater to soil for the water storage in subsoil 41 80 cm rfb led to a significant increase at early growth stages but a significant decline during late growth periods fig 3b there were no detectable differences between rfs and rf across growing seasons deepsoil 81 120 water storage in rfb was significant lower than these in rfs and rf at late growth stages fig 3c as a whole rfb obtained significantly higher soil water storage within 0 120 cm profile at early growth stages fig 3d irrespective of mulching treatments fertilization rates did not significantly affect the changes in topsoil and deepsoil water storage in most cases fig 3e and g however the dynamics of subsoil water condition clearly indicated a significant decrease for both f2 and f1 especially during late growth periods fig 3f this partially supported the point that maize plant obtained better growth status due to increased fertilize application and accordingly consumed more soil water in semiarid rainfed agricultural area of eap such as kenya intensive non productive water loss is widely recognized as major driving factor causing land degradation gachene et al 1997 heavy but hurry rainfall events would increase the incidence of surface runoff particularly in slope land gachene et al 1997 in this area although a total rainfall within growing in theory is not too scarce to threaten crop development dry spell occurrences between and during seasons often negatively impact on crop yields and soil fertility mainly due to significant insufficiency on rainfall harvesting and utilization biazin et al 2012 the rfms has been proved to be effective as an in situ rainwater harvesting technology to increase rainwater storage and infiltration in most semiarid regions of asia arnhold et al 2013 ren et al 2010 in our study site we also found that both rft and rfs help to significantly increase soil moisture in top and sub soil layers and prolong the water availability in early developmental stages effectively the rfms act as a measure to mitigate the impacts of dry spells on the other hand under conventional flatting cultivation farmland located at steep slopes usually suffer higher erosion rates compared to plain field pimentel et al 1995 as for our introduced ridge furrow mulching approach no detectable surface erosion was occurred in each sloping plot during both growing seasons due mainly to the fact that the setup of ridges could intercept the runoff from different rainfall events during growing season and the furrows provided a place for water storage through direct penetration in additional mulching the soil with various materials especially the plastic sheet provided a reliable physical barriers to prevent the washing of rainfall to bared soils in general no detectable changes in topsoil 10 cm depth temperature were recorded among fertilization treatments and instead mulching materials significantly altered top temperature in both seasons in 2012 rfs consistently maintained the lowest soil temperature 0 44 c lower than rf across growing season fig 4 a soil temperature was significantly increased under rfb at seedling and vegetative stages but a clear reduction during reproductive period diurnal changes in average soil temperature indicated that the warming effects of rfb at early and mid growth stages were mainly resulted from elevated night temperatures while cooling effects of rfb at late growth stages ultimately rely on decreased daytime temperatures similarly rfs led to the lowest soil temperature 1 63 c lower than rf throughout 2013 growing season fig 4b rfb significantly increased soil temperature by 1 25 c at seedling stage but reduced by 0 36 c at vegetative stage in semiarid agricultural ecosystem of eap heat stress occurred at late stages of crop development often bring about unacceptable economic losses and climate associated environmental issues the cooling effects of straw black polyethylene film mulching may mitigate any adverse consequences to a great extent as another environmental threat to dryland agriculture system in eap heat stress frequently took place in most time of growing season which played a negative role in yield formation and farmer s livelihood cairns et al 2013 it is widely acknowledged that mulching the soil surface with different materials modify soil thermal balance and thus determine crop development and yield performance lal 1978 in our technology system two different materials were applied to investigate the changes on soil thermal dynamic throughout two growing seasons we noticed that grass straw produced a most obvious temperature decrease compared to non mulched treatment followed by black film ai et al 2005 also observed that the coverage with black film as blocking the passage of most solar radiation clearly reduced soil temperature compared to the unmulched treatments as a whole in the early growing season both black film and grass straw could lead to a significant lower soil temperature compared to un mulched plots while the difference tended to be smaller in late growing season being probably attributable to canopy closure that intercepted the majority of solar energy and thus minimized any effect from mulches moreno and moreno 2008 in semiarid eap drought and high temperature often occur simultaneously during early maize growing season hatibu et al 2006 so far a large majority of traditional in situ rhts designed only to address the single environmental stress have exhibited a declined tendency of technology extension due mainly to the insignificant improvements on seedling establishment and hence yield performance rollins et al 2013 thus novel design on in situ rhts aiming to improve crop development during early stages should take into full consideration the combined effect of both drought and heat stresses in our system along with the significant increase in soil moisture through improving rainwater harvesting by ridge furrow configuration and reducing evaporation with soil mulching soil temperatures were lowered clearly by the coverage of both straw and black film to a more reasonable range for early maize development compared to these traditional techniques such as terraced fields trench style rainwater storage technique and stone bunds solely focusing on the issue of rainwater collection the biggest advantage of our novel system is the improvement of coordination between water availability and thermal balance which may provide better base for final yield output 3 3 soil nutrients in general soc within each growing season showed an obvious decreasing tendency in mulching treatments over two growing seasons except for rf in 2013 greater decline of soc was observed in rfb than rfs fig 5 a averaged to both seasons the decreasing magnitudes in in season soc were 0 75 and 0 55 g kg 1 for rfb and rfs respectively oppositely for both rrb and rfs soc tended to increase during fallow seasons but more so for rfs 0 55 g kg 1 compared to rfb 0 40 g kg 1 regardless of mulching treatments increased fertilization application suppressed the decline of soc contents in first growing season subsequently promoted the soc increase during second growing season across both seasons soc in f2 was 0 36 and 0 35 g kg 1 higher than that in f1 and f0 respectively fig 5b on the other hand stn showed a steady decrease in three mulching treatments as the growing season progresses in both years fig 5c in most cases however there were no significant differences in stn contents between treatments compared to the respective starting basal values of stn i e stn contents at sowing stage in 2012 in each treatment a clear decline in stn 0 06 0 04 and 0 09 g kg 1 for rfb rfs and rf respectively was detected at the end of fallow stage in 2013 independent of mulching patterns increased fertilization level achieved greater stn contents in both growing and fallow seasons fig 5d in comparison with f0 f2 and f1 significantly increased stn contents by 12 7 and 9 8 across both years additionally both mulching and fertilization had an insignificant effect on sap at most of developmental stages fig 5g and h but an overall increasing tread was observed over the whole study period obviously fertilization induced improvements in soil quality mainly including soc and stn could be a positive measure to relieve the soil erosion caused by local serious surface runoff in semiarid eap soc plays a critical role in maintaining soil carbon pool and boost soil restoration for fragile dryland agriculture system especially in semiarid eap where soil fertility depletion and loss has been described as one of the most serious environmental problem and hence the most important constraint to food security bationo et al 2007 in our study the soc content displayed rapidly decline within growing season as a result of plastic mulching this was due to the fact that under plastic mulching condition enhanced microbial biomass during growing season helps decompose soil organic matter more effectively across growing seasons liu et al 2009 for the grass straw mulching a significant increase on soc was recorded in both growing season revealing that returning crop residue to soil played an increasingly positive effect on soil carbon level rasmussen et al 1998 as a result of changes in soc and snp c n ratio was also generally affected by either mulching patterns fig 5e or fertilization rates fig 5f compared to rfb and rf rfs produced a insignificantly greater c n ratio in 2012 growing season while a significant higher c n value when it come to the end of 2012 fallow stage overall rfb maintained the lowest level of c n ratio across both years although increased fertilization application did not significantly affect c n ratios during both growing seasons a significant increase in c n value was found under f0 at the end of both fallow seasons compared to f1 and f2 soil c n ratio is another sensitive sign of soil nitrogen mineralization capacity high c n ratio may slow down the decomposition rates of organic matter and organic nitrogen by limiting soil microbial activities whereas lowered soil c n ratio could accelerate the process of microbial decomposition regarding organic matter and nitrogen our study indicated that by the end of each growing season c n ratio declined rapidly in plastic mulching treatments indicating an accelerated mineralization of soil organic n which usually resulted from improved water thermal balance 3 4 grain yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency evapotranspiration et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which was strongly correlated with mulching patterns and fertilization rates as indicated in fig 6 compared to rf rfb and rfs led to a lower et in early growing stages mainly due to significant retardation on soil evaporation by mulching materials fig 6a when it turned to vegetative stages especially during 29th 56th days after sowing however rfb and rfs produced a greater et than rf this was because plant in mulched plots obtained better growth status and accordingly consumed more soil water increased fertilization further enhanced et at same period fig 6b consequently water use efficiency wue was significantly affected by mulching patterns while not by fertilization rates wue in rfb and rfs was increased across both seasons by 63 8 and 35 9 compared to rf respectively table 2 grain yield was strongly influenced by mulching patterns and fertilization rates but the effects differed from growing seasons table 2 in 2012 grain yield was generally increased by 51 7 and 20 7 in rfb and rfs in comparison with rf the yield was further improved by compound fertilizer application with an increase of 26 3 in f2 and 12 0 in f1 relative to f0 in 2013 grain yield was significantly affected by mulching patterns but not by fertilization rates irrespective of fertilization grain yields in rfb and rfs were 75 0 and 34 3 higher than that in rf the optimization in major yield related components to a large extent accounted for the enhancements in grain yield by either plastic sheet or grass straw mulching in both seasons compared to rf kernel number per ear kernel weight per ear and 100 grain weight were significantly increased averaged over 3 fertilization rates by 24 6 and 10 0 66 7 and 27 9 24 6 and 11 5 for rfb and rfs across both seasons meanwhile kernel abortion in rfb and rfs was 35 1 and 17 1 lower than that in rf respectively besides the runoff intercept by rfms mulching soil with black film and grass straw reduce soil evaporation and provide a better water base for crop transpiration li et al 2008 wang et al 2011 evapotranspiration et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and the isotope measurements demonstrate that the transpiration is the larger component of et at field scale jasechko et al 2013 our study indicated that the et under rfb and rfs was significantly lower at early growth stages compared to no mulching due mainly to the suppression effect on soil evaporation by film and straw with crop development both mulched treatments were able to produce a greater et by virtue of adequate water storage accumulated at early stages these results were in good agreement of previous studies conducted for alfalfa jia et al 2006 potato zhao et al 2014 and wheat hu et al 2012 in dryland farming system in northwest china and south korea based on the theoretical formula wue was jointly driven by crop yield output and estimated et value throughout growing season at field scale in present study wues under rfb and rfs were increased across both seasons by 63 8 and 35 9 compared to rf respectively decreased et along with increased grain yield can be deemed as direct evidences for improved wues under both treatments as discussed above indirectly however the mechanisms responsible for the differential wue among the treatments are also attributable to improved soil water availability fertilizer use efficiency and reproductive success which are critical contributors for crop development and yield formation physiologically the increased crop yield under rfm system is primarily attributable to three aspects in first differences in grain yield in most cases can be attributed to differences in synchronization of plant growth with rainwater supply in dryland farming system of semiarid eap barron et al 2003 high variability in rainfall occurrence and amounts together with high evaporative demand frequently create low soil water availability and inadequate growth however the shape of alternating ridges and furrows increases rainfall collection in rainy season and prevents water loss through surface runoff moreover mulching soil with straw and film sheet directly inhibits water evaporation from the soil surface promotes the upward flow of soil water by vapor transfer and eventually enhances the topsoil water content especially during critical stages of crop growth secondly the declined temperatures due to straw and black film mulching not only reduce the evaporation but also keep on crops thriving during early developmental stages under high temperatures the cooling effect with rfm system is extremely crucial for maize production in the equatorial regions of eap where reproductive development and yield formation are usually compromised by failure of maize seedling establishment and biomass accumulation at vegetative stages lastly improved water and thermal conditions under rfm system increase fertilizer use efficiency and nutrient availability gan et al 2013 our data also revealed that rfm system especially using film mulching together with a least fertilization application could achieved an comparable yield output when compared to the high fertilizer rate 3 5 economic benefit for both rfb and rfs labor inputs were increased averaged to two growing seasons by 72 3 and 22 1 us due to extra labor costs in film and grass straw mulching fig 7 also an additional input with 194 8 us was needed for rfb to purchase the plastic sheet increased fertilization brought about higher input values mainly owing to fertilizer costs 121 0 and 72 6 us higher in f2 and f1 as compared with f0 respectively as a result total input in rfb and rfs was 91 0 and 7 5 higher than that in rfs when averaged to three fertilizer treatments independent of mulching patterns f2 and f1 produced 37 2 and 22 3 higher input value compared to f0 on the other hand the improvements in soil hydro thermal status and fertility due to mulching and fertilization substantially enhanced grain yield and hence economic output across both seasons total output value was averagely increased by 63 3 and 27 5 in rfb and rfs compared to rf f2 and f1 also increased total output value regardless of mulching by 27 1 and 14 1 respectively consequently net economic income was significantly improved by either mulching patterns or fertilization application in two growing seasons despite all the above a highest ratio of output to input 4 6 in 2012 and 3 7 in 2013 growing seasons was consistently achieved by the technique combination of rfs and f0 in both experimental seasons the implementation of effective and successful dryland farming strategies that ensure food security represents one of the most crucial issues in semiarid eap small household farmers in eap who are to a large extent both poor and vulnerable are eager to obtain cheap but efficient rainfed farming technology to produce more food to improve livelihood in our study grain yield and net revenue under rfms were significantly improved in both growing seasons 4 conclusion to introduce low cost but high yielding rainfed farming technology is critical in semiarid east african plateau eap where rainwater harvesting use efficiency remains at long term low level in this study an innovative rainfed farming technology rfms ridge furrow mulching system was firstly introduced to eap and its environmental and economic benefits were systemically evaluated at field scale over two growing seasons it suggested that the rfms played a critical role in significantly improving soil water storage field evapotranspiration soil thermal balance soil organic carbon and yield components which led to a great increase in grain yield per unit area and water use efficiency in dryland maize more importantly the farming practice of rfms can produce higher economic ratio of output to input additionally fertilization treatments further improved yield components grain yields and water use efficiencies on the basis of sole rfms treatments in summary innovative ridge furrow mulching system might be a promising technology strategy to tackle a series of environmental issues as rainfall harvesting water retention water soil erosion and eventually promote rainfed maize productivity and economic benefit in sloping field of semiarid eap considering the best technology strategy in relation to environmental friendliness and economic sustainability we therefore recommended that under rfms the alternation use of black film and grass straw mulching together with a least fertilization application may provide an advanced option to successfully confront the gathering environmental threats in dryland agriculture system of eap acknowledgements this research was funded by international cooperation program of ministry of science and technology of china 2015dfg31840 and 2014dfg32090

11418,we examine the characteristics of water user associations wuas that affect the success of collective action for irrigation management using random effects ordered probit models and a large panel dataset from 104 523 rural communities the results of the econometric analysis verify the hypotheses in the existing empirical literature and confirm the robustness of the theory of collective action in the context of irrigation management our results show that collective action for irrigation management depends on the distance from the market area of paddy field share of non farmers and elderly farmers share of paddy field and social capital we also find that collective action has an inverted u shaped relationship with the number of farm households and diversity in farmers landholdings and a u shaped relationship with the diversity of a community s farmers the results suggest that as the characteristics of irrigation systems and user groups can change little in the short run policies aimed at suppressing deteriorating collective action for irrigation management need to enhance social ties in a community thereby promoting community level social capital keywords collective action irrigation management system water user association japan 1 introduction irrigation systems are typical of common pool resources that are characterized by rivalry of consumption and difficulty of exclusion under circumstances where it is hard to exclude specific users from irrigation systems or where many people can openly access irrigation systems open access irrigation systems would be overexploited and depleted if not properly administered this is a collective action problem as described by ostrom 2010 if each individual in an interdependent situation selects strategies e g labor contribution for irrigation management based on a calculus that maximizes their own short term benefits individuals will take actions that generate lower joint outcomes e g the state of the irrigation canal as a result of everyone s effort than could have otherwise been achieved therefore it is essential for irrigation management to perform collective actions based on farmers collective efforts or cooperation in rural communities or water user associations wuas while it is reported in the literature that collective action for irrigation management faces difficulties in organizing resource users monitoring and enforcing the rules a number of case studies highlight the success of collective actions based on farmers collective efforts or cooperation examples from developing countries include joint maintenance of a canal under customary rules and the establishment of shared norms in rural communities or water user associations wuas to restrict open access see for example wade 1989 ostrom 1990 tang 1992 bardhan 1993 for earlier studies and bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 ricks 2016 for recent works the literature discusses factors facilitating or impeding collective action for the management of irrigation systems and describes such systems in detail ostrom 1990 and agrawal 2001 identified nearly 40 essential factors that are categorized into four kinds user group characteristics resource system characteristics different governance mechanisms and external environment it is however not simple to identify those factors just through case studies to reinforce the findings in individual case studies quantitative studies focusing on the irrigation systems in different countries also found factors in the four classifications e g bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 for india dayton johnson 2000 for mexico fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 for the philippines gorton et al 2009 for macedonia nakano and otsuka 2011 for uganda ito 2012 and wang et al 2016 for china takeda 2015 for japan and nagrah et al 2016 for pakistan in this study we examine the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management in japan collective action problems exist not only in developing countries but also in developed countries in particular there is a collective action problem that is unique to developed countries focusing on developed countries this study contributes to expanding previous research centered on developing countries we focus on irrigation systems in japan which is facing its own unique set of collective action problems the main crop grown in japan is rice for which irrigation is of particular importance gravity irrigation systems are the most commonly used mechanism in japan due to the steep geographical conditions the system is usually managed by rural communities the smallest units of regional society in rural villages which in many cases are simultaneously functioning as wuas conventionally both farmers and non farmers in a rural community have participated in collective action for irrigation management because irrigation canals provide water for both rice production and domestic use therefore it is difficult to overcome collective action problems because both farmers and non farmers are beneficiaries of irrigation which causes free riding behavior from both sides however as described by aoki 2001 mutual monitoring and enforcement of rules with strict penalties have worked well to prevent free riding from happening within rural communities as a result collective action has been carried out based on the cooperative efforts of farmers and non farmers in rural communities however many rural communities have been suffering from rapid depopulation population aging and urbanization since world war ii all of which are thought to have negative impacts on collective irrigation management therefore numerous rural communities have experienced a significant change in the status of collective action given this background we attempt to capture the relationships between the level of collective action and the change in economic and socio demographic conditions the outcomes of this study will provide meaningful implications for developing countries which will experience similar changes in rural communities with their economic growth another contribution to previous research is identification of some of the factors that influence collective action for irrigation management by using a large panel dataset at the wua level in previous literature there has been no solid consensus about the direction size and significance of their impact on irrigation management therefore the robustness of the previous results needs to be examined to identify the characteristics of wuas that have proved successful in managing local irrigation systems the lack of consensus among previous studies can be largely attributed to methodological issues such as the cost and difficulty of collecting data araral 2009 this study aims to address these issues first most empirical studies on irrigation management rely on cross sectional data due to the difficulty of collecting information over the long term studies based on cross sectional data cannot control for time invariant unobserved characteristics of wuas and irrigation systems such as differences in geographical conditions and history therefore the use of cross sectional data potentially suffers from an omitted variables bias because some unobserved factors might affect irrigation arrangements in specific places wang et al 2016 this is one of the causes inducing disagreement among researchers on the effect of some factors on the likelihood of collective action in irrigation management analyses based on panel data may help address this issue by controlling for unobservable characteristics of irrigation systems and wuas this study provides an opportunity to test the robustness of findings regarding the characteristics of wuas that proved successful in managing irrigation systems by using a large panel dataset n 209 046 2 periods at the wua level second most empirical studies on irrigation management do not specify or incorrectly define the nature of the collective action problem poteete and ostrom 2004 araral 2009 for instance most studies use a subjective indicator measured by good or bad to evaluate the outcome or status of successful collective action such as the level of activity of wuas or the maintenance level of irrigation channels nakano and otsuka 2011 indicators based on subjective appraisal may not precisely measure the exact levels of collective action in irrigation management in this study we use an objective indicator of irrigation management systems to denote different levels of collective action for irrigation management this indicator is observable and provides objective information on the status of collective action third many empirical studies censor a particular group of observations such as inactive irrigation associations from the data set araral 2009 this type of exclusion would lead to a censoring bias in the estimations of the parameters of interest meinzen dick 2007 poteete and ostrom 2008 to circumvent a possible censoring bias wuas that do not continue or control irrigation management are also included in the sample the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of farmer managed irrigation systems in japan section 3 reviews the empirical studies on farmers collective action in irrigation management to refine the fundamental indicators of irrigation management systems the data and hypotheses are described in section 4 while section 5 discusses the proposed methodology and empirical results the last section summarizes the main findings and provides our concluding remarks 2 irrigation systems in japan cultivation of rice using gravity irrigation is the standard in japan historically rural communities have been the wuas responsible for the operation and maintenance o m of irrigation facilities after world war ii both national and local governments began constructing large scale irrigation facilities such as dams headworks and main canals their management was transferred from the national and local governments to land improvement districts lids which are organizations established in 1949 to undertake the construction improvement and management of irrigation drainage facilities and land improvement projects including farmland consolidation within the boundaries of the district tanaka and sato 2003 at the same time the rights of irrigation management were transferred to lids from each rural community however the japanese government has endorsed a common rule for water use and assigned o m to rural communities at the level of main and branch canals the o m of irrigation except for large scale irrigation facilities has actually been implemented by rural communities to assure that the water from the river is stably delivered to the paddy field area through irrigation canals and efficiently allocated to various areas rural communities clean weed and repair the main and branch canals through meetings held by rural community members a few times a year rural community members decide how and when those activities are implemented during the meetings participants in those activities are determined through discussion or voting traditionally all households farm and non farm in the rural community were required to participate in such activities the reason is that most households within a rural community were farmers but even non farmers used water from irrigation canals for their daily life however the participation rules for those activities have changed significantly over the last 50 years due to changes in the circumstances surrounding rural communities e g rapid depopulation aging of farmers and urbanization accompanying the rapid economic growth in japan in particular the number of non farmers and part time farmers increased with urbanization inducing significant heterogeneity among the members of rural communities as a result the involvement of all households of a rural community in irrigation management became more difficult in recent years participation in irrigation management has dynamically changed shifting from participation of all households to the involvement of particular households e g only farm households or lack of management by wuas thus it has become more difficult to overcome the collective action problem due not only to both farmers and non farmers being beneficiaries of irrigation for rice production and domestic use but also to the changes in circumstances surrounding rural communities therefore since 2007 the government has been providing financial support for collective irrigation management carried out by rural communities through measures to conserve and improve land water and the environment to sustainably revitalize irrigation management 3 theory and evidence of collective action in irrigation management in the following sections we briefly review the literature that considers how collective action for irrigation management is affected by the characteristics of irrigation systems and user groups 3 1 characteristics of irrigation systems in this study we assess the impact of the following characteristics of irrigation systems 3 1 1 water scarcity most existing studies stress the importance of water scarcity as a determinant of the cooperation among farmers bardhan 2000 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 araral 2009 and agrawal 2001 suggest the presence of an inverted u shaped relationship between the degree of water scarcity and cooperation for irrigation management this means that the users of irrigation facilities have difficulty managing collective action with other users when water is scarce or extremely abundant user groups have no incentive and no need to collectively manage irrigation systems when water is abundant and conflicts among water users may become so large as to make collective action difficult when water shortage is severe fujiie et al 2005 water scarcity to some degree is ideal for collective action for irrigation management in short this implies that the return to farmers for participating in collective action for irrigation management is higher when water is moderately scarce compared with when water scarcity is severe or minimal hence the incentive for farmers to undertake collective action is greatest in addition araral 2009 found that fully autonomous wuas are better able to deal with the effects of water scarcity on monetary free riding compared with non autonomous wuas 3 1 2 access to the market the distance to the market has been widely recognized as an important factor for successful collective action in the management of common pool resources meinzen dick et al 2002 a site close to the market may lead to an increased opportunity for receiving non farming income and of market activities outside agriculture allowing some farmers to opt out loosens the traditional social ties that bind farmers into mutual dependencies thereby discouraging collective action meinzen dick et al 2002 araral 2009 wang et al 2016 however meinzen dick et al 2002 point out that sites closer to market are likely to be more commercially oriented and therefore have higher payoffs for effective irrigation as a result farmers have incentives to undertake collective action therefore the effects on irrigation management of access to the market are different across studies bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 mattoussi and seabright 2014 3 2 characteristics of user groups we assess the impact of the following characteristics of groups using the irrigation system 3 2 1 size of the group the effect of the number of participants on the sustainability of self governing wuas is ambiguous ostrom 2002 olson 1965 points out that acting collectively is more difficult for large organizations as the number of users increases the individual marginal contribution to irrigation management will decrease while the incentives to free ride on the effort of others increase in addition monitoring costs linked to compliance with rules and transaction costs linked to negotiations to create common rules may be higher in large groups however there may be some positive economies of scale in larger groups particularly in matters of pooling resources appointing guards lobbying with officials and so on bardhan 2000 earlier studies such as tang 1992 and lam 1998 found no relationship between the performance of wuas and the number of users several empirical studies found a negative effect of group size on wuas bardhan 2000 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 ito 2012 mattoussi and seabright 2014 while others found no impact dayton johnson 2000 the lack of consensus in the previous literature may depend on the curvilinear effect of group size on collective action for example in the case of community forest management agrawal and goyal 2001 find a curvilinear relationship between group size and the mobilization of resources to hire guards for shared forest resources 3 2 2 heterogeneity of user groups heterogeneity means that cultural backgrounds asset holdings interests and general norms shared with other group members will differ across users this heterogeneity is a significant variable for irrigation management baland and platteau 1996 ostrom 2002 social and cultural heterogeneity increase the coordination cost of forming and enforcing a common rule among members as a result heterogeneity makes collective action more difficult however if a member of a group has abilities and resources that other members do not have and participants in the user group can cooperate with each other the existence of a community s heterogeneity may help promote cooperation olson 1965 further poteete and ostrom 2004 also suggest that the relationship between heterogeneity and collective action is non linear existing empirical studies show the mixed effects of social and economic heterogeneity on collective action in irrigation management tang 1992 bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 3 2 3 dependence on irrigation systems the extent to which a community depends on irrigation systems is recognized as one of the key factors for success in collective action for irrigation management olson 1965 wade 1987 ostrom 1990 when many farmers depend on the irrigation system it may be easier to invest time and energy to create new institutions araral 2009 which result in maintaining successful collective action 3 2 4 social capital social capital is defined as the shared norms and networks that enable people to act collectively healy and c√¥t√© 2001 it is considered to play a key role in collective action for irrigation management communities with high social capital can reduce the cost of coordination monitoring and enforcement of the rules social capital is a mix of intangible assets and empirical studies have used several variables to proxy for social capital meinzen dick et al 2002 use the number of temples and cooperatives as an indicator of social capital the connections of individuals through temples have a strong influence on the organization of irrigation management the existence of cooperatives introduced by meinzen dick et al 2002 and the age of the resource as in araral 2009 also represent reasonable proxies for social capital however they do not find a statistically significant impact of these variables on collective action for irrigation management using a proxy measure for social capital may result in measurement problems for instance it is not clear whether older groups often used as a proxy measure for social capital have greater shared norms and networks to induce cooperation with other farmers compared with younger groups ideally more reliable and direct measures of social capital should be used 4 data hypotheses and definition of variables 4 1 unit of analysis and data in this study we use community level data obtained from the rural community card world census of agriculture and forestry 2000 these are comprehensive data collected from a survey implemented once every five years by the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff to collect information about agriculture and forests in all rural communities these data report detailed information on 139 176 rural communities in the year 2000 including data on agricultural production and the activities of the rural community such as management of irrigation communal farm roads and facilities since further information on irrigation management is not available before 1990 or after 2000 we use the data from 1990 and 2000 including information on rural communities activities for irrigation management following takahashi 2012 we excluded 5 out of 47 prefectures focusing on the data of 42 prefectures we exclude rural communities in hokkaido and okinawa due to differences in climatic conditions and those in tokyo kanagawa and osaka due to the strong effect of urbanization in these areas in addition we exclude rural communities where no paddy field and irrigation facilities are present therefore the final dataset used in this study covers 104 523 communities in 42 prefectures 4 2 hypotheses and definition of independent variables in this subsection we assess the validity of a set of hypotheses table 1 reports the summary statistics definition of variables and expected sign of the hypotheses 4 2 1 water scarcity the existing empirical literature shows that water scarcity has a curvilinear effect on collective action for irrigation management in short collective action among resource users would be more difficult when water is abundant or extremely scarce moderate water scarcity is ideal for the likelihood of collective action for irrigation management in japan water is abundant in most rural communities except during the season of rice transplantation however there is a variation in rainfall patterns across prefectures and in demand for water across regions we add a prefecture dummy to control for these variations across the prefecture level 4 2 2 access to the market we use the time distance to densely inhabited districts from a community as an indicator of its access to the market densely inhabited districts did mean the urban areas designated based on statistical data by the statistics bureau ministry of internal affairs and communications since the 1960 population census of japan we introduced three distinct dummy variables distance to did more than 1 5 h is equal to 1 if the time distance to a densely inhabited district is more than 1 5 h and 0 otherwise distance to did less than 1 h is equal to 1 if that distance is less than one hour and 0 otherwise while distance to did 1 1 5 h is equal to 1 if the time distance is from 1 to 1 5 h and 0 otherwise 4 2 3 size of group using the irrigation system we use the number of farm households that engage in farming and live in a community as an indicator of the group size of wuas and the area of paddy field in a community as an indicator of the size of wuas as measured by the irrigation service area we include both the number of farm households and its square to capture the possible u shaped relationship between the likelihood of collective action and group size according to the rural community card world census of agriculture and forestry 2000 the number of farm households in a community in our sample varies from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 386 in 2000 the average size of the communities is 25 farm households with an area of paddy field in 2000 of 21 ha 4 2 4 heterogeneity of user groups we create a diversity indicator to measure the community s social and economic heterogeneity diversity among community s farmers captures the degree of social heterogeneity following alesina et al 1999 we construct diversity among community s farmers as follows d i v e r s i t y a m o n g c o m m u n i t y s f a r m e r s 1 i f a r m e r i 2 where farmer i denotes the ratio of farmers i to the total population in the community and i indicates self sufficient farm households full time farm households type 1 part time farmers the income earned from farming is greater than other income and type 2 part time farmers the income earned from activities other than farming is higher respectively if this index is close to one the community comprises various types of farmers if this index is close to zero farmers in the community are homogeneous diversity of farmer s landholdings indicates the degree of economic heterogeneity we use this indicator instead of the distribution of farming income which is not disclosed in the data we construct diversity of landholdings as follows d i v e r s i t y o f l a n d h o l d i n g s 1 i l a n d h o l d i n g s i 2 where landholdings i denotes the ratio of operating farmland i corresponds to the land in ha of the farmer to total farmland in the community and may correspond to less than 1 0 ha 1 0 3 0 ha 3 0 5 0 ha 5 0 10 0 ha 10 0 20 0 ha 20 0 30 0 ha and more than 30 ha we include both these indicators of heterogeneity and their squares to capture the possible u shaped relationship between the likelihood of collective action and heterogeneity in addition we use the ratio of non farm households and the ratio of elderly farmers ratio of the population engaged in farming above 65 years old over the total population of a community to measure heterogeneity as a result of advancing urbanization the number of non farmers in rural communities has increased significantly making it harder to maintain a high level of collective action for irrigation management therefore we use the ratio of non farmers to control for the heterogeneity derived from increasing urbanization moreover communities in rural areas face aging of farmers as much as other areas in the country the empirical results of wang et al 2016 and li et al 2012 in china show negative relationships between the age of farmers and collective action in the commons indicating that an elderly group is less interested in participating in collective irrigation therefore we introduce the ratio of elderly farmers to control for the heterogeneity induced by aging finally we capture several types of heterogeneity social and economic as well as heterogeneity caused by the ratios of non farmers and elderly farmers 4 2 5 dependence on irrigation systems if these resources are usually salient to the livelihoods of users themselves they are more likely to have strong incentives to manage them more efficiently equitably and sustainably araral 2009 we use the ratio of paddy field ratio of the area of paddy field over the total area of farmland in a community as a proxy indicator of the dependence on irrigation the higher the ratio of paddy field within a community the greater the dependence on irrigation which results in maintaining successful collective action 4 2 6 social capital because social capital is intangible existing studies have used various proxy variables to capture it in this study we use age of community or user group fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 number of meetings labonne and chase 2011 and ratio of consolidated farmland as proxies for social capital age of community is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a community was established before 1975 and 0 otherwise ideally we would use the number of years since the establishment of the community as a proxy but this information is not available in our dataset number of meetings refers to the total number of meetings held by farmers in a year higher community ages and more meetings are proportionally related to the accumulation of social capital in communities in addition we introduce the ratio of consolidated farmland to improve labor and land productivity farmland consolidation is often carried out including merging and reshaping small plots of farmland into one large plot these projects are usually based on proposals received from farmers in rural communities if more than two thirds of landowners in the project area agree the project will be implemented by the central or prefectural government as a public project to implement projects consensus is needed among farmers within the community if the social capital in a community is low that community will usually not agree on the implementation of any projects therefore we use the ratio of consolidated farmland as a proxy for social capital 4 2 7 additional variables we include variables of topography to control for the geographic heterogeneity affecting collective action in irrigation management we use dummy variables flatland area urban area and hilly and mountainous area to denote topographical differences we also include indicators of farmland use in rural areas the growing area of abandoned farmland is a key problem in japan indeed according to the latest statistics available from japan s maff abandoned farmland comprises approximately 10 6 396 000 ha of all farmland the maff also has put substantial effort into expanding operation size for commercial farm households through rental of farmland therefore we use the ratio of rented in area and ratio of abandoned farmland to account for farmland use in rural community in addition year dummy is included to control for time effects common to all communities 4 3 measurement of dependent variables using appropriate measures of dependent variables as the outcome or degree of collective action is critical for examining the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management as previously discussed several studies use a subjective or qualitative indicator measured by good or bad to assess the outcome of successful collective action however self reported maintenance efforts inputs from households or the subjective appraisal of maintenance status recalled by interviewees might suffer from exaggeration bias in some circumstances wang et al 2016 in addition these indicators cannot precisely identify the different degrees of collective action for irrigation management therefore a direct measurement is required to denote different levels of collective action for instance ito 2012 proxies for collective action by counting per household labor contribution for irrigation management some studies employ direct measurements such as types of irrigation arrangements wang et al 2016 and the presence of the farmers organizations for irrigation meinzen dick et al 2002 to denote different levels of coordination and cooperation in this study we introduce an observable objective indicator to denote the different levels of collective action for irrigation management e g cutting weeds and removing silt specifically we assign an ordered dummy variable for different types of irrigation management 3 is the highest score and indicates management carried on by all households residing in the community 2 refers to management only performed by farm households 1 indicates management performed by hired hands and 0 denotes non functionality a community with no formal organization for irrigation management collective action is based on users collective effort or cooperation such as joint maintenance of a canal under customary rules and the establishment of shared norms in rural communities or wuas therefore this ranking of different types of irrigation management represents a direct indicator of the level of collective action based on users collective efforts or cooperation the level of collective action for irrigation maintenance carried on by all households is the highest all members of the community are required to participate in the operations and maintenance of the irrigation facilities in japan even non farmers use water from irrigation canals for their daily life such as water for fire prevention domestic water for local residents and use of the irrigation canal for melting and flushing snow in terms of the nature of collective action for irrigation management both farmers and non farmers have a strong incentive to free ride on the efforts of others if non farmers do not participate in collective action they are free riders on the efforts of the farmers collective action this type of irrigation management means both farmers and non farmers cooperate so they do not become free riders on the efforts of others collective action therefore rural communities with an irrigation management system where all beneficiaries of irrigation participate in collective action achieve the highest level of collective action for irrigation management this results in the highest collective effort or cooperation of irrigation users next irrigation management carried on by farm households is characterized by a lower level of collective action due to the exclusion of non farm households these two irrigation management systems are examples of collective action for irrigation management organized by the members of a community in the case of irrigation management carried on by hired hands and non functional irrigation management the collective action of community members is not required the ranking of non functionality a community with no formal organization for o m is the lowest because no collective action for irrigation management is carried out or controlled by a community 4 4 the transition of irrigation management systems we examine the transition of irrigation management systems using the sample described in the previous subsection fig 1 shows the distribution of the different irrigation management systems adopted by rural communities in 1990 and 2000 the number of communities adopting each irrigation management system is 35 695 all households 46 867 farm households 796 hired hands and 21 165 non functionality in 1990 in 2000 the number of communities adopting each irrigation management system is 34 008 all households 50 613 farm households 421 hired hands and 19 481 non functionality between 1990 and 2000 the number of communities adopting irrigation management carried out by farm households increased while the number of communities adopting other irrigation management systems decreased as shown in fig 2 the share of communities adopting an irrigation system managed by all households or farm households is 79 0 all households 34 2 farm households 44 8 in 1990 and 80 9 all households 32 5 farm households 48 4 in 2000 furthermore the share of communities characterized by non functionality is 20 2 in 1990 and 18 6 in 2000 as shown in figs 1 and 2 the choice of irrigation management system by a community seems stable during the period of analysis on the other hand table 2 indicates the transition of irrigation management systems from 1990 to 2000 it is apparent that communities have changed their irrigation management systems over the period of analysis for example looking at communities with irrigation management carried on by all households in 1990 n 35 695 about half of these communities n 18 625 52 2 show the same system of irrigation management in 2000 the remaining communities have changed irrigation management systems farm households hired hands and non functionality 36 0 have changed from an irrigation system managed by all households to one relying on farm households only in 2000 0 5 have changed to a system managed by hired hands and 11 5 have shifted to non functionality furthermore the ratio of communities moving to an irrigation system managed by farm households is the highest 36 0 in the case of communities adopting irrigation systems managed by all households 46 5 by hired hands 42 8 characterized by non functionality irrigation management systems seem to concentrate on management by farm households focusing on communities that maintained the same irrigation management system 52 2 were managed by all households 60 4 by farm households 4 0 by hired hands and 36 2 were characterized by non functionality in 1990 in communities that have not changed irrigation management systems in the period of analysis the ratio of communities adopting an irrigation system managed by farm households is the highest 60 4 overall we can observe the dynamics of the irrigation management systems adopted by a community in addition management only by farm households seems stable compared to other irrigation management systems table 1 shows the changes in the characteristics of communities over the period of analysis we can observe a remarkable shift in the size of the groups numbers of farm households heterogeneity ratio of non farmers and ratio of elderly farmers and social capital number of meetings and ratio of consolidated farmland these changes might influence the shifts observed in the irrigation management systems for example heterogeneity caused by the increase in the ratio of non farm households and aging of farmers might make it difficult to coordinate a collective action that involves non farmers this growing heterogeneity induces a decreasing level of collective action for irrigation management which results in the change from irrigation management systems managed by all households to those relying only on farm households on the other hand communities with irrigation management systems not characterized by collective action hired hands and non functionality have remarkably changed to irrigation management systems characterized by collective action all households and farm households this change implies that the level of collective action has increased the accumulation of social capital through implementing farmland consolidation and increasing the number of meetings as well as a reduction in coordination costs obtained due to the decrease in the number of farmers is likely to facilitate collective action for irrigation management a conventional cross sectional dataset cannot capture such changes in irrigation management systems and the characteristics of wuas therefore we use panel data to capture this transition through an empirical model 5 results and discussion 5 1 estimation models in the empirical model we assess the level of collective action for irrigation management on a categorical scale we use a random effects ordered probit model to empirically test the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management the dependent variable is an ordered variable that indicates the level of collective action for irrigation management the model can estimate the influence of each variable in determining the probability of a rural community selecting an irrigation management system further because we can utilize a panel data set we add random effects to this model to control for unobserved time invariant community characteristics that might be correlated with the level of collective action for irrigation management the model can be written as y i t Œ≤ x i t Œ± i Œµ i t and y i t k i f k k 1 y i t k k k 1 k where y i t is an indicator of the level of collective action for irrigation management and captures the unobservable latent continuous response only the category chosen by community i at each point in time t can be observed x i t is a set of time varying independent variables and Œ≤ is the parameter to be estimated Œ± i represents an individual specific and time invariant random component depending on unobserved heterogeneity the errors Œµ i t have a standard normal distribution with mean equal to Œ± i zero and variance equal to one and are assumed to be independent of Œ±i k is the number of outcomes furthermore we report the results of the ordered probit model with and without random effects considering the impact of both observed and unobserved heterogeneity 5 2 determinants of the level of collective action for irrigation management table 3 presents the results of the ordered probit model with column 1 and without columns 2 4 random effects to address how the effect of the independent variable changes when we add unobserved heterogeneity to the model the estimates from columns 1 4 have the expected signs and are statistically significant except for age of community in columns 3 and 4 most coefficients on the independent variables are larger in columns 2 4 where random effects are added to the specifications running the model without random effects may induce underestimation of the effect of the independent variables on the level of collective action for irrigation management the results in column 2 control for the characteristics of the irrigation systems and those in column 3 control for the characteristics of the user groups in column 4 we add both the characteristics of the irrigation systems and the user groups to confirm the specification of the model the coefficients in columns 2 3 are stable and less likely to suffer from specification problems based on the results reported in column 4 in the next section we discuss the impact of the characteristics of the irrigation systems and user groups a community as a wua on collective action for irrigation management at the wua level 5 2 1 the characteristics of the irrigation systems the coefficient on the distance to the market distance to did is negative and significant showing that a community that is far from the market is characterized by a lower level of collective action for irrigation management this finding is consistent with the results of meinzen dick et al 2002 and wang et al 2016 who use the same indicator for access to the market this may be because there are less profitable commercial opportunities for these communities meinzen dick et al 2002 and returns to irrigated farming decrease in remote areas furthermore a community that is further away from the market may maintain social ties among the members of the community 5 2 2 the characteristics of user groups 1 group size the coefficient on the number of farm households is positive and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is negative and significant at the 1 level these estimated parameters mean that the level of collective action increases as the number of farm households increases up to 106 farm households and decreases after this point this finding on the effect of group size implies that the relationship between group size and level of collective action is associated with an inverted u shaped relationship this result is consistent with the theoretical prediction of agrawal and goyal 2001 who indicate that medium sized groups will be more successful than small and large groups in facilitating collective action for large classes of common pool resources as well as with the empirical findings of ito 2012 however attention should be paid to this interpretation of the inverted u shaped relationship in the case of irrigation management in japan indeed because the average number of farm households in rural communities in japan was 25 in 2000 the level of collective action for irrigation management increases with the number of farm households in most communities in this respect our empirical result is consistent with the empirical findings of takeda 2015 for japan the coefficient on the area of paddy field is negative and significant as the area of paddy field increases the cost of organizing a collective action on a vast territory increases as well fujiie et al 2005 this result is consistent with the findings of case studies for indonesia fujiie et al 2005 and india bardhan 2000 and with the general opinion that collective action is more difficult as the size of the resource increases 2 heterogeneity of user group the coefficient on the diversity of farmer s landholdings is positive and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is negative and significant this inverted u shaped relationship between economic heterogeneity and level of collective action implies that a group characterized by moderate heterogeneity of landholdings will be more successful in enhancing the cooperation level of collective action for irrigation management than groups with extreme heterogeneity of assets or with homogeneous assets the positive effect on collective action up a certain level of heterogeneity is consistent with one of olson s 1965 arguments that the existence of heterogeneity in a community may help promote cooperation if a member of the group has abilities and resources that other members do not have and participants in the user group can cooperate with each other the negative effect on collective action after a certain level of heterogeneity is attributed to an increase in the differences in members benefits from irrigation management this finding is consistent with poteete and ostrom 2004 indicating that the relationship between heterogeneity and collective action is non linear the coefficient on the diversity among community farmers is negative and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is positive and significant social heterogeneity and its levels are associated with a u shaped relationship heterogeneity of social backgrounds makes collective action for irrigation management more difficult as the heterogeneity of farm households increases up to a certain level of social heterogeneity this finding is consistent with the previous literature bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 ito 2012 social and economic heterogeneity have non linear effects on the level of collective action for irrigation management the direction of the effect is different at each level of heterogeneity because the impact of social and economic heterogeneity on the benefit of collective action complements the effect derived from a variety of farm households the coefficients on the ratio of non farmers and ratio of elderly farmers are negative and statistically significant as a result of advancing urbanization an increase in non farmers leads to social heterogeneity among community members making it more difficult to maintain a high level of collective action for irrigation management this finding is in line with the results of existing studies fujiie et al 2005 ito 2012 in a similar way heterogeneity of age structure among farm households induced by aging has a significantly negative impact on collective action consistent with the findings of wang et al 2016 for china general norms shared with older and younger group members may differ across group members making it difficult to organize collective action 3 dependence on irrigation systems the positive coefficient on the ratio of paddy field confirms the hypothesis that a community with a high ratio of paddy field is more likely to achieve a higher level of collective action for irrigation management this implies that these communities have an incentive to agree on collective action requiring higher cooperation because irrigation is essential for their livelihood this finding is consistent with the empirical results of gorton et al 2009 for macedonia and araral 2009 for the philippines 4 social capital the coefficients on the number of meetings and ratio of consolidated farmland are positive and statistically significant as expected these variables are used as indicators of social capital the implementation of consolidated farmland projects induces coordination and transaction costs the accumulation of social capital is crucial in the implementation of consolidated farmland to decrease such costs a community with high social capital is likely to choose a higher level of cooperation for irrigation management collective action in addition holding meetings requires considerable amounts of social capital meetings are expected to increase the likelihood of collective action for irrigation management by strengthening social interactions or traditional social ties 5 3 simulation analysis in this subsection we discuss the relationship between the characteristics of wuas and the probability of adopting different types of irrigation management systems fig 3 the likelihood of choosing an irrigation system managed only by farm households is the highest with respect to all explanatory variables and is stable regarding changes in the characteristics of wuas we argue that this management system is stably selected because irrigation water is essential to farmers who use water from water canals for both farming and daily life compared with non farmers who use water only for daily life this result is consistent with the higher ratio of communities maintaining irrigation systems managed by farm households in the 10 years under analysis as shown in figs 1 and 2 however the probability of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households and the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community changes according to variations in the characteristics of wuas focusing on irrigation systems managed by all households and the absence of irrigation management we address the relationship between the probability of selecting different types of irrigation management systems and the characteristics of wuas first the relationships between the number of farm households fig 3a area of paddy field fig 3b diversity of farmer s landholdings fig 3c and the probability of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households show an inverted u shape the relationships between these characteristics of wuas and the absence of any irrigation management is u shaped below a certain threshold in the number of farm households area of paddy field and diversity of farmers landholdings the probability of the absence of irrigation management decreases and the likelihood of irrigation systems managed by all households increases however beyond a certain threshold the trend changes to the opposite direction second as the diversity of a community s farmers fig 3d ratio of non farmers fig 3e and ratio of elderly farmers fig 3f increase the probability of irrigation systems managed by all households decreases while the probability of non functionality increases the aging of farmers especially greatly affects the probability of adopting these irrigation management systems third the higher the ratio of paddy field fig 3g as a proxy indicator of the dependence on irrigation systems and number of meetings fig 3h and ratio of consolidated farmland fig 3i as proxy indicators of social capital the higher the probability of irrigation systems managed by all households overall irrigation systems managed by all households and the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community are greatly affected by the changes in social and economic conditions in particular the effect of social and economic conditions on the probability of adopting these management systems is in the opposite direction therefore sustaining physical infrastructure such as the ratio of paddy field and soft measures such as social capital increases the likelihood of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households and decreases the likelihood of selecting the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community this results in promoting collective action carried out by rural community members 6 conclusions this study provides empirical evidence on certain characteristics of wuas that affect the success of collective action for irrigation management we used panel data from 104 523 rural communities in japan observed between 1990 and 2000 the main contribution of this study is the use of a large scale panel dataset n 209 046 to assess the theory of collective action for irrigation management moreover we attempt to address certain methodological issues observed in previous empirical studies poteete and ostrom 2004 2008 araral 2009 such as the informational limits of cross sectional data the choice of subjective indicators as dependent variables and the censoring bias although a subjective indicator has been used as a dependent variable to evaluate the performance of collective action for irrigation management in existing empirical studies in this study we use an objective indicator of irrigation management systems to denote the different levels of collective action for irrigation management the result of the econometric analysis verifies the hypotheses of the existing empirical literature and confirms the robustness of the theory of collective action in the context of irrigation management our findings suggest that the level of collective action for irrigation management depends on the distance from the market the area and ratio of paddy field the ratio of non farmers the ratio of elderly farmers the number of meetings and the ratio of consolidated farmland a proxy for social capital we also find that the number of farm households the diversity of farmers landholdings and the diversity among a community s farmers have a curvilinear effect on collective action for irrigation management the relationship between these variables and likelihood of collective action is ambiguous in the existing literature an inverted u shaped relationship between collective action for irrigation management and the number of farm households and diversity of farmers landholdings seems to exist as well as a u shaped relationship between the level and diversity among a community s farmers these findings have implications for the governance of irrigation management carried on by wuas the rapid depopulation aging of farmers and urbanization may help explain the deteriorating state of irrigation management the japanese case serves as an example for developing countries which may experience similar changes in their rural environment due to economic development as socio economic conditions such as characteristics of user groups can change little in the short run it is necessary to maintain both physical infrastructures such as the ratio of paddy field and soft measures such as social capital to be able to perform collective irrigation management therefore policies aimed at suppressing deteriorating collective action for irrigation management include enhancing social interactions or traditional social ties in a community thereby accumulating social capital acknowledgement this work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant number jp

11418,we examine the characteristics of water user associations wuas that affect the success of collective action for irrigation management using random effects ordered probit models and a large panel dataset from 104 523 rural communities the results of the econometric analysis verify the hypotheses in the existing empirical literature and confirm the robustness of the theory of collective action in the context of irrigation management our results show that collective action for irrigation management depends on the distance from the market area of paddy field share of non farmers and elderly farmers share of paddy field and social capital we also find that collective action has an inverted u shaped relationship with the number of farm households and diversity in farmers landholdings and a u shaped relationship with the diversity of a community s farmers the results suggest that as the characteristics of irrigation systems and user groups can change little in the short run policies aimed at suppressing deteriorating collective action for irrigation management need to enhance social ties in a community thereby promoting community level social capital keywords collective action irrigation management system water user association japan 1 introduction irrigation systems are typical of common pool resources that are characterized by rivalry of consumption and difficulty of exclusion under circumstances where it is hard to exclude specific users from irrigation systems or where many people can openly access irrigation systems open access irrigation systems would be overexploited and depleted if not properly administered this is a collective action problem as described by ostrom 2010 if each individual in an interdependent situation selects strategies e g labor contribution for irrigation management based on a calculus that maximizes their own short term benefits individuals will take actions that generate lower joint outcomes e g the state of the irrigation canal as a result of everyone s effort than could have otherwise been achieved therefore it is essential for irrigation management to perform collective actions based on farmers collective efforts or cooperation in rural communities or water user associations wuas while it is reported in the literature that collective action for irrigation management faces difficulties in organizing resource users monitoring and enforcing the rules a number of case studies highlight the success of collective actions based on farmers collective efforts or cooperation examples from developing countries include joint maintenance of a canal under customary rules and the establishment of shared norms in rural communities or water user associations wuas to restrict open access see for example wade 1989 ostrom 1990 tang 1992 bardhan 1993 for earlier studies and bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 ricks 2016 for recent works the literature discusses factors facilitating or impeding collective action for the management of irrigation systems and describes such systems in detail ostrom 1990 and agrawal 2001 identified nearly 40 essential factors that are categorized into four kinds user group characteristics resource system characteristics different governance mechanisms and external environment it is however not simple to identify those factors just through case studies to reinforce the findings in individual case studies quantitative studies focusing on the irrigation systems in different countries also found factors in the four classifications e g bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 for india dayton johnson 2000 for mexico fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 for the philippines gorton et al 2009 for macedonia nakano and otsuka 2011 for uganda ito 2012 and wang et al 2016 for china takeda 2015 for japan and nagrah et al 2016 for pakistan in this study we examine the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management in japan collective action problems exist not only in developing countries but also in developed countries in particular there is a collective action problem that is unique to developed countries focusing on developed countries this study contributes to expanding previous research centered on developing countries we focus on irrigation systems in japan which is facing its own unique set of collective action problems the main crop grown in japan is rice for which irrigation is of particular importance gravity irrigation systems are the most commonly used mechanism in japan due to the steep geographical conditions the system is usually managed by rural communities the smallest units of regional society in rural villages which in many cases are simultaneously functioning as wuas conventionally both farmers and non farmers in a rural community have participated in collective action for irrigation management because irrigation canals provide water for both rice production and domestic use therefore it is difficult to overcome collective action problems because both farmers and non farmers are beneficiaries of irrigation which causes free riding behavior from both sides however as described by aoki 2001 mutual monitoring and enforcement of rules with strict penalties have worked well to prevent free riding from happening within rural communities as a result collective action has been carried out based on the cooperative efforts of farmers and non farmers in rural communities however many rural communities have been suffering from rapid depopulation population aging and urbanization since world war ii all of which are thought to have negative impacts on collective irrigation management therefore numerous rural communities have experienced a significant change in the status of collective action given this background we attempt to capture the relationships between the level of collective action and the change in economic and socio demographic conditions the outcomes of this study will provide meaningful implications for developing countries which will experience similar changes in rural communities with their economic growth another contribution to previous research is identification of some of the factors that influence collective action for irrigation management by using a large panel dataset at the wua level in previous literature there has been no solid consensus about the direction size and significance of their impact on irrigation management therefore the robustness of the previous results needs to be examined to identify the characteristics of wuas that have proved successful in managing local irrigation systems the lack of consensus among previous studies can be largely attributed to methodological issues such as the cost and difficulty of collecting data araral 2009 this study aims to address these issues first most empirical studies on irrigation management rely on cross sectional data due to the difficulty of collecting information over the long term studies based on cross sectional data cannot control for time invariant unobserved characteristics of wuas and irrigation systems such as differences in geographical conditions and history therefore the use of cross sectional data potentially suffers from an omitted variables bias because some unobserved factors might affect irrigation arrangements in specific places wang et al 2016 this is one of the causes inducing disagreement among researchers on the effect of some factors on the likelihood of collective action in irrigation management analyses based on panel data may help address this issue by controlling for unobservable characteristics of irrigation systems and wuas this study provides an opportunity to test the robustness of findings regarding the characteristics of wuas that proved successful in managing irrigation systems by using a large panel dataset n 209 046 2 periods at the wua level second most empirical studies on irrigation management do not specify or incorrectly define the nature of the collective action problem poteete and ostrom 2004 araral 2009 for instance most studies use a subjective indicator measured by good or bad to evaluate the outcome or status of successful collective action such as the level of activity of wuas or the maintenance level of irrigation channels nakano and otsuka 2011 indicators based on subjective appraisal may not precisely measure the exact levels of collective action in irrigation management in this study we use an objective indicator of irrigation management systems to denote different levels of collective action for irrigation management this indicator is observable and provides objective information on the status of collective action third many empirical studies censor a particular group of observations such as inactive irrigation associations from the data set araral 2009 this type of exclusion would lead to a censoring bias in the estimations of the parameters of interest meinzen dick 2007 poteete and ostrom 2008 to circumvent a possible censoring bias wuas that do not continue or control irrigation management are also included in the sample the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of farmer managed irrigation systems in japan section 3 reviews the empirical studies on farmers collective action in irrigation management to refine the fundamental indicators of irrigation management systems the data and hypotheses are described in section 4 while section 5 discusses the proposed methodology and empirical results the last section summarizes the main findings and provides our concluding remarks 2 irrigation systems in japan cultivation of rice using gravity irrigation is the standard in japan historically rural communities have been the wuas responsible for the operation and maintenance o m of irrigation facilities after world war ii both national and local governments began constructing large scale irrigation facilities such as dams headworks and main canals their management was transferred from the national and local governments to land improvement districts lids which are organizations established in 1949 to undertake the construction improvement and management of irrigation drainage facilities and land improvement projects including farmland consolidation within the boundaries of the district tanaka and sato 2003 at the same time the rights of irrigation management were transferred to lids from each rural community however the japanese government has endorsed a common rule for water use and assigned o m to rural communities at the level of main and branch canals the o m of irrigation except for large scale irrigation facilities has actually been implemented by rural communities to assure that the water from the river is stably delivered to the paddy field area through irrigation canals and efficiently allocated to various areas rural communities clean weed and repair the main and branch canals through meetings held by rural community members a few times a year rural community members decide how and when those activities are implemented during the meetings participants in those activities are determined through discussion or voting traditionally all households farm and non farm in the rural community were required to participate in such activities the reason is that most households within a rural community were farmers but even non farmers used water from irrigation canals for their daily life however the participation rules for those activities have changed significantly over the last 50 years due to changes in the circumstances surrounding rural communities e g rapid depopulation aging of farmers and urbanization accompanying the rapid economic growth in japan in particular the number of non farmers and part time farmers increased with urbanization inducing significant heterogeneity among the members of rural communities as a result the involvement of all households of a rural community in irrigation management became more difficult in recent years participation in irrigation management has dynamically changed shifting from participation of all households to the involvement of particular households e g only farm households or lack of management by wuas thus it has become more difficult to overcome the collective action problem due not only to both farmers and non farmers being beneficiaries of irrigation for rice production and domestic use but also to the changes in circumstances surrounding rural communities therefore since 2007 the government has been providing financial support for collective irrigation management carried out by rural communities through measures to conserve and improve land water and the environment to sustainably revitalize irrigation management 3 theory and evidence of collective action in irrigation management in the following sections we briefly review the literature that considers how collective action for irrigation management is affected by the characteristics of irrigation systems and user groups 3 1 characteristics of irrigation systems in this study we assess the impact of the following characteristics of irrigation systems 3 1 1 water scarcity most existing studies stress the importance of water scarcity as a determinant of the cooperation among farmers bardhan 2000 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 araral 2009 and agrawal 2001 suggest the presence of an inverted u shaped relationship between the degree of water scarcity and cooperation for irrigation management this means that the users of irrigation facilities have difficulty managing collective action with other users when water is scarce or extremely abundant user groups have no incentive and no need to collectively manage irrigation systems when water is abundant and conflicts among water users may become so large as to make collective action difficult when water shortage is severe fujiie et al 2005 water scarcity to some degree is ideal for collective action for irrigation management in short this implies that the return to farmers for participating in collective action for irrigation management is higher when water is moderately scarce compared with when water scarcity is severe or minimal hence the incentive for farmers to undertake collective action is greatest in addition araral 2009 found that fully autonomous wuas are better able to deal with the effects of water scarcity on monetary free riding compared with non autonomous wuas 3 1 2 access to the market the distance to the market has been widely recognized as an important factor for successful collective action in the management of common pool resources meinzen dick et al 2002 a site close to the market may lead to an increased opportunity for receiving non farming income and of market activities outside agriculture allowing some farmers to opt out loosens the traditional social ties that bind farmers into mutual dependencies thereby discouraging collective action meinzen dick et al 2002 araral 2009 wang et al 2016 however meinzen dick et al 2002 point out that sites closer to market are likely to be more commercially oriented and therefore have higher payoffs for effective irrigation as a result farmers have incentives to undertake collective action therefore the effects on irrigation management of access to the market are different across studies bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 mattoussi and seabright 2014 3 2 characteristics of user groups we assess the impact of the following characteristics of groups using the irrigation system 3 2 1 size of the group the effect of the number of participants on the sustainability of self governing wuas is ambiguous ostrom 2002 olson 1965 points out that acting collectively is more difficult for large organizations as the number of users increases the individual marginal contribution to irrigation management will decrease while the incentives to free ride on the effort of others increase in addition monitoring costs linked to compliance with rules and transaction costs linked to negotiations to create common rules may be higher in large groups however there may be some positive economies of scale in larger groups particularly in matters of pooling resources appointing guards lobbying with officials and so on bardhan 2000 earlier studies such as tang 1992 and lam 1998 found no relationship between the performance of wuas and the number of users several empirical studies found a negative effect of group size on wuas bardhan 2000 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 ito 2012 mattoussi and seabright 2014 while others found no impact dayton johnson 2000 the lack of consensus in the previous literature may depend on the curvilinear effect of group size on collective action for example in the case of community forest management agrawal and goyal 2001 find a curvilinear relationship between group size and the mobilization of resources to hire guards for shared forest resources 3 2 2 heterogeneity of user groups heterogeneity means that cultural backgrounds asset holdings interests and general norms shared with other group members will differ across users this heterogeneity is a significant variable for irrigation management baland and platteau 1996 ostrom 2002 social and cultural heterogeneity increase the coordination cost of forming and enforcing a common rule among members as a result heterogeneity makes collective action more difficult however if a member of a group has abilities and resources that other members do not have and participants in the user group can cooperate with each other the existence of a community s heterogeneity may help promote cooperation olson 1965 further poteete and ostrom 2004 also suggest that the relationship between heterogeneity and collective action is non linear existing empirical studies show the mixed effects of social and economic heterogeneity on collective action in irrigation management tang 1992 bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 nakano and otsuka 2011 ito 2012 3 2 3 dependence on irrigation systems the extent to which a community depends on irrigation systems is recognized as one of the key factors for success in collective action for irrigation management olson 1965 wade 1987 ostrom 1990 when many farmers depend on the irrigation system it may be easier to invest time and energy to create new institutions araral 2009 which result in maintaining successful collective action 3 2 4 social capital social capital is defined as the shared norms and networks that enable people to act collectively healy and c√¥t√© 2001 it is considered to play a key role in collective action for irrigation management communities with high social capital can reduce the cost of coordination monitoring and enforcement of the rules social capital is a mix of intangible assets and empirical studies have used several variables to proxy for social capital meinzen dick et al 2002 use the number of temples and cooperatives as an indicator of social capital the connections of individuals through temples have a strong influence on the organization of irrigation management the existence of cooperatives introduced by meinzen dick et al 2002 and the age of the resource as in araral 2009 also represent reasonable proxies for social capital however they do not find a statistically significant impact of these variables on collective action for irrigation management using a proxy measure for social capital may result in measurement problems for instance it is not clear whether older groups often used as a proxy measure for social capital have greater shared norms and networks to induce cooperation with other farmers compared with younger groups ideally more reliable and direct measures of social capital should be used 4 data hypotheses and definition of variables 4 1 unit of analysis and data in this study we use community level data obtained from the rural community card world census of agriculture and forestry 2000 these are comprehensive data collected from a survey implemented once every five years by the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff to collect information about agriculture and forests in all rural communities these data report detailed information on 139 176 rural communities in the year 2000 including data on agricultural production and the activities of the rural community such as management of irrigation communal farm roads and facilities since further information on irrigation management is not available before 1990 or after 2000 we use the data from 1990 and 2000 including information on rural communities activities for irrigation management following takahashi 2012 we excluded 5 out of 47 prefectures focusing on the data of 42 prefectures we exclude rural communities in hokkaido and okinawa due to differences in climatic conditions and those in tokyo kanagawa and osaka due to the strong effect of urbanization in these areas in addition we exclude rural communities where no paddy field and irrigation facilities are present therefore the final dataset used in this study covers 104 523 communities in 42 prefectures 4 2 hypotheses and definition of independent variables in this subsection we assess the validity of a set of hypotheses table 1 reports the summary statistics definition of variables and expected sign of the hypotheses 4 2 1 water scarcity the existing empirical literature shows that water scarcity has a curvilinear effect on collective action for irrigation management in short collective action among resource users would be more difficult when water is abundant or extremely scarce moderate water scarcity is ideal for the likelihood of collective action for irrigation management in japan water is abundant in most rural communities except during the season of rice transplantation however there is a variation in rainfall patterns across prefectures and in demand for water across regions we add a prefecture dummy to control for these variations across the prefecture level 4 2 2 access to the market we use the time distance to densely inhabited districts from a community as an indicator of its access to the market densely inhabited districts did mean the urban areas designated based on statistical data by the statistics bureau ministry of internal affairs and communications since the 1960 population census of japan we introduced three distinct dummy variables distance to did more than 1 5 h is equal to 1 if the time distance to a densely inhabited district is more than 1 5 h and 0 otherwise distance to did less than 1 h is equal to 1 if that distance is less than one hour and 0 otherwise while distance to did 1 1 5 h is equal to 1 if the time distance is from 1 to 1 5 h and 0 otherwise 4 2 3 size of group using the irrigation system we use the number of farm households that engage in farming and live in a community as an indicator of the group size of wuas and the area of paddy field in a community as an indicator of the size of wuas as measured by the irrigation service area we include both the number of farm households and its square to capture the possible u shaped relationship between the likelihood of collective action and group size according to the rural community card world census of agriculture and forestry 2000 the number of farm households in a community in our sample varies from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 386 in 2000 the average size of the communities is 25 farm households with an area of paddy field in 2000 of 21 ha 4 2 4 heterogeneity of user groups we create a diversity indicator to measure the community s social and economic heterogeneity diversity among community s farmers captures the degree of social heterogeneity following alesina et al 1999 we construct diversity among community s farmers as follows d i v e r s i t y a m o n g c o m m u n i t y s f a r m e r s 1 i f a r m e r i 2 where farmer i denotes the ratio of farmers i to the total population in the community and i indicates self sufficient farm households full time farm households type 1 part time farmers the income earned from farming is greater than other income and type 2 part time farmers the income earned from activities other than farming is higher respectively if this index is close to one the community comprises various types of farmers if this index is close to zero farmers in the community are homogeneous diversity of farmer s landholdings indicates the degree of economic heterogeneity we use this indicator instead of the distribution of farming income which is not disclosed in the data we construct diversity of landholdings as follows d i v e r s i t y o f l a n d h o l d i n g s 1 i l a n d h o l d i n g s i 2 where landholdings i denotes the ratio of operating farmland i corresponds to the land in ha of the farmer to total farmland in the community and may correspond to less than 1 0 ha 1 0 3 0 ha 3 0 5 0 ha 5 0 10 0 ha 10 0 20 0 ha 20 0 30 0 ha and more than 30 ha we include both these indicators of heterogeneity and their squares to capture the possible u shaped relationship between the likelihood of collective action and heterogeneity in addition we use the ratio of non farm households and the ratio of elderly farmers ratio of the population engaged in farming above 65 years old over the total population of a community to measure heterogeneity as a result of advancing urbanization the number of non farmers in rural communities has increased significantly making it harder to maintain a high level of collective action for irrigation management therefore we use the ratio of non farmers to control for the heterogeneity derived from increasing urbanization moreover communities in rural areas face aging of farmers as much as other areas in the country the empirical results of wang et al 2016 and li et al 2012 in china show negative relationships between the age of farmers and collective action in the commons indicating that an elderly group is less interested in participating in collective irrigation therefore we introduce the ratio of elderly farmers to control for the heterogeneity induced by aging finally we capture several types of heterogeneity social and economic as well as heterogeneity caused by the ratios of non farmers and elderly farmers 4 2 5 dependence on irrigation systems if these resources are usually salient to the livelihoods of users themselves they are more likely to have strong incentives to manage them more efficiently equitably and sustainably araral 2009 we use the ratio of paddy field ratio of the area of paddy field over the total area of farmland in a community as a proxy indicator of the dependence on irrigation the higher the ratio of paddy field within a community the greater the dependence on irrigation which results in maintaining successful collective action 4 2 6 social capital because social capital is intangible existing studies have used various proxy variables to capture it in this study we use age of community or user group fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 number of meetings labonne and chase 2011 and ratio of consolidated farmland as proxies for social capital age of community is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a community was established before 1975 and 0 otherwise ideally we would use the number of years since the establishment of the community as a proxy but this information is not available in our dataset number of meetings refers to the total number of meetings held by farmers in a year higher community ages and more meetings are proportionally related to the accumulation of social capital in communities in addition we introduce the ratio of consolidated farmland to improve labor and land productivity farmland consolidation is often carried out including merging and reshaping small plots of farmland into one large plot these projects are usually based on proposals received from farmers in rural communities if more than two thirds of landowners in the project area agree the project will be implemented by the central or prefectural government as a public project to implement projects consensus is needed among farmers within the community if the social capital in a community is low that community will usually not agree on the implementation of any projects therefore we use the ratio of consolidated farmland as a proxy for social capital 4 2 7 additional variables we include variables of topography to control for the geographic heterogeneity affecting collective action in irrigation management we use dummy variables flatland area urban area and hilly and mountainous area to denote topographical differences we also include indicators of farmland use in rural areas the growing area of abandoned farmland is a key problem in japan indeed according to the latest statistics available from japan s maff abandoned farmland comprises approximately 10 6 396 000 ha of all farmland the maff also has put substantial effort into expanding operation size for commercial farm households through rental of farmland therefore we use the ratio of rented in area and ratio of abandoned farmland to account for farmland use in rural community in addition year dummy is included to control for time effects common to all communities 4 3 measurement of dependent variables using appropriate measures of dependent variables as the outcome or degree of collective action is critical for examining the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management as previously discussed several studies use a subjective or qualitative indicator measured by good or bad to assess the outcome of successful collective action however self reported maintenance efforts inputs from households or the subjective appraisal of maintenance status recalled by interviewees might suffer from exaggeration bias in some circumstances wang et al 2016 in addition these indicators cannot precisely identify the different degrees of collective action for irrigation management therefore a direct measurement is required to denote different levels of collective action for instance ito 2012 proxies for collective action by counting per household labor contribution for irrigation management some studies employ direct measurements such as types of irrigation arrangements wang et al 2016 and the presence of the farmers organizations for irrigation meinzen dick et al 2002 to denote different levels of coordination and cooperation in this study we introduce an observable objective indicator to denote the different levels of collective action for irrigation management e g cutting weeds and removing silt specifically we assign an ordered dummy variable for different types of irrigation management 3 is the highest score and indicates management carried on by all households residing in the community 2 refers to management only performed by farm households 1 indicates management performed by hired hands and 0 denotes non functionality a community with no formal organization for irrigation management collective action is based on users collective effort or cooperation such as joint maintenance of a canal under customary rules and the establishment of shared norms in rural communities or wuas therefore this ranking of different types of irrigation management represents a direct indicator of the level of collective action based on users collective efforts or cooperation the level of collective action for irrigation maintenance carried on by all households is the highest all members of the community are required to participate in the operations and maintenance of the irrigation facilities in japan even non farmers use water from irrigation canals for their daily life such as water for fire prevention domestic water for local residents and use of the irrigation canal for melting and flushing snow in terms of the nature of collective action for irrigation management both farmers and non farmers have a strong incentive to free ride on the efforts of others if non farmers do not participate in collective action they are free riders on the efforts of the farmers collective action this type of irrigation management means both farmers and non farmers cooperate so they do not become free riders on the efforts of others collective action therefore rural communities with an irrigation management system where all beneficiaries of irrigation participate in collective action achieve the highest level of collective action for irrigation management this results in the highest collective effort or cooperation of irrigation users next irrigation management carried on by farm households is characterized by a lower level of collective action due to the exclusion of non farm households these two irrigation management systems are examples of collective action for irrigation management organized by the members of a community in the case of irrigation management carried on by hired hands and non functional irrigation management the collective action of community members is not required the ranking of non functionality a community with no formal organization for o m is the lowest because no collective action for irrigation management is carried out or controlled by a community 4 4 the transition of irrigation management systems we examine the transition of irrigation management systems using the sample described in the previous subsection fig 1 shows the distribution of the different irrigation management systems adopted by rural communities in 1990 and 2000 the number of communities adopting each irrigation management system is 35 695 all households 46 867 farm households 796 hired hands and 21 165 non functionality in 1990 in 2000 the number of communities adopting each irrigation management system is 34 008 all households 50 613 farm households 421 hired hands and 19 481 non functionality between 1990 and 2000 the number of communities adopting irrigation management carried out by farm households increased while the number of communities adopting other irrigation management systems decreased as shown in fig 2 the share of communities adopting an irrigation system managed by all households or farm households is 79 0 all households 34 2 farm households 44 8 in 1990 and 80 9 all households 32 5 farm households 48 4 in 2000 furthermore the share of communities characterized by non functionality is 20 2 in 1990 and 18 6 in 2000 as shown in figs 1 and 2 the choice of irrigation management system by a community seems stable during the period of analysis on the other hand table 2 indicates the transition of irrigation management systems from 1990 to 2000 it is apparent that communities have changed their irrigation management systems over the period of analysis for example looking at communities with irrigation management carried on by all households in 1990 n 35 695 about half of these communities n 18 625 52 2 show the same system of irrigation management in 2000 the remaining communities have changed irrigation management systems farm households hired hands and non functionality 36 0 have changed from an irrigation system managed by all households to one relying on farm households only in 2000 0 5 have changed to a system managed by hired hands and 11 5 have shifted to non functionality furthermore the ratio of communities moving to an irrigation system managed by farm households is the highest 36 0 in the case of communities adopting irrigation systems managed by all households 46 5 by hired hands 42 8 characterized by non functionality irrigation management systems seem to concentrate on management by farm households focusing on communities that maintained the same irrigation management system 52 2 were managed by all households 60 4 by farm households 4 0 by hired hands and 36 2 were characterized by non functionality in 1990 in communities that have not changed irrigation management systems in the period of analysis the ratio of communities adopting an irrigation system managed by farm households is the highest 60 4 overall we can observe the dynamics of the irrigation management systems adopted by a community in addition management only by farm households seems stable compared to other irrigation management systems table 1 shows the changes in the characteristics of communities over the period of analysis we can observe a remarkable shift in the size of the groups numbers of farm households heterogeneity ratio of non farmers and ratio of elderly farmers and social capital number of meetings and ratio of consolidated farmland these changes might influence the shifts observed in the irrigation management systems for example heterogeneity caused by the increase in the ratio of non farm households and aging of farmers might make it difficult to coordinate a collective action that involves non farmers this growing heterogeneity induces a decreasing level of collective action for irrigation management which results in the change from irrigation management systems managed by all households to those relying only on farm households on the other hand communities with irrigation management systems not characterized by collective action hired hands and non functionality have remarkably changed to irrigation management systems characterized by collective action all households and farm households this change implies that the level of collective action has increased the accumulation of social capital through implementing farmland consolidation and increasing the number of meetings as well as a reduction in coordination costs obtained due to the decrease in the number of farmers is likely to facilitate collective action for irrigation management a conventional cross sectional dataset cannot capture such changes in irrigation management systems and the characteristics of wuas therefore we use panel data to capture this transition through an empirical model 5 results and discussion 5 1 estimation models in the empirical model we assess the level of collective action for irrigation management on a categorical scale we use a random effects ordered probit model to empirically test the characteristics of wuas that affect the success of irrigation management the dependent variable is an ordered variable that indicates the level of collective action for irrigation management the model can estimate the influence of each variable in determining the probability of a rural community selecting an irrigation management system further because we can utilize a panel data set we add random effects to this model to control for unobserved time invariant community characteristics that might be correlated with the level of collective action for irrigation management the model can be written as y i t Œ≤ x i t Œ± i Œµ i t and y i t k i f k k 1 y i t k k k 1 k where y i t is an indicator of the level of collective action for irrigation management and captures the unobservable latent continuous response only the category chosen by community i at each point in time t can be observed x i t is a set of time varying independent variables and Œ≤ is the parameter to be estimated Œ± i represents an individual specific and time invariant random component depending on unobserved heterogeneity the errors Œµ i t have a standard normal distribution with mean equal to Œ± i zero and variance equal to one and are assumed to be independent of Œ±i k is the number of outcomes furthermore we report the results of the ordered probit model with and without random effects considering the impact of both observed and unobserved heterogeneity 5 2 determinants of the level of collective action for irrigation management table 3 presents the results of the ordered probit model with column 1 and without columns 2 4 random effects to address how the effect of the independent variable changes when we add unobserved heterogeneity to the model the estimates from columns 1 4 have the expected signs and are statistically significant except for age of community in columns 3 and 4 most coefficients on the independent variables are larger in columns 2 4 where random effects are added to the specifications running the model without random effects may induce underestimation of the effect of the independent variables on the level of collective action for irrigation management the results in column 2 control for the characteristics of the irrigation systems and those in column 3 control for the characteristics of the user groups in column 4 we add both the characteristics of the irrigation systems and the user groups to confirm the specification of the model the coefficients in columns 2 3 are stable and less likely to suffer from specification problems based on the results reported in column 4 in the next section we discuss the impact of the characteristics of the irrigation systems and user groups a community as a wua on collective action for irrigation management at the wua level 5 2 1 the characteristics of the irrigation systems the coefficient on the distance to the market distance to did is negative and significant showing that a community that is far from the market is characterized by a lower level of collective action for irrigation management this finding is consistent with the results of meinzen dick et al 2002 and wang et al 2016 who use the same indicator for access to the market this may be because there are less profitable commercial opportunities for these communities meinzen dick et al 2002 and returns to irrigated farming decrease in remote areas furthermore a community that is further away from the market may maintain social ties among the members of the community 5 2 2 the characteristics of user groups 1 group size the coefficient on the number of farm households is positive and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is negative and significant at the 1 level these estimated parameters mean that the level of collective action increases as the number of farm households increases up to 106 farm households and decreases after this point this finding on the effect of group size implies that the relationship between group size and level of collective action is associated with an inverted u shaped relationship this result is consistent with the theoretical prediction of agrawal and goyal 2001 who indicate that medium sized groups will be more successful than small and large groups in facilitating collective action for large classes of common pool resources as well as with the empirical findings of ito 2012 however attention should be paid to this interpretation of the inverted u shaped relationship in the case of irrigation management in japan indeed because the average number of farm households in rural communities in japan was 25 in 2000 the level of collective action for irrigation management increases with the number of farm households in most communities in this respect our empirical result is consistent with the empirical findings of takeda 2015 for japan the coefficient on the area of paddy field is negative and significant as the area of paddy field increases the cost of organizing a collective action on a vast territory increases as well fujiie et al 2005 this result is consistent with the findings of case studies for indonesia fujiie et al 2005 and india bardhan 2000 and with the general opinion that collective action is more difficult as the size of the resource increases 2 heterogeneity of user group the coefficient on the diversity of farmer s landholdings is positive and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is negative and significant this inverted u shaped relationship between economic heterogeneity and level of collective action implies that a group characterized by moderate heterogeneity of landholdings will be more successful in enhancing the cooperation level of collective action for irrigation management than groups with extreme heterogeneity of assets or with homogeneous assets the positive effect on collective action up a certain level of heterogeneity is consistent with one of olson s 1965 arguments that the existence of heterogeneity in a community may help promote cooperation if a member of the group has abilities and resources that other members do not have and participants in the user group can cooperate with each other the negative effect on collective action after a certain level of heterogeneity is attributed to an increase in the differences in members benefits from irrigation management this finding is consistent with poteete and ostrom 2004 indicating that the relationship between heterogeneity and collective action is non linear the coefficient on the diversity among community farmers is negative and significant and the coefficient on its squared term is positive and significant social heterogeneity and its levels are associated with a u shaped relationship heterogeneity of social backgrounds makes collective action for irrigation management more difficult as the heterogeneity of farm households increases up to a certain level of social heterogeneity this finding is consistent with the previous literature bardhan 2000 dayton johnson 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 ito 2012 social and economic heterogeneity have non linear effects on the level of collective action for irrigation management the direction of the effect is different at each level of heterogeneity because the impact of social and economic heterogeneity on the benefit of collective action complements the effect derived from a variety of farm households the coefficients on the ratio of non farmers and ratio of elderly farmers are negative and statistically significant as a result of advancing urbanization an increase in non farmers leads to social heterogeneity among community members making it more difficult to maintain a high level of collective action for irrigation management this finding is in line with the results of existing studies fujiie et al 2005 ito 2012 in a similar way heterogeneity of age structure among farm households induced by aging has a significantly negative impact on collective action consistent with the findings of wang et al 2016 for china general norms shared with older and younger group members may differ across group members making it difficult to organize collective action 3 dependence on irrigation systems the positive coefficient on the ratio of paddy field confirms the hypothesis that a community with a high ratio of paddy field is more likely to achieve a higher level of collective action for irrigation management this implies that these communities have an incentive to agree on collective action requiring higher cooperation because irrigation is essential for their livelihood this finding is consistent with the empirical results of gorton et al 2009 for macedonia and araral 2009 for the philippines 4 social capital the coefficients on the number of meetings and ratio of consolidated farmland are positive and statistically significant as expected these variables are used as indicators of social capital the implementation of consolidated farmland projects induces coordination and transaction costs the accumulation of social capital is crucial in the implementation of consolidated farmland to decrease such costs a community with high social capital is likely to choose a higher level of cooperation for irrigation management collective action in addition holding meetings requires considerable amounts of social capital meetings are expected to increase the likelihood of collective action for irrigation management by strengthening social interactions or traditional social ties 5 3 simulation analysis in this subsection we discuss the relationship between the characteristics of wuas and the probability of adopting different types of irrigation management systems fig 3 the likelihood of choosing an irrigation system managed only by farm households is the highest with respect to all explanatory variables and is stable regarding changes in the characteristics of wuas we argue that this management system is stably selected because irrigation water is essential to farmers who use water from water canals for both farming and daily life compared with non farmers who use water only for daily life this result is consistent with the higher ratio of communities maintaining irrigation systems managed by farm households in the 10 years under analysis as shown in figs 1 and 2 however the probability of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households and the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community changes according to variations in the characteristics of wuas focusing on irrigation systems managed by all households and the absence of irrigation management we address the relationship between the probability of selecting different types of irrigation management systems and the characteristics of wuas first the relationships between the number of farm households fig 3a area of paddy field fig 3b diversity of farmer s landholdings fig 3c and the probability of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households show an inverted u shape the relationships between these characteristics of wuas and the absence of any irrigation management is u shaped below a certain threshold in the number of farm households area of paddy field and diversity of farmers landholdings the probability of the absence of irrigation management decreases and the likelihood of irrigation systems managed by all households increases however beyond a certain threshold the trend changes to the opposite direction second as the diversity of a community s farmers fig 3d ratio of non farmers fig 3e and ratio of elderly farmers fig 3f increase the probability of irrigation systems managed by all households decreases while the probability of non functionality increases the aging of farmers especially greatly affects the probability of adopting these irrigation management systems third the higher the ratio of paddy field fig 3g as a proxy indicator of the dependence on irrigation systems and number of meetings fig 3h and ratio of consolidated farmland fig 3i as proxy indicators of social capital the higher the probability of irrigation systems managed by all households overall irrigation systems managed by all households and the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community are greatly affected by the changes in social and economic conditions in particular the effect of social and economic conditions on the probability of adopting these management systems is in the opposite direction therefore sustaining physical infrastructure such as the ratio of paddy field and soft measures such as social capital increases the likelihood of selecting an irrigation system managed by all households and decreases the likelihood of selecting the absence of any irrigation management carried on by a community this results in promoting collective action carried out by rural community members 6 conclusions this study provides empirical evidence on certain characteristics of wuas that affect the success of collective action for irrigation management we used panel data from 104 523 rural communities in japan observed between 1990 and 2000 the main contribution of this study is the use of a large scale panel dataset n 209 046 to assess the theory of collective action for irrigation management moreover we attempt to address certain methodological issues observed in previous empirical studies poteete and ostrom 2004 2008 araral 2009 such as the informational limits of cross sectional data the choice of subjective indicators as dependent variables and the censoring bias although a subjective indicator has been used as a dependent variable to evaluate the performance of collective action for irrigation management in existing empirical studies in this study we use an objective indicator of irrigation management systems to denote the different levels of collective action for irrigation management the result of the econometric analysis verifies the hypotheses of the existing empirical literature and confirms the robustness of the theory of collective action in the context of irrigation management our findings suggest that the level of collective action for irrigation management depends on the distance from the market the area and ratio of paddy field the ratio of non farmers the ratio of elderly farmers the number of meetings and the ratio of consolidated farmland a proxy for social capital we also find that the number of farm households the diversity of farmers landholdings and the diversity among a community s farmers have a curvilinear effect on collective action for irrigation management the relationship between these variables and likelihood of collective action is ambiguous in the existing literature an inverted u shaped relationship between collective action for irrigation management and the number of farm households and diversity of farmers landholdings seems to exist as well as a u shaped relationship between the level and diversity among a community s farmers these findings have implications for the governance of irrigation management carried on by wuas the rapid depopulation aging of farmers and urbanization may help explain the deteriorating state of irrigation management the japanese case serves as an example for developing countries which may experience similar changes in their rural environment due to economic development as socio economic conditions such as characteristics of user groups can change little in the short run it is necessary to maintain both physical infrastructures such as the ratio of paddy field and soft measures such as social capital to be able to perform collective irrigation management therefore policies aimed at suppressing deteriorating collective action for irrigation

11419,salinity adversely affects the environment agro ecosystems and agricultural productivity of arid and semi arid regions worldwide this salinization occurs due to natural human or both actions on the dynamic earth system this study was conducted to quantify the magnitude and map the spatial distributions of salinity of the irrigated agriculture in northern ethiopia a total of 717 soil and 13 water samples from nine irrigation schemes were used for analysis the soil samples were collected on a grid basis from 0 to 15 cm and 15 30 cm soil depths in the plant s root zone whilst surface water samples were collected from the irrigation water source middle and lower cross sections of the irrigation schemes these soil and water samples were analyzed quantitatively for 14 salinity parameters and results compared with worldwide standard values in addition the spatial analysis was made for three basic salinity parameters of hydrogen ion concentrations ph electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar even if there are non significant variations between soil depths and among the irrigation cross sections a salinity is observed at 33 of the schemes higher ph average values are spatially concentrated downstream whilst sar and ec showed inconsistent variations among irrigation schemes the quantitative and spatial salinity analysis revealed that gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have potential salinity levels as a result salinity management strategies and community based salinity management approaches that involve farmers participation is vital to create a sense of ownership irrigation users and decision makers should consider possible measures of minimizing salinity build up thereby increasing agricultural productivity in a sustainable way keywords irrigation schemes salinity spatial distribution semi arid region ethiopia 1 introduction soil salinity started to affect humanity since centuries shahid 2013 this soil salinization is caused due to natural or anthropogenic actions on the earth system today nearly 20 of the world irrigated agriculture is threatened by salinization li et al 2014 adejumobi et al 2016 this is even worse in arid and semi arid regions in which 30 of the irrigated agriculture is saline li et al 2014 this is due to the limited rainfall amount 400 mm and high evapotranspiration conditions huang et al 2010 beyond its inherited salinity nature of the arid and semi arid regions 41 of the land surface is irrigated with saline water undp 1997 as a result the sustainability of land and water resources for agricultural use remains questionable salinization adversely affects the environment agro ecosystems agricultural productivity and sustainability shahid 2013 this is caused due to the complex degradation dynamics of the soil and water resources which has a direct impact on food security of livelihoods that further hinders societal biophysical and socio economic base use of poor quality water coupled with the intensive use of soils for irrigation results in the development of salinity affected irrigated agriculture crescimanno et al 2007 when soils under irrigation are converted to salt affected soils salinity contaminated irrigation agriculture persists im erb and sukchan 2007 salt affected soils vary due to physical and chemical characteristics of the soil depth of water table leaching capacity crop cultivation system and salt distribution pattern qureshi and akhtar 2007 this occurs due to the natural phenomena salt deposition from the underlying parent material or human actions poor drainage facility poor quality irrigation water use or over irrigation thomas and morini 2005 furthermore salt affected soils result from chemical physical and biological interactions of the soil and water resources kidane et al 2006 the severity of salinity hazard or salinization is associated with low agricultural productivity on site land degradation and is mainly an environmental problem that eventually leads to desertification im erb and sukchan 2007 in agriculture where human being depends on salinity effect manifests in loss of crop stand reduced plant growth reduced yields and may cause crop failure by preventing water extraction from the soil due to reduced osmotic potential ayers and westcot 1985 dierickx 2009 the tigray region in northern ethiopia is known for its semi arid environment vulnerable to soil salinity as a result of the recent intensifications of irrigated agriculture the regional government has been expanded irrigated agriculture for the sustenance of its smallholder farmers in the last twenty years alemayehu et al 2009 as a result the regional irrigated land has increased from 15 000 ha before 2004 to more than 243 000 ha in 2015 board 2015 furthermore the government has an ambitious plan to irrigate 50 of the total 1 5 million hectares of available arable land in the next 10 15 years period gebresilassie 2014 gtp 2011 to achieve these goals earthen dams and diversions have been constructed continually in the last two decades as a means of harvesting surface water for small and medium scale irrigation developments however despite the satisfactory achievements of the intensification of irrigated agriculture the attention given to field level agricultural water management was non sufficient in addition due to lack of knowledge and awareness of improved irrigated land and water management strategies farmers are using traditional irrigation water application systems consequently irrigation application efficiency remains below 40 in the region mintesinot et al 2004 hagos et al 2016 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 this poor on farm irrigation water management practice has led to waterlogging poor water distribution and salinity development of the irrigated agricultural lands kidane et al 2006 as a result salinity eventually developed in the irrigated agricultural lands of the region especially in the past decades the yield and quality of the cultivated crops were hindered and consequently farmers were forced to change their cropping strategy by introducing mitigation measures mintesinot et al 2004 hagos et al 2016 kifle et al 2017 yohannes et al 2017 gebremeskel et al 2017 as a result farmers have changed crop cultivation strategy from the cereal based cultivation to salinity tolerant commercial crops even if a detailed study is hardly found that could clearly indicate the status and salinity development over time farmers extension experts and research institutions were trying to put some mitigation measures by introducing salinity tolerant improved crops such as potato onion and some drainage facilities through leaching although such mitigation measures were undertaken in the irrigated agricultural areas a considerable irrigated land of the irrigation schemes is converting into unproductive areas as a result of the on site salinity buildups kebede 2009 this indicates adequate field level agricultural land and water management techniques were lacking in the irrigated farmlands kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 kifle et al 2017 yohannes et al 2017 tsegay et al 2015 kifle et al 2008 despite the existence of some local studies on salinity developments in the semi arid region e g yazew 2005 bekele et al 2012 kebede 2009 gebremeskel et al 2017 a comprehensive study to identify the main salinity sources quantifying the magnitude and mapping its spatial distributions is lacking identifying the main driving forces of salinity from the soil itself or the water applied that forms a soluble salt accumulation in the soils of irrigated agriculture is essential in understanding and taking management measures for future agricultural productivity moreover soil depth based salinity status determination at which most crops grow is vital this is helpful to identify whether salts are going down the soil depths or emerging due to capillary rise from the groundwater tables near the surface therefore this study was aimed at understanding the salinity status by quantifying the magnitude mapping its spatial distributions in selected irrigation schemes this study is essential to deliver and put ways forward recommendations for decision makers and irrigation users to improve the agricultural productivity in a sustainable way and minimize the salinity build up in the soil depths of the region and other areas with similar socio economic and agro ecological conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 area description this study was conducted in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia tigray by selecting four districts including hintalo wajirat enderta kilte awlaelo and atsbi wenberta from which nine irrigation schemes were selected for this study fig 1 these irrigation schemes are gereb kunchi gum selassa gereb mehizi and may gassa from hintalo wajirat gereb wedicheber gereb kokhi and arato from enderta korir from kilte awlaelo and tegahne from atsbi wenberta district table 1 and fig 1 the boundary of all studied irrigation schemes was delineated by taking gps points from the irrigation schemes these districts are known for their semi arid climate which is mainly characterized by mixed agriculture with erratic rainfall and sparse vegetation coverage esser et al 2002 gebremeskel et al 2018 cropping practices are dominated by horticultural crop production during the irrigation season and cereal production during rainfed gebremeskel et al 2018 the districts average annual temperature and mean annual rainfall ranges from 19 23 c and 504 543 mm respectively oicha et al 2010 yazew 2005 the irrigation schemes have clay and clay loam soil textural classes table 1 geology of the irrigation schemes is characterized by flood basalt volcanic amba aradam formation antalo super sequence and metamorphic basement rocks gebreyohannes et al 2010 other characteristics such as water sources irrigation potential and actual irrigation capacity of each irrigation scheme are summarized in table 1 2 2 data collection and sampling procedures evaluating the spatial variability of salinity on the basis of soil depth and scheme elevation cross section determines the severity of salinity considering an efficient irrigation strategy is an important factor affecting the depth and scheme elevation of the soil and irrigation water salinity as well as salinity build up in the root zone hence in this study we used soil depth and scheme elevation for ease of data collection and for determining salinity spatially for this study nine irrigation schemes which were reported to have salinity problems are purposely selected table 1 however the existence of salinity in these irrigation schemes was checked after frequent field visit accordingly a total of 717 soil and 13 water samples were collected from these irrigation schemes for further analysis the 717 soil samples were collected 359 from 0 to 15 cm and 358 from 15 to 30 cm soil depth table 2 on a grid basis at the dry season irrigation season from april to may in the year 2015 since the roots of the crops cultivated in the irrigated agriculture are not deeper than 30 cm the soil depths from 0 to 15 and 15 30 cm were selected as means of comparison in salinity analysis the period from june to september was considered as rainy season and october to may was considered as an irrigation season this irrigation season lasts for eight months and farmers grew their crops based on the availability of water in the dams and consultation given by the irrigation development agents in the schemes the april and may are the driest months of the year that produces higher evapotranspiration by leaving back the salts at the surface hence taking data at these months is easier to detect salinity spatially and quantitatively at surface subsurface and different cross sections of the irrigation schemes each sample from each irrigation scheme was taken at the same spot from both soil depths table 2 on the other hand water samples were collected from the source of irrigation water upstream in the middle and the bottom downstream of the irrigation schemes water samples from some of the studied irrigation schemes were not included as water did not exist in the schemes at the time of data collection table 2 as a result only 13 water samples were considered for water analysis to develop maps showing the spatial distribution of the salinity gps readings of all sampling points were collected from each irrigation scheme the collected soil and water samples from each irrigation schemes are summarized in table 2 both spatial and quantitative measurements from the soil and irrigation water samples were analyzed and compared among the irrigation schemes 2 3 data analysis sample analysis was carried out first in the laboratory and then statistical and spatial analysis has followed in this study before proceeding to the laboratory analysis all soil samples were air dried crushed and passed through a 2 mm sieve the 1 5 soil to water ratio suspensions were prepared by weighing 10 g of soil into a pop top tube adding 50 ml of deionized water and shaking for 5 min on an end over end shake yao and yang 2010 laboratory analysis of the soil and water samples were done in mekelle soil research center laboratory of tigray agricultural research institute salinity indicator parameters including ph ec ca2 mg2 hco 3 cl and na2 for the collected soil and water samples and soil texture using hydrometer method were analyzed in the laboratory measurements of these parameters can sufficiently indicate the salinity status of irrigated agriculture abrol et al 1988 ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 2003 the laboratory analysis procedures adopted by pansu and gautheyrou 2006 were applied to analyse these parameters table 3 moreover the quality of the soil and water samples for agricultural use were statistically evaluated through various indices such as the total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar magnesium adsorption ratio mar residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc the permeability index pi and the kelly ratio kr table 5 these measurements and preceding indices are able to capture the salinity of an irrigation scheme ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 2003 equations for obtaining these indices are summarized in table 4 in addition the standard threshold values of the salinity parameters used to compare with the measured values from the irrigation schemes are given in table 5 the threshold values which were used for determining the soil in extract basis and the collected irrigation water samples are explicitly shown in table 5 moreover as indicated in table 5 nine parameters were applied for both soil and water samples whilst other five and two parameters were used independently for soil and water sample analysis respectively the widely accepted recommendation for use of saline water for agriculture is adopted from fao ayers and westcot 1985 for the majority of the salinity parameters after obtaining the results from laboratory and indices a descriptive statistics was made to calculate the mean of each parameter for each irrigation schemes the student t test was used to compare the parameter mean values between the soil depths for each irrigation scheme the t test compares only the locations of the distribution represented by means which is simple and intuitive kim et al 2014 moreover the collected gps readings for each sampling points were used to indicate the spatial distributions of salinity maps of salinity distributions across the irrigation schemes were produced using arc gis tools gis spatial interpolation techniques were employed to map the geo spatial salinity distributions in the irrigation schemes geostatistically the salinity was interpolated by using a universal kriging interpolation method of the spatial tools in the arc gis environment allbed et al 2014 the universal kriging technique is typically useful to incorporate trend wise estimation to accurately estimate the spatial salinity variations similar salinity spatial interpolation approaches have been used worldwide by different authors e g asfaw et al 2016 ni√±erola et al 2017 hence the major salinity indicator parameters i e ph ec and sar for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers of each irrigation scheme were interpolated into maps to show their spatial distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative soil and water salinity assessment the status of the salinity of all irrigation schemes was quantified from both the soil and water samples the analysis of the soil samples is given for each soil depth from 0 to 15 cm table 6 and 15 30 cm table 7 root zone each soil sample was analyzed against 14 salinity parameters as shown in tables 6 and 7 and the water samples were analysed for 11 salinity parameters table 8 moreover a descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken to compare the results obtained from the two soil depths for all the salinity parameters differences among the salinity parameters when compared with the averages of the data taken from each soil depths is non significant data not presented here hence the distributions of the salinity inducing parent materials are equally distributed in the soil depths in order to know if the water in the irrigation schemes has also effects to cause salinity water samples from upper middle and bottom cross sections of the irrigation schemes were analyzed and the results are presented in table 8 differences obtained among the irrigation sections for all the irrigations schemes is lower as compared with their means by the t test statistic method the details of the soil and water analysis results are presented in sections 3 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 laboratory analysis salinity parameters such as ph ec and the exchangeable cations and anions were analyzed in the laboratory and were subjected to statistical analysis as a result the details of these parameters are presented based on laboratory and statistical analysis except the gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes the average ph values of the soil and water samples are generally under the standards to use for irrigation water for both soil layers tables 6 8 the average ph value of gereb kunchi is 8 61 and 8 59 for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depths respectively whilst it is 8 59 and 8 55 for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depths respectively in taghane scheme table 5 figs 2 and 3 the result of the ph values for both schemes indicated that the observed values of these parameters are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use as compared to the fao standards ayers and westcot 1985 as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the gereb wedicheber and gereb kokhi irrigation schemes are in a position of approaching the threshold values table 5 for all soil depths in addition this tendency is observed in the gereb mihzi irrigation scheme at the 15 30 cm soil depth on the contrary analysis of ph of the collected water samples showed that the irrigation waters are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use the possible reasons could be the availability of complex chemical reaction among the cations and anions in the soil than what was happening to the water besides inherently the soil has complex physical and chemical weathered products that may lead to physical and chemical interactions kidane et al 2006 generally since the average ph values of each irrigation schemes were greater than 7 irrigation scheme tend to have alkaline properties which could lead to salinity table 6 8 abrol et al 1988 the soil and water samples of the irrigation schemes were also analyzed for exchangeable cations na ca2 and mg2 and anions hco 3 and cl concentrations following the procedures given in table 3 accordingly average values of these cations and anions of each irrigation scheme are under the standards prescribed for irrigation water use for both soil depths tables 6 table 7 unlike results from the soil analysis the values of salinity variables in water samples showed variations table 8 for example at the upstream of the gereb kokhi irrigation scheme the value of mg2 is 6 6 meq l which is above the standards to use for irrigation the ca2 has also a tendency to be above the standard in that scheme table 8 the results of the exchangeable anions and cations are relatively higher in the water samples as compared to the soil samples of the irrigation schemes as explained in tables 6 and 7 the average values of ec and tds of the irrigation schemes are under the range of recommended standards for irrigation in both soil depths however the tegahne irrigation scheme for both soil depths figs 2 and 3 and the gereb kunchi for the 15 30 cm soil depth fig 3 reveals greater ec and tds values these results clearly indicate that the observed values of these parameters are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use as compared to the recommended average values 1000 meq l robinove et al 1958 similarly water analysis of the irrigation schemes showed values within the standard which implies the possibility for irrigation use however a tendency of salinization is observed at the upper scheme of gerb kokhi and bottom scheme of korir irrigation schemes generally soil and irrigation water samples having ph greater than 8 4 and ec greater than 4 ds m are considered saline demir et al 2009 ayers and westcot 1985 based on this the quantitative analysis indicated that the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown salinity in these schemes soils are getting abandoned and agricultural lands are becoming out of production the possible reasons for this occurrence could be the availability of salinity inducing parent materials in the soil depths and inappropriate irrigation water management and limited use of drainage by the users since application of irrigation water using the traditional surface canal irrigation system is dominant in all the irrigation schemes these structures are built traditionally lacking a proper design works this has facilitated the occurrence of salinity in the irrigation schemes besides surface irrigation methods such as basin and furrow are the main irrigation methods practiced in the region these methods also lack design standards based on the characteristics of the water potential and command areas these could also be a reason for the occurrence of salinity in the irrigation schemes 3 1 2 salinity indices the salinity of the irrigation schemes was also analyzed based on the salinity indices given in table 4 the average soil and water sar values of each irrigation scheme are not out of range for irrigation purposes table 6 8 and figs 2 3 in this regard the sar parameter does not show any significant differences among the irrigation schemes for both the soil and water samples the mar value is dependent on the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the soil and water samples these elements often make a state of equilibrium in the soil or water solutions salifu et al 2015 when mar value is greater than 50 crop production is hardly possible table 5 raghunath 1987 gupta and gupta 1987 the mar results of the irrigation schemes for the soil samples for both soil depths show average values under the maximum permissible limit table 6 and 7 hence salinity effects associated with magnesium concentration in the irrigation schemes are infrequent the average values of the residual sodium carbonate rsc and residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc from each irrigation scheme have significant implications with regard to the salinity effects the rsc values greater than 2 5 meq l are not recommended for irrigation table 5 cfc 1975 as a result the average values obtained from all irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use table 5 the recommended value for rsbc is also acceptable when it is less than 1 25 meq l cfc 1975 rsbc values greater than the standard value is non existent in any of the irrigation schemes this explicitly shows that bi carbonate concentrations available in the irrigation schemes could not hinder crop growth furthermore the estimated rsc and rsbc values also didn t show any clear significant differences amid each soil depths if the permeability index pi value exceeds 65 water is considered suitable for irrigation table 5 doneen 1964 if the average kelly ratio kr values of a given irrigation scheme have values less than one the water can be used for irrigation purpose table 5 sundaray et al 2009 accordingly the average values of the water and soil samples collected from each irrigation scheme are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use tables 6 8 in most of the irrigation schemes the average kr values collected from the soil depths are above the standards for irrigation uses exceptions occurred for the may gassa and korir for both soil depths gereb kokhi 0 15 cm and tegahne 15 30 cm schemes which are below standards to use for irrigation in contrast the water samples taken from all cross sections of the irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation uses table 8 the direct results from the laboratory and those derived from the indices show the existence of salinity in the irrigation schemes it is proved that the soils and irrigation waters contain a significant amount of dissolved salts in contrast dissolved salt variations between the soil depths are non significant which implies the soil depth 0 30 cm has consistent salinity levels as most of the irrigated crops in the region have root depths not greater than 30 cm they can be stressed by salinity effects due to the high concentration of salts in the soil and irrigation water consequently crop growth would be limited and hence crop productivity is largely impaired sufficient leaching facilities in the soil profiles substantiated by adding ameliorative agents such as gypsum can reduce the salinity effects in the plants root zone tanji et al 2015 3 2 spatial distributions of soil salinity identifying spatial salinity distribution within the schemes is helpful for irrigation users and decision makers to put solutions for all or parts of the irrigation schemes the results of the spatial soil salinity distribution presented in this section is from soil sample analysis only therefore gridded spatial salinity maps of the nine irrigation schemes were developed for the sar ph and ec parameters spatial salinity maps are given for irrigation schemes of arato fig 4 may gassa fig 5 and gereb kunchi fig 6 the spatial maps of the remaining schemes are presented in supplementary data a fig 1a 6a we used the location of the water sources dam diversion point given in each figure as reference points to identify the irrigation schemes spatial salinity distribution 3 2 1 sar spatial distribution as indicated in figs 4 6 and supplementary data a the sar spatial distributions are given in soil depth basis 0 15 cm 15 30 cm soil depths gereb wedicheber tegahne korir and gereb kokhi irrigation schemes have shown relatively higher sar values at the downstream scheme for both soil depths while gum selassa and gereb mihizi showed higher values at the upstream schemes for both soil depths the gereb kunchi however showed a maximum value at the downstream for the 0 15 cm soil depth while the maximum values for the 15 30 cm soil were found at upstream schemes in contrast the arato irrigation scheme has a maximum value in the middle of the irrigation scheme in general there are no consistent sar variations among the irrigation schemes and between the soil depths comparing to the recommended standards of fao ayers and westcot 1985 the spatial distribution maps of sar for all irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use for both soil depths however the data suggest that salinity in these schemes are increasing despite the fact that it has not significantly hindered the soil and hence agricultural productivity 3 2 2 ph spatial distribution unlike the sar the ph maps have a consistent variation among the irrigation schemes except for arato which exhibited high ph in the upstream virtually all irrigation schemes have maximum ph values in the downstream cross sections the location specific maximum ph value of the irrigation schemes are presented as in arato 9 1 fig 4 gereb kunchi 9 2 fig 6 gereb wedicheber 8 8 supplementary data fig 6a korir 8 5 supplementary data fig 4a gum selassa 8 52 supplementary data fig 3a and tegahne 8 8 supplementary data fig 5a the observed salinity parameter values of these irrigation schemes are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use this clearly indicates that it can draw an attention towards putting adaptation strategies in the irrigation schemes generally the studied irrigation schemes have shown an increasing trend towards salinity for both soil depths especially in the downstream areas this could be because of the geographical positions where the soil and water properties of the upper schemes flow and concentrate towards the downstream cross sections 3 2 3 ec spatial distribution the ec maps of each irrigation scheme are also presented in figs 4 6 and the supplementary data a 1a 6a yet clear sign on the consistency of ec values for the upper middle and downstream cross sections of the irrigation schemes is lacking among the irrigation schemes higher ec values were obtained in the upstream of gum selassa may gassa tegahne and gereb wedicheber whereas maximum values were observed at the downstream of arato and korir irrigation schemes the soil ec directly correlates with particle size soil texture nutrient and organic matter content and cation exchange capacity allbed et al 2014 this indicates irrigation schemes having finer soil particles exhibits higher soil ec and vice versa even though most of the irrigation schemes have clay to clay loam soil texture table 1 this didn t guarantee a consistent ec values along the cross sections the gereb kunchi irrigation scheme is characterized differently in where very high ec values with clear variations between the soil depths were observed this irrigation scheme has a maximum value of 5 94 ds m in the 0 15 cm and 10 12 ds m in the 15 30 cm which is categorized as suppressing for plants to grow ayers and westcot 1985 the spatial distribution map of each irrigation scheme has helped to show spatial salinity variations for the ph ec and sar parameters despite the majority of the schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown a higher magnitude of soil salinity our findings are also supported by different studies which reported salinity in most irrigation schemes of the region for example yazew 2005 have confirmed higher soil salinity presence in gum selassa than korir irrigation scheme similarly haile et al 2002 revealed salinity at the top middle and bottom cross sections of the gum selassa irrigation scheme salinity build up in the root zone depends on several factors such as quality of irrigation water irrigation strategy crops being grown soil type groundwater depth the soil parent material the geological formations and soil forming factors such as climate topography and vegetation demir et al 2009 qureshi et al 2007 this was more pronounced when a spatial salinity analysis have been considered in the irrigation schemes as a result spatial variations in the vertical and horizontal directions have been observed after spatial salinity maps were developed for the schemes in this study gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown salinity levels that prohibit crop production this indicates 33 of the irrigation schemes have salinity that requires mitigation measures the gum selassa and gereb kunchi are found in nearby locations having similar vertisols soil parent material with clay soil textural type as indicated by kidane et al 2006 the possible drivers of salinity for these schemes were due to the poor management of irrigation water and the parent material irrigation was started in 1996 in both schemes and salinity incidence have started to occur after 10 years from the start of irrigation kidane et al 2006 the soils of these irrigation schemes were developed from alluvium volcanic origin under less than 400 mm annual rainfall characterized by the semi arid environment kidane et al 2006 yazew 2005 similarly the tegahne irrigation scheme has salinity effects due to the lower amount of rainfall under the clay loam soil textural type this scheme has a sedimentary rock parent material as a base for the creation of all its forefront characteristics including its salinity development irrigation has been practiced for 21 years after its earthen dam was built in 1996 and salinity was observed to occur in the first 5 years of irrigation yazew 2005 the irrigation water management crop and soil type soil parent material the geological formations and soil forming factors have a tendency for the occurrence of salinity incidence in the irrigation schemes yazew 2005 the underlying nature of these irrigation schemes may also aggravate the dynamic nature of salinity occurrence in the schemes spatial salinity variations are observed in the irrigation schemes that may need location specific coping strategies results from both quantitative and spatial analysis showed that there are two sources of salinity primary and secondary in the irrigation schemes the primary salinization is merely due to the saline nature of the underlying parent materials inherently gained this type of salinization existed in some of the irrigation schemes e g the tehagne irrigation but was not the main reason for the salinity to occur in the schemes the gereb kunchi may gassa gereb mihzi and gum selassa are found in the vicinity having similar environmental and geological locations however they have different salinity levels where salinity in gum selassa and gereb kunchi is above the standard salinity levels while the remaining schemes are below the standard this could be an indication that salinity sources from the parent material are not the main cause for the salinity to occur in the irrigation schemes moreover the difference in the time of the irrigation commencement is also observed in the irrigation schemes which may be another means of salinity variations coupled with the inefficient use of the agricultural water management in the schemes salinity sources emerged as a function of unwise anthropogenic human activities on irrigation water use is secondary salinization tanji et al 2015 this is virtually the main source of salinity over the studied irrigation schemes substantiated by the semi arid geographical locations of the irrigation schemes as indicated by kidane et al 2006 and yazew 2005 most of the irrigation schemes in the semi arid northern ethiopia tigray have been affected by salinity right after some years of irrigation practices this is mainly attributed to the lack of proper use of the agricultural water water is applied without knowing for how long how much water is needed for a specific crop of interest for at least eight months of the year besides the irrigation season is merely dry season where evapotranspiration is high as compared to the rainy season this evapotranspiration could eventually become a cause for greater concentration of soluble salts in the crop root zone as a result most horticultural crops grown in the irrigation schemes are suppressed by the high concentration of salts in the soil tanji et al 2015 moreover farmers don t follow the crop rotation system to crop production in the irrigation schemes yohannes et al 2017 although cropping systems are an effective strategy for salinity alleviation ni√±erola et al 2017 nowadays irrigation schemes are developing in tigray hagos et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 although concerns associated with possible salinity effects are non sufficient besides irrigation is still needed to increase agricultural production to satisfy food requirements in the semi arid areas as a result higher concentration of salts in the plants root zone are inevitable to face the irrigation schemes asfaw et al 2016 this may aggravate the intensity and effects of salinity in the region proper management of agricultural water towards reducing salinity is vital for increased crop production in the irrigation schemes hence quick implementation strategies towards salinity reduction and prevention could have petential benefits to the people these could be in terms of soil amendment additions such as gypsum and organic manures effective use of water applications based on the crop water requirements and it is also better to introduce drainage facilities for leaching the soluble salts hence leaching of the salts before planting should also be a prerequisite for crop establishment by far the development and introduction of salt tolerant crops are vital for the schemes moreover improved cultural practices such as precision land levelling zero tillage and bed forming methods of planting have shown reduced levels of salinity development qureshi et al 2007 these resource conservation techniques are widely used in arid and semi arid areas for growing crops one of the major bottle necks in persuading farmers to use saline soil and water resources for agricultural production is the lack of proper guidelines for farmers this can help farmers in using poor quality water irrigation amounts and frequencies which help to avoid salt accumulation in the plant root zone the soil and irrigation water should be managed carefully in the irrigation schemes prone to soil salinity to avoid further soil and water deterioration 4 conclusions sustainability of irrigated agriculture depends on the productivity of the soil and water resources however these resources are threatened by salinity to varying extent and severity on the irrigation schemes of tigray expansion of salt affected soils in the irrigation schemes is increasing as a result of recent irrigated agriculture intensifications however the magnitude and spatial distribution of salinity developments occurred in the irrigation schemes are yet unknown the results of this study showed that about 67 of the irrigation scheme s salinity level of both soil and water is above the standard to be used for irrigation however quantitative analysis of the soil and water samples and mapping of the spatial distributions of salinity showed that the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have higher salinity levels the spatial analysis of ph shows higher value at downstream parts of the schemes while sar and ec did not show consistent variations among the irrigation schemes despite the fact that the parent material underlying the surface has sources of salinity poor agricultural water management is the main source of salinity in the irrigation schemes lack of appropriate agricultural management strategies towards proper irrigation water management and non sufficient use of ameliorative and drainage facilities leaching has resulted in salinity moreover sources from the parent material have also intrinsically saline nature that caused the salinization of soil and water resources in the irrigated agriculture a multidimensional community based salinity management strategy on the basis of awareness creations and creating a sense of ownership could possibly be useful for overwhelming developments of the irrigated agriculture awareness creation on farmers extension workers and relevant stakeholders could help to address salinity effects through proper land and irrigation water management strategies in the irrigation schemes moreover policymakers can consider salinity effects side by side with the developments of irrigated agriculture in the region acknowledgements this research work was financed by the tigray agricultural research institute

11419,salinity adversely affects the environment agro ecosystems and agricultural productivity of arid and semi arid regions worldwide this salinization occurs due to natural human or both actions on the dynamic earth system this study was conducted to quantify the magnitude and map the spatial distributions of salinity of the irrigated agriculture in northern ethiopia a total of 717 soil and 13 water samples from nine irrigation schemes were used for analysis the soil samples were collected on a grid basis from 0 to 15 cm and 15 30 cm soil depths in the plant s root zone whilst surface water samples were collected from the irrigation water source middle and lower cross sections of the irrigation schemes these soil and water samples were analyzed quantitatively for 14 salinity parameters and results compared with worldwide standard values in addition the spatial analysis was made for three basic salinity parameters of hydrogen ion concentrations ph electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar even if there are non significant variations between soil depths and among the irrigation cross sections a salinity is observed at 33 of the schemes higher ph average values are spatially concentrated downstream whilst sar and ec showed inconsistent variations among irrigation schemes the quantitative and spatial salinity analysis revealed that gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have potential salinity levels as a result salinity management strategies and community based salinity management approaches that involve farmers participation is vital to create a sense of ownership irrigation users and decision makers should consider possible measures of minimizing salinity build up thereby increasing agricultural productivity in a sustainable way keywords irrigation schemes salinity spatial distribution semi arid region ethiopia 1 introduction soil salinity started to affect humanity since centuries shahid 2013 this soil salinization is caused due to natural or anthropogenic actions on the earth system today nearly 20 of the world irrigated agriculture is threatened by salinization li et al 2014 adejumobi et al 2016 this is even worse in arid and semi arid regions in which 30 of the irrigated agriculture is saline li et al 2014 this is due to the limited rainfall amount 400 mm and high evapotranspiration conditions huang et al 2010 beyond its inherited salinity nature of the arid and semi arid regions 41 of the land surface is irrigated with saline water undp 1997 as a result the sustainability of land and water resources for agricultural use remains questionable salinization adversely affects the environment agro ecosystems agricultural productivity and sustainability shahid 2013 this is caused due to the complex degradation dynamics of the soil and water resources which has a direct impact on food security of livelihoods that further hinders societal biophysical and socio economic base use of poor quality water coupled with the intensive use of soils for irrigation results in the development of salinity affected irrigated agriculture crescimanno et al 2007 when soils under irrigation are converted to salt affected soils salinity contaminated irrigation agriculture persists im erb and sukchan 2007 salt affected soils vary due to physical and chemical characteristics of the soil depth of water table leaching capacity crop cultivation system and salt distribution pattern qureshi and akhtar 2007 this occurs due to the natural phenomena salt deposition from the underlying parent material or human actions poor drainage facility poor quality irrigation water use or over irrigation thomas and morini 2005 furthermore salt affected soils result from chemical physical and biological interactions of the soil and water resources kidane et al 2006 the severity of salinity hazard or salinization is associated with low agricultural productivity on site land degradation and is mainly an environmental problem that eventually leads to desertification im erb and sukchan 2007 in agriculture where human being depends on salinity effect manifests in loss of crop stand reduced plant growth reduced yields and may cause crop failure by preventing water extraction from the soil due to reduced osmotic potential ayers and westcot 1985 dierickx 2009 the tigray region in northern ethiopia is known for its semi arid environment vulnerable to soil salinity as a result of the recent intensifications of irrigated agriculture the regional government has been expanded irrigated agriculture for the sustenance of its smallholder farmers in the last twenty years alemayehu et al 2009 as a result the regional irrigated land has increased from 15 000 ha before 2004 to more than 243 000 ha in 2015 board 2015 furthermore the government has an ambitious plan to irrigate 50 of the total 1 5 million hectares of available arable land in the next 10 15 years period gebresilassie 2014 gtp 2011 to achieve these goals earthen dams and diversions have been constructed continually in the last two decades as a means of harvesting surface water for small and medium scale irrigation developments however despite the satisfactory achievements of the intensification of irrigated agriculture the attention given to field level agricultural water management was non sufficient in addition due to lack of knowledge and awareness of improved irrigated land and water management strategies farmers are using traditional irrigation water application systems consequently irrigation application efficiency remains below 40 in the region mintesinot et al 2004 hagos et al 2016 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 this poor on farm irrigation water management practice has led to waterlogging poor water distribution and salinity development of the irrigated agricultural lands kidane et al 2006 as a result salinity eventually developed in the irrigated agricultural lands of the region especially in the past decades the yield and quality of the cultivated crops were hindered and consequently farmers were forced to change their cropping strategy by introducing mitigation measures mintesinot et al 2004 hagos et al 2016 kifle et al 2017 yohannes et al 2017 gebremeskel et al 2017 as a result farmers have changed crop cultivation strategy from the cereal based cultivation to salinity tolerant commercial crops even if a detailed study is hardly found that could clearly indicate the status and salinity development over time farmers extension experts and research institutions were trying to put some mitigation measures by introducing salinity tolerant improved crops such as potato onion and some drainage facilities through leaching although such mitigation measures were undertaken in the irrigated agricultural areas a considerable irrigated land of the irrigation schemes is converting into unproductive areas as a result of the on site salinity buildups kebede 2009 this indicates adequate field level agricultural land and water management techniques were lacking in the irrigated farmlands kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 kifle et al 2017 yohannes et al 2017 tsegay et al 2015 kifle et al 2008 despite the existence of some local studies on salinity developments in the semi arid region e g yazew 2005 bekele et al 2012 kebede 2009 gebremeskel et al 2017 a comprehensive study to identify the main salinity sources quantifying the magnitude and mapping its spatial distributions is lacking identifying the main driving forces of salinity from the soil itself or the water applied that forms a soluble salt accumulation in the soils of irrigated agriculture is essential in understanding and taking management measures for future agricultural productivity moreover soil depth based salinity status determination at which most crops grow is vital this is helpful to identify whether salts are going down the soil depths or emerging due to capillary rise from the groundwater tables near the surface therefore this study was aimed at understanding the salinity status by quantifying the magnitude mapping its spatial distributions in selected irrigation schemes this study is essential to deliver and put ways forward recommendations for decision makers and irrigation users to improve the agricultural productivity in a sustainable way and minimize the salinity build up in the soil depths of the region and other areas with similar socio economic and agro ecological conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 area description this study was conducted in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia tigray by selecting four districts including hintalo wajirat enderta kilte awlaelo and atsbi wenberta from which nine irrigation schemes were selected for this study fig 1 these irrigation schemes are gereb kunchi gum selassa gereb mehizi and may gassa from hintalo wajirat gereb wedicheber gereb kokhi and arato from enderta korir from kilte awlaelo and tegahne from atsbi wenberta district table 1 and fig 1 the boundary of all studied irrigation schemes was delineated by taking gps points from the irrigation schemes these districts are known for their semi arid climate which is mainly characterized by mixed agriculture with erratic rainfall and sparse vegetation coverage esser et al 2002 gebremeskel et al 2018 cropping practices are dominated by horticultural crop production during the irrigation season and cereal production during rainfed gebremeskel et al 2018 the districts average annual temperature and mean annual rainfall ranges from 19 23 c and 504 543 mm respectively oicha et al 2010 yazew 2005 the irrigation schemes have clay and clay loam soil textural classes table 1 geology of the irrigation schemes is characterized by flood basalt volcanic amba aradam formation antalo super sequence and metamorphic basement rocks gebreyohannes et al 2010 other characteristics such as water sources irrigation potential and actual irrigation capacity of each irrigation scheme are summarized in table 1 2 2 data collection and sampling procedures evaluating the spatial variability of salinity on the basis of soil depth and scheme elevation cross section determines the severity of salinity considering an efficient irrigation strategy is an important factor affecting the depth and scheme elevation of the soil and irrigation water salinity as well as salinity build up in the root zone hence in this study we used soil depth and scheme elevation for ease of data collection and for determining salinity spatially for this study nine irrigation schemes which were reported to have salinity problems are purposely selected table 1 however the existence of salinity in these irrigation schemes was checked after frequent field visit accordingly a total of 717 soil and 13 water samples were collected from these irrigation schemes for further analysis the 717 soil samples were collected 359 from 0 to 15 cm and 358 from 15 to 30 cm soil depth table 2 on a grid basis at the dry season irrigation season from april to may in the year 2015 since the roots of the crops cultivated in the irrigated agriculture are not deeper than 30 cm the soil depths from 0 to 15 and 15 30 cm were selected as means of comparison in salinity analysis the period from june to september was considered as rainy season and october to may was considered as an irrigation season this irrigation season lasts for eight months and farmers grew their crops based on the availability of water in the dams and consultation given by the irrigation development agents in the schemes the april and may are the driest months of the year that produces higher evapotranspiration by leaving back the salts at the surface hence taking data at these months is easier to detect salinity spatially and quantitatively at surface subsurface and different cross sections of the irrigation schemes each sample from each irrigation scheme was taken at the same spot from both soil depths table 2 on the other hand water samples were collected from the source of irrigation water upstream in the middle and the bottom downstream of the irrigation schemes water samples from some of the studied irrigation schemes were not included as water did not exist in the schemes at the time of data collection table 2 as a result only 13 water samples were considered for water analysis to develop maps showing the spatial distribution of the salinity gps readings of all sampling points were collected from each irrigation scheme the collected soil and water samples from each irrigation schemes are summarized in table 2 both spatial and quantitative measurements from the soil and irrigation water samples were analyzed and compared among the irrigation schemes 2 3 data analysis sample analysis was carried out first in the laboratory and then statistical and spatial analysis has followed in this study before proceeding to the laboratory analysis all soil samples were air dried crushed and passed through a 2 mm sieve the 1 5 soil to water ratio suspensions were prepared by weighing 10 g of soil into a pop top tube adding 50 ml of deionized water and shaking for 5 min on an end over end shake yao and yang 2010 laboratory analysis of the soil and water samples were done in mekelle soil research center laboratory of tigray agricultural research institute salinity indicator parameters including ph ec ca2 mg2 hco 3 cl and na2 for the collected soil and water samples and soil texture using hydrometer method were analyzed in the laboratory measurements of these parameters can sufficiently indicate the salinity status of irrigated agriculture abrol et al 1988 ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 2003 the laboratory analysis procedures adopted by pansu and gautheyrou 2006 were applied to analyse these parameters table 3 moreover the quality of the soil and water samples for agricultural use were statistically evaluated through various indices such as the total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar magnesium adsorption ratio mar residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc the permeability index pi and the kelly ratio kr table 5 these measurements and preceding indices are able to capture the salinity of an irrigation scheme ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 2003 equations for obtaining these indices are summarized in table 4 in addition the standard threshold values of the salinity parameters used to compare with the measured values from the irrigation schemes are given in table 5 the threshold values which were used for determining the soil in extract basis and the collected irrigation water samples are explicitly shown in table 5 moreover as indicated in table 5 nine parameters were applied for both soil and water samples whilst other five and two parameters were used independently for soil and water sample analysis respectively the widely accepted recommendation for use of saline water for agriculture is adopted from fao ayers and westcot 1985 for the majority of the salinity parameters after obtaining the results from laboratory and indices a descriptive statistics was made to calculate the mean of each parameter for each irrigation schemes the student t test was used to compare the parameter mean values between the soil depths for each irrigation scheme the t test compares only the locations of the distribution represented by means which is simple and intuitive kim et al 2014 moreover the collected gps readings for each sampling points were used to indicate the spatial distributions of salinity maps of salinity distributions across the irrigation schemes were produced using arc gis tools gis spatial interpolation techniques were employed to map the geo spatial salinity distributions in the irrigation schemes geostatistically the salinity was interpolated by using a universal kriging interpolation method of the spatial tools in the arc gis environment allbed et al 2014 the universal kriging technique is typically useful to incorporate trend wise estimation to accurately estimate the spatial salinity variations similar salinity spatial interpolation approaches have been used worldwide by different authors e g asfaw et al 2016 ni√±erola et al 2017 hence the major salinity indicator parameters i e ph ec and sar for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers of each irrigation scheme were interpolated into maps to show their spatial distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative soil and water salinity assessment the status of the salinity of all irrigation schemes was quantified from both the soil and water samples the analysis of the soil samples is given for each soil depth from 0 to 15 cm table 6 and 15 30 cm table 7 root zone each soil sample was analyzed against 14 salinity parameters as shown in tables 6 and 7 and the water samples were analysed for 11 salinity parameters table 8 moreover a descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken to compare the results obtained from the two soil depths for all the salinity parameters differences among the salinity parameters when compared with the averages of the data taken from each soil depths is non significant data not presented here hence the distributions of the salinity inducing parent materials are equally distributed in the soil depths in order to know if the water in the irrigation schemes has also effects to cause salinity water samples from upper middle and bottom cross sections of the irrigation schemes were analyzed and the results are presented in table 8 differences obtained among the irrigation sections for all the irrigations schemes is lower as compared with their means by the t test statistic method the details of the soil and water analysis results are presented in sections 3 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 laboratory analysis salinity parameters such as ph ec and the exchangeable cations and anions were analyzed in the laboratory and were subjected to statistical analysis as a result the details of these parameters are presented based on laboratory and statistical analysis except the gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes the average ph values of the soil and water samples are generally under the standards to use for irrigation water for both soil layers tables 6 8 the average ph value of gereb kunchi is 8 61 and 8 59 for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depths respectively whilst it is 8 59 and 8 55 for the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depths respectively in taghane scheme table 5 figs 2 and 3 the result of the ph values for both schemes indicated that the observed values of these parameters are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use as compared to the fao standards ayers and westcot 1985 as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the gereb wedicheber and gereb kokhi irrigation schemes are in a position of approaching the threshold values table 5 for all soil depths in addition this tendency is observed in the gereb mihzi irrigation scheme at the 15 30 cm soil depth on the contrary analysis of ph of the collected water samples showed that the irrigation waters are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use the possible reasons could be the availability of complex chemical reaction among the cations and anions in the soil than what was happening to the water besides inherently the soil has complex physical and chemical weathered products that may lead to physical and chemical interactions kidane et al 2006 generally since the average ph values of each irrigation schemes were greater than 7 irrigation scheme tend to have alkaline properties which could lead to salinity table 6 8 abrol et al 1988 the soil and water samples of the irrigation schemes were also analyzed for exchangeable cations na ca2 and mg2 and anions hco 3 and cl concentrations following the procedures given in table 3 accordingly average values of these cations and anions of each irrigation scheme are under the standards prescribed for irrigation water use for both soil depths tables 6 table 7 unlike results from the soil analysis the values of salinity variables in water samples showed variations table 8 for example at the upstream of the gereb kokhi irrigation scheme the value of mg2 is 6 6 meq l which is above the standards to use for irrigation the ca2 has also a tendency to be above the standard in that scheme table 8 the results of the exchangeable anions and cations are relatively higher in the water samples as compared to the soil samples of the irrigation schemes as explained in tables 6 and 7 the average values of ec and tds of the irrigation schemes are under the range of recommended standards for irrigation in both soil depths however the tegahne irrigation scheme for both soil depths figs 2 and 3 and the gereb kunchi for the 15 30 cm soil depth fig 3 reveals greater ec and tds values these results clearly indicate that the observed values of these parameters are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use as compared to the recommended average values 1000 meq l robinove et al 1958 similarly water analysis of the irrigation schemes showed values within the standard which implies the possibility for irrigation use however a tendency of salinization is observed at the upper scheme of gerb kokhi and bottom scheme of korir irrigation schemes generally soil and irrigation water samples having ph greater than 8 4 and ec greater than 4 ds m are considered saline demir et al 2009 ayers and westcot 1985 based on this the quantitative analysis indicated that the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown salinity in these schemes soils are getting abandoned and agricultural lands are becoming out of production the possible reasons for this occurrence could be the availability of salinity inducing parent materials in the soil depths and inappropriate irrigation water management and limited use of drainage by the users since application of irrigation water using the traditional surface canal irrigation system is dominant in all the irrigation schemes these structures are built traditionally lacking a proper design works this has facilitated the occurrence of salinity in the irrigation schemes besides surface irrigation methods such as basin and furrow are the main irrigation methods practiced in the region these methods also lack design standards based on the characteristics of the water potential and command areas these could also be a reason for the occurrence of salinity in the irrigation schemes 3 1 2 salinity indices the salinity of the irrigation schemes was also analyzed based on the salinity indices given in table 4 the average soil and water sar values of each irrigation scheme are not out of range for irrigation purposes table 6 8 and figs 2 3 in this regard the sar parameter does not show any significant differences among the irrigation schemes for both the soil and water samples the mar value is dependent on the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the soil and water samples these elements often make a state of equilibrium in the soil or water solutions salifu et al 2015 when mar value is greater than 50 crop production is hardly possible table 5 raghunath 1987 gupta and gupta 1987 the mar results of the irrigation schemes for the soil samples for both soil depths show average values under the maximum permissible limit table 6 and 7 hence salinity effects associated with magnesium concentration in the irrigation schemes are infrequent the average values of the residual sodium carbonate rsc and residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc from each irrigation scheme have significant implications with regard to the salinity effects the rsc values greater than 2 5 meq l are not recommended for irrigation table 5 cfc 1975 as a result the average values obtained from all irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use table 5 the recommended value for rsbc is also acceptable when it is less than 1 25 meq l cfc 1975 rsbc values greater than the standard value is non existent in any of the irrigation schemes this explicitly shows that bi carbonate concentrations available in the irrigation schemes could not hinder crop growth furthermore the estimated rsc and rsbc values also didn t show any clear significant differences amid each soil depths if the permeability index pi value exceeds 65 water is considered suitable for irrigation table 5 doneen 1964 if the average kelly ratio kr values of a given irrigation scheme have values less than one the water can be used for irrigation purpose table 5 sundaray et al 2009 accordingly the average values of the water and soil samples collected from each irrigation scheme are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use tables 6 8 in most of the irrigation schemes the average kr values collected from the soil depths are above the standards for irrigation uses exceptions occurred for the may gassa and korir for both soil depths gereb kokhi 0 15 cm and tegahne 15 30 cm schemes which are below standards to use for irrigation in contrast the water samples taken from all cross sections of the irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation uses table 8 the direct results from the laboratory and those derived from the indices show the existence of salinity in the irrigation schemes it is proved that the soils and irrigation waters contain a significant amount of dissolved salts in contrast dissolved salt variations between the soil depths are non significant which implies the soil depth 0 30 cm has consistent salinity levels as most of the irrigated crops in the region have root depths not greater than 30 cm they can be stressed by salinity effects due to the high concentration of salts in the soil and irrigation water consequently crop growth would be limited and hence crop productivity is largely impaired sufficient leaching facilities in the soil profiles substantiated by adding ameliorative agents such as gypsum can reduce the salinity effects in the plants root zone tanji et al 2015 3 2 spatial distributions of soil salinity identifying spatial salinity distribution within the schemes is helpful for irrigation users and decision makers to put solutions for all or parts of the irrigation schemes the results of the spatial soil salinity distribution presented in this section is from soil sample analysis only therefore gridded spatial salinity maps of the nine irrigation schemes were developed for the sar ph and ec parameters spatial salinity maps are given for irrigation schemes of arato fig 4 may gassa fig 5 and gereb kunchi fig 6 the spatial maps of the remaining schemes are presented in supplementary data a fig 1a 6a we used the location of the water sources dam diversion point given in each figure as reference points to identify the irrigation schemes spatial salinity distribution 3 2 1 sar spatial distribution as indicated in figs 4 6 and supplementary data a the sar spatial distributions are given in soil depth basis 0 15 cm 15 30 cm soil depths gereb wedicheber tegahne korir and gereb kokhi irrigation schemes have shown relatively higher sar values at the downstream scheme for both soil depths while gum selassa and gereb mihizi showed higher values at the upstream schemes for both soil depths the gereb kunchi however showed a maximum value at the downstream for the 0 15 cm soil depth while the maximum values for the 15 30 cm soil were found at upstream schemes in contrast the arato irrigation scheme has a maximum value in the middle of the irrigation scheme in general there are no consistent sar variations among the irrigation schemes and between the soil depths comparing to the recommended standards of fao ayers and westcot 1985 the spatial distribution maps of sar for all irrigation schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use for both soil depths however the data suggest that salinity in these schemes are increasing despite the fact that it has not significantly hindered the soil and hence agricultural productivity 3 2 2 ph spatial distribution unlike the sar the ph maps have a consistent variation among the irrigation schemes except for arato which exhibited high ph in the upstream virtually all irrigation schemes have maximum ph values in the downstream cross sections the location specific maximum ph value of the irrigation schemes are presented as in arato 9 1 fig 4 gereb kunchi 9 2 fig 6 gereb wedicheber 8 8 supplementary data fig 6a korir 8 5 supplementary data fig 4a gum selassa 8 52 supplementary data fig 3a and tegahne 8 8 supplementary data fig 5a the observed salinity parameter values of these irrigation schemes are above the standards prescribed for irrigation water use this clearly indicates that it can draw an attention towards putting adaptation strategies in the irrigation schemes generally the studied irrigation schemes have shown an increasing trend towards salinity for both soil depths especially in the downstream areas this could be because of the geographical positions where the soil and water properties of the upper schemes flow and concentrate towards the downstream cross sections 3 2 3 ec spatial distribution the ec maps of each irrigation scheme are also presented in figs 4 6 and the supplementary data a 1a 6a yet clear sign on the consistency of ec values for the upper middle and downstream cross sections of the irrigation schemes is lacking among the irrigation schemes higher ec values were obtained in the upstream of gum selassa may gassa tegahne and gereb wedicheber whereas maximum values were observed at the downstream of arato and korir irrigation schemes the soil ec directly correlates with particle size soil texture nutrient and organic matter content and cation exchange capacity allbed et al 2014 this indicates irrigation schemes having finer soil particles exhibits higher soil ec and vice versa even though most of the irrigation schemes have clay to clay loam soil texture table 1 this didn t guarantee a consistent ec values along the cross sections the gereb kunchi irrigation scheme is characterized differently in where very high ec values with clear variations between the soil depths were observed this irrigation scheme has a maximum value of 5 94 ds m in the 0 15 cm and 10 12 ds m in the 15 30 cm which is categorized as suppressing for plants to grow ayers and westcot 1985 the spatial distribution map of each irrigation scheme has helped to show spatial salinity variations for the ph ec and sar parameters despite the majority of the schemes are below the standards prescribed for irrigation water use the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown a higher magnitude of soil salinity our findings are also supported by different studies which reported salinity in most irrigation schemes of the region for example yazew 2005 have confirmed higher soil salinity presence in gum selassa than korir irrigation scheme similarly haile et al 2002 revealed salinity at the top middle and bottom cross sections of the gum selassa irrigation scheme salinity build up in the root zone depends on several factors such as quality of irrigation water irrigation strategy crops being grown soil type groundwater depth the soil parent material the geological formations and soil forming factors such as climate topography and vegetation demir et al 2009 qureshi et al 2007 this was more pronounced when a spatial salinity analysis have been considered in the irrigation schemes as a result spatial variations in the vertical and horizontal directions have been observed after spatial salinity maps were developed for the schemes in this study gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have shown salinity levels that prohibit crop production this indicates 33 of the irrigation schemes have salinity that requires mitigation measures the gum selassa and gereb kunchi are found in nearby locations having similar vertisols soil parent material with clay soil textural type as indicated by kidane et al 2006 the possible drivers of salinity for these schemes were due to the poor management of irrigation water and the parent material irrigation was started in 1996 in both schemes and salinity incidence have started to occur after 10 years from the start of irrigation kidane et al 2006 the soils of these irrigation schemes were developed from alluvium volcanic origin under less than 400 mm annual rainfall characterized by the semi arid environment kidane et al 2006 yazew 2005 similarly the tegahne irrigation scheme has salinity effects due to the lower amount of rainfall under the clay loam soil textural type this scheme has a sedimentary rock parent material as a base for the creation of all its forefront characteristics including its salinity development irrigation has been practiced for 21 years after its earthen dam was built in 1996 and salinity was observed to occur in the first 5 years of irrigation yazew 2005 the irrigation water management crop and soil type soil parent material the geological formations and soil forming factors have a tendency for the occurrence of salinity incidence in the irrigation schemes yazew 2005 the underlying nature of these irrigation schemes may also aggravate the dynamic nature of salinity occurrence in the schemes spatial salinity variations are observed in the irrigation schemes that may need location specific coping strategies results from both quantitative and spatial analysis showed that there are two sources of salinity primary and secondary in the irrigation schemes the primary salinization is merely due to the saline nature of the underlying parent materials inherently gained this type of salinization existed in some of the irrigation schemes e g the tehagne irrigation but was not the main reason for the salinity to occur in the schemes the gereb kunchi may gassa gereb mihzi and gum selassa are found in the vicinity having similar environmental and geological locations however they have different salinity levels where salinity in gum selassa and gereb kunchi is above the standard salinity levels while the remaining schemes are below the standard this could be an indication that salinity sources from the parent material are not the main cause for the salinity to occur in the irrigation schemes moreover the difference in the time of the irrigation commencement is also observed in the irrigation schemes which may be another means of salinity variations coupled with the inefficient use of the agricultural water management in the schemes salinity sources emerged as a function of unwise anthropogenic human activities on irrigation water use is secondary salinization tanji et al 2015 this is virtually the main source of salinity over the studied irrigation schemes substantiated by the semi arid geographical locations of the irrigation schemes as indicated by kidane et al 2006 and yazew 2005 most of the irrigation schemes in the semi arid northern ethiopia tigray have been affected by salinity right after some years of irrigation practices this is mainly attributed to the lack of proper use of the agricultural water water is applied without knowing for how long how much water is needed for a specific crop of interest for at least eight months of the year besides the irrigation season is merely dry season where evapotranspiration is high as compared to the rainy season this evapotranspiration could eventually become a cause for greater concentration of soluble salts in the crop root zone as a result most horticultural crops grown in the irrigation schemes are suppressed by the high concentration of salts in the soil tanji et al 2015 moreover farmers don t follow the crop rotation system to crop production in the irrigation schemes yohannes et al 2017 although cropping systems are an effective strategy for salinity alleviation ni√±erola et al 2017 nowadays irrigation schemes are developing in tigray hagos et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 although concerns associated with possible salinity effects are non sufficient besides irrigation is still needed to increase agricultural production to satisfy food requirements in the semi arid areas as a result higher concentration of salts in the plants root zone are inevitable to face the irrigation schemes asfaw et al 2016 this may aggravate the intensity and effects of salinity in the region proper management of agricultural water towards reducing salinity is vital for increased crop production in the irrigation schemes hence quick implementation strategies towards salinity reduction and prevention could have petential benefits to the people these could be in terms of soil amendment additions such as gypsum and organic manures effective use of water applications based on the crop water requirements and it is also better to introduce drainage facilities for leaching the soluble salts hence leaching of the salts before planting should also be a prerequisite for crop establishment by far the development and introduction of salt tolerant crops are vital for the schemes moreover improved cultural practices such as precision land levelling zero tillage and bed forming methods of planting have shown reduced levels of salinity development qureshi et al 2007 these resource conservation techniques are widely used in arid and semi arid areas for growing crops one of the major bottle necks in persuading farmers to use saline soil and water resources for agricultural production is the lack of proper guidelines for farmers this can help farmers in using poor quality water irrigation amounts and frequencies which help to avoid salt accumulation in the plant root zone the soil and irrigation water should be managed carefully in the irrigation schemes prone to soil salinity to avoid further soil and water deterioration 4 conclusions sustainability of irrigated agriculture depends on the productivity of the soil and water resources however these resources are threatened by salinity to varying extent and severity on the irrigation schemes of tigray expansion of salt affected soils in the irrigation schemes is increasing as a result of recent irrigated agriculture intensifications however the magnitude and spatial distribution of salinity developments occurred in the irrigation schemes are yet unknown the results of this study showed that about 67 of the irrigation scheme s salinity level of both soil and water is above the standard to be used for irrigation however quantitative analysis of the soil and water samples and mapping of the spatial distributions of salinity showed that the gum selassa gereb kunchi and tegahne irrigation schemes have higher salinity levels the spatial analysis of ph shows higher value at downstream parts of the schemes while sar and ec did not show consistent variations among the irrigation schemes despite the fact that the parent material underlying the surface has sources of salinity poor agricultural water management is the main source of salinity in the irrigation schemes lack of appropriate agricultural management strategies towards proper irrigation water management and non sufficient use of ameliorative and drainage facilities leaching has resulted in salinity moreover sources from the parent material have also intrinsically saline nature that caused the salinization of soil and water resources in the irrigated agriculture a multidimensional community based salinity management strategy on the basis of awareness creations and creating a sense of ownership could possibly be useful for overwhelming developments of the irrigated agriculture awareness creation on farmers extension workers and relevant stakeholders could help to address salinity effects through proper land and irrigation water management strategies in the irrigation schemes moreover policymakers can consider salinity effects side by side with the developments of irrigated agriculture in the region acknowledgements this research work was financed by the tigray agricultural research institute
