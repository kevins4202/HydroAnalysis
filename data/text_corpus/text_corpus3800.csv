19000,when acidic groundwater flows into an aquatic system the sediment water interface swi acts as a transition zone between the groundwater and lake water and often exhibits strong physical and biogeochemical gradients the fate of groundwater borne solutes such as fe ii is determined by the balance between the exposure time during transport across the swi and the reaction time within the swi however the relative role of groundwater seepage rates and iron kinetics on acidity generation in lakes is unknown porewater seepage velocities porewater chemical profiles and limnological data were collected across multiple field campaigns over the last two decades in acid mine lake 77 in lusatia germany this rare data set was analyzed using a damköhler approach that compares exposure and reactions timescales to determine that fe ii would typically be transported with little reaction across the swi spatially separating it from sediment processes that produce alkalinity and providing a source of acidity to the lake this damköhler analysis further showed that remediation should be focused on reducing groundwater seepage velocities and enhancing exposure times strategic planting of submerged benthic macroalgae would slow groundwater inflows as well as oxygenating overlying waters and supplying organic matter to the sediments a similar damköhler analysis could be used to assess

et al 1989 these gradients are acute in systems impacted by acid mine drainage amd neumann et al 2013 the exchange between groundwater and overlying waters varies over years with climate seasonally or during storm events rosenberry et al 2015 and can alter the sediment porewater composition schuster et al 2003 biogeochemical processes in the sediments blodau 2005 as well as onshore ecosystems sebestyen and schneider 2004 flushing of the overlying water into sediment porewater and the advective flow of groundwater into the overlying water are significant pathways in facilitating the transfer of solutes across the swi frei et al 2012 webster et al 1994 these can include carbon oxygen nutrients pollutants and acidity many of these solutes also undergo chemical transformation while being transported across the swi neumann et al 2013 the fate of solutes being advected across the sediment water interface depends on the balance between the rates of microbial or chemical reactions under the ambient conditions and transport dorsett et al 2011 showed that changing submarine groundwater discharge sgd into coastal waters altered sub surface residence times and impacted on the cycling and fluxes of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon into the nearshore region roy et al 2013 demonstrated that superimposing redox gradients on variable sgd seepage rates created a complex interplay between iron cycling and hydrology that moderated iron fluxes into coastal waters a similar dynamic is expected to occur in systems impacted by amd however the relative role of groundwater seepage rates and iron kinetics on acidity generation is unknown lake sediments impacted by amd are characterized by an acidity driven iron cycle peine et al 2000 regenspurg et al 2004 which is highly sensitive to redox conditions amd results from the oxidation of pyrite eq 1 1 fes 2 3 5 o 2 2 so 4 2 fe 2 2 h creating moderately acidic ph 5 6 groundwater rich in fe ii and so4 that seeps towards the swi of receiving waters where it is exposed to oxygen and the fe2 eventually becoming oxidized to a ferric hydroxide acidifying the lakes groundwater seepage rates may vary over years with climate seasonally or during storm events rosenberry et al 2015 and impact the redox gradients at the sediment water interface peine et al 2000 used mass balance calculations to establish an acidity balance for the sediment porewater and the water of a lake impacted by amd they showed that the acidity generation through fe ii oxidation directly at the swi was balanced by alkalinity gain eq 2 through

so 4 2 h this maintains an acidity gradient at the sediment water interface superimposed on the redox gradient in the acidic layers iron reduction outcompetes sulfate reduction blodau et al 1998

dynamic balance between advection and reaction the controls on such dynamic balances can be elucidated by the dimensionless damköhler number da that has been used extensively in the discipline of chemical engineering to classify a system according to the balance between transport and reaction the damköhler number is given as eq 1 7 da τ t τ r where τ t is the transport or advection timescale and τ r is the reaction timescale michalak 2000 used da to characterize the appearance of chemical sorption peaks in simulation experiments ocampo et al 2006 explored the removal of nitrate by riparian zones and demonstrated that 50 nitrate removal occurred when da 1 and increased to nearly 100 at da 2 20 carleton 2002 explored residence time distributions in treatment wetlands their impact on da and contaminant removal kurtz and peiffer 2011 demonstrated that surface complexation needs to be considered to explain the increase of feooh turnover rates by dissolved s ii with increasing da numbers battiato and tartakovsky 2011 used da in combination with multiple scale expansions to upscale from micro pore scale reaction diffusion advection processes to derive macro averaged governing equations more recently oldham et al 2013 introduced a generalized da that replaced the transport timescale with an exposure timescale the latter timescale was defined as the time over which the solute has an opportunity to be processed this concept is crucial in systems with variable redox conditions such as those impacted by amd the solute must be transported through an environment that is conducive to reaction in this paper field data and the damköhler approach were used to explore the relative controls of groundwater seepage and iron kinetics on acidification data from an intensive field experiment conducted on a lake impacted by amd were used to explore opportunities for amelioration of acidity and finally discuss consequences for remediation of these acidic systems while the focus in this paper is on amd systems the damköhler approach provides a relatively simple analysis tool that can be applied to any system that experiences inflows of reactive groundwater 2 methods 2 1 site description lignite mining has been extensive in the lusatia region of germany since the 1890 s and mining lakes emerged with the closure of open cast mines and the subsequent higher water tables friese et al 1998 the larger mining lakes in lusatia fig 1 are flooded with ph neutral river water however most of the smaller lakes contain acidic waters ph 2 4 of high ionic strength meier et al 2004 primary production is low in these lakes and acidity is produced by the weathering of overburden materials through the oxidation of pyrite and subsequently transported to surface waters via groundwater flow meier et al 2004 acidity in the lake waters is primarily attributed to the oxidation of ferrous iron after infiltration and its subsequent precipitation as iron oxide mineral blodau 2006 mining lake 77 ml77 was formed about 100 km south of berlin during the late 1960s fig 1 peine et al 2000 this headwater lake is part of a chain of lakes that is connected by small canals and drains into the river schwarze elster ml77 is surficially connected to ml114 upstream and ml76 downstream via drainage ditches the lower regional tertiary aquifer is separated from the upper aquifer complex by the mined 2nd lusatia coal seam the upper aquifer complex consists of tertiary and quaternary sediments mostly silt sand and gravel which were removed during active mining neumann et al 2013 the northern shoreline of ml77 was formed by the pyrite rich mining dumps whereas undisturbed tertiary sediments dominate the southeast region of the lake fig 2 the mine tailings mainly consist of sands with a pyrite content of 1 4 g fes 2 per kg peine et al 2000 the direction of groundwater flow is from north and northeast to southwest neumann et al 2013 ml77 has a maximum depth of 8 m with a surface area of 24 4 ha the mean potential evaporation at the lake is 2 6 mm d and the mean precipitation is 1 5 mm d beer 2012 pers comm the water residence time in the lake is approximately 2 years peine et al 2000 a weir exists at the outlet of the downstream lake ml76 see fig 1 to regulate the water level of the lakes upstream including ml77 neumann et al 2013 the lake is meromictic with dimictic stratification in the upper waters during the summer and winter months beer 2013 ml77 is strongly affected by acid mine drainage and the chemistry of the lake water is dominated by sulfate and ferric iron with a low ph of 2 8 neumann et al 2013 the iron hydroxyl sulfate minerals schwertmannite and goethite are abundant in the sediments of ml77 groundwater exchange rates observed in the lake range between approximately 10 l m2 d and 20 l m2 d neumann 2013 much higher rates have been recorded at a central hotspot site 25 fig 2 where the groundwater entering the lake is not affected by acid mine drainage fleckenstein et al 2009 in general groundwater surface water exchange rates are higher near the northern dump area and in shallow water depths neumann et al 2013 the patterns of groundwater surface water exchange are spatially and temporally heterogeneous in the north of the lake groundwater is predominantly exfiltrating at a relatively steady rate whereas fluxes in the south alternate between the exfiltration and infiltration neumann et al 2013 2 2 existing data set an extensive data set neumann et al 2013 was available for this study the seepage rates and pore water chemistry data were collected at ml77 between 2008 and 2009 as described in neumann et al 2013 at the shallow sites sites 1 19 fig 2 seepage meters with collection bags were deployed at the bottom of the lake seepage meters were installed by scuba divers at the deeper sites sites 20 25 and the bags were fixed to a buoy and lowered to about 0 5 m below the water surface to reduce the effects of wind and waves neumann et al 2013 pore water peepers 60 cm long and 1 cm peeper resolution were installed to determine concentration depth profiles of chemical species in the sediment porewater neumann et al 2013 the peepers were placed within 1 m from the seepage meters to minimise the effects of small scale heterogeneity on the different flux estimates the peepers were deployed by scuba divers and were removed between summer 2008 and spring 2009 the peepers were allowed to equilibrate for three weeks before sampling neumann et al 2013 after retrieval the ph fe ii and sulfate concentrations were determined in the lab eighteen sites were selected for spatial analysis of pore water and seepage rates from june 2008 to march 2009 the eighteen sites were also used for temporal analysis of seepage rates from february 2008 to october 2009 with temporal porewater chemistry additionally recorded for five sites from june to october 2009 the sediment was sampled with a gravity corer at thirteen sites in november and december of 2008 for analysis of porosity and mineralogy neumann et al 2013 2 3 data analysis the conservative transport of fe ii as it travels across the swi was assessed by calculating damköhler numbers for fe ii using the measured fluxes and solute concentrations the reaction timescale of fe ii oxidation required for calculation of da is highly dependent on ph eq 8 and can be derived using the rate law given by stumm and lee 1961 8 d f e i i d t k a b i o p o 2 o h 2 f e i i where p o 2 is the partial pressure of oxygen atm and kabio is the abiotic rate constant 1 5 1013 l2 mol atm min at 25 c at low ph abiotic fe ii oxidation is faster than microbial oxidation kirby et al 1999 thus the use of the abiotic rate for our application oldham et al 2013 equation 8 can be rewritten as 9 d f e i i d t k f e i i where 10 k k a b i o p o 2 o h 2 hence 11 τ r f e i i h 2 k a b i o p o 2 k w 2 where kw is the ionic product of water 10 14 mol2 l equation 11 shows that τ r increases by two orders of magnitude per ph unit increase for the purposes of our application the ph values used for the da determinations were measured at a depth of 1 cm below the swi optically identified by the occurrence of precipitates in the peeper water it is further assumed that an o2 saturation of 80 occurred in the swi p o 2 0 16 atm the exposure timescale eq 12 is parameterised as 12 τ e l u s advection controlled l 2 d diffusion controlled where l is the thickness of the still to be defined swi layer m us is the seepage velocity m d and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient for fe ii in water m2 day 1 the non dimensional peclet number eq 13 13 p e u s l d was used to determine whether the system was advection or diffusion dominated to infer the appropriate parameterization of τ e oldham et al 2013 applying this framework to the transport of fe ii across the swi if da 1 the transport of fe ii occurs faster than its reaction i e fe ii is transported conservatively under these conditions fe ii is not retained at the swi and in lake oxidation occurs followed by acidification conversely if da 1 fe ii reacts faster than it is transported across the swi and it will be retained there when da 1 63 of fe ii in the exfiltrating groundwater is consumed within the swi layer oldham et al 2013 when da 2 3 90 of fe ii is consumed within the swi layer for the purposes of this paper reactive transport is defined as occurring when at least 63 of fe ii is consumed da 1 3 results 3 1 seepage rates the seepage rates recorded in ml77 were both spatially and temporally variable in the north of the lake near the mining dumps the groundwater lake water exchange patterns at the sediment water interface were dominated by groundwater exfiltration fig 3 this reflects the regional groundwater flow from northeast to southwest the rates of groundwater seepage were highly variable with some sites exhibiting seepage rates below 1 l m2 d throughout the year and others reaching upwards of 15 l m2 d at certain times of the year in the south of ml77 the exchange patterns at the sediment water interface were more varied with the seepage alternating between exfiltration and infiltration of groundwater site 25 exhibited seepage rates that exceeded all other sites fluxes of groundwater ranged from 175 to 264 l m2 d fleckenstien et al 2009 attributed these higher fluxes to preferential flow from the deeper tertiary aquifer which became hydraulically connected to the upper quaternary aquifer as a result of the excavation of parts of the separating aquitard during mining such phenomena are a common feature of mining lakes this site is discussed in more detail in fleckenstein et al 2009 3 2 porewater chemistry and sediment water interfaces the porewater profiles of ph and fe ii concentrations for each site were consistent with the observations of past studies at sites with predominantly exfiltrating groundwater a distinct ph gradient was visible in the top 5 cm of the sediment fig 4 an increase in acidity was notable in this region for all sites with a stronger more distinct ph gradient exhibited at sites with predominantly exfiltrating groundwater from a ph of 5 6 to a ph of around 3 strong fe ii concentration gradients were also prominent at such sites e g site 5 in fig 4 the concentration and ph gradients were less steep and well defined at sites where alternating groundwater flux directions were apparent e g site 2 in fig 4 the sediment surface was defined as the point at which a very steep chemocline in fe ii concentrations was measured within the sediments this was set as zero depth in the porewater profiles an examination of all profiles close to this zero point highlighted that above the sediment chemocline additional more gradual chemoclines were evident in the water column fig 5 there was variability in the gradient of water column chemocline the height of the chemocline above the sediment surface and the water column concentrations this chemocline variability was likely impacted by exfiltration velocities and whether the hypolimnion of the lake was oxic or anoxic at the time of profiling see fig 5 one of the challenges is the definition of the swi layer through which the fe ii passes prior to being incorporated into the overlying lake water the definition of this layer will in turn determine its effective thickness fe ii oxidation only starts once fe ii is exposed to dissolved oxygen it can be assumed that typically this precludes the reaction occurring within the sediment porewater if fe ii passes through the viscous boundary layer with a thickness typically of o 10 cm furrer and wehrli 1996 lorke and peeters 2006 then it will be incorporated into the ambient lake hydrodynamics transported away from the swi and mixed with interior waters alternatively if fe ii is consumed fully within the diffusive boundary layer with a thickness typically of o 0 1 cm jørgensen and des marais 1990 then it will not be transported into the lake interior the measured water column chemoclines fig 6 suggest that the swi layer defined as the thickness of the water column chemocline is o 1 cm this swi layer can be conceptualized as a mixing length l that defines the thickness of a water column concentration gradient of a conservative tracer originating in the groundwater and being transported across the swi via exfiltration if the seepage rate is low l will only be slightly larger than the diffusive boundary layer thickness with increasing seepage rates groundwater moves further from the swi where the tracer is exposed to the higher flows of the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer grant and marusic 2011 and l becomes larger it is expected that l o 0 1 10 cm i e somewhere between the thickness of the diffusive and viscous boundary layers the thicknesses of the measured water column chemoclines fig 6 led to the choice of three length scales 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m representing the thickness of the swi for the subsequent analyses the sensitivity of da to our choice of l is explored in more detail below 4 discussion 4 1 fe ii exits the sediments a range of seepage velocities were used to explore their impact on the degree to which fe ii is transported conservatively across the swi under groundwater exfiltrating conditions to cover the range of observed water column chemocline thicknesses fig 6 three different length scales were used that simulated the lower middle and upper bounds of the expected l 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m and explored the effect of diffusive versus advective conditions via pe analysis on da distributions fig 7 there is a general trend of increasing pe values with length scale and in some samples this included a regime shift from diffusion controlled conditions q1 or qiv to advection controlled conditions qii or qiii the majority of data sit in qiii and qiv indicating conservative fe ii transport log da 0 was occurring under both diffusive qiv or advective conditions qiii reactive transport of fe ii was indicated at l 0 01 m only when log pe values 0 qi fig 7 that is under diffusion controlled conditions for advective conditions reactive behavior was predicted only for l 0 1 m at one single site site 21 on 1 09 2009 with log pe being only slightly larger than 0 pe 1 12 the seepage velocity was low 0 04 cm d and the ph was relatively high ph 5 55 thus while there is uncertainty in the actual length scale of the swi in almost all cases examined in this study the majority of fe ii exited the sediment without oxidation to be transported and mixed into the overlying water column this analysis shows that retention of fe ii in ml 77 can be expected only under very specific conditions i e a combination of a comparatively low seepage velocity ph 5 and a mixing layer thickness 0 01 m our analysis therefore suggests that in ml 77 fe ii oxidation occurred in the water column and could subsequently trigger the generation of acidity within the lake the analysis agrees with previous mass balances that suggested that acidity generation occurs within the lake not at the swi peine et al 2000 having validated this approach the more general requirements for fe ii to be oxidized at the swi is explored below therefore moderating acidity generation in the lake to these ends ph and seepage velocities were systematically varied over the three mixing lengths already used in our analyses fig 8 a ph range between 5 and 7 was chosen as measured in pore water just below the swi koschorreck et al 2007 fig 4 and across which reactive behavior of fe ii can be expected seepage velocities us were varied from 0 02 to 10 cm d indicated by the different coloured lines in fig 8 covering the range of seepage velocities reported in the review of rosenberry et al 2015 for the longest mixing length 0 1 m do concentration was also varied from 80 0 16 atm where oxic lake water is transported to the mixing layer without prior reaction with other reduced substances to 0 08 0 016 atm where do consumption e g by respiration of organic matter has occurred prior to reaching the mixing layer from the analysis of our field data it is evident that diffusive conditions log pe 0 predominate at the lowest mixing length similarly when l 0 001 m in our scenarios fig 7a log pe 0 for all seepage velocities except us 10 cm d data not shown and therefore for us 0 02 2 cm d the exposure timescale τe was controlled by the diffusive timescales and therefore independent of seepage velocity this results in the lines for us 0 02 2 cm d directly overlaying each other when l 0 01 m fig 7b log pe 0 for us 0 02 and 0 1 cm d implying that again diffusion controls transport and τe and these the lines lie directly on top of each other for l 0 01 m and us 0 5 cm d transport is controlled by advection and therefore τe is sensitive to seepage velocity with increasing mixing length diffusive conditions become less relevant for l 0 1 m τe becomes controlled by advection and therefore increasing seepage velocities change τe and da for each mixing length l critical ph thresholds exist below which no effective turnover occurs log da 0 the ph thresholds decrease with increasing l and decreasing seepage velocity corresponding to an increase in exposure time τe at a do saturation of 80 the ph threshold decreases from ph 7 at l 0 001 diffusion controlled conditions τe 0 03 days to ph 5 at l 0 1 m advection controlled conditions us 0 02 cm d τe 282 days the ph threshold at this mixing length for the highest seepage rate us 10 m d τe 1 day is ph 6 2 even under low do conditions as we would expect during lake stratification there is still a window of reaction for low seepage velocities fig 7d at a mixing length scale of 0 1 m the threshold ranges from ph 5 5 us 0 2 cm d τe 282 days to ph 6 7 us 10 m d τe 1 day 4 2 implications for remediation of amd impacted waterways this analysis has shown that the key process for acidification of amd impacted waterways is in lake oxidation of fe ii the spatial separation of the in lake fe ii oxidation from in sediment alkalinity generation leads to lake acidification and this is likely to be common in water bodies receiving inflow of fe ii and so4 2 containing groundwater attempts at in situ remediation of acid mine lakes by the addition of organic matter to stimulate sulfate reduction and alkalinity generation have failed these processes could not balance in lake acidity production geller et al 2009 a damköhler analysis was used to demonstrate that if there is sufficient exposure time during transport across the swi the transfer of fe ii into the surface water body may be prevented oxidation of fe ii would occur at the interface and be subject to internal redox cycling of fe ii peine et al 2000 established an acidity generation balance for ml 77 and determined that internal cycling generated acidity at a rate of 1 0 4 7 mmol m2 a and consumed acidity by microbial iron reduction at a rate of 0 7 3 8 mmol m2 a in contrast in lake generation of acidity occurred at a rate of 16 20 mmol m2 a koschorreck and tittel 2007 determined the critical acidity load that can be compensated for by internal sediment processes in mining lakes to be 1 8 mmol m2 a in productive lakes and 0 18 mmol m2 a in less productive lakes these estimates together with our analysis suggest remediation measures must focus on methods to enhance the oxidation of fe ii at the swi and in particular they must increase the exposure time of groundwater seepage cross the diffusive and viscous boundary layers one remediation measure that may be utilized to this end is the establishment of submerged macrophytes at the locations where groundwater seepage is observed submerged macrophytes would support remediation efforts in two ways by increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations close the to swi contributing to a direct source of organic carbon to the sediments via photosynthesis and therefore promoting rapid fe ii oxidation and by decreasing the in lake hydrodynamics adjacent to the swi nepf 2012 there is a paucity of literature on macrophyte abundance in acidic mine lakes however tittel and kamjunke 2004 concluded that benthic algae would provide a far greater alkalinity source compared to pelagic phytoplankton the additional benefits of slowing groundwater seepage to enhance reactivity and retention of groundwater borne solutes at the swi have not yet been explored 5 conclusions this paper has successfully demonstrated the use of a simple but powerful damköhler analysis to explore the fate of groundwater borne fe ii seeping into a mine lake the analysis highlighted that fe ii would typically be transported with little reaction across the swi providing a source of acidity to the lake waters and spatially separating it from sediment processes that produce alkalinity this transport of unreacted fe ii into the lake waters may explain the challenges experienced in lake remediation experiments our analysis suggests that remediation may be more effective if focused on establishing submerged benthic macroalgae in regions where groundwater seepage is found to our knowledge this has not been previously tested the usefulness of damköhler analyses is not restricted to the context of this

on da and contaminant removal kurtz and peiffer 2011 demonstrated that surface complexation needs to be considered to explain the increase of feooh turnover rates by dissolved s ii with increasing da numbers battiato and tartakovsky 2011 used da in combination with multiple scale expansions to upscale from micro pore scale reaction diffusion advection processes to derive macro averaged governing equations more recently oldham et al 2013 introduced a generalized da that replaced the transport timescale with an exposure timescale the latter timescale was defined as the time over which the solute has an opportunity to be processed this concept is crucial in systems with variable redox conditions such as those impacted by amd the solute must be transported through an environment that is conducive to reaction in this paper field data and the damköhler approach were used to explore the relative controls of groundwater seepage and iron kinetics on acidification data from an intensive field experiment conducted on a lake impacted by amd were used to explore opportunities for amelioration of acidity and finally discuss consequences for remediation of these acidic systems while the focus in this paper is on amd systems the damköhler approach provides a relatively simple analysis tool that can be applied to any system that experiences inflows of reactive groundwater 2 methods 2 1 site description lignite mining has been extensive in the lusatia region of germany since the 1890 s and mining lakes emerged with the closure of open cast mines and the subsequent higher water tables friese et al 1998 the larger mining lakes in lusatia fig 1 are flooded with ph neutral river water however most of the smaller lakes contain acidic waters ph 2 4 of high ionic strength meier et al 2004 primary production is low in these lakes and acidity is produced by the weathering of overburden materials through the oxidation of pyrite and subsequently transported to surface waters via groundwater flow meier et al 2004 acidity in the lake waters is primarily attributed to the oxidation of ferrous iron after infiltration and its subsequent precipitation as iron oxide mineral blodau 2006 mining lake 77 ml77 was formed about 100 km south of berlin during the late 1960s fig 1 peine et al 2000 this headwater lake is part of a chain of lakes that is connected by small canals and drains into the river schwarze elster ml77 is surficially connected to ml114 upstream and ml76 downstream via drainage ditches the lower regional tertiary aquifer is separated from the upper aquifer complex by the mined 2nd lusatia coal seam the upper aquifer complex consists of tertiary and quaternary sediments mostly silt sand and gravel which were removed during active mining neumann et al 2013 the northern shoreline of ml77 was formed by the pyrite rich mining dumps whereas undisturbed tertiary sediments dominate the southeast region of the lake fig 2 the mine tailings mainly consist of sands with a pyrite content of 1 4 g fes 2 per kg peine et al 2000 the direction of groundwater flow is from north and northeast to southwest neumann et al 2013 ml77 has a maximum depth of 8 m with a surface area of 24 4 ha the mean potential evaporation at the lake is 2 6 mm d and the mean precipitation is 1 5 mm d beer 2012 pers comm the water residence time in the lake is approximately 2 years peine et al 2000 a weir exists at the outlet of the downstream lake ml76 see fig 1 to regulate the water level of the lakes upstream including ml77 neumann et al 2013 the lake is meromictic with dimictic stratification in the upper waters during the summer and winter months beer 2013 ml77 is strongly affected by acid mine drainage and the chemistry of the lake water is dominated by sulfate and ferric iron with a low ph of 2 8 neumann et al 2013 the iron hydroxyl sulfate minerals schwertmannite and goethite are abundant in the sediments of ml77 groundwater exchange rates observed in the lake range between approximately 10 l m2 d and 20 l m2 d neumann 2013 much higher rates have been recorded at a central hotspot site 25 fig 2 where the groundwater entering the lake is not affected by acid mine drainage fleckenstein et al 2009 in general groundwater surface water exchange rates are higher near the northern dump area and in shallow water depths neumann et al 2013 the patterns of groundwater surface water exchange are spatially and temporally heterogeneous in the north of the lake groundwater is predominantly exfiltrating at a relatively steady rate whereas fluxes in the south alternate between the exfiltration and infiltration neumann et al 2013 2 2 existing data set an extensive data set neumann et al 2013 was available for this study the seepage rates and pore water chemistry data were collected at ml77 between 2008 and 2009 as described in neumann et al 2013 at the shallow sites sites 1 19 fig 2 seepage meters with collection bags were deployed at the bottom of the lake seepage meters were installed by scuba divers at the deeper sites sites 20 25 and the bags were fixed to a buoy and lowered to about 0 5 m below the water surface to reduce the effects of wind and waves neumann et al 2013 pore water peepers 60 cm long and 1 cm peeper resolution were installed to determine concentration depth profiles of chemical species in the sediment porewater neumann et al 2013 the peepers were placed within 1 m from the seepage meters to minimise the effects of small scale heterogeneity on the different flux estimates the peepers were deployed by scuba divers and were removed between summer 2008 and spring 2009 the peepers were allowed to equilibrate for three weeks before sampling neumann et al 2013 after retrieval the ph fe ii and sulfate concentrations were determined in the lab eighteen sites were selected for spatial analysis of pore water and seepage rates from june 2008 to march 2009 the eighteen sites were also used for temporal analysis of seepage rates from february 2008 to october 2009 with temporal porewater chemistry additionally recorded for five sites from june to october 2009 the sediment was sampled with a gravity corer at thirteen sites in november and december of 2008 for analysis of porosity and mineralogy neumann et al 2013 2 3 data analysis the conservative transport of fe ii as it travels across the swi was assessed by calculating damköhler numbers for fe ii using the measured fluxes and solute concentrations the reaction timescale of fe ii oxidation required for calculation of da is highly dependent on ph eq 8 and can be derived using the rate law given by stumm and lee 1961 8 d f e i i d t k a b i o p o 2 o h 2 f e i i where p o 2 is the partial pressure of oxygen atm and kabio is the abiotic rate constant 1 5 1013 l2 mol atm min at 25 c at low ph abiotic fe ii oxidation is faster than microbial oxidation kirby et al 1999 thus the use of the abiotic rate for our application oldham et al 2013 equation 8 can be rewritten as 9 d f e i i d t k f e i i where 10 k k a b i o p o 2 o h 2 hence 11 τ r f e i i h 2 k a b i o p o 2 k w 2 where kw is the ionic product of water 10 14 mol2 l equation 11 shows that τ r increases by two orders of magnitude per ph unit increase for the purposes of our application the ph values used for the da determinations were measured at a depth of 1 cm below the swi optically identified by the occurrence of precipitates in the peeper water it is further assumed that an o2 saturation of 80 occurred in the swi p o 2 0 16 atm the exposure timescale eq 12 is parameterised as 12 τ e l u s advection controlled l 2 d diffusion controlled where l is the thickness of the still to be defined swi layer m us is the seepage velocity m d and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient for fe ii in water m2 day 1 the non dimensional peclet number eq 13 13 p e u s l d was used to determine whether the system was advection or diffusion dominated to infer the appropriate parameterization of τ e oldham et al 2013 applying this framework to the transport of fe ii across the swi if da 1 the transport of fe ii occurs faster than its reaction i e fe ii is transported conservatively under these conditions fe ii is not retained at the swi and in lake oxidation occurs followed by acidification conversely if da 1 fe ii reacts faster than it is transported across the swi and it will be retained there when da 1 63 of fe ii in the exfiltrating groundwater is consumed within the swi layer oldham et al 2013 when da 2 3 90 of fe ii is consumed within the swi layer for the purposes of this paper reactive transport is defined as occurring when at least 63 of fe ii is consumed da 1 3 results 3 1 seepage rates the seepage rates recorded in ml77 were both spatially and temporally variable in the north of the lake near the mining dumps the groundwater lake water exchange patterns at the sediment water interface were dominated by groundwater exfiltration fig 3 this reflects the regional groundwater flow from northeast to southwest the rates of groundwater seepage were highly variable with some sites exhibiting seepage rates below 1 l m2 d throughout the year and others reaching upwards of 15 l m2 d at certain times of the year in the south of ml77 the exchange patterns at the sediment water interface were more varied with the seepage alternating between exfiltration and infiltration of groundwater site 25 exhibited seepage rates that exceeded all other sites fluxes of groundwater ranged from 175 to 264 l m2 d fleckenstien et al 2009 attributed these higher fluxes to preferential flow from the deeper tertiary aquifer which became hydraulically connected to the upper quaternary aquifer as a result of the excavation of parts of the separating aquitard during mining such phenomena are a common feature of mining lakes this site is discussed in more detail in fleckenstein et al 2009 3 2 porewater chemistry and sediment water interfaces the porewater profiles of ph and fe ii concentrations for each site were consistent with the observations of past studies at sites with predominantly exfiltrating groundwater a distinct ph gradient was visible in the top 5 cm of the sediment fig 4 an increase in acidity was notable in this region for all sites with a stronger more distinct ph gradient exhibited at sites with predominantly exfiltrating groundwater from a ph of 5 6 to a ph of around 3 strong fe ii concentration gradients were also prominent at such sites e g site 5 in fig 4 the concentration and ph gradients were less steep and well defined at sites where alternating groundwater flux directions were apparent e g site 2 in fig 4 the sediment surface was defined as the point at which a very steep chemocline in fe ii concentrations was measured within the sediments this was set as zero depth in the porewater profiles an examination of all profiles close to this zero point highlighted that above the sediment chemocline additional more gradual chemoclines were evident in the water column fig 5 there was variability in the gradient of water column chemocline the height of the chemocline above the sediment surface and the water column concentrations this chemocline variability was likely impacted by exfiltration velocities and whether the hypolimnion of the lake was oxic or anoxic at the time of profiling see fig 5 one of the challenges is the definition of the swi layer through which the fe ii passes prior to being incorporated into the overlying lake water the definition of this layer will in turn determine its effective thickness fe ii oxidation only starts once fe ii is exposed to dissolved oxygen it can be assumed that typically this precludes the reaction occurring within the sediment porewater if fe ii passes through the viscous boundary layer with a thickness typically of o 10 cm furrer and wehrli 1996 lorke and peeters 2006 then it will be incorporated into the ambient lake hydrodynamics transported away from the swi and mixed with interior waters alternatively if fe ii is consumed fully within the diffusive boundary layer with a thickness typically of o 0 1 cm jørgensen and des marais 1990 then it will not be transported into the lake interior the measured water column chemoclines fig 6 suggest that the swi layer defined as the thickness of the water column chemocline is o 1 cm this swi layer can be conceptualized as a mixing length l that defines the thickness of a water column concentration gradient of a conservative tracer originating in the groundwater and being transported across the swi via exfiltration if the seepage rate is low l will only be slightly larger than the diffusive boundary layer thickness with increasing seepage rates groundwater moves further from the swi where the tracer is exposed to the higher flows of the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer grant and marusic 2011 and l becomes larger it is expected that l o 0 1 10 cm i e somewhere between the thickness of the diffusive and viscous boundary layers the thicknesses of the measured water column chemoclines fig 6 led to the choice of three length scales 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m representing the thickness of the swi for the subsequent analyses the sensitivity of da to our choice of l is explored in more detail below 4 discussion 4 1 fe ii exits the sediments a range of seepage velocities were used to explore their impact on the degree to which fe ii is transported conservatively across the swi under groundwater exfiltrating conditions to cover the range of observed water column chemocline thicknesses fig 6 three different length scales were used that simulated the lower middle and upper bounds of the expected l 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m and explored the effect of diffusive versus advective conditions via pe analysis on da distributions fig 7 there is a general trend of increasing pe values with length scale and in some samples this included a regime shift from diffusion controlled conditions q1 or qiv to advection controlled conditions qii or qiii the majority of data sit in qiii and qiv indicating conservative fe ii transport log da 0 was occurring under both diffusive qiv or advective conditions qiii reactive transport of fe ii was indicated at l 0 01 m only when log pe values 0 qi fig 7 that is under diffusion controlled conditions for advective conditions reactive behavior was predicted only for l 0 1 m at one single site site 21 on 1 09 2009 with log pe being only slightly larger than 0 pe 1 12 the seepage velocity was low 0 04 cm d and the ph was relatively high ph 5 55 thus while there is uncertainty in the actual length scale of the swi in almost all cases examined in this study the majority of fe ii exited the sediment without oxidation to be transported and mixed into the overlying water column this analysis shows that retention of fe ii in ml 77 can be expected only under very specific conditions i e a combination of a comparatively low seepage velocity ph 5 and a mixing layer thickness 0 01 m our analysis therefore suggests that in ml 77 fe ii oxidation occurred in the water column and could subsequently trigger the generation of acidity within the lake the analysis agrees with previous mass balances that suggested that acidity generation occurs within the lake not at the swi peine et al 2000 having validated this approach the more general requirements for fe ii to be oxidized at the swi is explored below therefore moderating acidity generation in the lake to these ends ph and seepage velocities were systematically varied over the three mixing lengths already used in our analyses fig 8 a ph range between 5 and 7 was chosen as measured in pore water just below the swi koschorreck et al 2007 fig 4 and across which reactive behavior of fe ii can be expected seepage velocities us were varied from 0 02 to 10 cm d indicated by the different coloured lines in fig 8 covering the range of seepage velocities reported in the review of rosenberry et al 2015 for the longest mixing length 0 1 m do concentration was also varied from 80 0 16 atm where oxic lake water is transported to the mixing layer without prior reaction with other reduced substances to 0 08 0 016 atm where do consumption e g by respiration of organic matter has occurred prior to reaching the mixing layer from the analysis of our field data it is evident that diffusive conditions log pe 0 predominate at the lowest mixing length similarly when l 0 001 m in our scenarios fig 7a log pe 0 for all seepage velocities except us 10 cm d data not shown and therefore for us 0 02 2 cm d the exposure timescale τe was controlled by the diffusive timescales and therefore independent of seepage velocity this results in the lines for us 0 02 2 cm d directly overlaying each other when l 0 01 m fig 7b log pe 0 for us 0 02 and 0 1 cm d implying that again diffusion controls transport and τe and these the lines lie directly on top of each other for l 0 01 m and us 0 5 cm d transport is controlled by advection and therefore τe is sensitive to seepage velocity with increasing mixing length diffusive conditions become less relevant for l 0 1 m τe becomes controlled by advection and therefore increasing seepage velocities change τe and da for each mixing length l critical ph thresholds exist below which no effective turnover occurs log da 0 the ph thresholds decrease with increasing l and decreasing seepage velocity corresponding to an increase in exposure time τe at a do saturation of 80 the ph threshold decreases from ph 7 at l 0 001 diffusion controlled conditions τe 0 03 days to ph 5 at l 0 1 m advection controlled conditions us 0 02 cm d τe 282 days the ph threshold at this mixing length for the highest seepage rate us 10 m d τe 1 day is ph 6 2 even under low do conditions as we would expect during lake stratification there is still a window of reaction for low seepage velocities fig 7d at a mixing length scale of 0 1 m the threshold ranges from ph 5 5 us 0 2 cm d τe 282 days to ph 6 7 us 10 m d τe 1 day 4 2 implications for remediation of amd impacted waterways this analysis has shown that the key process for acidification of amd impacted waterways is in lake oxidation of fe ii the spatial separation of the in lake fe ii oxidation from in sediment alkalinity generation leads to lake acidification and this is likely to be common in water bodies receiving inflow of fe ii and so4 2 containing groundwater attempts at in situ remediation of acid mine lakes by the addition of organic matter to stimulate sulfate reduction and alkalinity generation have failed these processes could not balance in lake acidity production geller et al 2009 a damköhler analysis was used to demonstrate that if there is sufficient exposure time during transport across the swi the transfer of fe ii into the surface water body may be prevented oxidation of fe ii would occur at the interface and be subject to internal redox cycling of fe ii peine et al 2000 established an acidity generation balance for ml 77 and determined that internal cycling generated acidity at a rate of 1 0 4 7 mmol m2 a and consumed acidity by microbial iron reduction at a rate of 0 7 3 8 mmol m2 a in contrast in lake generation of acidity occurred at a rate of 16 20 mmol m2 a koschorreck and tittel 2007 determined the critical acidity load that can be compensated for by internal sediment processes in mining lakes to be 1 8 mmol m2 a in productive lakes and 0 18 mmol m2 a in less productive lakes these estimates together with our analysis suggest remediation measures must focus on methods to enhance the oxidation of fe ii at the swi and in particular they must increase the exposure time of groundwater seepage cross the diffusive and viscous boundary layers one remediation measure that may be utilized to this end is the establishment of submerged macrophytes at the locations where groundwater seepage is observed submerged macrophytes would support remediation efforts in two ways by increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations close the to swi contributing to a direct source of organic carbon to the sediments via photosynthesis and therefore promoting rapid fe ii oxidation and by decreasing the in lake hydrodynamics adjacent to the swi nepf 2012 there is a paucity of literature on macrophyte abundance in acidic mine lakes however tittel and kamjunke 2004 concluded that benthic algae would provide a far greater alkalinity source compared to pelagic phytoplankton the additional benefits of slowing groundwater seepage to enhance reactivity and retention of groundwater borne solutes at the swi have not yet been explored 5 conclusions this paper has successfully demonstrated the use of a simple but powerful damköhler analysis to explore the fate of groundwater borne fe ii seeping into a mine lake the analysis highlighted that fe ii would typically be transported with little reaction across the swi providing a source of acidity to the lake waters and spatially separating it from sediment processes that produce alkalinity this transport of unreacted fe ii into the lake waters may explain the challenges experienced in lake remediation experiments our analysis suggests that remediation may be more effective if focused on establishing submerged benthic macroalgae in regions where groundwater seepage is found to our knowledge this has not been previously tested the usefulness of damköhler analyses is not restricted to the context of this

19001,considerable amount of phosphorous is present as organic phosphonates usually in the form of metal complexes e g ca ii phosphonate in domestic and industrial effluents which cannot be effectively removed by traditional processes for phosphate herein we employed a proprietary process i e fe iii displacement uv irradiation co precipitation denoted fe iii uv naoh to enable an efficient removal of ca ii phosphonate complexes from water the combined process includes three basic steps i e fe iii replacement with the complexed ca ii to form fe iii phosphonate of high photo reactivity uv mediated degradation of fe iii phosphonate to form phosphate and other intermediates and the final phosphorous removal via co precipitation at ph 6 the operational conditions for the combined process to remove a typical phosphonate ca ii ntmp nitrilotrismethylenephosphonate are optimized where 60 ntmp is transformed to phosphate with the total phosphorous reduction from 1 81 mg l to 0 17 mg l under uv irradiation the cleavage of ntmp is identified at the c n and c p bonds to form the intermediate products and phosphate in sequence also the combined process is employed for treatment of two authentic effluents before and after activated sludge treatment resulting in the phosphorous drop from 4 3 mg l to 0 23 mg l and from 0 90 mg l to 0 14 mg l respectively which is much superior to other processes including fenton co precipitation in general the combined process exhibits great potential for efficient removal of phosphonates from contaminated waters graphical abstract

from contaminated waters is urgently desired as well known decarboxylation of fe iii carboxyl complexes could proceed via ligands to metals charge transfer lmct under uv irradiation based on the principle a combined process i e fe iii displacement uv irradiation precipitation has been recently developed to effectively remove various toxic metal carboxyl complexes from water including cu ii citrate pan et al 2014 xu et al 2015 and cu ii edta shan et al 2018 in brief most metal carboxyl complexes are inert to uv irradiation and the free fe iii ions was deliberately added to the metal carboxyl complex solution to form fe iii carboxyl complexes of high photo reactivity because fe iii displays much higher complexation constants with carboxyl ligands where free toxic metal ions are simultaneously released for subsequent removal by chemical precipitation later it was successfully extended to remove cr iii citrate from synthetic solution and authentic tannery effluent despite of its extremely slow decomplexation rate ye et al 2017 where the hydroxyl radicals formed during fe iii uv process tended to oxide the complexed cr iii to free cr vi greatly speeding up the decomplexation and driving a fast formation of fe iii citrate for photolysis moreover the toxic cr vi was effectively reduced back to free cr iii for co precipitation in the presence of fe ii formed during photolysis as for phosphonates limited study has been available on the photo reactivity of their fe iii complexes in the past decades matthijs et al 1989 reported fe iii edtmp could be photodegraded through a photoinduced ligand to metal charge transfer procedure under sunlight irradiation lesueur et al 2005 further confirmed the fe iii mediated photolysis of four common aminophosphonates during uv irradiation kuhn et al 2018 evidenced that during photo degradation of dtpmp in the presence of fe ii the initial cleavage of dtpmp was initiated at the c n bond resulting in the gradual drop of c po oh 2 groups in the phosphonate the above study inspired us to consider the potential of photo assisted process for water decontamination from phosphonates in this study we demonstrated the applicability of the fe iii uv naoh process to eliminate various ca ii phosphonate complexes from synthetic solution and authentic effluents ntmp was employed as the model phosphonate

fig 2d as observed fe iii naoh could only result in limited tp removal 49 from the ca ii ntmp solution even at the fe iii dosage of 0 20 mm comparatively uv fe iii naoh could result in nearly 100 tp removal at the fe iii dosage of 0 12 mm or higher such relatively low removal by the fe iii naoh process 50 is possibly due to the poor precipitation of ferric hydroxide in the presence of organic ligands zhou et al 2008 henneberry et al 2011 hu et al 2015 which compete with hydroxy anions to bind fe iii obviously the uv irradiation unit is indispensable to the combined process for enhanced tp removal also the formation of phosphate from the ca ii ntmp solution was detected after fe iii addition and uv irradiation as seen in fig 2a the production rate of phosphate increased with the increasing fe iii addition which is consistent with the final tp removal as the fe iii dosage increased to 0 12 mm the phosphate formation reached 61 and the residual tp after precipitation dropped down to 0 3 mg l further fe iii addition to 0 2 mm offered limited promotion to tp removal in the subsequent experiments we set the optimal fe iii dosage as 0 12 mm for the fe iii uv naoh process except for otherwise specified 3 1 2 effect of uv irradiation time the influences of uv irradiation duration on the formation of po 4 3 as well as the final removal of tp are illustrated in fig 2b the po 4 3 formation reached 40 after 10 min uv irradiation indicating the cleavage of the c p bond of ntmp similar to the effect of fe iii dosage increasing the uv irradiation time is favorable for the final tp removal in the initial 10 min about 40 po 4 3 was formed and nearly 80 tp was removed after precipitation indicating that ntmp was partially transformed to low molecular weight phosphonates which was readily removed during fe iii coagulation after 60 min irradiation the phosphate formation reached 60 with the residual tp below 0 1 mg l after precipitation the above results implied that the formation of phosphate could be an indicator for the final tp removal in the forthcoming experiments we set 60 min as the optimal uv irradiation time for the fe iii uv naoh process except for otherwise specified 3 1 3 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph 1 5 10 0 on the phosphate formation during uv irradiation was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 2c as seen ph 3 0 is the optimal value for phosphate formation 65 at ph 3 0 and higher ph values resulted in lower efficiency of ntmp photolysis and phosphate formation at ph 2 5 3 0 fe iii is mainly present in the form of feoh2 displaying the highest photo reactivity among all the fe iii species to generate oh radicals based on eq 1 hug et al 2001 at ph 2 and ph 3 the predominant fe iii species turned to be fe3 and ferric hydroxide colloids sediments respectively both suppressing the generation of oh radicals intensively bajt et al 2001 and resulting in a low po 4 3 formation at alkaline phs phosphonates preferably bind fe iii and the fe iii phosphonate complexes are attacked by hydroxyl radicals more easily than the counterpart phosphonates rott et al 2017a note that phosphate formation still reached 40 50 at neutral or alkaline phs also the initial phs were set in the range of 2 5 3 0 for the subsequent fe iii uv naoh processes except for otherwise specified 1 feoh2 hv fe2 oh 3 1 4 effect of the precipitation ph effect of the precipitation ph on tp removal is described in fig 2d as seen the ph values from 4 5 to 6 0 resulted in the lowest residual tp whereas at ph from 8 0 to 12 0 the residual tp remained at a relatively high level such ph dependent precipitation correlated well with the zeta potential of the resultant flocs fig s1 which exhibited a dramatic drop from 1 3 mv to 40 mv at the ph range from 5 0 to 8 0 in theoretical viewpoint the higher the ph the stronger the electrostatic charge repulsion between phosphate phosphonates and the formed iron hydroxide surface in the following section the optimal ph was set as 6 0 for precipitation 3 2 mechanism of the fe iii uv naoh process 3 2 1 fe iii displacement the stability constant of ca ii ntmp logk 7 6 is much lower than that of fe iii ntmp logk 21 2 popov et al 2001 and fe iii ions are capable of displacing ca ii from ca ii ntmp in thermodynamic viewpoint the effectiveness of fe iii displacement was reflected by the formed fe iii ntmp complexes as determined by ion pair high performance liquid chromatography nowack 1997 expectedly the addition of fe iii resulted in an equimolar formation of fe iii ntmp complexes fig s2 indicating that fe iii could displace equimolar ca ii from ca ii ntmp complexes to release the free ca ii ions eq 2 2 ca ii ntmp fe iii fe iii ntmp ca ii 3 2 2 role of oh radicals as previously reported bajt et al 2001 hug et al 2001 photoexcitation of feoh2 would result in the formation of oh radicals eq 1 which was demonstrated by epr spectra of fe iii uv system recorded in fig 3 a clearly the signals of the oh radicals without uv irradiation were ignorable while strong signals were detected in the fe iii uv system even in the first 2 min indicating the generation of massive oh radicals as the irradiation proceeded after 20 min the intensity of oh signals turned much weaker possibly due to the consumption of both the radicals and the feoh2 species to further explore the role of oh radicals in ntmp degradation we examined the effect of methanol a typical oh radical scavenger on the formation of po 4 3 as shown in fig 3b and 20 min irradiation could result in the efficiency of phosphate transformation higher than 50 for the fe iii uv process the addition of 100 mm methanol significantly inhibited the phosphate formation and 60 min was required to achieve similar efficiency thus we believe that oh radicals play a significant role in the formation of po 4 3 note that such adverse effect from the added methanol gradually turned weaker as the irradiation proceeded this is mainly because another important process i e direct photolysis of fe iii phosphonate contributed significantly to the formation of phosphate as discussed below 3 2 3 photolysis of fe iii complexes it is well known that ferrous carboxylates could be photodegraded under uv irradiation via lmct process eq 3 such as fe iii citrate xu et al 2015 ye et al 2017 fe iii edta shan et al 2018 and fe iii oxalate safarzadeh amiri et al 1997 chen et al 2007 doumic et al 2015 3 fe3 l hv fe2 l in fact similar lmct process occurred for fe iii phosphonate complexes generally phosphonate in natural water or bio effluents is mainly present in the form of metal complexes ca2 mg2 etc most of which are of poor photo reactivity and insensitive to uv irradiation in theory fe iii could displace the complexed metals such as ca ii to form fe iii phosphonates due to their stability constants several orders in magnitude higher than the former ones and the formed fe iii phosphonates would be effectively photodegraded under uv irradiation for instance no photodegradation of hedp was observed in distilled water or in the background of ca ii however the addition of fe iii or cu ii resulted in a rapid photodegradation of hedp nowack 2003 matthijs 1989 reported that fe iii edtmp could be photo degraded via stepwise processes i e from the parent compound to ethylenediaminetrimethylenephosphonate ethylenediaminedimethylene phosphonate and ethylenediaminemonomethylenephosphonate in sequence the latter of which is stable in the presence of fe iii and light irradiation kuhn et al 2017 identified idmp as the major breakdown product of edtmp during uv irradiation of non complex edtmp kuhn et al 2018 found that in the presence of fe iii and uv irradiation the c n bond of dtpmp was cleaved resulting in the formation of idmp ethylamino bismethylenephosphonic acid eabmp and ampa based on the above discussion the degradation scheme of ca ii ntmp is proposed in fig 4 first fe iii replaced ca ii from ca ii ntmp to form fe iii ntmp where the free ca ii is released stoichiometrically afterward the uv irradiation activates the photolysis of fe iii phosphonate complexes based on lmct process resulting in the generation of fe ii and a phosphonyl radical kononova and nesmeyanova 2002 then po oh o donates one electron leading to the formation of the carbon centered radical po oh 2 ch2 2 n ch2 and the release of phosphate barrett and mcbride 2005 jaisi et al 2016 the methylene radical is rapidly intercepted by o2 to form a peroxyl radical which will be decomposed to superoxide and the iminium cation and the latter one further reacts with h2o to form idmp nowack and stone 2003 simultaneously another pathway i e oh mediated degradation occurred on the substrate the initial cleavage of ntmp was identified at the c n bond leading to the immediate formation of idmp and ampa evidence by hplc analyses as shown in fig 5 to further examine the reasonability of the proposed process the mass balance of elemental p was conducted for photodegradation of fe iii ntmp as observed in fig 5 the tp of four p species i e ntmp and idmp ampa and phosphate varied insignificantly during the whole process further validating the reliability of the above mechanism a slight drop in the tp of the four p species during the initial reaction indicated the formation of other intermediate phosphonates which were transformed to idmp ampa and phosphate eventually 3 2 4 co precipitation for tp removal according to fig 2a fe iii uv naoh process could result in 90 tp removal at the fe iii dosage of 0 12 mm while fe iii naoh could only result in limited tp removal 24 from the ca ii ntmp solution under similar conditions fe iii precipitation and flocculation was effective for removal of phosphate however phosphonates tend to form complexes with typical fe iii and al iii flocculants thereby compromising the final tp removal rott et al 2017b the above results further demonstrated that the uv irradiation unit was essential to enhance the final tp removal during precipitation we also characterized the solid samples after co precipitation in terms of sem xrd and elemental analysis fig s3 s5 apparently the free metal cations including ca ii fe ii and fe iii ntmp and its intermediate phosphonates were co precipitated with the formed phosphate 3 3 extension to other phosphonates to further examine the feasibility of the combined fe iii uv naoh process for other phosphonates we employed ca pbtc ca hedp ca edtmp ca dtpmp and ca hdtmp as the pollutants of concern their degradation properties by fe iii were examined in terms of phosphate formation and compared to the fenton process fe ii h2o2 the results in fig 6 indicated that for the fenton process ph 3 the concerned phosphonates could be converted to phosphate by the maximum of 20 whereas for the fe iii uv process the same phosphonates exhibited much higher degradation efficiency 60 and the degradation of pbtc and hedp even reached up to 90 and 80 respectively it seems that the elemental n present in phosphonate adversely affected the formation of phosphate possibly because part of the hydroxyl radicals has to be consumed on the leakage of the c n bond generally fe iii uv is more efficient than fenton process to degrade phosphonates also we further compared the effectiveness of fe iii uv with classical fenton process on the final tp removal during co precipitation ph 6 and direct fe iii coagulation was employed for reference for all the tested six phosphonates fig 7 pre oxidation by both processes is essential to improve the tp removal of co precipitation comparatively the fenton naoh process enhanced the final p removal for phosphonates 50 whereas the fe iii uv naoh exhibited the most attractive performance resulting in the final p removal higher than 90 with the residual total p below 0 5 mg l level 1 a standard for wastewater treatment plant in china gb18918 2002 in all the test cases 3 4 validation of the combined process in treatment of real effluent prior to the validation experiments we examined the effect of natural organic matters noms and other metal ions cu2 and ni2 on the formation of phosphate and the final tp removal from the ca ii ntmp solution results in fig s6 suggested that the presence of nom and both metals at the test levels 5 mg toc l for nom and 0 1 mm for metal ions did not exert significant effect on the efficiency of the combined process to validate the feasibility of the combined process in practical applicability two authentic samples from a wwtp in jiangyin city china was collected for test the influent and the effluent direct fe iii coagulation and traditional fenton followed by precipitation namely fenton naoh were also employed for comparison the initial tp of the test influent was 4 3 mg l 1 82 mg l in phosphate and 2 48 mg l in dop while that for the effluent was 0 90 mg l 0 24 mg l in phosphate and 0 66 mg l in dop results in table 1 indicated that fe iii uv naoh exhibited more efficient phosphorous removal than the other two processes such satisfactory performance renders us to believe that the combined fe iii uv naoh process is a promising option for water decontamination from phosphonates 4 conclusions in the present study the application of a proprietary combined process i e fe iii uv naoh was extended to enhanced removal of phosphonate in the form of ca ii complexes the basic steps for the process included fe iii replacement with the complexed ca ii to form fe iii phosphonate uv mediated degradation of phosphonate to cleave its c n and c p bonds and form phosphate and other breakdown products as well as the final removal of tp through co precipitation by utilizing the process the residual tp of the ntmp solution can be reduced from 1 81 mg l to below 0 2 mg l test on the treatment of real wastewater further validated the potential of the combined process in enhanced phosphorous removal from water this study provides a highly efficient option for water decontamination from phosphonate and further study is required on the pilot scale operation of the combined process acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the financial support from natural science foundation of china grant no 51761165011 and

19001,considerable amount of phosphorous is present as organic phosphonates usually in the form of metal complexes e g ca ii phosphonate in domestic and industrial effluents which cannot be effectively removed by traditional processes for phosphate herein we employed a proprietary process i e fe iii displacement uv irradiation co precipitation denoted fe iii uv naoh to enable an efficient removal of ca ii phosphonate complexes from water the combined process includes three basic steps i e fe iii replacement with the complexed ca ii to form fe iii phosphonate of high photo reactivity uv mediated degradation of fe iii phosphonate to form phosphate and other intermediates and the final phosphorous removal via co precipitation at ph 6 the operational conditions for the combined process to remove a typical phosphonate ca ii ntmp nitrilotrismethylenephosphonate are optimized where 60 ntmp is transformed to phosphate with the total phosphorous reduction from 1 81 mg l to 0 17 mg l under uv irradiation the cleavage of ntmp is identified at the c n and c p bonds to form the intermediate products and phosphate in sequence also the combined process is employed for treatment of two authentic effluents before and after activated sludge treatment resulting in the phosphorous drop from 4 3 mg l to 0 23 mg l and from 0 90 mg l to 0 14 mg l respectively which is much superior to other processes including fenton co precipitation in general the combined process exhibits great potential for efficient removal of phosphonates from contaminated waters graphical abstract

as in natural waters nowack and stone 2006 gu et al 2011 majed et al 2012 qin et al 2015 though few open data are available on the phosphate concentration in industrial effluents we sampled several biotreated textile effluents and discriminated the six phosphonates in fig 1 with their total amount reaching 0 1 0 5 mg p l in addition phosphonates have been identified in the influents of german

activated sludge treatment either aerobically horstman and grohmann 1988 or anaerobically nowack 1998 traditional processes such as adsorption and precipitation flocculation could enable highly efficient removal of inorganic phosphate however they usually work ineffectively for organic phosphonates neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 rott et al 2018a the complexation of phosphonates with

stone 2000 matthijs et al 1989 schowanek and verstraete 1990 accompanying a long term release of bioavailable phosphate in water moreover there still exists substantial risk for phosphonate transformation to more toxic aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa particularly in the presence of sunlight grandcoin and baures 2017 thus the contribution of phosphonates to water eutrophication and environmental safety should be particularly concerned studnik et al 2015 qin et al 2015 drzyzga and lipok 2017 and development of efficient and cost effective approaches to realize phosphonate removal from contaminated waters is urgently desired as well known decarboxylation of fe iii carboxyl complexes could proceed via ligands to metals charge transfer lmct under uv irradiation based on the principle a combined process i e fe iii displacement uv irradiation precipitation has been recently developed to effectively remove various toxic metal carboxyl complexes from water including cu ii citrate pan et al 2014 xu et al 2015 and cu ii edta shan et al 2018 in brief most metal carboxyl complexes are inert to uv irradiation and the free fe iii ions was deliberately added to the metal carboxyl complex solution to form fe iii carboxyl complexes of high photo reactivity because fe iii displays much higher complexation constants with carboxyl ligands where free toxic metal ions are simultaneously released for subsequent removal by chemical precipitation later it was successfully extended to remove cr iii citrate from synthetic solution and authentic tannery effluent despite of its extremely slow decomplexation rate ye et al 2017 where the hydroxyl radicals formed during fe iii uv process tended to oxide the complexed cr iii to free cr vi greatly speeding up the decomplexation and driving a fast formation of fe iii citrate for photolysis moreover the toxic cr vi was effectively reduced back to free cr iii for co precipitation in the presence of fe ii formed during photolysis as for phosphonates limited study has been available on the photo reactivity of their fe iii complexes in the past decades matthijs et al 1989 reported fe iii edtmp could be photodegraded through a photoinduced ligand to metal charge transfer procedure under sunlight irradiation lesueur et al 2005 further confirmed the fe iii mediated photolysis of four common aminophosphonates during uv irradiation kuhn et al 2018 evidenced that during photo degradation of dtpmp in the presence of fe ii the initial cleavage of dtpmp was initiated at the c n bond resulting in the gradual drop of c po oh 2 groups in the phosphonate the above study inspired us to consider the potential of photo assisted process for water decontamination from phosphonates in this study we demonstrated the applicability of the fe iii uv naoh process to eliminate various ca ii phosphonate complexes from synthetic solution and authentic effluents ntmp was employed as the model phosphonate to optimize the operational conditions and elucidate the underlying mechanism it is a typical aminophosphonate characterized by three c po oh 2 groups and usually present as metal complex e g ca ii ntmp complex in natural waters or biotreated effluents nowack 2003 afterward the process was extended to removal of other ca ii phosphonates and some typical processes including fenton precipitation

the complexed metals such as ca ii to form fe iii phosphonates due to their stability constants several orders in magnitude higher than the former ones and the formed fe iii phosphonates would be effectively photodegraded under uv irradiation for instance no photodegradation of hedp was observed in distilled water or in the background of ca ii however the addition of fe iii or cu ii resulted in a rapid photodegradation of hedp nowack 2003 matthijs 1989 reported that fe iii edtmp could be photo degraded via stepwise processes i e from the parent compound to ethylenediaminetrimethylenephosphonate ethylenediaminedimethylene phosphonate and ethylenediaminemonomethylenephosphonate in sequence the latter of which is stable in the presence of fe iii and light irradiation kuhn et al 2017 identified idmp as the major breakdown product of edtmp during uv irradiation of non complex edtmp kuhn et al 2018 found that in the presence of fe iii and uv irradiation the c n bond of dtpmp was cleaved resulting in the formation of idmp ethylamino bismethylenephosphonic acid eabmp and ampa based on the above discussion the degradation scheme of ca ii ntmp is proposed in fig 4 first fe iii replaced ca ii from ca ii ntmp to form fe iii ntmp where the free ca ii is released stoichiometrically afterward the uv irradiation activates the photolysis of fe iii phosphonate complexes based on lmct process resulting in the generation of fe ii and a phosphonyl radical kononova and nesmeyanova 2002 then po oh o donates one electron leading to the formation of the carbon centered radical po oh 2 ch2 2 n ch2 and the release of phosphate barrett and mcbride 2005 jaisi et al 2016 the methylene radical is rapidly intercepted by o2 to form a peroxyl radical which will be decomposed to superoxide and the iminium cation and the latter one further reacts with h2o to form idmp nowack and stone 2003 simultaneously another pathway i e oh mediated degradation occurred on the substrate the initial cleavage of ntmp was identified at the c n bond leading to the immediate formation of idmp and ampa evidence by hplc analyses as shown in fig 5 to further examine the reasonability of the proposed process the mass balance of elemental p was conducted for photodegradation of fe iii ntmp as observed in fig 5 the tp of four p species i e ntmp and idmp ampa and phosphate varied insignificantly during the whole process further validating the reliability of the above mechanism a slight drop in the tp of the four p species during the initial reaction indicated the formation of other intermediate phosphonates which were transformed to idmp ampa and phosphate eventually 3 2 4 co precipitation for tp removal according to fig 2a fe iii uv naoh process could result in 90 tp removal at the fe iii dosage of 0 12 mm while fe iii naoh could only result in limited tp removal 24 from the ca ii ntmp solution under similar conditions fe iii precipitation and flocculation was effective for removal of phosphate however phosphonates tend to form complexes with typical fe iii and al iii flocculants thereby compromising the final tp removal rott et al 2017b the above results further demonstrated that the uv irradiation unit was essential to enhance the final tp removal during precipitation we also characterized the solid samples after co precipitation in terms of sem xrd and elemental analysis fig s3 s5 apparently the free metal cations including ca ii fe ii and fe iii ntmp and its intermediate phosphonates were co precipitated with the formed phosphate 3 3 extension to other phosphonates to further examine the feasibility of the combined fe iii uv naoh process for other phosphonates we employed ca pbtc ca hedp ca edtmp ca dtpmp and ca hdtmp as the pollutants of concern their degradation properties by fe iii were examined in terms of phosphate formation and compared to the fenton process fe ii h2o2 the results in fig 6 indicated that for the fenton process ph 3 the concerned phosphonates could be converted to phosphate by the maximum of 20 whereas for the fe iii uv process the same phosphonates exhibited much higher degradation efficiency 60 and the degradation of pbtc and hedp even reached up to 90 and 80 respectively it seems that the elemental n present in phosphonate adversely affected the formation of phosphate possibly because part of the hydroxyl radicals has to be consumed on the leakage of the c n bond generally fe iii uv is more efficient than fenton process to degrade phosphonates also we further compared the effectiveness of fe iii uv with classical fenton process on the final tp removal during co precipitation ph 6 and direct fe iii coagulation was employed for reference for all the tested six phosphonates fig 7 pre oxidation by both processes is essential to improve the tp removal of co precipitation comparatively the fenton naoh process enhanced the final p removal for phosphonates 50 whereas the fe iii uv naoh exhibited the most attractive performance resulting in the final p removal higher than 90 with the residual total p below 0 5 mg l level 1 a standard for wastewater treatment plant in china gb18918 2002 in all the test cases 3 4 validation of the combined process in treatment of real effluent prior to the validation experiments we examined the effect of natural organic matters noms and other metal ions cu2 and ni2 on the formation of phosphate and the final tp removal from the ca ii ntmp solution results in fig s6 suggested that the presence of nom and both metals at the test levels 5 mg toc l for nom and 0 1 mm for metal ions did not exert significant effect on the efficiency of the combined process to validate the feasibility of the combined process in practical applicability two authentic samples from a wwtp in jiangyin city china was collected for test the influent and the effluent direct fe iii coagulation and traditional fenton followed by precipitation namely fenton naoh were also employed for comparison the initial tp of the test influent was 4 3 mg l 1 82 mg l in phosphate and 2 48 mg l in dop while that for the effluent was 0 90 mg l 0 24 mg l in phosphate and 0 66 mg l in dop results in table 1 indicated that fe iii uv naoh exhibited more efficient phosphorous removal than the other two processes such satisfactory performance renders us to believe that the combined fe iii uv naoh process is a promising option for water decontamination from phosphonates 4 conclusions in the present study the application of a proprietary combined process i e fe iii uv naoh was extended to enhanced removal of phosphonate in the form of ca ii complexes the basic steps for the process included fe iii replacement with the complexed ca ii to form fe iii phosphonate uv mediated degradation of phosphonate to cleave its c n and c p bonds and form phosphate and other breakdown products as well as the final removal of tp through co precipitation by utilizing the process the residual tp of the ntmp solution can be reduced from 1 81 mg l to below 0 2 mg l test on the treatment of real wastewater further validated the potential of the combined process in enhanced phosphorous removal from water this study provides a highly efficient option for water decontamination from phosphonate and further study is required on the pilot scale operation of the combined process acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the financial support from natural science foundation of china grant no 51761165011 and

19002,carbon dioxide co2 emissions from lakes have been proven to be an important component of the continental carbon balance but most co2 evasion estimates ignore daily variability of partial pressure of co2 pco2 to discern the variability of pco2 and its effect on co2 outgassing estimations we conducted in situ biweekly pco2 measurements during daylight from november 2017 to june 2018 at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst in a subtropical shallow lake in louisiana usa daytime pco2 varied largely from 154 to 1698 μatm with an average of 736 μatm while daytime co2 flux ranged from 43 to 284 mmol m2 h 1 averaging at 44 mmol m2 h 1 significant decreases in pco2 and co2 fluxes from mornings to late afternoons were observed throughout the study period specifically in morning hours average pco2 and co2 fluxes were 940 μatm and 83 mmol m2 h 1 respectively while in afternoon hours average pco2 and co2 fluxes were only 410 μatm and 6 mmol m2 h 1 respectively relationships between pco2 and ambient factors reveal that solar radiation lake trophic status and water temperature play a major role in pco2 and co2 dynamics in lake water we argue that uncertainties may exist in the current regional and global co2 evasion estimates due to this high daily pco2 variability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic pco2 co2 flux carbon

bastviken et al 2011 kokic et al 2015 biddanda 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that freshwaters are often supersaturated with aqueous carbon dioxide with respect to atmospheric co2 suggesting net carbon effluxes from aquatic ecosystems to the atmosphere richey et al 2002 butman and raymond 2011 li et al 2012 based on recent estimates of the global surface area of lakes downing et al 2006 a total co2 emission from inland lake waters was estimated to be 0 5 pg c yr 1 with about 60 from freshwater lakes cole et al 1994 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 and 40 from saline lakes duarte et al 2008 compared to the total lateral export of carbon from the continents to the sea approximately 0 9 pg c yr 1 cole et al 2007 co2 emission from lakes is certainly an important component in the continental carbon balance partial pressure of co2 pco2 in aquatic systems can fluctuate spatially and temporarily which can be influenced by several factors including ph pardue et al 1988 seekell and gudasz 2016 water temperature sobek et al 2005 marotta et al 2009 kosten et al 2007 and trophic states marotta et al 2010 gu et al 2011 in most lakes and reservoirs across the world co2 supersaturation has been found which is driven by in situ net ecosystem production imbalanced towards net heterotrophy cole et al 2000 duarte and prairie 2005 gu et al 2011 and or by input of surface water with high dissolved inorganic carbon dic maberly et al 2013 few lakes are reported as autotrophic systems and function as net sinks of co2 kling et al 1992 tranvik et al 2009 bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 1994 reported pco2 levels in 1835 lakes around the world among which less than 10 were within 20 of equilibrium with the atmosphere while more than 80 were supersaturated among the lakes being studied field data for co2 evasion estimates were mostly collected on a weekly to quarterly basis which ignores daily variability of pco2 and hence daily variation of co2 fluxes a knowledge gap still exists regarding the effect of diel changes in pco2 on co2 outgassing estimation for instance daily concentration of inorganic carbon was reported to vary between 4 and 63 mmol m 3 in a productive lake in northwest england maberly 1996 while pco2 was found to have low daily variation in an unproductive lake in northern sweden jonsson et al 2007 considering the large amounts of carbon being processed in lakes and reservoirs an improved quantification of carbon fluxes is needed to help understand the global carbon cycle in the recent decade studies regarding estimating freshwater co2 outgassing at regional and global scales have been intensified e g cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 bastviken et al 2011 but uncertainties in these estimates are still considerable among these the great variability of co2 evasion may be partly due to the difference in temperature and solar radiation derived by geographical regions schelske et al 2006 for instance in the arctic tundra an average co2 flux of 5 1 μmol c m2 s 1 from an upland headwater catchment in alaska was observed crawford et al 2013 in the mediterranean climate morales pineda et al 2014 found average co2 emissions from two reservoirs guadalcacín and bornos in spain ranged from 5 6 to 34 7 μmol c m2 s 1 in the humid continental climate zone of north america a strong diurnal change of co2 flux from 26 0 to 56 7 μmol c m2 s 1 in western lake erie was registered by shao et al 2015 in a boreal lake lake kuivajärvi in finland however an averaged co2 flux of 0 7 μmol c m 2 s 1 throughout the whole day was observed with no clear diurnal variation mammarella et al 2015 in addition uncertainties in the estimates of co2 flux at regional or global scales can also come from methodological limitations schelker et al 2016 current calculation of co2 outgassing from water bodies into the atmosphere is mainly based on the estimate of pco2 derived from water alkalinity ph and temperature measurements e g cole et al 1994 golub et al 2017 but this is very uncertain one of the biggest unknowns is the accuracy of pco2 estimation improving the understanding in pco2 variation is a critical step in achieving reliable estimates of co2 emissions from lake bodies to reduce uncertainties in co2 flux estimations we therefore need to constrain all these factors causing data scatters and differences here we conducted a field study investigating daily pco2 and co2 outgassing variations in a subtropical shallow lake specifically the study was to i measure bi weekly pco2 and ambient parameters of the lake water during daytime from november 2017 to june 2018 ii estimate hourly co2 fluxes at the water air interface using in situ pco2 measurements and iii investigate the influences of environmental factors on daily carbon dynamics and the resulting co2 sink source behaviors of the studied lake the findings from this study will help improve our understanding of daily pco2 variability as well as improve global estimation of co2 outgassing from freshwaters 2 methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at capitol lake latitude 30 27 36 n longitude 91 11 06 w in baton rouge louisiana usa fig 1 from november 2017 to june 2018 this urban lake is located on the previous floodplain of the mississippi river with an open water surface of approximately 22 ha ldeq 2018 it has a perimeter of 3 5 km and a depth ranging from 0 3 to 2 4 m the lake receives drainage from surrounding residential and industrial areas and the entire drainage area is approximately 1170 ha pardue et al 1988 previous studies have documented that the lake had been contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls heavy metals and other industrial and municipal waste during the late 1970s and early 1980s delaune et al 1989 lake water quality has been improved in recent years and can be classified as a mesoeutrophic lake ldeq 2018 with soluble reactive phosphorus levels averaged at 3 μm during the study period the dominating vegetation near the lake are c4 grasses stenotaphrum secundatum walter kuntze and there is no strong distinction between littoral and off shore habitats the climate of the study area is humid subtropical with long hot summers and short mild winters the long term annual precipitation in the region is approximately 1470 mm ranging from 160 mm july to 80 mm october xu and xu 2015 the long term average annual air temperature in this region is approximately 20 c with the minimum in january 11 c and maximum in july 28 c xu and xu 2016 during the 8 month study period average daily air temperature in the studied watershed ranged from 5 to 30 c with the highest in june and the lowest in january 2018 fig 2 daily air temperature on the sampling days varied from 1 c in january to 33 c in june while daily average water temperature fluctuated largely from 5 c in january to 30 c in june fig 5 2 2 field measurements from november 2017 to june 2018 biweekly field trips were conducted for in situ measurements of pco2 and water quality parameters during each trip measurements were taken about 6 m from the shoreline at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst the rationale for the sampling strategy was based on a previous study xu and xu 2015 on a nearby eutrophic lake reporting that 7 00 was the time when solar radiation in the area first became measurable i e above 0 00 kw m 2 accompanying with a daytime minimum of dissolved oxygen do concentration while 17 00 was the latest hour when solar radiation could still be measured i e above 0 00 kw m 2 but with a daytime do maximum there was slight time shift but this diel trend of do was fairly consistent over seasons based on the knowledge we selected 7 00 and 17 00 as the time of sunrise and sunset in this study considering that the studied lake was mesotrophic we hypothesized that daytime pco2 would maximize and minimize at 7 00 and at 17 00 with the weakest and strongest effect of photosynthesis respectively the addition of the two sampling points in between at 10 00 and 14 00 was to track pco2 changes in the lake from sunrise to sunset all trips were made on sunny days to minimize rainfall and or stormwater runoff effects on water conditions pco2 in surface water was measured using a databank handheld datalogger turner designs sunnyvale ca usa connected with a c sense in situ pco2 sensor with 3 full scale accuracy the datalogger measured in situ pco2 at a 30 s interval and measurements were only recorded after the reading was stabilized for about 5 min chlorophyll a chl a fluorescence and colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence cdom were measured using an aquafluor handheld fluorometer turner designs sunnyvale ca usa by a 5 s excitation light scan to untreated water samples turbidity was detected by a hach 2100p handheld turbid meter hach inc loveland co usa other water quality parameters including ph water temperature and do concentration and saturation do were measured using a ysi 556 multi probe system ysi inc yellow springs oh usa at 30 50 cm below the water surface in situ measurements of pco2 ph water temperature and do concentration and saturation were continuously measured for 5 min after readings were stabilized which normally took 15 30 min the variations of readings within the 5 min period were very low and the last ones from each sampling event were used for calculation for turbidity chl a and cdom a composed water sample was taken and measured in the field all measurements were taken at the same location since the studied lake was shallow and small it was assumed that the variation across the lake was low and the measurements could well represent the water quality of the entire lake 2 3 collection of water samples water samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc were collected for analyzing their concentrations and delta 13 isotopes δ13cdic and δ13cdoc at 7 30 cst using a plastic grab sampler at a depth of 30 50 cm below the water surface dic samples were sealed in 20 ml glass vials with plastic caps and butyl rubber septa and

pco2 from early mornings at 7 00 to the late afternoons at 17 00 on all 12 sampling days from november 2017 to june 2018 fig 3 and table 1 daytime average pco2 standard deviation for the entire study period was 736 675 μatm with the highest value in december 2017 1698 201 μatm and the lowest value at the end of february 2018 154 143 μatm significant reductions in average pco2 were found from 10 00 to 14 00 table 2 average pco2 decreased by 1 from 7 00 945 511 μatm to 10 00 934 694 μatm 52 from 10 00 to 14 00 445 541 μatm and 16 from 14 00 to 17 00 374 404 μatm 3 2 estimation of co2 fluxes corresponding to the daytime change of pco2 in the lake water co2 fluxes on all 12 sampling days showed downward trends in daytime hours table 1 and fig 3 throughout the study period daytime average co2 fluxes sd ranged from 44 29 mmol m2 h 1 in february 2018 to 284 80 mmol m2 h 1 in december 2017 with an average of 44 94 mmol m2 h 1 similar to pco2 we also observed significant reductions in daytime co2 flux between 10 00 and 14 00 table 2 for all samples except december 23 2017 fig 3 with respect to the average co2 flux at 7 00 77 98 mmol m2 h 1 average co2 fluxes at 14 00 and 17 00 markedly decreased by 81 14 111 mmol m2 h 1 and 102 2 72 mmol m2 h 1 respectively while average co2 flux at 10 00 increased by 15 88 114 mmol m2 h 1 table 2 3 3 relationships of pco2 with ambient factors from november 2017 to april 2018 dic concentrations in capitol lake ranged from 10 to 22 mg c l 1 with an average of 15 4 mg c l 1 δ13cdic varied from 12 to 6 with an average of 10 2 but the majority of most δ13cdic values ranging from 13 to 8 fig 4 doc concentration and δ13cdoc varied from 6 to 9 mg c l 1 and 29 to 27 respectively averaging at 8 1 mg c l 1 and 28 1 fig 4 no significant correlations were found between dic and δ13cdic and between doc and δ13cdoc most ambient parameters in capitol lake showed seasonal variations within the daytime specifically average chl a and cdom were lower during the middle of the daytime while average do and do appeared to increase during the daytime fig 5 significant negative correlations were found between pco2 and ph cdom chl a and solar radiation respectively table 3 clear opposite daytime trends were observed between pco2 and do concentrations on a daily base and a significant negative correlation was found between average daytime trends for pco2 and do concentrations during the study period r 2 0 999 fig 6 a negative correlations were also found between daily average temperature and pco2 daily declining rates b 1 in capitol lake table 1 fig 6b compared to the average level at morning hours 7 00 and 10 00 average pco2 and co2 flux at afternoon hours 14 00 and 17 00 significantly decreased by 56 and 92 respectively p 0 05 in contrast average water temperature and solar radiation increased by 4 and 179 respectively from morning hours to the afternoon hours fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 sink and source dynamics of daily co2 fluxes in the subtropical lake our findings showed strong decreasing trends of pco2 and co2 flux from mornings to evenings throughout the study period fig 3 suggesting that co2 dynamics in this mesotrophic shallow lake is primarily driven by photosynthesis it is to be exact in equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration during the daytime evidenced by the strong daytime negative correlation between pco2 and do concentrations fig 6a photosynthesis and respiration are the two major biogeochemical processes affecting pco2 variation in this study similar findings have been reported by studies in other aquatic systems e g juranek and quay 2005 alin and johnson 2007 peng et al 2012 which often follow the diurnal cycle carbon fixation is limited to daytime hours and respiration occurs throughout the 24 h cycle schelske et al 2006 a ratio of photosynthesis to respiration p r of less than 1 0 indicates heterotrophy resulting in higher pco2 at the water surface than the atmospheric level conversely p r ratio greater than 1 0 suggests an autotrophic ecosystem with pco2 below the atmospheric equilibrium gu et al 2011 on a daily scale co2 in the lake water at 7 00 to 10 00 was often 10 of 12 sampling days supersaturated which is associated with the stronger aquatic respiration over photosynthesis sobek et al 2005 in contrast in the late afternoons pco2 in the lake was mostly under saturated 9 out of 12 measurements which could be attributed to changes in the photosynthesis respiration ratio i e from p r 1 0 to p r 1 0 resulting in co2 invasion from the atmosphere into the lake in addition previous studies have claimed the importance of catchment dic loading on lake pco2 maberly et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 but its influence may be less important for this study due to the sampling strategy however it is worth noting that a local rain event occurred one day prior to the december 23rd field trip fig 2 the catchment dic loading caused by that could be the reason why no significant reduction was found in co2 flux at the middle of that sampling day fig 3 co2 derived from soil respiration and released from sediments may be a superimposed second order phenomenon affecting the overnight pco2 dynamics in the lake δ13c of organic matter is primarily dependent on the photosynthetic pathway of the plant from which it is derived 27 to 30 for c3 plants and 12 to 14 for c4 plants and there is a 7 11 isotopic fractionation when respired co2 is dissolved and converted to dic rounick and winterbourn 1986 cerling et al 1991 dubois et al 2009 morning δ13cdic values of the studied lake in water were mostly between 8 and 13 combined with the fact that the lake is mainly affected by c4 grasses δ13cdic observed in this study could be affected by both soil respiration and lake sediments especially during the nighttime however no data is available for lake sediments and groundwater in this study and it is not clear whether or how sediments and groundwater could have made an effect on soil respiration convective processes can also impact pco2 dynamics at a daily scale in this study the convection process at air water exchange may have played a role in the pco2 dynamic from sunset to sunrise as the isotope data revealed ciais et al 1995 have reported a δ13c value of atmospheric co2 in the northern hemisphere varying between 8 3 and 7 3 in addition night convective processes may transport pockets of co2 rich groundwater entering lakes in the littoral zone brothers et al 2017 morales pineda et al 2014 also found hourly dips in pco2 at 2 m below water surface and high surface co2 fluxes during convective mixing which usually occurs during the nighttime when cooling of the surface water induced vertical water movements and upwelling of deep co2 rich groundwater åberg et al 2010 this could be especially true for lakes with surface areas less than 1 km2 which often have a proportionally greater littoral zone and are more easily affected by the convective mixing downing et al 2006 brothers et al 2017 collectively these findings demonstrated that a subtropical shallow lake could be both a source and a sink of co2 especially during daylight hours 4 2 dominating ambient factors affecting the dynamics of co2 flux in the studied lake the sink and source dynamics of co2 at daylight hours resulting from pco2 changes is primarily driven by sunlight availability i e solar radiation in lakes photosynthesis is often affected by nutrients and solar radiation while respiration may be strongly controlled by water temperature and organic matter loading cole et al 2000 pace et al 2004 yvon durocher et al 2010 previous studies have also reported cases for photo oxidative production of dic from doc due to sunlight e g graneli et al 1996 it is generally believed that pco2 increases together with doc concentration in lake water due to the allochthonous loading of organic matter sobek et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 however it may not be the case here at least at the seasonal scale as our data show a negative correlation between the concentration of pco2 and cdom fluorescence table 3 instead negative correlations exist between pco2 and solar radiation and between do concentrations and pco2 on the daily scale figs 6a and 7 suggesting that daily changes in solar radiation is the major environmental factor driving the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms and thus decreasing pco2 this result is consistent with previous studies linking diurnal variation in pco2 to photosynthetically active radiation par and metabolism as a result of the strong control of par on the balance between photosynthesis and respiration hanson et al 2006 marotta et al 2010 morales pineda et al 2014 it is also worth noting that the dominating driving factor may vary on cloudy or rainy days since the effects of precipitation and catchment dic loading have been minimized in this study many studies have found that water temperature plays a vital role in aquatic metabolism and gas solubility but the relationship between water temperature and pco2 is continuously debated marotta et al 2009 analyzed previous data sets of over 100 tropical lakes reporting a global positive correlation between water temperature and pco2 based on an analysis of the database of more than 4000 lakes at the globe scale however sobek et al 2005 found that pco2 is independent of water temperature in this study water temperature during the daytime was almost constant fig 7 however the significant negative correlation between the average daily water temperature and the daily pco2 declining rates b 1 fig 6b suggests that daily water temperature appeared to have an effect on the pco2 levels in the late afternoons there may be a temperature threshold in mesotrophic waters above which pco2 in the late afternoon could be very low due to active photosynthesis lake trophic status could be another important factor affecting the level of pco2 and co2 flux in aquatic ecosystems gu et al 2011 shao et al 2015 morin et al 2018 although under debate brothers and sibley 2018 unproductive aquatic systems are often net heterotrophic with high respiratory rates e g marotta et al 2010 while productive systems are more likely to be net sinks of co2 e g xu and xu 2015 studies conducted on other aquatic systems or at other climate regions reporting variations in diurnal co2 have mostly attributed them to aquatic productivity for example bass et al 2013 reported that surface co2 was supersaturated throughout the 24 h sampling period from 5436 to 33 041 μatm in a nutrient enriched floodplain in northern australia primarily due to changes in biological factors that drive co2 efflux dynamics in a tropical productive lake in brazil reis and barbosa 2014 reported that diurnal co2 dynamics have strong dependence on biological metabolism while net heterotrophy and co2 outgassing from lakes were registered only at night in this study pco2 levels were likely also affected by the aquatic productivity evidenced by the negative correlation between pco2 and chl a on the seasonal scale table 3 in comparison no significant diel trend in co2 flux was found in an oligotrophic lake in northern michigan usa morin et al 2018 shao et al 2015 reported an obvious diurnal co2 flux variation in august and september during the period of high chl a whereas no noticeable difference was found over time in other months 4 3 uncertainties in current co2 evasion estimation due to diel pco2 dynamics findings from this study suggest considerable uncertainties in current regional and global co2 outgassing estimations especially for trophic lakes for instance the drastic decrease in pco2 during the daytime indicates that field co2 measurements taken in the afternoon may potentially result in underestimated co2 fluxes in this study the time frame required to observe significant decreases in pco2 and co2 flux is small from 10 00 to 14 00 which indicates that the commonly used one time measurements in previous studies could have potentially yielded an underestimation or overestimation in daily co2 outgassing alternatively results from this study also suggests that during the hours of darkness when photosynthesis is almost inactive greater co2 evasion could be expected however only a few studies have paid attention to the co2 outgassing at nighttime for instance from a study of a tropical productive lake in southeastern brazil reis and barbosa 2014 reported that the average nighttime pco2 565 53 μatm was significantly higher than the average daytime pco2 436 26 μatm gu et al 2011 found that long term 1987 2006 average pco2 224 μatm at night was higher than that in the daytime in an analysis of limnological data for lake apopka at florida usa in a recent published study reiman and xu 2018 also reported a consistent diel cycle of pco2 with highest values before sunset and lowest values during peak daylight in the lower mississippi river taken together we argue that great uncertainties may exist in current regional and global estimations of co2 evasion from lake systems due to diel pco2 dynamics 5 conclusions this study investigated the daylight fluctuations of pco2 co2 flux and related water quality parameters in a subtropical shallow lake located in southern louisiana usa from november 2017 to june 2018 by conducting biweekly field trips results from the study show a consistently declining trend of pco2 and co2 flux from early mornings to late afternoons throughout the 8 month study period specifically a significant decrease in average pco2 and co2 flux was found from 10 00 to 14 00 whereas no significant change occurred between 7 00 and 10 00 or between 14 00 and 17 00 average daytime pco2 values in the lake were highest at 7 00 945 511 μatm and lowest at 17 00 374 403 μatm higher average co2 fluxes were observed in the morning hours i e 77 mmol m2 h 1 at 7 00 and 88 mmol m2 h 1 at 10 00 while lower and negative co2 fluxes occurred in the afternoon hours 14 mmol m2 h 1 at 14 00 and 2 mmol m2 h 1 at 17 00 these findings reveal that a shallow mesotrophic lake can function as both a source and a sink of co2 especially during daytime the close correlations of pco2 with daily changes in solar radiation and temperature suggest that the daytime co2 fluctuation in the lake was primarily driven by aquatic metabolism and that solar radiation lake trophic status and water temperature appear to be the most influential factors based on the findings we argue that large uncertainties may exist in the current regional and global co2 evasion estimates due to neglecting the high variability of pco2 in the daytime acknowledgements this study was primarily supported

19002,carbon dioxide co2 emissions from lakes have been proven to be an important component of the continental carbon balance but most co2 evasion estimates ignore daily variability of partial pressure of co2 pco2 to discern the variability of pco2 and its effect on co2 outgassing estimations we conducted in situ biweekly pco2 measurements during daylight from november 2017 to june 2018 at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst in a subtropical shallow lake in louisiana usa daytime pco2 varied largely from 154 to 1698 μatm with an average of 736 μatm while daytime co2 flux ranged from 43 to 284 mmol m2 h 1 averaging at 44 mmol m2 h 1 significant decreases in pco2 and co2 fluxes from mornings to late afternoons were observed throughout the study period specifically in morning hours average pco2 and co2 fluxes were 940 μatm and 83 mmol m2 h 1 respectively while in afternoon hours average pco2 and co2 fluxes were only 410 μatm and 6 mmol m2 h 1 respectively relationships between pco2 and ambient factors reveal that solar radiation lake trophic status and water temperature play a major role in pco2 and co2 dynamics in lake water we argue that uncertainties may exist in the current regional and global co2 evasion estimates due to this high daily pco2 variability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic pco2 co2 flux carbon

bastviken et al 2011 kokic et al 2015 biddanda 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that freshwaters are often supersaturated with aqueous carbon dioxide with respect to atmospheric co2 suggesting net carbon effluxes from aquatic ecosystems to the atmosphere richey et al 2002 butman and raymond 2011 li et al 2012 based on recent estimates of the global surface area of lakes downing et al 2006 a total co2 emission from inland lake waters was estimated to be 0 5 pg c yr 1 with about 60 from freshwater lakes cole et al 1994 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 and 40 from saline lakes duarte et al 2008 compared to the total lateral export of carbon from the continents to the sea approximately 0 9 pg c yr 1 cole et al 2007 co2 emission from lakes is certainly an important component in the continental carbon balance partial pressure of co2 pco2 in aquatic systems can fluctuate spatially and temporarily which can be influenced by several factors including ph pardue et al 1988 seekell and gudasz 2016 water temperature sobek et al 2005 marotta et al 2009 kosten et al 2007 and trophic states marotta et al 2010 gu et al 2011 in most lakes and reservoirs across the world co2 supersaturation has been found which is driven by in situ net ecosystem production imbalanced towards net heterotrophy cole et al 2000 duarte and prairie 2005 gu et al 2011 and or by input of surface water with high dissolved inorganic carbon dic maberly et al 2013 few lakes are reported as autotrophic systems and function as net sinks of co2 kling et al 1992 tranvik et al 2009 bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 1994 reported pco2 levels in 1835 lakes around the world among which less than 10 were within 20 of equilibrium with the atmosphere while more than 80 were supersaturated among the lakes being studied field data for co2 evasion estimates were mostly collected on a weekly to quarterly basis which ignores daily variability of pco2 and hence daily variation of co2 fluxes a knowledge gap still exists regarding the effect of diel changes in pco2 on co2 outgassing estimation for instance daily concentration of inorganic carbon was reported to vary between 4 and 63 mmol m 3 in a productive lake in northwest england maberly 1996 while pco2 was found to have low daily variation in an unproductive lake in northern sweden jonsson et al 2007 considering the large amounts of carbon being processed in lakes and reservoirs an improved quantification of carbon fluxes is needed to help understand the global carbon cycle in the recent decade studies regarding estimating freshwater co2 outgassing at regional and global scales have been intensified e g cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 bastviken et al 2011 but uncertainties in these estimates are still considerable among these the great variability of co2 evasion may be partly due to the difference in temperature and solar radiation derived by geographical regions schelske et al 2006 for instance in the arctic tundra an average co2 flux of 5 1 μmol c m2 s 1 from an upland headwater catchment in alaska was observed crawford et al 2013 in the mediterranean climate morales pineda et al 2014 found average co2 emissions from two reservoirs guadalcacín and bornos in spain ranged from 5 6 to 34 7 μmol c m2 s 1 in the humid continental climate zone of north america a strong diurnal change of co2 flux from 26 0 to 56 7 μmol c m2 s 1 in western lake erie was registered by shao et al 2015 in a boreal lake lake kuivajärvi in finland however an averaged co2 flux of 0 7 μmol c m 2 s 1 throughout the whole day was observed with no clear diurnal variation mammarella et al 2015 in addition uncertainties in the estimates of co2 flux at regional or global scales can also come from methodological limitations schelker et al 2016 current calculation of co2 outgassing from water bodies into the atmosphere is mainly based on the estimate of pco2 derived from water alkalinity ph and temperature measurements e g cole et al 1994 golub et al 2017 but this is very uncertain one of the biggest unknowns is the accuracy of pco2 estimation improving the understanding in pco2 variation is a critical step in achieving reliable estimates of co2 emissions from lake bodies to reduce uncertainties in co2 flux estimations we therefore need to constrain all these factors causing data scatters and differences here we conducted a field study investigating daily pco2 and co2 outgassing variations in a subtropical shallow lake specifically the study was to i measure bi weekly pco2 and ambient parameters of the lake water during daytime from november 2017 to june 2018 ii estimate hourly co2 fluxes at the water air interface using in situ pco2 measurements and iii investigate the influences of environmental factors on daily carbon dynamics and the resulting co2 sink source behaviors of the studied lake the findings from this study will help improve our understanding of daily pco2 variability as well as improve global estimation of co2 outgassing from freshwaters 2 methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at capitol lake latitude 30 27 36 n longitude 91 11 06 w in baton rouge louisiana usa fig 1 from november 2017 to june 2018 this urban lake is located on the previous floodplain of the mississippi river with an open water surface of approximately 22 ha ldeq 2018 it has a perimeter of 3 5 km and a depth ranging from 0 3 to 2 4 m the lake receives drainage from surrounding residential and industrial areas and the entire drainage area is approximately 1170 ha pardue et al 1988 previous studies have documented that the lake had been contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls heavy metals and other industrial and municipal waste during the late 1970s and early 1980s delaune et al 1989 lake water quality has been improved in recent years and can be classified as a mesoeutrophic lake ldeq 2018 with soluble reactive phosphorus levels averaged at 3 μm during the study period the dominating vegetation near the lake are c4 grasses stenotaphrum secundatum walter kuntze and there is no strong distinction between littoral and off shore habitats the climate of the study area is humid subtropical with long hot summers and short mild winters the long term annual precipitation in the region is approximately 1470 mm ranging from 160 mm july to 80 mm october xu and xu 2015 the long term average annual air temperature in this region is approximately 20 c with the minimum in january 11 c and maximum in july 28 c xu and xu 2016 during the 8 month study period average daily air temperature in the studied watershed ranged from 5 to 30 c with the highest in june and the lowest in january 2018 fig 2 daily air temperature on the sampling days varied from 1 c in january to 33 c in june while daily average water temperature fluctuated largely from 5 c in january to 30 c in june fig 5 2 2 field measurements from november 2017 to june 2018 biweekly field trips were conducted for in situ measurements of pco2 and water quality parameters during each trip measurements were taken about 6 m from the shoreline at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst the rationale for the sampling strategy was based on a previous study xu and xu 2015 on a nearby eutrophic lake reporting that 7 00 was the time when solar radiation in the area first became measurable i e above 0 00 kw m 2 accompanying with a daytime minimum of dissolved oxygen do concentration while 17 00 was the latest hour when solar radiation could still be measured i e above 0 00 kw m 2 but with a daytime do maximum there was slight time shift but this diel trend of do was fairly consistent over seasons based on the knowledge we selected 7 00 and 17 00 as the time of sunrise and sunset in this study considering that the studied lake was mesotrophic we hypothesized that daytime pco2 would maximize and minimize at 7 00 and at 17 00 with the weakest and strongest effect of photosynthesis respectively the addition of the two sampling points in between at 10 00 and 14 00 was to track pco2 changes in the lake from sunrise to sunset all trips were made on sunny days to minimize rainfall and or stormwater runoff effects on water conditions pco2 in surface water was measured using a databank handheld datalogger turner designs sunnyvale ca usa connected with a c sense in situ pco2 sensor with 3 full scale accuracy the datalogger measured in situ pco2 at a 30 s interval and measurements were only recorded after the reading was stabilized for about 5 min chlorophyll a chl a fluorescence and colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence cdom were measured using an aquafluor handheld fluorometer turner designs sunnyvale ca usa by a 5 s excitation light scan to untreated water samples turbidity was detected by a hach 2100p handheld turbid meter hach inc loveland co usa other water quality parameters including ph water temperature and do concentration and saturation do were measured using a ysi 556 multi probe system ysi inc yellow springs oh usa at 30 50 cm below the water surface in situ measurements of pco2 ph water temperature and do concentration and saturation were continuously measured for 5 min after readings were stabilized which normally took 15 30 min the variations of readings within the 5 min period were very low and the last ones from each sampling event were used for calculation for turbidity chl a and cdom a composed water sample was taken and measured in the field all measurements were taken at the same location since the studied lake was shallow and small it was assumed that the variation across the lake was low and the measurements could well represent the water quality of the entire lake 2 3 collection of water samples water samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc were collected for analyzing their concentrations and delta 13 isotopes δ13cdic and δ13cdoc at 7 30 cst using a plastic grab sampler at a depth of 30 50 cm below the water surface dic samples were sealed in 20 ml glass vials with plastic caps and butyl rubber septa and

pco2 from early mornings at 7 00 to the late afternoons at 17 00 on all 12 sampling days from november 2017 to june 2018 fig 3 and table 1 daytime average pco2 standard deviation for the entire study period was 736 675 μatm with the highest value in december 2017 1698 201 μatm and the lowest value at the end of february 2018 154 143 μatm significant reductions in average pco2 were found from 10 00 to 14 00 table 2 average pco2 decreased by 1 from 7 00 945 511 μatm to 10 00 934 694 μatm 52 from 10 00 to 14 00 445 541 μatm and 16 from 14 00 to 17 00 374 404 μatm 3 2 estimation of co2 fluxes corresponding to the daytime change of pco2 in the lake water co2 fluxes on all 12 sampling days showed downward trends in daytime hours table 1 and fig 3 throughout the study period daytime average co2 fluxes sd ranged from 44 29 mmol m2 h 1 in february 2018 to 284 80 mmol m2 h 1 in december 2017 with an average of 44 94 mmol m2 h 1 similar to pco2 we also observed significant reductions in daytime co2 flux between 10 00 and 14 00 table 2 for all samples except december 23 2017 fig 3 with respect to the average co2 flux at 7 00 77 98 mmol m2 h 1 average co2 fluxes at 14 00 and 17 00 markedly decreased by 81 14 111 mmol m2 h 1 and 102 2 72 mmol m2 h 1 respectively while average co2 flux at 10 00 increased by 15 88 114 mmol m2 h 1 table 2 3 3 relationships of pco2 with ambient factors from november 2017 to april 2018 dic concentrations in capitol lake ranged from 10 to 22 mg c l 1 with an average of 15 4 mg c l 1 δ13cdic varied from 12 to 6 with an average of 10 2 but the majority of most δ13cdic values ranging from 13 to 8 fig 4 doc concentration and δ13cdoc varied from 6 to 9 mg c l 1 and 29 to 27 respectively averaging at 8 1 mg c l 1 and 28 1 fig 4 no significant correlations were found between dic and δ13cdic and between doc and δ13cdoc most ambient parameters in capitol lake showed seasonal variations within the daytime specifically average chl a and cdom were lower during the middle of the daytime while average do and do appeared to increase during the daytime fig 5 significant negative correlations were found between pco2 and ph cdom chl a and solar radiation respectively table 3 clear opposite daytime trends were observed between pco2 and do concentrations on a daily base and a significant negative correlation was found between average daytime trends for pco2 and do concentrations during the study period r 2 0 999 fig 6 a negative correlations were also found between daily average temperature and pco2 daily declining rates b 1 in capitol lake table 1 fig 6b compared to the average level at morning hours 7 00 and 10 00 average pco2 and co2 flux at afternoon hours 14 00 and 17 00 significantly decreased by 56 and 92 respectively p 0 05 in contrast average water temperature and solar radiation increased by 4 and 179 respectively from morning hours to the afternoon hours fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 sink and source dynamics of daily co2 fluxes in the subtropical lake our findings showed strong decreasing trends of pco2 and co2 flux from mornings to evenings throughout the study period fig 3 suggesting that co2 dynamics in this mesotrophic shallow lake is primarily driven by photosynthesis it is to be exact in equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration during the daytime evidenced by the strong daytime negative correlation between pco2 and do concentrations fig 6a photosynthesis and respiration are the two major biogeochemical processes affecting pco2 variation in this study similar findings have been reported by studies in other aquatic systems e g juranek and quay 2005 alin and johnson 2007 peng et al 2012 which often follow the diurnal cycle carbon fixation is limited to daytime hours and respiration occurs throughout the 24 h cycle schelske et al 2006 a ratio of photosynthesis to respiration p r of less than 1 0 indicates heterotrophy resulting in higher pco2 at the water surface than the atmospheric level conversely p r ratio greater than 1 0 suggests an autotrophic ecosystem with pco2 below the atmospheric equilibrium gu et al 2011 on a daily scale co2 in the lake water at 7 00 to 10 00 was often 10 of 12 sampling days supersaturated which is associated with the stronger aquatic respiration over photosynthesis sobek et al 2005 in contrast in the late afternoons pco2 in the lake was mostly under saturated 9 out of 12 measurements which could be attributed to changes in the photosynthesis respiration ratio i e from p r 1 0 to p r 1 0 resulting in co2 invasion from the atmosphere into the lake in addition previous studies have claimed the importance of catchment dic loading on lake pco2 maberly et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 but its influence may be less important for this study due to the sampling strategy however it is worth noting that a local rain event occurred one day prior to the december 23rd field trip fig 2 the catchment dic loading caused by that could be the reason why no significant reduction was found in co2 flux at the middle of that sampling day fig 3 co2 derived from soil respiration and released from sediments may be a superimposed second order phenomenon affecting the overnight pco2 dynamics in the lake δ13c of organic matter is primarily dependent on the photosynthetic pathway of the plant from which it is derived 27 to 30 for c3 plants and 12 to 14 for c4 plants and there is a 7 11 isotopic fractionation when respired co2 is dissolved and converted to dic rounick and winterbourn 1986 cerling et al 1991 dubois et al 2009 morning δ13cdic values of the studied lake in water were mostly between 8 and 13 combined with the fact that the lake is mainly affected by c4 grasses δ13cdic observed in this study could be affected by both soil respiration and lake sediments especially during the nighttime however no data is available for lake sediments and groundwater in this study and it is not clear whether or how sediments and groundwater could have made an effect on soil respiration convective processes can also impact pco2 dynamics at a daily scale in this study the convection process at air water exchange may have played a role in the pco2 dynamic from sunset to sunrise as the isotope data revealed ciais et al 1995 have reported a δ13c value of atmospheric co2 in the northern hemisphere varying between 8 3 and 7 3 in addition night convective processes may transport pockets of co2 rich groundwater entering lakes in the littoral zone brothers et al 2017 morales pineda et al 2014 also found hourly dips in pco2 at 2 m below water surface and high surface co2 fluxes during convective mixing which usually occurs during the nighttime when cooling of the surface water induced vertical water movements and upwelling of deep co2 rich groundwater åberg et al 2010 this could be especially true for lakes with surface areas less than 1 km2 which often have a proportionally greater littoral zone and are more easily affected by the convective mixing downing et al 2006 brothers et al 2017 collectively these findings demonstrated that a subtropical shallow lake could be both a source and a sink of co2 especially during daylight hours 4 2 dominating ambient factors affecting the dynamics of co2 flux in the studied lake the sink and source dynamics of co2 at daylight hours resulting from pco2 changes is primarily driven by sunlight availability i e solar radiation in lakes photosynthesis is often affected by nutrients and solar radiation while respiration may be strongly controlled by water temperature and organic matter loading cole et al 2000 pace et al 2004 yvon durocher et al 2010 previous studies have also reported cases for photo oxidative production of dic from doc due to sunlight e g graneli et al 1996 it is generally believed that pco2 increases together with doc concentration in lake water due to the allochthonous loading of organic matter sobek et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 however it may not be the case here at least at the seasonal scale as our data show a negative correlation between the concentration of pco2 and cdom fluorescence table 3 instead negative correlations exist between pco2 and solar radiation and between do concentrations and pco2 on the daily scale figs 6a and 7 suggesting that daily changes in solar radiation is the major environmental factor driving the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms and thus decreasing pco2 this result is consistent with previous studies linking diurnal variation in pco2 to photosynthetically active radiation par and metabolism as a result of the strong control of par on the balance between photosynthesis and respiration hanson et al 2006 marotta et al 2010 morales pineda et al 2014 it is also worth noting that the dominating driving factor may vary on cloudy or rainy days since the effects of precipitation and catchment dic loading have been minimized in this study many studies have found that water temperature plays a vital role in aquatic metabolism and gas solubility but the relationship between water temperature and pco2 is continuously debated marotta et al 2009 analyzed previous data sets of over 100 tropical lakes reporting a global positive correlation between water temperature and pco2 based on an analysis of the database of more than 4000 lakes at the globe scale however sobek et al 2005 found that pco2 is independent of water temperature in this study water temperature during the daytime was almost constant fig 7 however the significant negative correlation between the average daily water temperature and the daily pco2 declining rates b 1 fig 6b suggests that daily water temperature appeared to have an effect on the pco2 levels in the late afternoons there may be a temperature threshold in mesotrophic waters above which pco2 in the late afternoon could be very low due to active photosynthesis lake trophic status could be another important factor affecting the level of pco2 and co2 flux in aquatic ecosystems gu et al 2011 shao et al 2015 morin et al 2018 although under debate brothers and sibley 2018 unproductive aquatic systems are often net heterotrophic with high respiratory rates e g marotta et al 2010 while productive systems are more likely to be net sinks of co2 e g xu and xu 2015 studies conducted on other aquatic systems or at other climate regions reporting variations in diurnal co2 have mostly attributed them to aquatic productivity for example bass et al 2013 reported that surface co2 was supersaturated throughout the 24 h sampling period from 5436 to 33 041 μatm in a nutrient enriched floodplain in northern australia primarily due to changes in biological factors that drive co2 efflux dynamics in a tropical productive lake in brazil reis and barbosa 2014 reported that diurnal co2 dynamics have strong dependence on biological metabolism while net heterotrophy and co2 outgassing from lakes were registered only at night in this study pco2 levels were likely also affected by the aquatic productivity evidenced by the negative correlation between pco2 and chl a on the seasonal scale table 3 in comparison no significant diel trend in co2 flux was found in an oligotrophic lake in northern michigan usa morin et al 2018 shao et al 2015 reported an obvious diurnal co2 flux variation in august and september during the period of high chl a whereas no noticeable difference was found over time in other months 4 3 uncertainties in current co2 evasion estimation due to diel pco2 dynamics findings from this study suggest considerable uncertainties in current regional and global co2 outgassing estimations especially for trophic lakes for instance the drastic decrease in pco2 during the daytime indicates that field co2 measurements taken in the afternoon may potentially result in underestimated co2 fluxes in this study the time frame required to observe significant decreases in pco2 and co2 flux is small from 10 00 to 14 00 which indicates that the commonly used one time measurements in previous studies could have potentially yielded an underestimation or overestimation in daily co2 outgassing alternatively results from this study also suggests that during the hours of darkness when photosynthesis is almost inactive greater co2 evasion could be expected however only a few studies have paid attention to the co2 outgassing at nighttime for instance from a study of a tropical productive lake in southeastern brazil reis and barbosa 2014 reported that the average nighttime pco2 565 53 μatm was significantly higher than the average daytime pco2 436 26 μatm gu et al 2011 found that long term 1987 2006 average pco2 224 μatm at night was higher than that in the daytime in an analysis of limnological data for lake apopka at florida usa in a recent published study reiman and xu 2018 also reported a consistent diel cycle of pco2 with highest values before sunset and lowest values during peak daylight in the lower mississippi river taken together we argue that great uncertainties may exist in current regional and global estimations of co2 evasion from lake systems due to diel pco2 dynamics 5 conclusions this study investigated the daylight fluctuations of pco2 co2 flux and related water quality parameters in a subtropical shallow lake located in southern louisiana usa from november 2017 to june 2018 by conducting biweekly field trips results from the study show a consistently declining trend of pco2 and co2 flux from early mornings to late afternoons throughout the 8 month study period specifically a significant decrease in average pco2 and co2 flux was found from 10 00 to 14 00 whereas no significant change occurred between 7 00 and 10 00 or between 14 00 and 17 00 average daytime pco2 values in the lake were highest at 7 00 945 511 μatm and lowest at 17 00 374 403 μatm higher average co2 fluxes were observed in the morning hours i e 77 mmol m2 h 1 at 7 00 and 88 mmol m2 h 1 at 10 00 while lower and negative co2 fluxes occurred in the afternoon hours 14 mmol m2 h 1 at 14 00 and 2 mmol m2 h 1 at 17 00 these findings reveal that a shallow mesotrophic lake can function as both a source and a sink of co2 especially during daytime the close correlations of pco2 with daily changes in solar radiation and temperature suggest that the daytime co2 fluctuation in the lake was primarily driven by aquatic metabolism and that solar radiation lake trophic status and water temperature appear to be the most influential factors based on the findings we argue that large uncertainties may exist in the current regional and global co2 evasion estimates due to neglecting the high variability of pco2 in the daytime acknowledgements this study was primarily supported

19003,phosphorus has been considered as a pollutant to be removed from the wastewater in the last years however it has been considered a valuable asset that needs to be recovered due to its shortage in nature the study of optimum phosphorus management in wastewater treatment plants is not straightforward due to the complexity of technologies and configurations that may be applied for phosphorus removal and recovery in this context plant wide mathematical modelling and simulation tools are very useful for carrying out these studies this paper introduces a study carried out at the sur wwtp madrid to assess optimum phosphorus management strategies based on the pwm the mathematical model made it possible to describe the phosphorus flux and its characterization throughout the plant finally an exploration by simulation with west was carried out to analyse different plant configurations and different operational strategies to optimize phosphorus management strategies in the sur wwtp

treatment plant 1 introduction traditionally because wastewater treatment plants wwtp have been operated to guarantee a certain effluent quality the focus has been the study of processes for chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus removal however nowadays the general concern about scarcity of natural resources is promoting the reconceptualization of wastewater from a different perspective wwtps become water resource recovery facilities wrrfs from which valuable products like chemicals nutrients bioenergy bioproducts or even water itself can be obtained wef 2014 in the case of phosphorus p for example the eutrophication problem associated with its discharge to natural resources has promoted the research and creation of technologies for phosphorus removal in wwtp the most commonly used technology has been the physico chemical process which removes phosphorus through precipitation during the 90s the biological treatment for phosphorus removal by means of microorganisms that accumulate high quantities of phosphorus was widespread in wwtp configurations where phosphorus is removed biologically and there is an anaerobic digester a high amount of phosphorus and ammonia is released at this point the supernatant of the digester is consequently rich in ammonia and phosphorus and consequently at this point struvite may precipitate spontaneously causing pipe blockage problems fattah 2012 however phosphorus is currently being thought of not only as a contaminant but also as a valuable product to be recovered due to its shortage in nature in this sense some studies suggest that phosphorus peak may occur between 2030 and 2040 cordell et al 2009 i e after this demand will exceed supply this has pushed the development of different techniques for phosphorus recovery the work of shu et al 2006 shows that phosphorus recovery as struvite by means of precipitation processes is technically feasible and economically beneficial pastor et al 2008 however the study of the optimum phosphorus management strategies in a wrrf entails a great deal of complexity the configurations combine conventional and innovative technologies for obtaining effluent quality and simultaneously optimizing the recovery of by products the complexity of these configurations and their recirculations makes it necessary to take on a plant wide perspective and include biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes jointly in order to establish an optimum solution for the design and operation of the entire plant copp et al 2002 grau et al 2007a b jeppsson et al 2007 in this context mathematical modelling has been demonstrated over the years to be a valuable tool for assessing different strategies for the optimum design and operation of wwtps a mathematical model able to describe all biochemical and physico chemical p related process and p mass fluxes through the entire plant would be very useful for defining an optimum p management strategy in order to comply with effluent quality requirements maximizing p recovery as struvite and guaranteeing minimum operational costs in the last years several research groups proposed mathematical models along this line kazadi mbamba et al 2015 a b established guidelines to model physico chemical processes in the scope of wastewater treatment plant however no biochemical processes are described ikumi et al 2014 presented a plant wide model pwm where organic matter and nutrient removal anaerobic digestion and phosphorus precipitation are described barat et al 2013 also presented a model for organic matter and nutrient removal incorporating chemical and precipitation reactions ceit ik4 developed a pwm methodology that allows the straightforward construction of compatible mathematical models in addition to biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes this methodology incorporates heat balances and economic cost estimations grau et al 2007a fernández arévalo et al 2014 2017 lizarralde et al 2015 this methodology is especially suitable for the comparative assessment of any combination of existing or in development biological and chemical technologies in terms of effluent quality or overall economic aspects and it guarantees elemental mass and charge balance throughout the whole plant by making it easy to visualize and characterize phosphorus fluxes throughout the plant bearing all the aforementioned in mind this paper aims to show the usefulness of pwms in order to analyse phosphorus fluxes and thus optimize phosphorus management and maximize phosphorus recovery by means of struvite precipitation in sur wwtp madrid with this purpose first the construction calibration and validation of a mathematical model based on the pwm methodology proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 is shown second the complete phosphorus mapping in the wwtp is presented showing the potentiality of the tool for the analysis of p management strategies in the plant third an exploration by simulation is presented to assess the effect of incorporating a precipitation unit into the plant to recover phosphorus as struvite finally the effect of operational strategies in the water line such as control of solid retention time srt in the biological phosphorus removal reactor and temperature are analysed at different seasons of the year in order to draw some guidelines for optimum p management strategies in wwtps 2 description of the sur wwtp the sur wwtp located on the left bank of manzanares river treats wastewater from the sur collector which collects spills from vicálvaro puente de vallecas and villa de vallecas 2 937 000 population equivalent given the configuration of the sewage network it can receive water from other catchments located upstream the main characteristics of the flows and the concentrations of contaminants entering the wwtp are collected in table 1 2 1 configuration of the sur wwtp the water line consists of a pre treatment a primary clarifier and an activated sludge treatment for organic matter and phosphorus removal the sludge line in turn includes different sludge thickening processes anaerobic digestion and a dehydration step with centrifuge the biological treatment treats 260 000 m3 d 2 937 000 population equivalent and is divided into six identical lines each line is designed for biological organic matter and phosphorus removal for this reason each line contains an anaerobic zone a facultative zone and an aerobic zone thus allowing the alternating anaerobic aerobic phases that enables the activity of phosphorus accumulation organisms paos the dimensions and number of elements of the anaerobic zone the facultative zone the aerobic zone and the secondary clarifiers are included in table 2 the average value of the solid retention time is 7 7 days the plant is operated at low aeration in order to limit the nitrification process and enable biological phosphorus removal the sludge treatment consists of primary and secondary sludge thickeners the primary sludge is thickened by gravity in two thickeners the secondary sludge is thickened by dissolved air flotation in six units the thickened sludge is homogenized in two tanks and taken into nine digesters finally the digested sludge is dehydrated by centrifuges the configuration of the whole wwtp including the water line the sludge line and the recycle flows in the wwtp is presented in fig 1 3 mathematical model construction the different scenarios of struvite recovery in the sur wwtp were to be compared and analysed through simulation given this purpose a mathematical model was constructed following the methodology proposed by ceit ik4 grau et al 2007a fernández arévalo et al 2014 lizarralde et al 2015 to reproduce sur wwtp and the possibility of recovering struvite this methodology allows the straightforward construction of compatible mathematical models ensuring elemental mass and charge continuity for any possible combination of unit process models therefore it is especially suited for the comparative assessment of any combination of existing or under development biological and chemical technologies in terms of effluent quality or global economic aspects first the biochemical model for reproducing biological organic matter and phosphorus removal and anaerobic digestion was built the biochemical transformations selected were the ones that describe heterotrophic biomass activity under aerobic conditions pao activity under aerobic conditions and acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis and pao activity under anaerobic conditions additionally extracellular transformations such as disintegration enzymatic hydrolysis and endogenous respiration were included having the biochemical model was defined second liquid gas and precipitation redissolution processes were described for the model constructed for the sur wwtp five gaseous components and the mass exchange between the gaseous and aqueous phases needed to be included h2o o2 co2 nh3 h2 and ch4 regarding the precipitation redissolution reactions the most relevant sparingly soluble salts proposed by musvoto et al 2000 and their precipitation according to the equation proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 were considered i e caco3 mgco3 ca3 po4 2 struvite k struvite and newberyite additionally since chemical phosphorus removal exists in the wwtp fepo4 and fe oh 3 were also included in the model third the chemical model was built selecting the chemical components and species was straightforward once the biochemical and physico chemical transformations was defined based on the methodology proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 the components selected for the case analysed in this paper are h2o h co3 c nh4 n po4 p tva tbu tpro tac ca mg k fe3 fe2 na and cl based on the methodology presented in lizarralde et al 2015 a total of 17 components 56 reactions and 67 chemical species were considered in the model constructed for the sur wwtp biochemical and physico chemical transformations were described using ordinary differential equations while chemical reactions were described using algebraic equations according to the tableau method morel and hering 1993 finally the mass transport of the different units was defined the construction of the biological reactors and the precipitation unit was done according to the methodology proposed lizarralde et al 2015 in contrast the mass transport of the separation units were simplified models that consider them as ideal separation units the detailed description of the mathematical model is compiled in the supplementary data the mathematical model constructed in this work has been implemented in the west www mikebydhi com simulation platform 4 mathematical model calibration once the model was built and implemented in the simulation platform a calibration process was carried out to check the model s capacity to reproduce the real behaviour of the plant with this objective the influent of the wastewater treatment plant was characterized in terms of model components then steady state simulations were run considering average flows and concentrations of a full year finally the model was validated by considering the dynamic behaviour of the plant during the year 4 1 influent characterization according to the measurements available for the influent of the sur wwtp table 1 and the typical ratios for urban wastewater fractioning henze et al 2008 the characterization of the wastewater in terms of model components was estimated following the principles presented in grau et al 2007c the ratios used for organic matter characterization in terms of model components are gathered in table 3 the procedure to obtain the influent characterization is presented in the supplementary data the values of the inorganic components are based on the measurements of orthophosphates ammonia nitrogen and alkalinity 4 2 model calibration under steady state conditions the model parameters to describe cod and nitrogen removal under aerobic and anoxic conditions were adopted from the asm2d henze et al 2000 the model parameters to describe the anaerobic digestion were taken from the adm1 batstone et al 2002 the model parameters that describe anaerobic reactions in the water line were modified in order to achieve a biological phosphorus removal analogous to the results obtained with asm2d this model was employed in previous works showing successful results fernández arévalo et al 2017 2018 those that describe the assimilation and release of phosphorus by paos were modified following the guidelines given in larrea et al 2002 the experimental and simulated data for the average values for one year are compared in fig 2 and it can be seen that there is a reasonable correlation between the experimental data and the values predicted by the model the model is able to reproduce cod and phosphorus removal by means of biochemical processes in the water line the concentration of nitrates in the effluent shows that nitrification occurs under aerobic conditions the presence of nitrates in the anaerobic tank may inhibit the process and reduce the ability of the plant to remove po4p biologically however in this case biological phosphorus removal is not completely inhibited but the plant should be operated in order to avoid nitrification i e low solid retention times the physico chemical processes are able to reproduce the chemical phosphorus removal and biogas production in the anaerobic digester finally the chemical reactions make it possible to correctly describe ph at any point of the plant there is a slight mismatch between experimental and simulated data in the sludge line it can be seen that the biogas production predicted by the model is slightly lower than the experimentally measured value this could be caused by a higher use of volatile fatty acids vfas by pao microorganisms in the model which would result in a lower use of vfas by anaerobic bacteria to produce methane this effect is also observed in the fact that more of phosphorus is released in the model prediction than in the experimental measurements however if higher anaerobic bacteria activity was assumed ammonia release would also increase thus increasing the mismatch between experimental and simulated data in terms of ammonia in the clarified flow of the dewatering unit thus the combination of parameters used in the model is a compromise in order to meet all experimental data in addition to biological reactions the precipitation kinetic parameters were adjusted on the one hand the precipitation kinetic for fepo4 was adjusted to reproduce chemical phosphorus removal the biological mathematical model has previously employed in a wwtp where only biological phosphorus removal was present the kinetic parameter for fepo4 precipitation was adjusted to meet the values of phosphate concentration in the effluent for the real amount of fecl3 dosed on the other hand the precipitation kinetic for struvite was adjusted to meet the efficiency of the technology given by the supplier 4 3 model validation under dynamic conditions the model parameters were established by using the treatment plant s average values of the over the course one year once those parameters were defined the dynamic behaviour of the plant was analysed using the daily information provided by the plant the daily profiles in terms of flow rate total cod total suspended solids and ph have been taken fig 3 for the validation in the case of total kjeldhal nitrogen total phosphorus tp and orthophosphates po4 p weekly data was available the characterization presented in section 4 1 has been applied to generate the dynamic influent in terms of model components the validation of the model has been done by comparing the values of total suspended solids tssml in the reactors t cod po4 p tp and no3 in the effluent biogas production and its composition in the anaerobic digester and the sludge production fig 4 it can be seen that the model is able to reproduce all the variables mentioned above reasonably the match between experimental and simulated data in the water line is right the model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the plant in terms of tssml and codt po4 p and tp in the effluent the mathematical model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the plant for variations in concentration in the influent and different temperatures during the year in the dynamic behaviour of the plant nitrification is observed specifically in the hot seasons likewise in the steady state calibration the biogas production prediction is lower in the model than in real data 5 phosphorus mass flow mapping throughout the wwtp based on the pwm once the predictive capacity of the plant model was validated a model based analysis of different scenarios was performed to analyse mass fluxes within the plant and to explore the best operational strategies for optimizing their performance in order to study the optimum phosphorus management strategies in the wwtp it is necessary to have a complete phosphorus mapping this makes it possible to see at a glance the total amount of phosphorus and phosphates available at each point of the plant thus facilitating the selection of the best available management approaches to that end he next subsections present a complete mass flow mapping of phosphorus in the plant the analysis of possible recovery solutions and the current likelihood of pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation all of which allow the benefits of different strategies to be compared 5 1 phosphorus mass flow mapping throughout the wwtp based on the pwm the model constructed following the pwm methodology guarantees mass continuity throughout the wwtp this in turn allows a complete definition of the phosphorus mass fluxes throughout the wwtp presented in fig 5 it can be seen that a high percentage 70 of the phosphorus entering the plant is retained in the sludge produced the 30 of the phosphorus is discharged in the effluent there are several recycle points in the wwtp that contain phosphorus the clarified recycle flow of the primary sludge thickener contains 5 of the phosphorus in the influent the clarified flow of the secondary sludge thickener is recycled into the activated sludge process and at this point there is 15 of phosphorus entering the plant finally the last recycle point is the supernatant of the anaerobic digester to the head of the plant this flow contains 37 of the total phosphorus entering the wwtp fernández arévalo et al 2017 apart from the total phosphorus fluxes the model constructed following the pwm methodology fully characterizes the phosphorus throughout the plant specifying the form the phosphorus has at each point of the plant i e phosphate ferric phosphate or biological phosphorus fig 6 the chart in fig 6 visualizes the phosphorus forms throughout the plant in the influent 72 of the total phosphorus entering the plant is in the form of phosphates this percentage is reduced through the treatment in the water line 19 in the primary sludge 22 in the effluent and 0 1 in the secondary sludge fig 6 also indicates that 73 of the phosphorus is removed biologically in the activated sludge unit whereas 25 of the phosphorus is removed chemically and contained in the fepo4 once the primary and secondary sludge are thickened and mixed only 0 4 of the total phosphorus in the flux is phosphate this point corresponds with the inlet of the digester where 83 5 of the phosphorus is contained in microorganisms and the organic matter there is a remarkable increase in phosphate concentration in the outflow of the anaerobic digestion this is caused by the poly phosphate release under anaerobic digestion moreover ammonium and other metal cations i e magnesium and potassium are also released during anaerobic digestion however at this point there is still a high concentration of sludge and thus a high concentration of organic phosphate in the clarified outflow from the dewatering unit the dissolved components remain the same as in the outflow of the digester it must be highlighted that the 99 of the total phosphorus is in the form of phosphates 5 2 analysis of the potential phosphorus recovery in the wwtp the previous section shows the mass fluxes and the characterization of phosphorus at each point of the sur wwtp the joint analysis of these two graphics facilitates the study of different alternatives for phosphorus recovery the sludge generated in the dewatering unit contains 70 of the phosphorus entering the wwtp one of the alternatives for recovery is using the sludge on the land if the sludge meets the requirements i e no heavy metals are present singh and agrawal 2008 or alternatively release the phosphorus by leaching and the subsequent recovery of phosphorus as struvite however this treatment still has limits on economic feasibility in full scale application regarding the 30 of phosphorus discharged in the effluent at this point the concentration is too low for precipitation to be viable the recycle flow from the secondary the primary sludge thickeners represent only 15 and 5 of the total phosphorus entering the wwtp respectively the low quantity of the phosphorus available discards these points as recovery points the most significant point in terms of phosphorus recovery as struvite is the clarified flow of the dewatering unit this point represents the 37 of the phosphate entering the wwtp and at this point there is a high concentration of phosphates released in the anaerobic digester and low solid concentration 5 3 quantification of the likely uncontrolled struvite precipitation one of the biggest problems in operating a wwtp where phosphorus is removed biologically and sludge is treated by means of anaerobic digestion is the uncontrolled phosphorus precipitation the most likely place for uncontrolled precipitation to take place is the outflow of the anaerobic digestion due to the release of ammonia and phosphates in the anaerobic digester additionally the water treated in the wwtp contains a high concentration of magnesium in the influent magnesium is also accumulated during the biological process and released in the anaerobic digester although alkaline ph is required to have a good struvite precipitation the high ammonia phosphate and magnesium concentration causes a supersaturation condition in the effluent from the digester this is the reason why the uncontrolled struvite precipitation at this point has been quantified in this study to that end a reactor after the digester has been introduced into the simulations to simulate the retention time in the pipes and reproduce the precipitation in them in this scenario simulation results show that on average 345 2 kg of struvite may precipitate every day 126 tonnes of struvite per year causing pipe blockage this high amount of uncontrolled struvite precipitation is a signal that it may be economically and technically feasible to recover phosphorus as struvite by means of precipitation in this wwtp the following section describes different scenarios analysed for struvite recovery 6 exploration by simulation of the potential for phosphorus recovery based on the results presented in the previous section this section describes a model based scenario analysis that was performed in order to assess the maximum quantity of struvite that can be recovered and the benefits on the plant operation to that end three different scenarios were compared in terms of struvite production biogas production sludge production ferric chloride dosage and pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the baseline scenario scenario a is based on the current plant configuration however due to a change in the operation of the current plant the sludge is withdrawn from the secondary settler rather than from the biological reactor as shown in fig 7 in the second scenario scenario b fig 8 a precipitation unit is incorporated after the dewatering unit to recover struvite from the supernatant from the digester by incorporating the reactor unit struvite is recovered and lower phosphate concentrations are taken into the head of the plant in the third scenario scenario c fig 9 a redissolution tank is added to treat the secondary sludge in order to avoid pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the redissolution tank is an anaerobic reactor where the phosphorus and magnesium accumulated by pao bacteria is released this way the main release of phosphorus is done in the redissolution tank and a lower quantity of phosphorus is released in the anaerobic digester consequently the precipitation likelihood after the anaerobic digester should be lower although scenario c is proposed as a solution to avoid the uncontrolled struvite precipitation the suitability and efficiency of the process will depend on the available readily organic matter in the redissolution tank and residence time conditions thus there may be a lack of volatile fatty acids in the redissolution tank due to a low redissolution of organic matter and this may cause a low release of phosphorus that would cause a very low release of po4 p and mg2 to overcome this scenario d fig 10 is also proposed where a fraction of the primary sludge is taken to the redissolution tank as a source of organic matter the percentage of the primary sludge taken to the redissolution tank was estimated based on process stoichiometry such that the amount of volatile fatty acids taken to the redissolution tank guarantees the release of phosphates fig 11 shows a complete phosphate fluxes in scenarios a b c and d facilitating the understanding the behaviour of the plant in all cases fecl3 dosing is controlled so that phosphate concentration in the effluent is kept constant in all cases incorporating a precipitation tank in the sludge line affects the amount of phosphorus recycled to the head of the plant in scenarios b and d the amount of phosphates recycled to the head of the plant is reduced by around 80 in scenario c this reduction is lower 43 since a smaller amount of struvite is recovered the main difference between scenarios b and d lies in the effluent from the digester in scenario b the release of phosphate under anaerobic conditions occurs in the anaerobic digester the phosphate flux in the effluent from the anaerobic digester is 572 7 kg p d in contrast in scenario d the release of phosphorus occurs in the redissolution tank and in the anaerobic digester consequently the flux in the effluent from the anaerobic digester is lower than in scenario b 402 kg p day the rest of the phosphorus is released in the redissolution tank 172 4 kg p d these two fluxes are mixed in the influent of the precipitation unit as a consequence the amount of phosphorus entering the precipitation tank is comparable and so is the amount of struvite recovered in scenario c the amount of phosphorus released in the redissolution tank is very low when mixing this diluted flux with the supernatant from the digester a very diluted flux enters the precipitation unit thus reducing the efficiency of the precipitation unit in addition to mapping the phosphorus throughout the plant this mathematical model permits the relevant operational variables to be evaluated at the different points of the wwtp table 4 compares the one year model predictions for scenarios a b c and d in terms of struvite production mgcl2 dosage to provide with the required mg2 to form struvite and naoh dosage to maintain the ph in the optimum values in the precipitation unit as struvite precipitation is an alkalinity consuming process naoh is required to maintain ph at the optimum value for struvite precipitation in the three new scenarios proposed in the paper struvite is recovered theoretically in scenarios b and d the amount of struvite produced is comparable 1343 and 1345 tonnes per year however in scenario c a very small amount of struvite is recovered this is because the dissolution of phosphate in the redissolution tank is very low if no primary sludge is provided leading to a small amount of dissolved phosphorus being available in the precipitation tank additionally in scenario c higher flow rates enter the precipitation unit compared to scenario b causing a dilution of the flow going into the reactor which reduces the precipitation kinetic higher flow rates imply lower retention times in the reactor as well these two factors reduce the plant s recovery efficiency in order to achieve the cited struvite production magnesium chloride and sodium hydroxide must be added into the precipitation unit the magnesium chloride dosage is directly dependent on the struvite recovered and consequently higher magnesium chloride is required in scenario d 1 05 at a first glance it would be reasonable to expect that the sodium hydroxide would follow the same trend however in this case the amount of naoh required in scenario d is theoretically 10 2 higher than in scenario b this is because the ph in the flow from the redissolution tank is lower 6 9 than the ph in the effluent of the anaerobic digester 7 4 in scenario d consequently higher amount of sodium hydroxide is needed to achieve the same ph in the reactor this effect shows the need to ensure a good aquatic chemistry and ph prediction throughout the plant the recovery of phosphorus as struvite has a positive effect on the overall performance of the plant specifically the key factors affected are the consumption of fecl3 for chemical phosphorus removal the treatment of the sludge produced and maintenance cost savings associated with the clogging of pipes due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the benefits in these operational variables can be translated into economic savings that depending on the struvite purchase price can be much more significant than the benefit of selling struvite itself table 5 shows the comparison of the four scenarios proposed in this paper in terms of the plant wide operational variables it can be seen that less uncontrolled struvite precipitation occurs in the cases where struvite is recovered because less phosphorus is recycled into the head of the plant in scenario b the amount of uncontrolled struvite precipitation is 24 6 lower compared to scenario a additionally in scenario d the main release of phosphorus and magnesium occurs in a different point of the ammonia release causing 69 8 less uncontrolled precipitation including a redissolution tank reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation by 45 2 in scenario d relative to scenario b illustrating the benefit of including the redissolution tank despite the similarity in struvite recovery in scenario c since there is no phosphate and magnesium release in the redissolution tank the uncontrolled struvite precipitation is not as low as expected this fact together with lower struvite production makes scenario c technically unfeasible the sludge production in the four scenarios is also shown in table 5 by incorporating a precipitation unit into the plant configuration reduces the sludge disposal 6 6 in scenario b and 5 9 in scenario d which is translated into economical savings recovering struvite in the sludge line means that smaller amount of orthophosphate is recycled into the water line in consequence the ferric chloride dosage required to achieve the effluent quality in terms of phosphorus concentration is lowered by up to 50 in scenarios b and 45 1 in scenario d this study shows the technical benefits of incorporating the precipitation unit into the plant configuration the solution presented shows the maximum struvite recovery capacity of the wwtp in a first implementation phase the sur wwtp installed the technology sized to produce 2000 kg of struvite per day with the configuration of scenario b this is spain s first scale plant for phosphorus recovery as struvite this implementation shows promising results in line with the simulation study futurenviro 2017 the installation could be enhanced to reach the maximum struvite recovery potential this analysis was undertaken for the average value of solid retention time at which the plant is currently operated and the average temperature of 19 c the plant s performance in terms of biological phosphorus removal is directly affected by these two factors and consequently this may have an effect on the factors analysed above the following section studies the effect of these parameters on the plant s performance 7 exploration by simulation of the operation of the biological treatment for maximum struvite production an additional analysis was performed to study the effect of the operational conditions on the results for scenario d shown in the previous section the maximum capacity for struvite production depends on the biological phosphorus removal consequently it is very important to find the optimum water line operating conditions in order to maximize struvite production there are various factors affecting the biological phosphorus removal such as the solid retention time srt and consequently the concentration of tssml the operating temperature temp the vfa available or the po4 p in the inlet the objective of this exploration is to analyse the optimum srt or tssml in the biological reactors for the different average temperatures that may occur in during the year at low solid retention times biological phosphorus removal is favoured seviour and nielsen 2010 greater biological phosphorus removal is beneficial for struvite recovery since higher amount of phosphorus will be released in the sludge line under anaerobic conditions anaerobic digester or redissolution tank temperature affects struvite recovery through two mechanisms biological phosphorus removal is not favoured because of higher nitrification rate and presence of nitrates in the anaerobic tank which reduces the phosphorus accumulated biologically and in the solubility of struvite is greater at high temperatures consequently high temperatures do not favour struvite recovery the following paragraphs present the effect of these operating conditions on the overall performance of the plant in terms of struvite recovery uncontrolled struvite precipitation naoh and mgcl2 dosage in the precipitation unit and fecl3 dosage for chemical phosphorus precipitation to perform this study the solid retention time was analysed by controlling the sludge flow rate to maintain a constant solid concentration in the aerated tank the solid concentration in the aerated reactor varied between 1500 g m3 and 3500 g m3 for different temperatures ranging from 13 c to 25 c to reproduce different seasons of the year in all cases the required effluent quality is guaranteed the solid retention time is never lower than the value required to remove organic matter and phosphorus removal is guaranteed due to the control of fecl3 dosage to guarantee minimum phosphate release focusing first on the effect of the cited operating parameters on struvite production fig 12 shows the effect of the concentration of solids and temperature on the recovery of struvite the red zone indicates the maximum struvite capacity whereas the blue zone indicates the lowest struvite recovery in general lower srt represented by lower tssml in fig 12 means higher struvite recovery this is due to the fact that biological phosphorus removal is favoured at low srt seviour and nielsen 2010 however it must be noted that below a certain concentration struvite recovery drops in this case the srt is not high enough to guarantee the growth of pao microorganisms and biological phosphorus removal is not optimum consequently struvite recovery is not maximal either the optimum solid concentration in the aerated tank varies at different temperatures between 13 c and 19 c the optimum solid concentration is 2000 g m3 however at higher temperatures the water line can operate at lower solid concentration for example around 1500 g m3 and maximize struvite recovery this is due to the fact that there is higher microorganism activity and thus the system can operate at lower srt values fig 13 shows the behaviour of the plant in terms of uncontrolled struvite precipitation for different solid retention times and temperatures the red zones indicate undesired operating strategies since these indicate maximum spontaneous struvite precipitation and consequently higher maintenance costs at low solid retention times represented by low tssml in fig 13 spontaneous struvite precipitation is lower than at high solid retention times this is due to a higher struvite recovery at high struvite recoveries smaller quantity of phosphates is recycled into the biological treatment and therefore lower quantities are released in the anaerobic digester turning to the issue of mgcl2 and naoh dosages in the precipitation unit fig 14 shows mgcl2 dosage needed to recover struvite and naoh dosage required to keep the optimum ph value in the struvite recovery technology the mgcl2 follows the same trend as the production of struvite there is an increase in mgcl2 dosage as srt lowers which is caused by an increase in struvite production however below a certain value of concentration of solids in the aerated reactor the dosage required decreases as struvite production also decreases in contrast the dosage of naoh does not follow this trend this is because the dosage of naoh depends not only on the production of struvite but also on the ph of the water in the inlet it was observed that naoh dosage increases for lower srt values this is because there is an increase in biological activity in the digester as srt decreases causing higher acidification in the inlet to the precipitation unit once again this shows the need to have a good ph prediction in the entire plant in order to be able to estimate the dosage of naoh in the precipitation unit finally the dosage of fecl3 required to maintain the effluent quality depending on the operating conditions cited above was analysed fig 15 red zones indicate high dosage requirements whereas blue zones are the desirable zones since these indicate lower dosage needs at low solid retention times the dosage of fecl3 decreases this is caused by two factors on the one hand at that point biological phosphorus removal is favoured and thus chemical phosphorus removal decreases on the other hand struvite recovery is maximized and thus the amount of phosphorus recycled into the water line is reduced additionally it is observed that for low temperatures the required dosage of fecl3 is reduced even if struvite recovery is lower at low temperatures the fecl3 dosage is reduced because the solubility of the fepo4 is reduced at low temperatures in summary the simulation shows that the optimum point for maximizing struvite production is working at low solid retention times when struvite production is maximized uncontrolled struvite precipitation is minimized the study presented in this work shows the potential of mathematical models to analyse different scenarios under different conditions the solution suggested in this paper may be required in other wwtps however a tailored study for each case depending on regional legislation or plant configuration the modelling methodology employed in this paper makes it possible to carry out these studies in a rigorous way 8 conclusions based on a real case scenario this paper presents a model based analysis for optimum p management in wwtps considering water quality economical costs and phosphorous recovery as struvite in a circular economy context given that aim a mathematical model has been constructed considering the following features 1 it is able to reproduce biological phosphorus and organic matter removal chemical phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion and struvite precipitation and ph evolution under dynamic conditions 2 it is a plant wide model that is able to analyse the interactions between the water and sludge line 3 it is able to guarantee phosphorus mass continuity 4 it shows the different forms in which phosphorus is present at each point and 5 it includes costs in order to analyse different alternatives for p mapping and recovery the model constructed was calibrated and validated with one year s worth of experimental data from the full scale sur wwtp madrid the mathematical model yielded a complete phosphorus mass balance throughout the plant and this made it possible to analyse the different phosphorus recovery alternatives based on this analysis four different scenarios were proposed from the model based exploration of the different scenarios a number of conclusions may be drawn adding a technology for struvite recovery in addition to the benefits of obtaining a marketable product reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation and thus reduces pipe blockage moreover the sludge production decreases which lowers operational costs related to sludge disposal since the phosphorus quantity recycled to the head of the plant is reduced ferric chloride dosage also is reduced finally biogas production is maintained when a precipitation unit is added the effect of incorporating a redissolution tank to treat secondary sludge was analysed in this scenario the necessity of incorporating primary sludge as source of volatile fatty acids for the redissolution tank was shown this technology increased the quantity of struvite that could be recovered additionally it significantly reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation in the pipes immediately after the digester the scenario analysis showed the benefits of incorporating the technology for struvite recovery in addition to the benefits of obtaining a marketable product the operation and maintenance costs of the plant were considerably reduced based on these results the solution has been implemented in the real wwtp making it the first case in spain where struvite is recovered after several months of operation the plant s real behaviour confirms the simulation results finally a study was performed to determine optimum operational strategies in the water line to maximize struvite production this study made it possible to 1 assess the effect of certain operational variables like srt or temperature and 2 draw up some guidelines about optimum p management and recovery considering seasonal variations from this analysis it can be concluded that low srt promotes high struvite recovery the optimum value of solid concentration in the aerated tank varies with temperature for temperatures between 13 c and 19 c the optimum solid concentration for struvite recovery was 2000 g m3 whereas at higher temperatures the maximum struvite recovery is achieved at lower solid concentration acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the spanish education and culture ministry for the research

19003,phosphorus has been considered as a pollutant to be removed from the wastewater in the last years however it has been considered a valuable asset that needs to be recovered due to its shortage in nature the study of optimum phosphorus management in wastewater treatment plants is not straightforward due to the complexity of technologies and configurations that may be applied for phosphorus removal and recovery in this context plant wide mathematical modelling and simulation tools are very useful for carrying out these studies this paper introduces a study carried out at the sur wwtp madrid to assess optimum phosphorus management strategies based on the pwm the mathematical model made it possible to describe the phosphorus flux and its characterization throughout the plant finally

treatment plant 1 introduction traditionally because wastewater treatment plants wwtp have been operated to guarantee a certain effluent quality the focus has been the study of processes for chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus removal however nowadays the general concern about scarcity of natural resources is promoting the reconceptualization of wastewater from a different perspective wwtps become water resource recovery facilities wrrfs from which valuable products like chemicals nutrients bioenergy bioproducts or even water itself can be obtained wef 2014 in the case of phosphorus p for example the eutrophication problem associated with its discharge to natural resources has promoted the research and creation of technologies for phosphorus removal in wwtp the most commonly used technology has been the physico chemical process which removes phosphorus through precipitation during the 90s the biological treatment for phosphorus removal by means of microorganisms that accumulate high quantities of phosphorus was widespread in wwtp configurations where phosphorus is removed biologically and there is an anaerobic digester a high amount of phosphorus and ammonia is released at this point the supernatant of the digester is consequently rich in ammonia and phosphorus and consequently at this point struvite may precipitate spontaneously causing pipe blockage problems fattah 2012 however phosphorus is currently being thought of not only as a contaminant but also as a valuable product to be recovered due to its shortage in nature in this sense some studies suggest that phosphorus peak may occur between 2030 and 2040 cordell et al 2009 i e after this demand will exceed supply this has pushed the development of different techniques for phosphorus recovery the work of shu et al 2006 shows that phosphorus recovery as struvite by means of precipitation processes is technically feasible and economically beneficial pastor et al 2008 however the study of the optimum phosphorus management strategies in a wrrf entails a great deal of complexity the configurations combine conventional and innovative technologies for obtaining effluent quality and simultaneously optimizing the recovery of by products the complexity of these configurations and their recirculations makes it necessary to take on a plant wide perspective and include biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes jointly in order to establish an optimum solution for the design and operation of the entire plant copp et al 2002 grau et al 2007a b jeppsson et al 2007 in this context mathematical modelling has been demonstrated over the years to be a valuable tool for assessing different strategies for the optimum design and operation of wwtps a mathematical model able to describe all biochemical and physico chemical p related process and p mass fluxes through the entire plant would be very useful for defining an optimum p management strategy in order to comply with effluent quality requirements maximizing p recovery as struvite and guaranteeing minimum operational costs in the last years several research groups proposed mathematical models along this line kazadi mbamba et al 2015 a b established guidelines to model physico chemical processes in the scope of wastewater treatment plant however no biochemical processes are described ikumi et al 2014 presented a plant wide model pwm where organic matter and nutrient removal anaerobic digestion and phosphorus precipitation are described barat et al 2013 also presented a model for organic matter and nutrient removal incorporating chemical and precipitation reactions ceit ik4 developed a pwm methodology that allows the straightforward construction of compatible mathematical models in addition to biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes this methodology incorporates heat balances and economic cost estimations grau et al 2007a fernández arévalo et al 2014 2017 lizarralde et al 2015 this methodology is especially suitable for the comparative assessment of any combination of existing or in development biological and chemical technologies in terms of effluent quality or overall economic aspects and it guarantees elemental mass and charge balance throughout the whole plant by making it easy to visualize and characterize phosphorus fluxes throughout the plant bearing all the aforementioned in mind this paper aims to show the usefulness of pwms in order to analyse phosphorus fluxes and thus optimize phosphorus management and maximize phosphorus recovery by means of struvite precipitation in sur wwtp madrid with this purpose first the construction calibration and validation of a mathematical model based on the pwm methodology proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 is shown second the complete phosphorus mapping in the wwtp is presented showing the potentiality of the tool for the analysis of p management strategies in the plant third an exploration by simulation is presented to assess the effect of incorporating a precipitation unit into the plant to recover phosphorus as struvite finally the effect of operational strategies in the water line such as control of solid retention time srt in the biological phosphorus removal reactor and temperature are analysed at different seasons of the year in order to draw some guidelines for optimum p management strategies in wwtps 2 description of the sur wwtp the sur wwtp located on the left bank of manzanares river treats wastewater from the sur collector which collects spills from vicálvaro puente de vallecas and villa de vallecas 2 937 000 population equivalent given the configuration of the sewage network it can receive water from other catchments located upstream the main characteristics of the flows and the concentrations of contaminants entering the wwtp are collected in table 1 2 1 configuration of the sur wwtp the water line consists of a pre treatment a primary clarifier and an activated sludge treatment for organic matter and phosphorus removal the sludge line in turn includes different sludge thickening processes anaerobic digestion and a dehydration step with centrifuge the biological treatment treats 260 000 m3 d 2 937 000 population equivalent and is divided into six identical lines each line is designed for biological organic matter and phosphorus removal for this reason each line contains an anaerobic zone a facultative zone and an aerobic zone thus allowing the alternating anaerobic aerobic phases that enables the activity of phosphorus accumulation organisms paos the dimensions and number of elements of the anaerobic zone the facultative zone the aerobic zone and the secondary clarifiers are included in table 2 the average value of the solid retention time is 7 7 days the plant is operated at low aeration in order to limit the nitrification process and enable biological phosphorus removal the sludge treatment consists of primary and secondary sludge thickeners the primary sludge is thickened by gravity in two thickeners the secondary sludge is thickened by dissolved air flotation in six units the thickened sludge is homogenized in two tanks and taken into nine digesters finally the digested sludge is dehydrated by centrifuges the configuration of the whole wwtp including the water line the sludge line and the recycle flows in the wwtp is presented in fig 1 3 mathematical model construction the different scenarios of struvite recovery in the sur wwtp were to be compared and analysed through simulation given this purpose a mathematical model was constructed following the methodology proposed by ceit ik4 grau et al 2007a fernández arévalo et al 2014 lizarralde et al 2015 to reproduce sur wwtp and the possibility of recovering struvite this methodology allows the straightforward construction of compatible mathematical models ensuring elemental mass and charge continuity for any possible combination of unit process models therefore it is especially suited for the comparative assessment of any combination of existing or under development biological and chemical technologies in terms of effluent quality or global economic aspects first the biochemical model for reproducing biological organic matter and phosphorus removal and anaerobic digestion was built the biochemical transformations selected were the ones that describe heterotrophic biomass activity under aerobic conditions pao activity under aerobic conditions and acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis and pao activity under anaerobic conditions additionally extracellular transformations such as disintegration enzymatic hydrolysis and endogenous respiration were included having the biochemical model was defined second liquid gas and precipitation redissolution processes were described for the model constructed for the sur wwtp five gaseous components and the mass exchange between the gaseous and aqueous phases needed to be included h2o o2 co2 nh3 h2 and ch4 regarding the precipitation redissolution reactions the most relevant sparingly soluble salts proposed by musvoto et al 2000 and their precipitation according to the equation proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 were considered i e caco3 mgco3 ca3 po4 2 struvite k struvite and newberyite additionally since chemical phosphorus removal exists in the wwtp fepo4 and fe oh 3 were also included in the model third the chemical model was built selecting the chemical components and species was straightforward once the biochemical and physico chemical transformations was defined based on the methodology proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 the components selected for the case analysed in this paper are h2o h co3 c nh4 n po4 p tva tbu tpro tac ca mg k fe3 fe2 na and cl based on the methodology presented in lizarralde et al 2015 a total of 17 components 56 reactions and 67 chemical species were considered in the model constructed for the sur wwtp biochemical and physico chemical transformations were described using ordinary differential equations while chemical reactions were described using algebraic equations according to the tableau method morel and hering 1993 finally the mass transport of the different units was defined the construction of the biological reactors and the precipitation unit was done according to the methodology proposed lizarralde et al 2015 in contrast the mass transport of the separation units were simplified models that consider them as ideal separation units the detailed description of the mathematical model is compiled in the supplementary data the mathematical model constructed in this work has been implemented in the west www mikebydhi com simulation platform 4 mathematical model calibration once the model was built and implemented in the simulation platform a calibration process was carried out to check the model s capacity to reproduce the real behaviour of the plant with this objective the influent of the wastewater treatment plant was characterized in terms of model components then steady state simulations were run considering average flows and concentrations of a full year finally the model was validated by considering the dynamic behaviour of the plant during the year 4 1 influent characterization according to the measurements available for the influent of the sur wwtp table 1 and the typical ratios for urban wastewater fractioning henze et al 2008 the characterization of the wastewater in terms of model components was estimated following the principles presented in grau et al 2007c the ratios used for organic matter characterization in terms of model components are gathered in table 3 the procedure to obtain the influent characterization is presented in the supplementary data the values of the inorganic components are based on the measurements of orthophosphates ammonia nitrogen and alkalinity 4 2 model calibration under steady state conditions the model parameters to describe cod and nitrogen removal under aerobic and anoxic conditions were adopted from the asm2d henze et al 2000 the model parameters to describe the anaerobic digestion were taken from the adm1 batstone et al 2002 the model parameters that describe anaerobic reactions in the water line were modified in order to achieve a biological phosphorus removal analogous to the results obtained with asm2d this model was employed in previous works showing successful results fernández arévalo et al 2017 2018 those that describe the assimilation and release of phosphorus by paos were modified following the guidelines given in larrea et al 2002 the experimental and simulated data for the average values for one year are compared in fig 2 and it can be seen that there is a reasonable correlation between the experimental data and the values predicted by the model the model is able to reproduce cod and phosphorus removal by means of biochemical processes in the water line the concentration of nitrates in the effluent shows that nitrification occurs under aerobic conditions the presence of nitrates in the anaerobic tank may inhibit the process and reduce the ability of the plant to remove po4p biologically however in this case biological phosphorus removal is not completely inhibited but the plant should be operated in order to avoid nitrification i e low solid retention times the physico chemical processes are able to reproduce the chemical phosphorus removal and biogas production in the anaerobic digester finally the chemical reactions make it possible to correctly describe ph at any point of the plant there is a slight mismatch between experimental and simulated data in the sludge line it can be seen that the biogas production predicted by the model is slightly lower than the experimentally measured value this could be caused by a higher use of volatile fatty acids vfas by pao microorganisms in the model which would result in a lower use of vfas by anaerobic bacteria to produce methane this effect is also observed in the fact that more of phosphorus is released in the model prediction than in the experimental measurements however if higher anaerobic bacteria activity was assumed ammonia release would also increase thus increasing the mismatch between experimental and simulated data in terms of ammonia in the clarified flow of the dewatering unit thus the combination of parameters used in the model is a compromise in order to meet all experimental data in addition to biological reactions the precipitation kinetic parameters were adjusted on the one hand the precipitation kinetic for fepo4 was adjusted to reproduce chemical phosphorus removal the biological mathematical model has previously employed in a wwtp where only biological phosphorus removal was present the kinetic parameter for fepo4 precipitation was adjusted to meet the values of phosphate concentration in the effluent for the real amount of fecl3 dosed on the other hand the precipitation kinetic for struvite was adjusted to meet the efficiency of the technology given by the supplier 4 3 model validation under dynamic conditions the model parameters were established by using the treatment plant s average values of the over the course one year once those parameters were defined the dynamic behaviour of the plant was analysed using the daily information provided by the plant the daily profiles in terms of flow rate total cod total suspended solids and ph have been taken fig 3 for the validation in the case of total kjeldhal nitrogen total phosphorus tp and orthophosphates po4 p weekly data was available the characterization presented in section 4 1 has been applied to generate the dynamic influent in terms of model components the validation of the model has been done by comparing the values of total suspended solids tssml in the reactors t cod po4 p tp and no3 in the effluent biogas production and its composition in the anaerobic digester and the sludge production fig 4 it can be seen that the model is able to reproduce all the variables mentioned above reasonably the match between experimental and simulated data in the water line is right the model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the plant in terms of tssml and codt po4 p and tp in the effluent the mathematical model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the plant for variations in concentration in the influent and different temperatures during the year in the dynamic behaviour of the plant nitrification is observed specifically in the hot seasons likewise in the steady state calibration the biogas production prediction is lower in the model than in real data 5 phosphorus mass flow mapping throughout the wwtp based on the pwm once the predictive capacity of the plant model was validated a model based analysis of different scenarios was performed to analyse mass fluxes within the plant and to explore the best operational strategies for optimizing their performance in order to study the optimum phosphorus management strategies in the wwtp it is necessary to have a complete phosphorus mapping this makes it possible to see at a glance the total amount of phosphorus and phosphates available at each point of the plant thus facilitating the selection of the best available management approaches to that end he next subsections present a complete mass flow mapping of phosphorus in the plant the analysis of possible recovery solutions and the current likelihood of pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation all of which allow the benefits of different strategies to be compared 5 1 phosphorus mass flow mapping throughout the wwtp based on the pwm the model constructed following the pwm methodology guarantees mass continuity throughout the wwtp this in turn allows a complete definition of the phosphorus mass fluxes throughout the wwtp presented in fig 5 it can be seen that a high percentage 70 of the phosphorus entering the plant is retained in the sludge produced the 30 of the phosphorus is discharged in the effluent there are several recycle points in the wwtp that contain phosphorus the clarified recycle flow of the primary sludge thickener contains 5 of the phosphorus in the influent the clarified flow of the secondary sludge thickener is recycled into the activated sludge process and at this point there is 15 of phosphorus entering the plant finally the last recycle point is the supernatant of the anaerobic digester to the head of the plant this flow contains 37 of the total phosphorus entering the wwtp fernández arévalo et al 2017 apart from the total phosphorus fluxes the model constructed following the pwm methodology fully characterizes the phosphorus throughout the plant specifying the form the phosphorus has at each point of the plant i e phosphate ferric phosphate or biological phosphorus fig 6 the chart in fig 6 visualizes the phosphorus forms throughout the plant in the influent 72 of the total phosphorus entering the plant is in the form of phosphates this percentage is reduced through the treatment in the water line 19 in the primary sludge 22 in the effluent and 0 1 in the secondary sludge fig 6 also indicates that 73 of the phosphorus is removed biologically in the activated sludge unit whereas 25 of the phosphorus is removed chemically and contained in the fepo4 once the primary and secondary sludge are thickened and mixed only 0 4 of the total phosphorus in the flux is phosphate this point corresponds with the inlet of the digester where 83 5 of the phosphorus is contained in microorganisms and the organic matter there is a remarkable increase in phosphate concentration in the outflow of the anaerobic digestion this is caused by the poly phosphate release under anaerobic digestion moreover ammonium and other metal cations i e magnesium and potassium are also released during anaerobic digestion however at this point there is still a high concentration of sludge and thus a high concentration of organic phosphate in the clarified outflow from the dewatering unit the dissolved components remain the same as in the outflow of the digester it must be highlighted that the 99 of the total phosphorus is in the form of phosphates 5 2 analysis of the potential phosphorus recovery in the wwtp the previous section shows the mass fluxes and the characterization of phosphorus at each point of the sur wwtp the joint analysis of these two graphics facilitates the study of different alternatives for phosphorus recovery the sludge generated in the dewatering unit contains 70 of the phosphorus entering the wwtp one of the alternatives for recovery is using the sludge on the land if the sludge meets the requirements i e no heavy metals are present singh and agrawal 2008 or alternatively release the phosphorus by leaching and the subsequent recovery of phosphorus as struvite however this treatment still has limits on economic feasibility in full scale application regarding the 30 of phosphorus discharged in the effluent at this point the concentration is too low for precipitation to be viable the recycle flow from the secondary the primary sludge thickeners represent only 15 and 5 of the total phosphorus entering the wwtp respectively the low quantity of the phosphorus available discards these points as recovery points the most significant point in terms of phosphorus recovery as struvite is the clarified flow of the dewatering unit this point represents the 37 of the phosphate entering the wwtp and at this point there is a high concentration of phosphates released in the anaerobic digester and low solid concentration 5 3 quantification of the likely uncontrolled struvite precipitation one of the biggest problems in operating a wwtp where phosphorus is removed biologically and sludge is treated by means of anaerobic digestion is the uncontrolled phosphorus precipitation the most likely place for uncontrolled precipitation to take place is the outflow of the anaerobic digestion due to the release of ammonia and phosphates in the anaerobic digester additionally the water treated in the wwtp contains a high concentration of magnesium in the influent magnesium is also accumulated during the biological process and released in the anaerobic digester although alkaline ph is required to have a good struvite precipitation the high ammonia phosphate and magnesium concentration causes a supersaturation condition in the effluent from the digester this is the reason why the uncontrolled struvite precipitation at this point has been quantified in this study to that end a reactor after the digester has been introduced into the simulations to simulate the retention time in the pipes and reproduce the precipitation in them in this scenario simulation results show that on average 345 2 kg of struvite may precipitate every day 126 tonnes of struvite per year causing pipe blockage this high amount of uncontrolled struvite precipitation is a signal that it may be economically and technically feasible to recover phosphorus as struvite by means of precipitation in this wwtp the following section describes different scenarios analysed for struvite recovery 6 exploration by simulation of the potential for phosphorus recovery based on the results presented in the previous section this section describes a model based scenario analysis that was performed in order to assess the maximum quantity of struvite that can be recovered and the benefits on the plant operation to that end three different scenarios were compared in terms of struvite production biogas production sludge production ferric chloride dosage and pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the baseline scenario scenario a is based on the current plant configuration however due to a change in the operation of the current plant the sludge is withdrawn from the secondary settler rather than from the biological reactor as shown in fig 7 in the second scenario scenario b fig 8 a precipitation unit is incorporated after the dewatering unit to recover struvite from the supernatant from the digester by incorporating the reactor unit struvite is recovered and lower phosphate concentrations are taken into the head of the plant in the third scenario scenario c fig 9 a redissolution tank is added to treat the secondary sludge in order to avoid pipe blockage due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the redissolution tank is an anaerobic reactor where the phosphorus and magnesium accumulated by pao bacteria is released this way the main release of phosphorus is done in the redissolution tank and a lower quantity of phosphorus is released in the anaerobic digester consequently the precipitation likelihood after the anaerobic digester should be lower although scenario c is proposed as a solution to avoid the uncontrolled struvite precipitation the suitability and efficiency of the process will depend on the available readily organic matter in the redissolution tank and residence time conditions thus there may be a lack of volatile fatty acids in the redissolution tank due to a low redissolution of organic matter and this may cause a low release of phosphorus that would cause a very low release of po4 p and mg2 to overcome this scenario d fig 10 is also proposed where a fraction of the primary sludge is taken to the redissolution tank as a source of organic matter the percentage of the primary sludge taken to the redissolution tank was estimated based on process stoichiometry such that the amount of volatile fatty acids taken to the redissolution tank guarantees the release of phosphates fig 11 shows a complete phosphate fluxes in scenarios a b c and d facilitating the understanding the behaviour of the plant in all cases fecl3 dosing is controlled so that phosphate concentration in the effluent is kept constant in all cases incorporating a precipitation tank in the sludge line affects the amount of phosphorus recycled to the head of the plant in scenarios b and d the amount of phosphates recycled to the head of the plant is reduced by around 80 in scenario c this reduction is lower 43 since a smaller amount of struvite is recovered the main difference between scenarios b and d lies in the effluent from the digester in scenario b the release of phosphate under anaerobic conditions occurs in the anaerobic digester the phosphate flux in the effluent from the anaerobic digester is 572 7 kg p d in contrast in scenario d the release of phosphorus occurs in the redissolution tank and in the anaerobic digester consequently the flux in the effluent from the anaerobic digester is lower than in scenario b 402 kg p day the rest of the phosphorus is released in the redissolution tank 172 4 kg p d these two fluxes are mixed in the influent of the precipitation unit as a consequence the amount of phosphorus entering the precipitation tank is comparable and so is the amount of struvite recovered in scenario c the amount of phosphorus released in the redissolution tank is very low when mixing this diluted flux with the supernatant from the digester a very diluted flux enters the precipitation unit thus reducing the efficiency of the precipitation unit in addition to mapping the phosphorus throughout the plant this mathematical model permits the relevant operational variables to be evaluated at the different points of the wwtp table 4 compares the one year model predictions for scenarios a b c and d in terms of struvite production mgcl2 dosage to provide with the required mg2 to form struvite and naoh dosage to maintain the ph in the optimum values in the precipitation unit as struvite precipitation is an alkalinity consuming process naoh is required to maintain ph at the optimum value for struvite precipitation in the three new scenarios proposed in the paper struvite is recovered theoretically in scenarios b and d the amount of struvite produced is comparable 1343 and 1345 tonnes per year however in scenario c a very small amount of struvite is recovered this is because the dissolution of phosphate in the redissolution tank is very low if no primary sludge is provided leading to a small amount of dissolved phosphorus being available in the precipitation tank additionally in scenario c higher flow rates enter the precipitation unit compared to scenario b causing a dilution of the flow going into the reactor which reduces the precipitation kinetic higher flow rates imply lower retention times in the reactor as well these two factors reduce the plant s recovery efficiency in order to achieve the cited struvite production magnesium chloride and sodium hydroxide must be added into the precipitation unit the magnesium chloride dosage is directly dependent on the struvite recovered and consequently higher magnesium chloride is required in scenario d 1 05 at a first glance it would be reasonable to expect that the sodium hydroxide would follow the same trend however in this case the amount of naoh required in scenario d is theoretically 10 2 higher than in scenario b this is because the ph in the flow from the redissolution tank is lower 6 9 than the ph in the effluent of the anaerobic digester 7 4 in scenario d consequently higher amount of sodium hydroxide is needed to achieve the same ph in the reactor this effect shows the need to ensure a good aquatic chemistry and ph prediction throughout the plant the recovery of phosphorus as struvite has a positive effect on the overall performance of the plant specifically the key factors affected are the consumption of fecl3 for chemical phosphorus removal the treatment of the sludge produced and maintenance cost savings associated with the clogging of pipes due to uncontrolled struvite precipitation the benefits in these operational variables can be translated into economic savings that depending on the struvite purchase price can be much more significant than the benefit of selling struvite itself table 5 shows the comparison of the four scenarios proposed in this paper in terms of the plant wide operational variables it can be seen that less uncontrolled struvite precipitation occurs in the cases where struvite is recovered because less phosphorus is recycled into the head of the plant in scenario b the amount of uncontrolled struvite precipitation is 24 6 lower compared to scenario a additionally in scenario d the main release of phosphorus and magnesium occurs in a different point of the ammonia release causing 69 8 less uncontrolled precipitation including a redissolution tank reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation by 45 2 in scenario d relative to scenario b illustrating the benefit of including the redissolution tank despite the similarity in struvite recovery in scenario c since there is no phosphate and magnesium release in the redissolution tank the uncontrolled struvite precipitation is not as low as expected this fact together with lower struvite production makes scenario c technically unfeasible the sludge production in the four scenarios is also shown in table 5 by incorporating a precipitation unit into the plant configuration reduces the sludge disposal 6 6 in scenario b and 5 9 in scenario d which is translated into economical savings recovering struvite in the sludge line means that smaller amount of orthophosphate is recycled into the water line in consequence the ferric chloride dosage required to achieve the effluent quality in terms of phosphorus concentration is lowered by up to 50 in scenarios b and 45 1 in scenario d this study shows the technical benefits of incorporating the precipitation unit into the plant configuration the solution presented shows the maximum struvite recovery capacity of the wwtp in a first implementation phase the sur wwtp installed the technology sized to produce 2000 kg of struvite per day with the configuration of scenario b this is spain s first scale plant for phosphorus recovery as struvite this implementation shows promising results in line with the simulation study futurenviro 2017 the installation could be enhanced to reach the maximum struvite recovery potential this analysis was undertaken for the average value of solid retention time at which the plant is currently operated and the average temperature of 19 c the plant s performance in terms of biological phosphorus removal is directly affected by these two factors and consequently this may have an effect on the factors analysed above the following section studies the effect of these parameters on the plant s performance 7 exploration by simulation of the operation of the biological treatment for maximum struvite production an additional analysis was performed to study the effect of the operational conditions on the results for scenario d shown in the previous section the maximum capacity for struvite production depends on the biological phosphorus removal consequently it is very important to find the optimum water line operating conditions in order to maximize struvite production there are various factors affecting the biological phosphorus removal such as the solid retention time srt and consequently the concentration of tssml the operating temperature temp the vfa available or the po4 p in the inlet the objective of this exploration is to analyse the optimum srt or tssml in the biological reactors for the different average temperatures that may occur in during the year at low solid retention times biological phosphorus removal is favoured seviour and nielsen 2010 greater biological phosphorus removal is beneficial for struvite recovery since higher amount of phosphorus will be released in the sludge line under anaerobic conditions anaerobic digester or redissolution tank temperature affects struvite recovery through two mechanisms biological phosphorus removal is not favoured because of higher nitrification rate and presence of nitrates in the anaerobic tank which reduces the phosphorus accumulated biologically and in the solubility of struvite is greater at high temperatures consequently high temperatures do not favour struvite recovery the following paragraphs present the effect of these operating conditions on the overall performance of the plant in terms of struvite recovery uncontrolled struvite precipitation naoh and mgcl2 dosage in the precipitation unit and fecl3 dosage for chemical phosphorus precipitation to perform this study the solid retention time was analysed by controlling the sludge flow rate to maintain a constant solid concentration in the aerated tank the solid concentration in the aerated reactor varied between 1500 g m3 and 3500 g m3 for different temperatures ranging from 13 c to 25 c to reproduce different seasons of the year in all cases the required effluent quality is guaranteed the solid retention time is never lower than the value required to remove organic matter and phosphorus removal is guaranteed due to the control of fecl3 dosage to guarantee minimum phosphate release focusing first on the effect of the cited operating parameters on struvite production fig 12 shows the effect of the concentration of solids and temperature on the recovery of struvite the red zone indicates the maximum struvite capacity whereas the blue zone indicates the lowest struvite recovery in general lower srt represented by lower tssml in fig 12 means higher struvite recovery this is due to the fact that biological phosphorus removal is favoured at low srt seviour and nielsen 2010 however it must be noted that below a certain concentration struvite recovery drops in this case the srt is not high enough to guarantee the growth of pao microorganisms and biological phosphorus removal is not optimum consequently struvite recovery is not maximal either the optimum solid concentration in the aerated tank varies at different temperatures between 13 c and 19 c the optimum solid concentration is 2000 g m3 however at higher temperatures the water line can operate at lower solid concentration for example around 1500 g m3 and maximize struvite recovery this is due to the fact that there is higher microorganism activity and thus the system can operate at lower srt values fig 13 shows the behaviour of the plant in terms of uncontrolled struvite precipitation for different solid retention times and temperatures the red zones indicate undesired operating strategies since these indicate maximum spontaneous struvite precipitation and consequently higher maintenance costs at low solid retention times represented by low tssml in fig 13 spontaneous struvite precipitation is lower than at high solid retention times this is due to a higher struvite recovery at high struvite recoveries smaller quantity of phosphates is recycled into the biological treatment and therefore lower quantities are released in the anaerobic digester turning to the issue of mgcl2 and naoh dosages in the precipitation unit fig 14 shows mgcl2 dosage needed to recover struvite and naoh dosage required to keep the optimum ph value in the struvite recovery technology the mgcl2 follows the same trend as the production of struvite there is an increase in mgcl2 dosage as srt lowers which is caused by an increase in struvite production however below a certain value of concentration of solids in the aerated reactor the dosage required decreases as struvite production also decreases in contrast the dosage of naoh does not follow this trend this is because the dosage of naoh depends not only on the production of struvite but also on the ph of the water in the inlet it was observed that naoh dosage increases for lower srt values this is because there is an increase in biological activity in the digester as srt decreases causing higher acidification in the inlet to the precipitation unit once again this shows the need to have a good ph prediction in the entire plant in order to be able to estimate the dosage of naoh in the precipitation unit finally the dosage of fecl3 required to maintain the effluent quality depending on the operating conditions cited above was analysed fig 15 red zones indicate high dosage requirements whereas blue zones are the desirable zones since these indicate lower dosage needs at low solid retention times the dosage of fecl3 decreases this is caused by two factors on the one hand at that point biological phosphorus removal is favoured and thus chemical phosphorus removal decreases on the other hand struvite recovery is maximized and thus the amount of phosphorus recycled into the water line is reduced additionally it is observed that for low temperatures the required dosage of fecl3 is reduced even if struvite recovery is lower at low temperatures the fecl3 dosage is reduced because the solubility of the fepo4 is reduced at low temperatures in summary the simulation shows that the optimum point for maximizing struvite production is working at low solid retention times when struvite production is maximized uncontrolled struvite precipitation is minimized the study presented in this work shows the potential of mathematical models to analyse different scenarios under different conditions the solution suggested in this paper may be required in other wwtps however a tailored study for each case depending on regional legislation or plant configuration the modelling methodology employed in this paper makes it possible to carry out these studies in a rigorous way 8 conclusions based on a real case scenario this paper presents a model based analysis for optimum p management in wwtps considering water quality economical costs and phosphorous recovery as struvite in a circular economy context given that aim a mathematical model has been constructed considering the following features 1 it is able to reproduce biological phosphorus and organic matter removal chemical phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion and struvite precipitation and ph evolution under dynamic conditions 2 it is a plant wide model that is able to analyse the interactions between the water and sludge line 3 it is able to guarantee phosphorus mass continuity 4 it shows the different forms in which phosphorus is present at each point and 5 it includes costs in order to analyse different alternatives for p mapping and recovery the model constructed was calibrated and validated with one year s worth of experimental data from the full scale sur wwtp madrid the mathematical model yielded a complete phosphorus mass balance throughout the plant and this made it possible to analyse the different phosphorus recovery alternatives based on this analysis four different scenarios were proposed from the model based exploration of the different scenarios a number of conclusions may be drawn adding a technology for struvite recovery in addition to the benefits of obtaining a marketable product reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation and thus reduces pipe blockage moreover the sludge production decreases which lowers operational costs related to sludge disposal since the phosphorus quantity recycled to the head of the plant is reduced ferric chloride dosage also is reduced finally biogas production is maintained when a precipitation unit is added the effect of incorporating a redissolution tank to treat secondary sludge was analysed in this scenario the necessity of incorporating primary sludge as source of volatile fatty acids for the redissolution tank was shown this technology increased the quantity of struvite that could be recovered additionally it significantly reduces the uncontrolled struvite precipitation in the pipes immediately after the digester the scenario analysis showed the benefits of incorporating the technology for struvite recovery in addition to the benefits of obtaining a marketable product the operation and maintenance costs of the plant were considerably reduced based on these results the solution has been implemented in the real wwtp making it the first case in spain where struvite is recovered after several months of operation the plant s real behaviour confirms the simulation results finally a study was performed to determine optimum operational strategies in the water line to maximize struvite production this study made it possible to 1 assess the effect of certain operational variables like srt or temperature and 2 draw up some guidelines about optimum p management and recovery considering seasonal variations from this analysis it can be concluded that low srt promotes high struvite recovery the optimum value of solid concentration in the aerated tank varies with temperature for temperatures between 13 c and 19 c the optimum solid concentration for struvite recovery was 2000 g m3 whereas at higher temperatures the maximum struvite recovery is achieved at lower solid concentration acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the spanish education and culture ministry for the research

19004,in many low income countries the poor conditions of sanitation systems have been a significant cause of mortality since they accelerate waterborne disease transmission developing sanitation systems in these countries is a pressing concern in both the public and private sectors this research investigated a decentralized domestic wastewater treatment system using ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds although uv led disinfection has become more widespread in recent years it is a novel approach for domestic wastewater treatment domestic wastewater was pretreated by a low cost pretreatment system with an inclined settler and a sand filter prior to feeding a novel flow through uv led reactor at an inlet flow rate of 30 l h the cod tss and turbidity of the effluent were 17 7 mg l 3 0 mg l and 3 9 ntu respectively uv transmittance at 285 nm was enhanced from 29 1 to 70 4 improving the influent quality for uv led disinfection the flow through uv led reactor was operated at various flow rates from 10 to 50 ml min resulting in applied uv doses of 69 4 to 47 8 mj cm2 respectively these doses are sufficient for inactivating total coliforms in the wastewater to meet the water reuse guidelines for agriculture for both processed food crops and non food crops fouling which was observed starting at 2 d of operation decreased the disinfection efficacy to 27 after 25 days of continuous operation of the fouling layer 67 was attributed to organic matter in contrast to previous fouling studies with mercury uv lamps in which the fouling layer consisted primarily of inorganic compounds the fouling was reversed by off line citric acid cleaning for 4 h after every 400 h of continuous operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv leds flow through decentralized domestic wastewater water reuse fouling 1 introduction in a recent study more than 380 disease outbreaks related to waterborne parasitic protozoa were documented globally in a six year period between 2011 and 2016 efstratiou et al 2017 additionally 87 of total global mortality cases attributed to diarrhea came from south asia and sub saharan africa troeger et al 2017 there is no doubt that poor water supply and sanitation systems are a root cause leading to these public health issues yang et al 2012 therefore developing sanitation systems especially disinfection processes plays a critical role in addressing the issue ultraviolet uv disinfection is one of most common and most effective technologies for water and wastewater disinfection song et al 2016 although other conventional disinfection technologies have been widely used such as ozone chlorine oxide chlorine and peracetic acid they are all chemical containing and or by product forming processes uv disinfection is considered environmentally friendly as a noncorrosive treatment option free of disinfectant residuals and disinfection byproducts liberti et al 2003 for this reason there have been case studies on the application of uv disinfection for wastewater reclamation in southern italy uv disinfection was successful in removing protozoan parasites for unrestricted reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture with no formation of disinfection byproducts liberti et al 2003 a case study of water reuse in the middle east evaluated uv disinfection for inactivating enteric pathogens remaining after treatment by constructed wetlands azaizeh et al 2013 uv disinfection also showed a high performance in disinfecting swine secondary effluent for water reuse under alkaline controlled conditions in catarina brazil bilotta et al 2017 these previous studies involved traditional uv lamps containing mercury vapor which is extremely toxic to human health and the environment when it comes to lamp breakage during operation or discharging nance et al 2012 the united nations environmental programme unep through the minamata convention on mercury is working to control mercury waste and eliminate the release of mercury into air water and land by 2020 united nations environment programme 2013 although the minamata convention does not specifically address mercury uv lamps it raises awareness of the harmful effects of mercury and encourages organizations and governments to adopt mercury free products additionally mercury uv lamps are highly fragile temperature variation sensitive and they contain a large footprint thus uv light emitting diodes uv leds have been recently considered as a potential novel uv source offering features that could overcome the shortcomings of these lamps including high durability robust designs lower voltage requirements and lack of mercury chevremont et al 2013 würtele et al 2011 however studies applying uv leds for wastewater disinfection processes in real conditions are limited in particular there is a lack of case studies involving flow through uv c led processes ultraviolet disinfection is not completely free from drawbacks wastewater constituents such as solid particles humic acid and turbidity can reduce the inactivation efficacy of the uv disinfection process due to absorption scattering and shielding effects carré et al 2018 mamane et al 2006 consequently in applications of uv disinfection proper and efficient up stream treatment processes are often a decisive factor for success therefore this research pretreated the domestic wastewater with a low cost conventional system consisting of an inclined tube settler and a slow sand filter prior to feeding the novel flow through uv led reactor due to the high total settling area in comparison with other types of sedimentation inclined settlers have been widely applied to enhance settling velocities of clarification processes especially without support from chemical flocculation there have been a variety of inclinations used in inclined settlers in the literature ranging from 8 to 60 however most of industrial manufactures set their products at 60 inclination since it reduces the footprint of the processes and ensures sludge flow smith and davis 2013 smith et al 2013 slow sand filtration has been considered an effective conventional technology in water and wastewater treatment for treating a wide range of physical chemical and biological pollution haig et al 2011 li et al 2018 paredes et al 2016 moreover slow sand filtration processes are simple for operation and maintenance have low operating costs and can be used as tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants sand grain sizes range from 0 1 to several millimeters generally haig et al 2014 maintenance requirements are also an integral part of putting uv led disinfection technology into practice a very important consideration during operation of uv disinfection processes is fouling the growth of foulant on quartz sleeves due to the increase of temperature during operation could significantly reduce the uv dose applied due to a decrease of uv transmittance of the sleeves nessim and gehr 2006 although it has been hypothesized that leds will not be affected by fouling as much as mercury lamps because heat generated during operation is dissipated on the opposite side as the light source arik et al 2004 to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to evaluate fouling during application of a uv led disinfection process in wastewater treatment thus the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the performance of a low cost pretreatment system 2 study the disinfection efficacy of a flow through uv led system in continuous operation 3 determine the fouling period and fouling layer constituents and 4 propose an environmentally friendly cleaning method for removing the fouling layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source domestic wastewater was collected from a manhole at the asian institute of technology s ait sewer system pathumthani province thailand the ait campus with a population of 2000 2 500 generates wastewater with a mixture of greywater and blackwater mainly from dormitories offices and a cafeteria wastewater samples collected daily were analyzed giving the characteristics shown in table 1 all parameters were determined n 18 following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 2 2 pre treatment system with inclined tube settler and slow sand filtration prior to entering the uv led unit the raw wastewater was first stored in a raw wastewater tank and then pumped with a peristaltic pump through a conventional system with an inclined tube settler and a slow sand filter fig 1 the gravitational tube settler consisted of 117 tubes 400 mm length x 12 7 mm diameter inclined at 60 and fed from the bottom the respective total working volume and settling surface were calculated at 0 076 m3 and 1 87 m2 the tube settler acted as a sedimentation unit to remove extensive suspended solids which would have disturbed the uv led disinfection process the tube settler overflow was gravity fed to the sand filter the sand filter was constructed in three layers including a sand layer with sand size d10 d60 of approximately 0 4 0 8 mm at a thickness of 0 2 m a small supported gravel layer with gravel size d10 d60 of 5 10 mm at a thickness of 0 1 m and a large supported gravel layer with gravel size d10 d60 of 10 20 mm at a thickness of 0 15 m in that order d refers to the effective diameter d10 and d60 mean 10 and 60 of the particles were finer than that size respectively the total surface area of sand filtration was 0 2 m2 before pumping to the flow through uv led process an appropriate amount of pretreated wastewater was stored in a storage tank since the uv led process had lower capacity compared to the pretreatment system the extra volume of pretreated wastewater was directly discharged into the sewer system schematics of the pretreatment units and the treatment system are given in fig 1 the pretreatment system was first operated at three inlet flow rates of 30 60 and 90 l per hour l h to determine an optimal flow rate which would generate an acceptable influent for the uv led unit at these flow rates the corresponding overflow rates of the tube settler were 0 016 0 032 and 0 048 m3 m2 h respectively and the filtration rates of the sand filter were 0 15 0 3 and 0 45 m3 m2 h respectively the pretreatment efficiency of the system was based on four parameters total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity and uv transmittance uvt the uvt was calculated by eq 1 all parameters were determined n 6 following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 1 uvt λ 100 10 a λ where uvt is the uv transmittance at wavelength λ and a λ is the absorbance of wastewater at wavelength λ measured by a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer tokyo japan carré et al 2018 demonstrated that the microorganism inactivation efficacy of a uv disinfection process was significantly enhanced when the turbidity was under 5 ntu while mariel et al 2012 indicated that the increase of turbidity in wastewaters from 9 9 to 16 2 ntu resulted in a 60 reduction in the disinfection performance of the uv process thus the pretreated wastewater quality was designed to be less than 5 ntu in turbidity 2 3 flow through uv led reactor the flow through uv led reactor used in this study shown in fig 2 was a commercially available pearlaqua 6d aquisense technologies kentucky usa the reactor contained two leds with the spectral emission given by the manufacturer shown in fig 3 they exhibited a peak wavelength emission at 285 nm fig 3 a weighted average spectral emission of 287 nm and a full width at half maximum fwhm of 13 5 nm the leds have a rated effective lifetime of 10 000 h as given by the reactor manufacturer the pearl aqua unit has an input voltage of 12v dc and a total optical output of 65 mw the reactor contains a working volume of 68 6 ml an inlet and outlet diameter of ¼ inch and an outer length and diameter of 107 87 mm 2 4 uv fluence determination to evaluate the efficacy of the uv led disinfection process the uv doses applied by the flow through reactor to the water samples were determined using a method called biodosimetry described previously oguma et al 2016 usepa 2006 in this method the flow through reactor was challenged with a microorganism at specific flow rates and its log reduction from uv exposure was determined for each flow rate in parallel quasi collimated beam experiments were conducted with a batch reactor to determine the dose response of the microorganism in each water sample the dose response curve was then used as a standard curve to back calculate the uv dose or the reduction equivalent fluence ref delivered by the flow through reactor at each flow rate pure cultured male specific 2 ms2 coliphage atcc 15597 b1 american type culture collection virginia u s was used as the representative microorganism and biodosimeter for the disinfection studies male specific and f specific coliphage have commonly been considered indicators of the presence of pathogens in addition to other popular microorganisms such as e coli fecal coliforms or enterococci wu et al 2011 ms2 coliphage also has much in common with mammalian viral pathogens including enteroviruses such as size shape isoelectric point genome length and morphology michen and graule 2010 park et al 2011 moreover ms2 is generally more resistant to environmental factors compared to other virus surrogates feng et al 2003 silverman et al 2013 the flow through uv led reactor was operated at five different flow rates of 10 20 30 40 and 50 ml min the treated wastewater was spiked with ms2 at a concentration of 105 to 108 pfu ml corresponding uv doses applied by the flow through process at each flow rate were estimated by correlating the log reduction of ms2 to a uv dose response curve developed with the batch reactor experiments described below the batch reactor illustrated in fig 4 contained a uv led unit purchased from tds light company limited tds uv280 j9 jiangsu china with nine leds set at a distance of 3 cm from the water sample surface the spectral emission of the uv led batch reactor fig s1 was measured at the national institute of metrology thailand nimt with a diode array spectroradiometer cas140ct 154 a cosine receptor probe eop 146 and a non optical density filter instrument systems germany the leds in the batch reactor had a peak wavelength emission of 277 3 nm a weighted average wavelength of 276 nm a fwhm of 10 7 nm and the radiation profile shown in fig s2 incident irradiance at the center of the water sample was 0 30 mw cm2 and the uniformity of the batch reactor irradiance shown in fig s3 yielded a petri factor of 0 876 for the 3 5 cm dishes inner diameter 3 35 cm which were cornered in the same position for each experiment by two secure microscope slides current and voltage inputs were controlled with a voltage regulator to stabilize the irradiance output the unit was operated with an input current and voltage of 60 ma and 17 vdc respectively given the challenges of operating the batch reactor unit without an in house radiometer as well as challenges associated with polychromatic actinometry calculations the irradiance of the batch reactor was back calculated using biodosimetry with ms2 the inactivation rate constant reported in the literature for a uv led device with the same peak wavelength emission 277 nm and fwhm 10 nm was 0 052 cm2 mj beck et al 2017 using that inactivation rate in these experiments the average irradiance across the surface of the water sample back calculated from biodosimetry was 0 208 mj cm2 0 0133 n 3 this value was comparable to the average irradiance across the surface of the water sample calculated from off site radiometry 0 213 mj cm2 for a polychromatic uv source adjusted to account for the petri factor reflection factor and divergence factor linden and darby 1997 usepa 2006 these values were then used together with the water factor to determine the average irradiance applied throughout each water sample beck et al 2017 the calculation did not include a collimation factor as proposed by kheyrandish et al 2018 which was published a full year after these experiments were conducted the irradiance was weighted germicidally by the dna absorbance to calculate the uv doses for each batch experiment as described previously linden and darby 1997 usepa 2006 weighting by the ms2 action spectrum instead of dna absorbance would have had a negligible effect since the action spectrum of ms2 closely follows that of dna and rna within the spectrum emitted by these leds beck et al 2016 to account for the slight differences in uvled wavelength emission from the batch 277 nm and the flow through reactors 285 nm average germicidal irradiance was also calculated for a hypothetical batch reactor with the same leds as those used in the flow through reactor the ratio of average germicidal uv irradiances led to a wavelength correction factor of 0 97 average germicidal irradiance would be slightly lower from leds emitting at 285 nm than those emitting at 277 nm since their peak emission is further from the peak of rna absorbance beck et al 2016 each batch reactor experiment exposed a 5 ml sample volume 6 mm depth continuously stirred by a magnetic stir bar to create homogenous water sample the uv doses in mj cm2 were calculated as the product of the average irradiance eavg mw cm2 and exposure time s where eavg accounted for the uv absorbance of the water across the uv led spectrum the log reduction of ms2 coliphage was estimated following chick watson model 2 log reduction log c 0 c where c0 and c are the ms2 coliphage concentration pfu ml before and after exposure to the uv leds respectively the applied uv doses with the corresponding log reduction of ms2 were used to plot the uv dose response curves from which to determine the dose applied by the flow through uv led reactor 2 5 preparation and enumeration of the microorganism the ms2 coliphage stock was propagated and enumerated following the u s environmental protection agency epa method for double agar layer usepa 2001 for propagation ms2 and the log phage e coli host atcc 700891 were inoculated in a mixture of phosphate buffered saline pbs and tryptic soy broth with magnesium chloride and ampicillin and streptomycin antibiotics per manufacturer s instructions the mixture then was incubated at 37 1 c for 16 24 h to separate ms2 from the bacterial cells the mixture was centrifuged for 25 min at 3000 g the supernatant was filtered through sterile 0 2 μm filters and stored in the freezer at 18 2 c 2 6 continuous feeding operation process for the fouling and cleaning study the reduction of the applied uv dose due to fouling over the continuous feeding process was investigated by examining the decrease of disinfection efficacy through daily sampling in these experiments the flow through reactor was operated at 30 ml min with distilled water and ms2 as the challenge microorganism distilled water was used to eliminate disturbances and create a homogenous condition for comparison since the uv dose of 20 mj cm2 is commonly applied for filtered effluent in wastewater disinfection for 3 log removal of microbial pathogens gehr et al 2003 lazarova et al 1999 our study applied higher doses than that for ensuring pathogen disinfection therefore the flow through uv led reactor was continuously fed at 30 ml min with pretreated wastewater until the disinfection efficacy or fouling coefficient decreased to around 0 27 at which point the uv dose applied reached below 20 mj cm2 and cleaning was required fouling layers on the inside wall of the uv led unit were removed to investigate fouling constituents n 2 using the inductively coupled plasma method 3120b at intertek bangkok thailand a 50 hydrochloric acid hcl solution was used to dissolve the fouling layers to analyze the calcium ca magnesium mg iron fe and phosphorus p content since they are assumed to be the dominant fouling materials lin et al 1999a qiang et al 2013 the total volatile solids tvs apha method 2540e content of the fouling layers was also examined in order to estimate the contribution of organic materials in the fouling layers these parameters and other parameters of the pretreated wastewater were analyzed following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater including hardness 2340c iron 3500b and total phosphorus 4500d p apha 2012 citric acid was used to clean the fouled reactor during the cleaning process the uv leds were turned off and the flow through reactor was processed with a 15 citric acid solution ph 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml min at each cleaning test 1 l of the citric solution was prepared and recirculated one cleaning experiment was conducted at each fouling period for a total of four cleanings with corresponding cleaning times of 2 3 4 and 12 h the aim of this experiment was to determine the required time to reverse the fouling and return the reactor to its original condition using citric acid cleaning 2 7 statistical analysis when comparing differences in removal efficiencies for the pretreatment system one way anova analysis was used with a p value 0 05 one way anova analysis p value 0 05 was also applied to determine significant differences in disinfection efficacies of the flow through uv led reactor among various operational flow rates 3 results and discussion 3 1 pretreatment system performance the overall treatment performance of the tube settler and slow sand filter in terms of tss cod and turbidity removal is given in table 2 and fig 5 the flow rate of 30 l h had the highest removal efficiencies for tss 96 8 1 1 cod 89 9 3 4 and turbidity 94 2 3 the other flow rates of 60 and 90 l h led to lower removal efficacies of under 85 in most parameters this indicates that the increase of inlet flow rate led to a decrease in treatment performance of the pretreatment system as expected since there was no support from up stream coagulation flocculation processes the treatment output of the tube settler in this study was quite low in comparison with most of the literature at an overflow rate of 0 016 m3 m2 h the tube settler removed 76 6 of tss 30 0 gtss m2 day 67 0 of cod 51 3 gcod m2 day and 52 1 of turbidity tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2014 determined that a 60 inclined settler could increase the overall treatment efficiency compared to conventional designs leading to an overall settling efficiency of 93 the initial tss concentration in that study was 1066 mg l which was 12 times higher than this study similarly in another study at an overflow rate of 0 2 m3 m2 h 45 inclination 1233 mg l mlss and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min 99 4 of tss was removed fraji et al 2013 in those cases the application of chemical based pretreatment was necessary due to the high tss however in this study coagulation and flocculation chemicals could have increased the turbidity in the effluent and impaired the light transmittance of uv leds the tube settler and sand filter in this study did not require any chemical based support and the pretreatment efficacy was still efficient resulting in effluent concentration of tss cod and turbidity of 3 mg l 17 7 mg l and 3 9 ntu respectively at an operational flow rate of 30 l h in analyzing the tube setter s and sand filter s contributions to overall removal efficiencies the data revealed that the tube settler was more significant for removing tss turbidity and cod whereas the sand filter was dominant in enhancing uv transmittance for instance at an operational flow rate of 30 l h the sand filter unit 0 15 m3 m2 h contributed to the removal of 22 9 6 0 of cod 20 2 5 6 of tss and 42 0 4 6 of turbidity from the raw wastewater whereas the tube settler unit 0 016 m3 m2 h contributed to the removal of over 66 9 8 6 of cod 76 5 5 6 of tss and 52 1 6 0 of turbidity from the raw wastewater fig 5 regarding uv transmittance a final uvt at 285 nm of 71 4 was obtained at a flow rate of 30 l h fig 6 the tube settler and sand filter accounted for a 10 5 and 30 9 uvt enhancement respectively indicating that around 75 of the overall uvt enhancement of the pretreatment system was attributed to the sand filter rizzo et al 2015 reported a better performance in which 62 of the uv absorbance used to calculate uvt was removed with sand filtration and graphene absorption at a 0 1 m h filtration rate in comparison to other pretreatment methods subsurface wetlands treating household effluent reached a uvt at 254 nm of only 40 azaizeh et al 2013 whereas a uvt 254 nm of 57 was obtained when using sonication to treat trickling filter effluent for uv disinfection by yong et al 2008 this indicates that the conventional and low cost pretreatment system in this study can be considered as a high performance pretreatment option for uv led disinfection the sand filtration effectiveness in lowering turbidity has been demonstrated in the literature li et al 2018 reported turbidity of less than 1 ntu which was significantly better than that of this study from a filtration rate ranging from 0 5 to 0 2 m h however li et al 2018 used a granular activated carbon gac sandwich filter with 10 cm 30 cm 10 cm of sand gac sand the filtration media was more complex and thicker than in this study in addition pompei et al 2017 also reported 1 ntu turbidity of filtered water the pompei study used a thicker layer of sand 40 cm compared to 20 cm in this study and the sand was a finer grain size of 0 21 mm compared to the 0 4 0 8 mm used in this study huisman and wood 1974 concluded that the most effective sand size for slow sand filter ranging from 0 15 to 0 35 mm these differences could explain why the li and pompei sand filtration systems reached lower effluent turbidities than in this study given the above results operating this pretreatment system with a flow rate of 30 l h was optimal among the three flow rates tested therefore this flow rate was selected for subsequent experiments at 30 l h the pretreatment system could process 0 72 m3 of pretreated wastewater per day this volume would account for at least 70 of average water consumption and therefore generation per household in thailand the study location 0 98 m3 day metropolitan waterworks authority 2017 the uv led system had a significantly lower capacity compared to the pretreatment system therefore an appropriate amount of pretreated wastewater was stored in a storage tank for disinfection studies and the extra was directly discharged into the sewer system the uv led system could be scaled up to accommodate the total wastewater volume however 3 2 ms2 uv dose response curve through the lab scale batch reactor experiments with wastewater an ms2 uv dose response curve was developed which demonstrated linear inactivation kinetics fig 7 the fluence based inactivation rate constant kf from the wastewater samples was exactly 0 052 0 003 cm2 mj n 4 which matched the designed inactivation rate constant from biodosimetry in another study in which ms2 was inactivated with a high precision laser emitting monochromatic light at 280 nm the inactivation rate constant kf was 0 043 cm2 mj however that source differed from these leds which emit over a broader range down to 270 nm fig 3 where the absorbance of rna and therefore the inactivation of ms2 is higher beck et al 2016 in another study with uv leds emitting at 275 nm the ms2 inactivation rate constant was 0 035 cm2 mj bowker et al 2011 however that study calculated the uv dose applied as if it were a monochromatic system whereas leds are polychromatic light sources offering broadband spectral emissions spanning across more than 20 nm 3 3 flow through uv led process disinfection efficiency the disinfection performance of the flow through uv led reactor at the five different operating flow rates and their corresponding exposure time log ms2 inactivation and uv dose is given in table 3 and fig 8 as expected the dose applied to the water sample decreased as the operating flow rates increased due to the lower uv exposure times the lowest log ms2 inactivation was 2 6 0 1 log at the highest flow rate tested of 50 ml min corresponding to a uv dose of 47 8 1 6 mj cm2 from there the ms2 log activation increased 1 45 times at a flow rate 5 times slower to 3 7 0 2 log at a 10 ml min which was less efficient than the batch system although the uv dose increased with increasing exposure time the dose response of the ms2 exhibited tailing lower inactivation efficiencies in flow through reactors than in batch reactors have been reported previously for both low pressure uv lamps and uv leds hijnen et al 2006 oguma et al 2013 it is assumed that this is due to microbial aggregation light shielding and or to heterogeneous hydraulic conditions within the reactor given that there was no mixing by a magnetic stirrer during operation of the flow through process microbial aggregations could occur especially when the operational time is increased this finding was highly supported by oguma et al 2013 in a flow through reactor and by mattle and kohn 2012 in a batch system the inactivation efficacy of uv light could also be affected by light shielding which prevents uv irradiation from reaching the target microorganism particularly in waters with lower uv transmittance finally heterogeneous hydraulic conditions could also play a role the system could have been susceptible to short circuiting whereby a portion of the water exits the reactor before the average particle residence time short circuiting and reduced disinfection efficacy is more prominent at low flow rates iranpour et al 1999 a uvled system s configuration strongly affects its disinfection performance specifically the uv irradiance is stronger near the uv light source lee et al 2018 price et al 2011 in this study the maximum distance between the uv source and the reactor wall was 5 56 cm within a spherical reactor with a highly reflective material uv reactors are typically designed to have a thin path length or a high uv transmittance this study disinfected wastewater with a uvt 285 nm of 70 which was lower than the operational uvt recommended by the manufacturer of greater than 90 however tailing has also been seen in a cylindrical flow through reactor with a maximum path length of 12 mm and uv leds of lower output oguma et al 2013 inactivation efficacies of uv led systems vary with radiation profile water characteristics challenge microorganisms system configurations and sample volumes future research in this area would be beneficial the concentrations of total coliforms and e coli in the pretreated wastewater in this study both ranged from 0 8 104 to 2 3 105 mpn 100 ml which is approximately 5 logs since the uv dose needed to inactivate e coli is much lower than for ms2 at approximately 3 2 mj cm2 at 280 nm to 3 4 mj cm2 at 260 nm for 1 log inactivation beck et al 2017 oguma et al 2013 the uv doses applied in this study of 69 4 mj cm2 before fouling or approximately 20 mj cm2 after fouling are sufficient for inactivating e coli and total coliforms in pretreated wastewaters for agriculture use which would meet the water reuse guideline for agriculture both for processed food crops and non food crops of non detected coliform in 100 ml samples usepa 2012 3 4 fouling for fouling investigation tests the flow through uv led process was continuously operated at a flow rate of 30 ml min during the continuous operation disinfection efficacy of the process decreased from 3 7 log ms2 inactivation to approximately 1 log after 25 days indicating fouling in the uv system the fouling coefficient decreased from 1 to approximately 0 27 fig 9 this reduction in disinfection efficacy was presumed due to fouling as opposed to led aging because it was completely reversed as discussed in section 3 5 the reduction in disinfection performance of the uv led process was observed starting from the 2nd day of continuous operation fig 9 the fouling appeared to follow first order kinetics corresponding to the findings of lin et al 1999b the estimated reduction of disinfection performance of the process was 0 12 0 03 log ms2 inactivation per day n 52 it is important to note that all previous fouling studies for ultraviolet disinfection processes were investigated with traditional uv lamps therefore it is difficult to compare this study with others regarding the cause of fouling lin et al 1999b indicated that the increase of temperature during operation enhanced the precipitation of fouling materials consequently the smooth surface of the quartz sleeve turned into a round surface and trapped water while the high temperature enhanced the coprecipitation of foulant materials in our study the fouling layer appeared as a light brown amorphous film not only on the quartz plate but also on the reactor wall the manufacturer aimed to enhance inactivation efficacy with an interior surface of highly reflective material with a reflectivity of 95 at wavelengths of 250 300 nm according to the manufacturer therefore the fouling layer diminished the uv reflection off the reactor s wall and reduced the disinfection efficacy moreover the presence of dominant fouling materials in pretreated wastewater table 4 and the system s hydrodynamic conditions including the low operational flow rate 30 ml min and bottom feed operation contributed to the formation of the fouling layers in our study there have been many constituents in water that have caused fouling during uv disinfection processes including calcium and magnesium hardness iron phosphorus and other elements and minerals in the matrix of the foulant whereas iron and hardness attributed to the most dominant fraction amin et al 2010 lin et al 1999a qiang et al 2013 table 4 shows for this study the concentration of fouling elements in the pretreated wastewater the concentration in the acid solution used to dissolve the fouling layer for analysis as well as the fraction in the total weight of the fouling layer including hardness iron and phosphorus this indicates that calcium compounds played an important role in the fouling layer composition 18 7 additionally it has been reported that fouling layers dominantly consist of amorphous and inorganic films amin et al 2010 whereas uv radiation is able to prevent the accumulation of organic foulants on quartz sleeves lin et al 1999b other research studies have shown inorganic fouling materials to be the dominant constituents of the fouling layer however in this research volatile solids accounted for 67 of total solids in the fouling layers therefore it is assumed that organic fouling materials could play a significant role given that uv irradiation could prevent organic fouling and the quartz plate was the closest part to light source organic fouling on the quartz may have been insignificant however fouling occurred not only on the quartz plate but also on the interior surface of the reactor observations showed that the fouling layer was thin and rough on the quartz plate and a thicker uniform layer on the reactor s interior surface fig s4 the thin but rough layer on the quartz plate was assumed to be due to precipitates the thicker uniform layer on interior surface may have formed because of the reactor s design the farthest point from leds to the interior surface was 5 56 cm therefore wastewater could have absorbed a majority of the uv irradiance before it reached the reactor s interior surface as a result organic fouling layers formed and increased over the long continuously operational period those layers could have trapped microorganisms following a similar mechanism to fouling on quartz sleeve in the study of lin et al 1999b consequently fouling on the reactor s interior surface was considered an important cause of the reduction in disinfection performance over the continuous operation in this study however there remains a limitation in this study in that the fouling effects on the reactor s interior and the quartz cover could not be examined individually research into fouling layers developed in flow through uv led systems is limited therefore more intensive studies on the fouling mechanisms of uv led processes are necessary as uv led disinfection technology is put into practice 3 5 proposed fouling reversal method citric acid has been utilized for metal ions chelating and as an alternative cleaning agent for calcium salts removal in a wide range of industrial activities especially for food manufacturing vavrusova et al 2017 vavrusova and skibsted 2016 citric acid is an organic compound environmentally friendly and biodegradable since it is derived from natural materials therefore it is harmless to the environment other studies reported that citrate is an efficient calcium carbonate caco3 scale inhibitor since it absorbs caco3 crystals and prevents the growth of crystal particles bassioni 2010 chaussemier et al 2015 wada et al 2001 with regard to metal ions samsuri and irawan 2004 determined that a solution of citric acid 4 ph 2 soaked for 5 h could dissolve most iron complexes in montmorillonite whereas 0 1 m citric acid soaked for 144 h could dissolve 39 of total harbor sediment iron mineral in the study of di palma and mecozzi 2007 the uv leds were operated at a flow rate of 30 ml min until the fouling effect reduced the applied uv dose to less than 20 mj cm2 only 4 h of running with citric acid solution 15 ph 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml min was required to recover the fouled uv led reactor back to its original applied uv dose 69 4 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 10 ml min with pretreated wastewater a 12 h cleaning was also tested indicating that there was no re adsorption of the fouling constituents onto the reactor s wall and the quartz cover when the soaking period was greater than 4 h fig 10 the u s epa suggests that for continuous feeding disinfection processes for traditional uv lamps off line cleaning with chemicals is required for up to 15 min the cleaning frequency can vary depending on the water quality the degree of fouling and operating conditions usepa 2006 for this study cleaning the flow through uv led reactor for 4 h was required after 25 days of operation 4 conclusions through the above results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a conventional low cost system with an inclined settler and sand filter could be an appropriate option for pretreating domestic wastewater prior to uv led disinfection at a flow rate of 30 l h a 600 inclined settler and a slow sand filter produced quality effluent for the subsequent uv led disinfection specifically tss was decreased by 96 8 1 1 cod by 89 9 3 4 and turbidity by 94 2 3 as such the effluent concentration of tss cod and turbidity were 3 0 0 8 mg l 17 7 3 2 mg l and 3 9 0 7 ntu respectively uvt at 285 nm was also significantly enhanced from approximately 29 70 the other inlet flow rates presented a lower treatment performance 2 in the flow through uv led process 3 7 log ms2 inactivation was achieved at a flow rate of 10 ml min corresponding to an applied uv dose of 69 4 mj cm2 the increase of the inlet flow rate to 20 30 40 and 50 ml min reduced disinfection performance to 3 4 3 1 2 8 and 2 6 log ms2 inactivation respectively the corresponding uv doses reached are sufficient for disinfecting water for agricultural use which would meet the usepa guideline for water reuse notably with the same wastewater source ms2 inactivation performance in the flow through process did not follow the same trend compared to the batch reactor when it came to exposure time 3 it has been claimed that fouling in mercury lamp uv disinfection reactors is due primarily to inorganic constituents taking place mostly on the quartz sleeve and resulting from the effects of temperature in contrast the fouling in this uv led system was primarily organic taking place both on the quartz and on the reactor s interior surface it was also attributed in part to hydrodynamic conditions and the reactor s configuration in this study volatile solids content accounted for 67 of the total fouling constituents fouling of the flow through reactor occurred within 2 days of operation with an average reduction of 0 12 0 03 log ms2 inactivation per day after 25 d continuous operation the uv led system fouling coefficient reduced from 1 0 to 0 27 4 fouling reversal was possible with 4 h of citric acid soaking restoring the uv led flow through reactor to its original disinfection efficacy the required frequency of offline chemical cleaning which depends on the water quality the degree of fouling and the applied dose depends on the reactor configuration and uv emission source as well this study can act as a starting point from which to base future research and future guidelines declaration of

19004,in many low income countries the poor conditions of sanitation systems have been a significant cause of mortality since they accelerate waterborne disease transmission developing sanitation systems in these countries is a pressing concern in both the public and private sectors this research investigated a decentralized domestic wastewater treatment system using ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds although uv led disinfection has become more widespread in recent years it is a novel approach for domestic wastewater treatment domestic wastewater was pretreated by a low cost pretreatment system with an inclined settler and a sand filter prior to feeding a novel flow through uv led reactor at an inlet flow rate of 30 l h the cod tss and turbidity of the effluent were 17 7 mg l 3 0 mg l and 3 9 ntu respectively uv transmittance at 285 nm was enhanced from 29 1 to 70 4 improving the influent quality for uv led disinfection the flow through uv led reactor was operated at various flow rates from 10 to 50 ml min resulting in applied uv doses of 69 4 to 47 8 mj cm2 respectively these doses are sufficient for inactivating total coliforms in the wastewater to meet the water reuse guidelines for agriculture for both processed food crops and non food crops fouling which was observed starting at 2 d of operation decreased the disinfection efficacy to 27 after 25 days of continuous operation of the fouling layer 67 was attributed to organic matter in contrast to previous fouling studies with mercury uv lamps in which the fouling layer consisted primarily of inorganic compounds the fouling was reversed by off line citric acid cleaning for 4 h after every 400 h of continuous operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv leds flow through decentralized domestic wastewater water reuse fouling 1 introduction in a recent study more than 380 disease outbreaks related to waterborne parasitic protozoa were documented globally in a six year period between 2011 and 2016 efstratiou et al 2017 additionally 87 of total global mortality cases attributed to diarrhea came from south asia and sub saharan africa troeger et al 2017 there is no doubt that poor water supply and sanitation systems are a root cause leading to these public health issues yang et al 2012 therefore developing sanitation systems especially disinfection processes plays a critical role in addressing the issue ultraviolet uv disinfection is one of most common and most effective technologies for water and wastewater disinfection song et al 2016 although other conventional disinfection technologies have been widely used such as ozone chlorine oxide chlorine and peracetic acid they are all chemical containing and or by product forming processes uv disinfection is considered environmentally friendly as a noncorrosive treatment option free of disinfectant residuals and disinfection byproducts liberti et al 2003 for this reason there have been case studies on the application of uv disinfection for wastewater reclamation in southern italy uv disinfection was successful in removing protozoan parasites for unrestricted reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture with no formation of disinfection byproducts liberti et al 2003 a case study of water reuse in the middle east evaluated uv disinfection for inactivating enteric pathogens remaining after treatment by constructed wetlands azaizeh et al 2013 uv disinfection also showed a high performance in disinfecting swine secondary effluent for water reuse under alkaline controlled conditions in catarina brazil bilotta et al 2017 these previous studies involved traditional uv lamps containing mercury vapor which is extremely toxic to human health and the environment when it comes to lamp breakage during operation or discharging nance et al 2012 the united nations environmental programme unep through the minamata convention on mercury is working to control mercury waste and eliminate the release of mercury into air water and land by 2020 united nations environment programme 2013 although the minamata convention does not specifically address mercury uv lamps it raises awareness of the harmful effects of mercury and encourages organizations and governments to adopt mercury free products additionally mercury uv lamps are highly fragile temperature variation sensitive and they contain a large footprint thus uv light emitting diodes uv leds have been recently considered as a potential novel uv source offering features that could overcome the shortcomings of these lamps including high durability robust designs lower voltage requirements and lack of mercury chevremont et al 2013 würtele et al 2011 however studies applying uv leds for wastewater disinfection processes in real conditions are limited in particular there is a lack of case studies involving flow through uv c led processes ultraviolet disinfection is not completely free from drawbacks wastewater constituents such as solid particles humic acid and turbidity can reduce the inactivation efficacy of the uv disinfection process due to absorption scattering and shielding effects carré et al 2018 mamane et al 2006 consequently in applications of uv disinfection proper and efficient up stream treatment processes are often a decisive factor for success therefore this research pretreated the domestic wastewater with a low cost conventional system consisting of an inclined tube settler and a slow sand filter prior to feeding the novel flow through uv led reactor due to the high total settling area in comparison with other types of sedimentation inclined settlers have been widely applied to enhance settling velocities of clarification processes especially without support from chemical flocculation there have been a variety of inclinations used in inclined settlers in the literature ranging from 8 to 60 however most of industrial manufactures set their products at 60 inclination since it reduces the footprint of the processes and ensures sludge flow smith and davis 2013 smith et al 2013 slow sand filtration has been considered an effective conventional technology in water and wastewater treatment for treating a wide range of physical chemical and biological pollution haig et al 2011 li et al 2018 paredes et al 2016 moreover slow sand filtration processes are simple for operation and maintenance have low operating costs and can be used as tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants sand grain sizes range from 0 1 to several millimeters generally haig et al 2014 maintenance requirements are also an integral part of putting uv led disinfection technology into practice a very important consideration during operation of uv disinfection processes is fouling the growth of foulant on quartz sleeves due to the increase of temperature during operation could significantly reduce the uv dose applied due to a decrease of uv transmittance of the sleeves nessim and gehr 2006 although it has been hypothesized that leds will not be affected by fouling as much as mercury lamps because heat generated during operation is dissipated on the opposite side as the light source arik et al 2004 to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to evaluate fouling during application of a uv led disinfection process in wastewater treatment thus the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the performance of a low cost pretreatment system 2 study the disinfection efficacy of a flow through uv led system in continuous operation 3 determine the fouling period and fouling layer constituents and 4 propose an environmentally friendly cleaning method for removing the fouling layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source domestic wastewater was collected from a manhole at the asian institute of technology s ait sewer system pathumthani province thailand the ait campus with a population of 2000 2 500 generates wastewater with a mixture of greywater and blackwater mainly from dormitories offices and a cafeteria wastewater samples collected daily were analyzed giving the characteristics shown in table 1 all parameters were determined n 18 following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 2 2 pre treatment system with inclined tube settler and slow sand filtration prior to entering the uv led unit the raw wastewater was first stored in a raw wastewater tank and then pumped with a peristaltic pump through a conventional system with an inclined tube settler and a slow sand filter fig 1 the gravitational tube settler consisted of 117 tubes 400 mm length x 12 7 mm diameter inclined at 60 and fed from the bottom the respective total working volume and settling surface were calculated at 0 076 m3 and 1 87 m2 the tube settler acted as a sedimentation unit to remove extensive suspended solids which would have disturbed the uv led disinfection process the tube settler overflow was gravity fed to the sand filter the sand filter was constructed in three layers including a sand layer with sand size d10 d60 of approximately 0 4 0 8 mm at a thickness of 0 2 m a small supported gravel layer with gravel size d10 d60 of 5 10 mm at a thickness of 0 1 m and a large supported gravel layer with gravel size d10 d60 of 10 20 mm at a thickness of 0 15 m in that order d refers to the effective diameter d10 and d60 mean 10 and 60 of the particles were finer than that size respectively the total surface area of sand filtration was 0 2 m2 before pumping to the flow through uv led process an appropriate amount of pretreated wastewater was stored in a storage tank since the uv led process had lower capacity compared to the pretreatment system the extra volume of pretreated wastewater was directly discharged into the sewer system schematics of the pretreatment units and the treatment system are given in fig 1 the pretreatment system was first operated at three inlet flow rates of 30 60 and 90 l per hour l h to determine an optimal flow rate which would generate an acceptable influent for the uv led unit at these flow rates the corresponding overflow rates of the tube settler were 0 016 0 032 and 0 048 m3 m2 h respectively and the filtration rates of the sand filter were 0 15 0 3 and 0 45 m3 m2 h respectively the pretreatment efficiency of the system was based on four parameters total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity and uv transmittance uvt the uvt was calculated by eq 1 all parameters were determined n 6 following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 1 uvt λ 100 10 a λ where uvt is the uv transmittance at wavelength λ and a λ is the absorbance of wastewater at wavelength λ measured by a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer tokyo japan carré et al 2018 demonstrated that the microorganism inactivation efficacy of a uv disinfection process was significantly enhanced when the turbidity was under 5 ntu while mariel et al 2012 indicated that the increase of turbidity in wastewaters from 9 9 to 16 2 ntu resulted in a 60 reduction in the disinfection performance of the uv process thus the pretreated wastewater quality was designed to be less than 5 ntu in turbidity 2 3 flow through uv led reactor the flow through uv led reactor used in this study shown in fig 2 was a commercially available pearlaqua 6d aquisense technologies kentucky usa the reactor contained two leds with the spectral emission given by the manufacturer shown in fig 3 they exhibited a peak wavelength emission at 285 nm fig 3 a weighted average spectral emission of 287 nm and a full width at half maximum fwhm of 13 5 nm the leds have a rated effective lifetime of 10 000 h as given by the reactor manufacturer the pearl aqua unit has an input voltage of 12v dc and a total optical output of 65 mw the reactor contains a working volume of 68 6 ml an inlet and outlet diameter of ¼ inch and an outer length and diameter of 107 87 mm 2 4 uv fluence determination to evaluate the efficacy of the uv led disinfection process the uv doses applied by the flow through reactor to the water samples were determined using a method called biodosimetry described previously oguma et al 2016 usepa 2006 in this method the flow through reactor was challenged with a microorganism at specific flow rates and its log reduction from uv exposure was determined for each flow rate in parallel quasi collimated beam experiments were conducted with a batch reactor to determine the dose response of the microorganism in each water sample the dose response curve was then used as a standard curve to back calculate the uv dose or the reduction equivalent fluence ref delivered by the flow through reactor at each flow rate pure cultured male specific 2 ms2 coliphage atcc 15597 b1 american type culture collection virginia u s was used as the representative microorganism and biodosimeter for the disinfection studies male specific and f specific coliphage have commonly been considered indicators of the presence of pathogens in addition to other popular microorganisms such as e coli fecal coliforms or enterococci wu et al 2011 ms2 coliphage also has much in common with mammalian viral pathogens including enteroviruses such as size shape isoelectric point genome length and morphology michen and graule 2010 park et al 2011 moreover ms2 is generally more resistant to environmental factors compared to other virus surrogates feng et al 2003 silverman et al 2013 the flow through uv led reactor was operated at five different flow rates of 10 20 30 40 and 50 ml min the treated wastewater was spiked with ms2 at a concentration of 105 to 108 pfu ml corresponding uv doses applied by the flow through process at each flow rate were estimated by correlating the log reduction of ms2 to a uv dose response curve developed with the batch reactor experiments described below the batch reactor illustrated in fig 4 contained a uv led unit purchased from tds light company limited tds uv280 j9 jiangsu china with nine leds set at a distance of 3 cm from the water sample surface the spectral emission of the uv led batch reactor fig s1 was measured at the national institute of metrology thailand nimt with a diode array spectroradiometer cas140ct 154 a cosine receptor probe eop 146 and a non optical density filter instrument systems germany the leds in the batch reactor had a peak wavelength emission of 277 3 nm a weighted average wavelength of 276 nm a fwhm of 10 7 nm and the radiation profile shown in fig s2 incident irradiance at the center of the water sample was 0 30 mw cm2 and the uniformity of the batch reactor irradiance shown in fig s3 yielded a petri factor of 0 876 for the 3 5 cm dishes inner diameter 3 35 cm which were cornered in the same position for each experiment by two secure microscope slides current and voltage inputs were controlled with a voltage regulator to stabilize the irradiance output the unit was operated with an input current and voltage of 60 ma and 17 vdc respectively given the challenges of operating the batch reactor unit without an in house radiometer as well as challenges associated with polychromatic actinometry calculations the irradiance of the batch reactor was back calculated using biodosimetry with ms2 the inactivation rate constant reported in the literature for a uv led device with the same peak wavelength emission 277 nm and fwhm 10 nm was 0 052 cm2 mj beck et al 2017 using that inactivation rate in these experiments the average irradiance across the surface of the water sample back calculated from biodosimetry was 0 208 mj cm2 0 0133 n 3 this value was comparable to the average irradiance across the surface of the water sample calculated from off site radiometry 0 213 mj cm2 for a polychromatic uv source adjusted to account for the petri factor reflection factor and divergence factor linden and darby 1997 usepa 2006 these values were then used together with the water factor to determine the average irradiance applied throughout each water sample beck et al 2017 the calculation did not include a collimation factor as proposed by kheyrandish et al 2018 which was published a full year after these experiments were conducted the irradiance was weighted germicidally by the dna absorbance to calculate the uv doses for each batch experiment as described previously linden and darby 1997 usepa 2006 weighting by the ms2 action spectrum instead of dna absorbance would have had a negligible effect since the action spectrum of ms2 closely follows that of dna and rna within the spectrum emitted by these leds beck et al 2016 to account for the slight differences in uvled wavelength emission from the batch 277 nm and the flow through reactors 285 nm average germicidal irradiance was also calculated for a hypothetical batch reactor with the same leds as those used in the flow through reactor the ratio of average germicidal uv irradiances led to a wavelength correction factor of 0 97 average germicidal irradiance would be slightly lower from leds emitting at 285 nm than those emitting at 277 nm since their peak emission is further from the peak of rna absorbance beck et al 2016 each batch reactor experiment exposed a 5 ml sample volume 6 mm depth continuously stirred by a magnetic stir bar to create homogenous water sample the uv doses in mj cm2 were calculated as the product of the average irradiance eavg mw cm2 and exposure time s where eavg accounted for the uv absorbance of the water across the uv led spectrum the log reduction of ms2 coliphage was estimated following chick watson model 2 log reduction log c 0 c where c0 and c are the ms2 coliphage concentration pfu ml before and after exposure to the uv leds respectively the applied uv doses with the corresponding log reduction of ms2 were used to plot the uv dose response curves from which to determine the dose applied by the flow through uv led reactor 2 5 preparation and enumeration of the microorganism the ms2 coliphage stock was propagated and enumerated following the u s environmental protection agency epa method for double agar layer usepa 2001 for propagation ms2 and the log phage e coli host atcc 700891 were inoculated in a mixture of phosphate buffered saline pbs and tryptic soy broth with magnesium chloride and ampicillin and streptomycin antibiotics per manufacturer s instructions the mixture then was incubated at 37 1 c for 16 24 h to separate ms2 from the bacterial cells the mixture was centrifuged for 25 min at 3000 g the supernatant was filtered through sterile 0 2 μm filters and stored in the freezer at 18 2 c 2 6 continuous feeding operation process for the fouling and cleaning study the reduction of the applied uv dose due to fouling over the continuous feeding process was investigated by examining the decrease of disinfection efficacy through daily sampling in these experiments the flow through reactor was operated at 30 ml min with distilled water and ms2 as the challenge microorganism distilled water was used to eliminate disturbances and create a homogenous condition for comparison since the uv dose of 20 mj cm2 is commonly applied for filtered effluent in wastewater disinfection for 3 log removal of microbial pathogens gehr et al 2003 lazarova et al 1999 our study applied higher doses than that for ensuring pathogen disinfection therefore the flow through uv led reactor was continuously fed at 30 ml min with pretreated wastewater until the disinfection efficacy or fouling coefficient decreased to around 0 27 at which point the uv dose applied reached below 20 mj cm2 and cleaning was required fouling layers on the inside wall of the uv led unit were removed to investigate fouling constituents n 2 using the inductively coupled plasma method 3120b at intertek bangkok thailand a 50 hydrochloric acid hcl solution was used to dissolve the fouling layers to analyze the calcium ca magnesium mg iron fe and phosphorus p content since they are assumed to be the dominant fouling materials lin et al 1999a qiang et al 2013 the total volatile solids tvs apha method 2540e content of the fouling layers was also examined in order to estimate the contribution of organic materials in the fouling layers these parameters and other parameters of the pretreated wastewater were analyzed following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater including hardness 2340c iron 3500b and total phosphorus 4500d p apha 2012 citric acid was used to clean the fouled reactor during the cleaning process the uv leds were turned off and the flow through reactor was processed with a 15 citric acid solution ph 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml min at each cleaning test 1 l of the citric solution was prepared and recirculated one cleaning experiment was conducted at each fouling period for a total of four cleanings with corresponding cleaning times of 2 3 4 and 12 h the aim of this experiment was to determine the required time to reverse the fouling and return the reactor to its original condition using citric acid cleaning 2 7 statistical analysis when comparing differences in removal efficiencies for the pretreatment system one way anova analysis was used with a p value 0 05 one way anova analysis p value 0 05 was also applied to determine significant differences in disinfection efficacies of the flow through uv led reactor among various operational flow rates 3 results and discussion 3 1 pretreatment system performance the overall treatment performance of the tube settler and slow sand filter in terms of tss cod and turbidity removal is given in table 2 and fig 5 the flow rate of 30 l h had the highest removal efficiencies for tss 96 8 1 1 cod 89 9 3 4 and turbidity 94 2 3 the other flow rates of 60 and 90 l h led to lower removal efficacies of under 85 in most parameters this indicates that the increase of inlet flow rate led to a decrease in treatment performance of the pretreatment system as expected since there was no support from up stream coagulation flocculation processes the treatment output of the tube settler in this study was quite low in comparison with most of the literature at an overflow rate of 0 016 m3 m2 h the tube settler removed 76 6 of tss 30 0 gtss m2 day 67 0 of cod 51 3 gcod m2 day and 52 1 of turbidity tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2014 determined that a 60 inclined settler could increase the overall treatment efficiency compared to conventional designs leading to an overall settling efficiency of 93 the initial tss concentration in that study was 1066 mg l which was 12 times higher than this study similarly in another study at an overflow rate of 0 2 m3 m2 h 45 inclination 1233 mg l mlss and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min 99 4 of tss was removed fraji et al 2013 in those cases the application of chemical based pretreatment was necessary due to the high tss however in this study coagulation and flocculation chemicals could have increased the turbidity in the effluent and impaired the light transmittance of uv leds the tube settler and sand filter in this study did not require any chemical based support and the pretreatment efficacy was still efficient resulting in effluent concentration of tss cod and turbidity of 3 mg l 17 7 mg l and 3 9 ntu respectively at an operational flow rate of 30 l h in analyzing the tube setter s and sand filter s contributions to overall removal efficiencies the data revealed that the tube settler was more significant for removing tss turbidity and cod whereas the sand filter was dominant in enhancing uv transmittance for instance at an operational flow rate of 30 l h the sand filter unit 0 15 m3 m2 h contributed to the removal of 22 9 6 0 of cod 20 2 5 6 of tss and 42 0 4 6 of turbidity from the raw wastewater whereas the tube settler unit 0 016 m3 m2 h contributed to the removal of over 66 9 8 6 of cod 76 5 5 6 of tss and 52 1 6 0 of turbidity from the raw wastewater fig 5 regarding uv transmittance a final uvt at 285 nm of 71 4 was obtained at a flow rate of 30 l h fig 6 the tube settler and sand filter accounted for a 10 5 and 30 9 uvt enhancement respectively indicating that around 75 of the overall uvt enhancement of the pretreatment system was attributed to the sand filter rizzo et al 2015 reported a better performance in which 62 of the uv absorbance used to calculate uvt was removed with sand filtration and graphene absorption at a 0 1 m h filtration rate in comparison to other pretreatment methods subsurface wetlands treating household effluent reached a uvt at 254 nm of only 40 azaizeh et al 2013 whereas a uvt 254 nm of 57 was obtained when using sonication to treat trickling filter effluent for uv disinfection by yong et al 2008 this indicates that the conventional and low cost pretreatment system in this study can be considered as a high performance pretreatment option for uv led disinfection the sand filtration effectiveness in lowering turbidity has been demonstrated in the literature li et al 2018 reported turbidity of less than 1 ntu which was significantly better than that of this study from a filtration rate ranging from 0 5 to 0 2 m h however li et al 2018 used a granular activated carbon gac sandwich filter with 10 cm 30 cm 10 cm of sand gac sand the filtration media was more complex and thicker than in this study in addition pompei et al 2017 also reported 1 ntu turbidity of filtered water the pompei study used a thicker layer of sand 40 cm compared to 20 cm in this study and the sand was a finer grain size of 0 21 mm compared to the 0 4 0 8 mm used in this study huisman and wood 1974 concluded that the most effective sand size for slow sand filter ranging from 0 15 to 0 35 mm these differences could explain why the li and pompei sand filtration systems reached lower effluent turbidities than in this study given the above results operating this pretreatment system with a flow rate of 30 l h was optimal among the three flow rates tested therefore this flow rate was selected for subsequent experiments at 30 l h the pretreatment system could process 0 72 m3 of pretreated wastewater per day this volume would account for at least 70 of average water consumption and therefore generation per household in thailand the study location 0 98 m3 day metropolitan waterworks authority 2017 the uv led system had a significantly lower capacity compared to the pretreatment system therefore an appropriate amount of pretreated wastewater was stored in a storage tank for disinfection studies and the extra was directly discharged into the sewer system the uv led system could be scaled up to accommodate the total wastewater volume however 3 2 ms2 uv dose response curve through the lab scale batch reactor experiments with wastewater an ms2 uv dose response curve was developed which demonstrated linear inactivation kinetics fig 7 the fluence based inactivation rate constant kf from the wastewater samples was exactly 0 052 0 003 cm2 mj n 4 which matched the designed inactivation rate constant from biodosimetry in another study in which ms2 was inactivated with a high precision laser emitting monochromatic light at 280 nm the inactivation rate constant kf was 0 043 cm2 mj however that source differed from these leds which emit over a broader range down to 270 nm fig 3 where the absorbance of rna and therefore the inactivation of ms2 is higher beck et al 2016 in another study with uv leds emitting at 275 nm the ms2 inactivation rate constant was 0 035 cm2 mj bowker et al 2011 however that study calculated the uv dose applied as if it were a monochromatic system whereas leds are polychromatic light sources offering broadband spectral emissions spanning across more than 20 nm 3 3 flow through uv led process disinfection efficiency the disinfection performance of the flow through uv led reactor at the five different operating flow rates and their corresponding exposure time log ms2 inactivation and uv dose is given in table 3 and fig 8 as expected the dose applied to the water sample decreased as the operating flow rates increased due to the lower uv exposure times the lowest log ms2 inactivation was 2 6 0 1 log at the highest flow rate tested of 50 ml min corresponding to a uv dose of 47 8 1 6 mj cm2 from there the ms2 log activation increased 1 45 times at a flow rate 5 times slower to 3 7 0 2 log at a 10 ml min which was less efficient than the batch system although the uv dose increased with increasing exposure time the dose response of the ms2 exhibited tailing lower inactivation efficiencies in flow through reactors than in batch reactors have been reported previously for both low pressure uv lamps and uv leds hijnen et al 2006 oguma et al 2013 it is assumed that this is due to microbial aggregation light shielding and or to heterogeneous hydraulic conditions within the reactor given that there was no mixing by a magnetic stirrer during operation of the flow through process microbial aggregations could occur especially when the operational time is increased this finding was highly supported by oguma et al 2013 in a flow through reactor and by mattle and kohn 2012 in a batch system the inactivation efficacy of uv light could also be affected by light shielding which prevents uv irradiation from reaching the target microorganism particularly in waters with lower uv transmittance finally heterogeneous hydraulic conditions could also play a role the system could have been susceptible to short circuiting whereby a portion of the water exits the reactor before the average particle residence time short circuiting and reduced disinfection efficacy is more prominent at low flow rates iranpour et al 1999 a uvled system s configuration strongly affects its disinfection performance specifically the uv irradiance is stronger near the uv light source lee et al 2018 price et al 2011 in this study the maximum distance between the uv source and the reactor wall was 5 56 cm within a spherical reactor with a highly reflective material uv reactors are typically designed to have a thin path length or a high uv transmittance this study disinfected wastewater with a uvt 285 nm of 70 which was lower than the operational uvt recommended by the manufacturer of greater than 90 however tailing has also been seen in a cylindrical flow through reactor with a maximum path length of 12 mm and uv leds of lower output oguma et al 2013 inactivation efficacies of uv led systems vary with radiation profile water characteristics challenge microorganisms system configurations and sample volumes future research in this area would be beneficial the concentrations of total coliforms and e coli in the pretreated wastewater in this study both ranged from 0 8 104 to 2 3 105 mpn 100 ml which is approximately 5 logs since the uv dose needed to inactivate e coli is much lower than for ms2 at approximately 3 2 mj cm2 at 280 nm to 3 4 mj cm2 at 260 nm for 1 log inactivation beck et al 2017 oguma et al 2013 the uv doses applied in this study of 69 4 mj cm2 before fouling or approximately 20 mj cm2 after fouling are sufficient for inactivating e coli and total coliforms in pretreated wastewaters for agriculture use which would meet the water reuse guideline for agriculture both for processed food crops and non food crops of non detected coliform in 100 ml samples usepa 2012 3 4 fouling for fouling investigation tests the flow through uv led process was continuously operated at a flow rate of 30 ml min during the continuous operation disinfection efficacy of the process decreased from 3 7 log ms2 inactivation to approximately 1 log after 25 days indicating fouling in the uv system the fouling coefficient decreased from 1 to approximately 0 27 fig 9 this reduction in disinfection efficacy was presumed due to fouling as opposed to led aging because it was completely reversed as discussed in section 3 5 the reduction in disinfection performance of the uv led process was observed starting from the 2nd day of continuous operation fig 9 the fouling appeared to follow first order kinetics corresponding to the findings of lin et al 1999b the estimated reduction of disinfection performance of the process was 0 12 0 03 log ms2 inactivation per day n 52 it is important to note that all previous fouling studies for ultraviolet disinfection processes were investigated with traditional uv lamps therefore it is difficult to compare this study with others regarding the cause of fouling lin et al 1999b indicated that the increase of temperature during operation enhanced the precipitation of fouling materials consequently the smooth surface of the quartz sleeve turned into a round surface and trapped water while the high temperature enhanced the coprecipitation of foulant materials in our study the fouling layer appeared as a light brown amorphous film not only on the quartz plate but also on the reactor wall the manufacturer aimed to enhance inactivation efficacy with an interior surface of highly reflective material with a reflectivity of 95 at wavelengths of 250 300 nm according to the manufacturer therefore the fouling layer diminished the uv reflection off the reactor s wall and reduced the disinfection efficacy moreover the presence of dominant fouling materials in pretreated wastewater table 4 and the system s hydrodynamic conditions including the low operational flow rate 30 ml min and bottom feed operation contributed to the formation of the fouling layers in our study there have been many constituents in water that have caused fouling during uv disinfection processes including calcium and magnesium hardness iron phosphorus and other elements and minerals in the matrix of the foulant whereas iron and hardness attributed to the most dominant fraction amin et al 2010 lin et al 1999a qiang et al 2013 table 4 shows for this study the concentration of fouling elements in the pretreated wastewater the concentration in the acid solution used to dissolve the fouling layer for analysis as well as the fraction in the total weight of the fouling layer including hardness iron and phosphorus this indicates that calcium compounds played an important role in the fouling layer composition 18 7 additionally it has been reported that fouling layers dominantly consist of amorphous and inorganic films amin et al 2010 whereas uv radiation is able to prevent the accumulation of organic foulants on quartz sleeves lin et al 1999b other research studies have shown inorganic fouling materials to be the dominant constituents of the fouling layer however in this research volatile solids accounted for 67 of total solids in the fouling layers therefore it is assumed that organic fouling materials could play a significant role given that uv irradiation could prevent organic fouling and the quartz plate was the closest part to light source organic fouling on the quartz may have been insignificant however fouling occurred not only on the quartz plate but also on the interior surface of the reactor observations showed that the fouling layer was thin and rough on the quartz plate and a thicker uniform layer on the reactor s interior surface fig s4 the thin but rough layer on the quartz plate was assumed to be due to precipitates the thicker uniform layer on interior surface may have formed because of the reactor s design the farthest point from leds to the interior surface was 5 56 cm therefore wastewater could have absorbed a majority of the uv irradiance before it reached the reactor s interior surface as a result organic fouling layers formed and increased over the long continuously operational period those layers could have trapped microorganisms following a similar mechanism to fouling on quartz sleeve in the study of lin et al 1999b consequently fouling on the reactor s interior surface was considered an important cause of the reduction in disinfection performance over the continuous operation in this study however there remains a limitation in this study in that the fouling effects on the reactor s interior and the quartz cover could not be examined individually research into fouling layers developed in flow through uv led systems is limited therefore more intensive studies on the fouling mechanisms of uv led processes are necessary as uv led disinfection technology is put into practice 3 5 proposed fouling reversal method citric acid has been utilized for metal ions chelating and as an alternative cleaning agent for calcium salts removal in a wide range of industrial activities especially for food manufacturing vavrusova et al 2017 vavrusova and skibsted 2016 citric acid is an organic compound environmentally friendly and biodegradable since it is derived from natural materials therefore it is harmless to the environment other studies reported that citrate is an efficient calcium carbonate caco3 scale inhibitor since it absorbs caco3 crystals and prevents the growth of crystal particles bassioni 2010 chaussemier et al 2015 wada et al 2001 with regard to metal ions samsuri and irawan 2004 determined that a solution of citric acid 4 ph 2 soaked for 5 h could dissolve most iron complexes in montmorillonite whereas 0 1 m citric acid soaked for 144 h could dissolve 39 of total harbor sediment iron mineral in the study of di palma and mecozzi 2007 the uv leds were operated at a flow rate of 30 ml min until the fouling effect reduced the applied uv dose to less than 20 mj cm2 only 4 h of running with citric acid solution 15 ph 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml min was required to recover the fouled uv led reactor back to its original applied uv dose 69 4 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 10 ml min with pretreated wastewater a 12 h cleaning was also tested indicating that there was no re adsorption of the fouling constituents onto the reactor s wall and the quartz cover when the soaking period was greater than 4 h fig 10 the u s epa suggests that for continuous feeding disinfection processes for traditional uv lamps off line cleaning with chemicals is required for up to 15 min the cleaning frequency can vary depending on the water quality the degree of fouling and operating conditions usepa 2006 for this study cleaning the flow through uv led reactor for 4 h was required after 25 days of operation 4 conclusions through the above results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a conventional low cost system with an inclined settler and sand filter could be an appropriate option for pretreating domestic wastewater prior to uv led disinfection at a flow rate of 30 l h a 600 inclined settler and a slow sand filter produced quality effluent for the subsequent uv led disinfection specifically tss was decreased by 96 8 1 1 cod by 89 9 3 4 and turbidity by 94 2 3 as such the effluent concentration of tss cod and turbidity were 3 0 0 8 mg l 17 7 3 2 mg l and 3 9 0 7 ntu respectively uvt at 285 nm was also significantly enhanced from approximately 29 70 the other inlet flow rates presented a lower treatment performance 2 in the flow through uv led process 3 7 log ms2 inactivation was achieved at a flow rate of 10 ml min corresponding to an applied uv dose of 69 4 mj cm2 the increase of the inlet flow rate to 20 30 40 and 50 ml min reduced disinfection performance to 3 4 3 1 2 8 and 2 6 log ms2 inactivation respectively the corresponding uv doses reached are sufficient for disinfecting water for agricultural use which would meet the usepa guideline for water reuse notably with the same wastewater source ms2 inactivation performance in the flow through process did not follow the same trend compared to the batch reactor when it came to exposure time 3 it has been claimed that fouling in mercury lamp uv disinfection reactors is due primarily to inorganic constituents taking place mostly on the quartz sleeve and resulting from the effects of temperature in contrast the fouling in this uv led system was primarily organic taking place both on the quartz and on the reactor s interior surface it was also attributed in part to hydrodynamic conditions and the reactor s configuration in this study volatile solids content accounted for 67 of the total fouling constituents fouling of the flow through reactor occurred within 2 days of operation with an average reduction of 0 12 0 03 log ms2 inactivation per day after 25 d continuous operation the uv led system fouling coefficient reduced from 1 0 to 0 27 4 fouling reversal was possible with 4 h of citric acid soaking restoring the uv led flow through reactor to its original disinfection efficacy the required frequency of offline chemical cleaning which depends on the water quality the degree of fouling and the applied dose depends on the reactor configuration and uv emission source as well this study can act as a starting point from which to base future research and future guidelines declaration of
