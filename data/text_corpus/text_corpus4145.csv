intelligent algorithm layout design unsupervised learning 1 introduction oil production from deepwater fields has experienced consistent growth since 2000 with the maturation of deepwater development concepts deepwater fields have adopted a development mode based on a subsea production system sps at present the deepwater oil field with the largest number of subsea wells is the dalia oil field operated by total in angola which has 78 subsea wells the field however has completed all crude oil processing operations using only one floating production storage and offloading fpso unit this requires a series of sps equipment such as subsea manifold pipeline end terminal plet pipeline end manifold plem and jumper to collect and deliver the crude oil to the fpso growth in the deepwater sector faced significant challenges following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 in this case operators have been forced to reduce costs to adapt to low oil prices thus optimizing the layout of the sps plays a vital role in reducing the facility s construction cost of deepwater oil fields on the basis of the characteristics and development strategies of specific oil and gas fields the layout pattern of various underwater production systems has been formed initially engineers designed the sps but recently an increasing number of sps layout optimization algorithms have been introduced these algorithms primary are used to assist designers in preliminary conceptual design to improve design efficiency the characteristics are reflected in the different connection modes of the underwater wellhead and the manifold and the production platform the four common layout modes are as follows single well tiebacks daisy chain template manifolds and cluster manifolds wang et al 2012 the cluster manifold connection is applicable to almost all of the reservoirs of various sizes and most of the relevant research is based on this layout mode for optimization wang et al 2014a we selected the cluster manifolds with the broadest application prospects as the research object fig 1 shows a typical sps using cluster manifold connection in the layout optimization of the sps based on the position

proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to integrate the optimization of the offshore production system the model defines the number capacity and location of platforms and manifolds as well as the optimal assignment of wells to these facilities while searching for the minimum global investment costs this research has optimized the subsea well grouping cluster manifold layout and connection relationship among cluster manifolds in the sps but the interaction among these three optimization aspects has not been considered comprehensively in this study we established a mathematical model to accurately describe the optimization problems and studied the mechanism of interaction among these optimization problems based on this model finally we developed an optimization algorithm for sps layout to achieve the goal of collaborative optimization we took a deepwater oil field with 22 production wells as an example to analyze and verify the optimization effect and necessity of collaborative optimization finally by comparing our results with the results from the existing optimization method we verified the advanced performance of this new optimization algorithm 2 description of the optimization problem and assumptions 2 1 optimization problem description in the development of deepwater fields with a large number of subsea wells it generally is necessary to connect the subsea wells to multiple cluster manifolds for joint development of the entire oilfield a subsea tree installed on the subsea well is connected to the cluster manifold by the subsea jumper plet subsea pipeline plet subsea jumper cluster manifold connection mode subsea pipelines are used to connect one cluster manifold to another cluster manifold and finally to connect to the fpso the plem is used to optimizing the cluster manifolds layout the cluster manifolds can be directly connected to plem or be connected to plem in series the cluster manifolds be connected in series can reduce the pipeline distance and pigging costs fig 2 shows four well groups which are indicated by dotted lines and each well group includes a cluster manifold and all of the subsea wells connected to it the well locations were fixed before the optimization of sps layout to design the optimum sps layout we optimized the division of the well groups and the connection relationship among the well groups which focused on the following three main problems 1 well grouping allocate subsea wells to appropriate well groups 2 cluster manifolds layout arrange a suitable number of cluster manifolds in a suitable position 3 connection relationship between cluster manifolds connect each cluster manifold in an appropriate form to achieve the goal of reducing the pipeline cost these optimization problems are not three problems in isolation and they affect each other in the optimization process in previous studies the goal of the optimization algorithm was to first optimize the well grouping and cluster manifold layout in coordination and then to optimize the connection relationship between the cluster manifolds on the basis of the previous optimization results neuroth et al 2000 souza and medeiros 2010 gehrlein and pasic 2009 dobersek and goricanec 2009 el mahdy et al 2010 in this study we developed a new optimization algorithm based on the clustering algorithm and minimum spanning tree algorithm for the problems existing in previous research the clustering algorithm is a typical application of unsupervised learning which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets and the minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to optimize the scheme for the connection between manifolds by finding the minimum spanning tree minimum spanning tree is the minimum subsets of edges that can connect all the vertices without forming any cycle and with the minimum total cost we achieved the goal of collaborative optimization for three problems of well grouping cluster manifolds layout and the connection relationship among cluster manifolds and demonstrated that it effectively reduced subsea development costs 2 2 basic assumptions our main purpose was to study the collaborative optimization methods for these three optimization problems to facilitate the establishment of mathematical models and the realization of algorithms this paper simplified some irrelevant conditions and proposed the following basic assumptions 1 seabed topography we assumed that the seabed topography was a flat two dimensional plane there were no restrictions on the design of the malicious terrain and no geopolitical and fishery activities and the position of all subsea equipment was expressed in two dimensional coordinates 2 well slots of cluster manifolds we assumed that the alternative cluster manifold types are 4 slot 6 slot 8 slot 10 slot 12 slot and 14 slot 3 connection mode of subsea equipment we assumed that the connection mode of subsea tree jumper cluster manifold was used when the distance between the well and manifold was less than 100 m whereas the connection mode of subsea tree jumper plet branch pipeline plet jumper cluster manifold was used by default all connections were in a straight line and met the requirements of flow assurance 4 risk assessment we considered the risk assessment of the subsea pipeline and quantified and integrated the risk of subsea pipelines into the overall cost using the accident rate and its maintenance cost 5 cost description the cost in the objective function of this paper considered only the pipeline connection costs of cluster manifold layout and the manufacturing and installation costs of subsea production facilities because the cost of the subsea wellhead and subsea tree did not affect the optimal design of this study the cost did not include these two types of equipment we have considered the pigging by double the length of export pipeline when calculating the overall cost export pipeline refers to the pipeline among manifolds 3 mathematical model 3 1 basic parameters and optimization objectives let the expression of subsea wells be w 1 w 2 w 3 w n in which n is the number of subsea wells and its expression also indicates its coordinates that is w n x w n y w n let the expression of cluster manifolds be m 1 m 2 m m in which m is the number of cluster manifolds and its expression also indicates its coordinates that is m m x m m y m m let the expression of plem be p its coordinates is p x p y p in the construction of the sps each subsea well must be connected to the cluster manifolds so we refer to all of the subsea wells connected to the cluster manifold m m as the well group g m therefore the expression of the well group corresponding to the cluster manifold is g i i 1 2 m in which m is the number of well groups and the number of subsea wells included in the well group is represented by w g 1 w g 2 w g m the clustering center of each well group is the corresponding cluster manifold coordinate that is m i x m i y m i i 1 2 m the value of the number of cluster manifolds m is between the minimum number of cluster manifolds k min and the maximum number of cluster manifolds k max performing an iterative loop on all integers between k min and k max the optimal value of the final iteration result is the optimal number of manifolds as follows 1 k m a x n 4 2 k m i n n 14 where k m a x is the maximum number of cluster manifolds k m i n is the minimum number of cluster manifolds and n is number of subsea wells we set the overall cost of the sps to c m i w g i i 1 2 m that is the cost is related to the number coordinates and combination of the cluster manifolds our optimization objective was to minimize the cost by selecting the optimum number of cluster manifolds well grouping cluster manifold coordinates and cluster manifold combination form then the rough mathematical model of cluster manifold layout and subsea well grouping problem can be expressed in the following optimization problems 3 min m i w g i i 1 2 m c m i w g i i 1 2 m we next established the display expression of the model based on the connection relationship between the subsea wells and the cluster manifolds various constraints and basic assumptions 3 2 connection between subsea well and cluster manifold the grouping problem of subsea wells is a connection problem between the subsea well and cluster manifold to establish a mathematical model we defined a simple and clear connectivity matrix to explain the relationship between subsea well and cluster manifold when assigning a certain number of subsea wells w 1 w 2 w 3 w n to several well groups g 1 g 2 g m n and m represent the number of subsea wells and well groups if the ith subsea well w i i 1 2 n was assigned to the jth well group g j j 1 2 m that is it is connected with the jth cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m binary numbers b i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m can be used to represent their connection relationship as follows 4 b i j 1 w i c o n n e c t i n g w i t h m j 0 w i n o t c o n n e c t i n g w i t h m j because a subsea well can be connected only to a cluster manifold all b i j can fully represent the grouping of the subsea wells that is the connection relationship between the subsea well w i and the cluster manifold m j all the binary numbers b i j can form this connection between the well and the manifold relation matrix that is b b i j n m i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 5 b b i j n m b 11 b 1 m b n 1 b n m n m 3 3 connection relationship between cluster manifolds and plem in a subsea production system cluster manifolds can be connected in series or connected with plem using binary number b m i j i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 to represent the connection relationship between the ith cluster manifold m i i 1 2 m the jth cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m and the plem p all of the binary numbers b m i j can form this connection relation matrix that is b m b m i j m 1 m 1 i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 6 b m b m i j m 1 m 1 b m 1 1 b m 1 m 1 b m m 1 1 b m m 1 m 1 m 1 m 1 3 4 cluster manifold combination form each well group g i i 1 2 m uses different types of cluster manifolds because the commonly used cluster manifold types are only 4 slot 6 slot 8 slot 10 slot 12 slot and 14 slot to facilitate the establishment of the model we set the 4 slot manifold to the 14 slot manifold to be the no 1 manifold to the no 6 manifold use of binary number b s i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 to represent the combination of different types of manifolds indicates the number of no using j manifolds in the ith well group all of the binary numbers b s i j can form the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 7 b s b s i j m 6 b s 11 b s 16 b s m 1 b s m 6 m 6 3 5 cost model using l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m to represent the length between subsea wells w i i 1 2 n and cluster manifolds m j j 1 2 m this paper defined the distance between any two points by euler distance so l i j w i m j b i j we considered the use of the jumper and the plet so the connection cost between subsea wells and cluster manifolds can be represented by c l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 8 c l i j 0 44 0 2 l i j 1 t 0 02 where l i j is the length between subsea well w i and cluster manifold m j and t is production time year all of c l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m can form the connection between well and manifold cost matrix c l c l i j n m 9 c l c l i j n m c l 11 c l 1 m c l n 1 c l n m n m using l m i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 m to represent the length between each cluster manifold in which l m i j m i m j b m i j the connection cost between cluster manifolds can be represented by c l m i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 m 10 c l m i j 0 88 0 8 l m i j 1 t 0 02 where l m i j is the length between cluster manifold s all of c l m i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 m can form the cluster manifolds connection cost matrix c l m c l m i j m m 11 c l m c l m i j m m c l 11 c l 1 m c l m 1 c l m m m m in addition to the connection cost between the subsea wells and the cluster manifold the cost of the cluster manifolds also affects the design of the sps according to the previous concept of setting manifold types for cluster manifolds with different numbers of well slots use m p j j 1 2 6 to represent the cost of the no 1 6 cluster manifolds which include manufacturing costs installation costs and operating costs as follows 12 m p j 4 1 0 02 t j 1 6 1 0 02 t j 2 9 1 0 02 t j 3 12 1 0 02 t j 4 15 1 0 02 t j 5 19 1 0 02 t j 6 where m p j is the cost of manifold no j in million u s dollars usd eq 8 eq 10 and eq 12 are derived based on the engineering data of deepwater oil fields which belong to china petroleum chemical corporation sinopec use cm to represent the total cost of the cluster manifolds according to the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 7 13 c m i 1 m j 1 6 b s i j m p j where cm is the total cost of the cluster manifolds million usd b s i j is the number of no j manifolds in the ith well group and m p j is the cost of no j cluster manifold according to the connection between well and manifold cost matrix c l c l i j n m and the cluster manifolds connection cost matrix c l m c l m i j m m the total cost between all the subsea equipment can be expressed as follows 14 c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j i 1 m j 1 m c l m i j 3 6 constraints on connection relations and number of well slots when the subsea wells w 1 w 2 w 3 w n are assigned to the well groups g 1 g 2 g m any subsea well must be connected to cluster manifold and it can be connected to only one manifold thus according to the connection between well and manifold relation matrix that is b b i j n m i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 5 set the following constraints 15 j m b i j b i 1 b i 2 b i m 1 according to the engineering practice when selecting manifold well slots one or two well slots need to be reserved for further development at a later stage thus the total number of well slots for each manifold must be greater than the number of wells that is w g i i 1 2 m of its well group on the basis of the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 set the following constraints 16 w g i j 1 6 2 2 j b s i j we aimed the optimal design of sps at the layout of cluster manifolds and the grouping of subsea wells the basic restriction was that the number of cluster manifolds must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the optimality of the optimization results we did not limit the upper limit of the cluster manifold the restrictions are as follows 17 m 1 and is a positive integer 3 7 mathematical relationships and model establishment of optimization goals according to the previous analysis we transformed the optimization target with the lowest overall cost c into the following mathematical language 18 min c c i 1 n j 1 m c l i j i 1 m j 1 m c l m i j i 1 m j 1 6 b s i j m p j s t j m b i j b i 1 b i 2 b i m 1 w g i j 1 6 2 2 j b s i j m 1 a n d i s a p o s i t i v e i n t e g e r the first and second items on the right side of equation 18 are the overall connection cost and the third item is the overall cost of the cluster manifold to achieve the optimization goal of the lowest overall cost we considered the subsea well grouping the connection relationship with the cluster manifolds the combination form of cluster manifolds and the number of well groups as a whole we also took into account the restrictions in equations 15 17 and eventually formed a connection matrix cluster manifold combination matrix and number of well groups that minimized the overall cost the unknown variables of the new algorithm are the number of cluster manifolds m the connection between well and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m the manifold coordinates m m x m m y m m the plem coordinates p x p y p the connection between the well and the manifold relation matrix b b i j n m and the connection between the manifold and the plem relation matrix b m b m i j m 1 m 1 the lowest overall cost c can be obtained by iterating the above unknown quantities through the algorithm 4 the new algorithm for the layout of sps the previously described relationship among the three optimization problems is shown in fig 3 when optimizing the layout of cluster manifolds we made it as close as possible to each connected subsea well and manifold this ensured that the well grouping and the connection between cluster manifolds affected the layout of the cluster manifold to optimize the well grouping we distributed the wellhead to be the closest to the manifold so it was affected by the layout of cluster manifolds the location of the cluster manifolds determined the connection relationship among them so an interactive relationship existed among the well grouping cluster manifold layout and their connection pattern 4 1 optimization of well grouping and cluster manifold layout step 1 establish circular orbits around subsea wells and generate initial clustering centers first the centroid c 0 x 0 y 0 of all subsea wells is calculated as the center of the circular orbit that is 19 x 0 i 1 n x w i n y 0 i 1 n y w i n second find the subsea well that is farthest from the centroid and use the distance l 0 as the radius of the circular orbit finally arrange the initial clustering center that is the cluster manifold on the circular guide orbit its coordinates are m i x m i y m i i 1 2 m in which x m i x 0 l 0 c o s 2 i 1 π d v y m i y 0 l 0 s i n 2 i 1 π d v step 2 distribute the subsea wells to the well group of the nearest cluster manifold first calculate the distance between each subsea well w i i 1 2 n and each cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m that is l ij w i m j b i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m second compare the distance from each well to each cluster manifold for example the distance between well no 2 and all manifolds is l 21 l 22 l 2 m if l 21 is the minimum distance then assign well no 2 w 2 to well group no 1 g 1 in the meantime let b 21 1 and let b 22 b 23 b 2 m equal 0 this results in a new connection between well and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m 20 b b i j n m b 11 b 12 1 0 b 1 m 0 b n 1 b n 2 b n m n m step 3 adjust the position of the cluster manifolds according to the well grouping calculate the centroid c j x j y j j 1 2 m of all wells in each well group g j j 1 2 m in which x j i 1 n x w i b i j i 1 n b i j y j i 1 n y w i b i j i 1 n b i j j 1 2 m this centroid is the new position of the cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m step 4 establish an iteration loop based on step 2 and step 3 if the position of all cluster manifolds has not changed after the adjustment in step 3 stop the loop otherwise continue to run the loop and continuously adjust the position of the cluster manifolds and the well grouping until the position of the cluster manifolds is not changed then calculate the total connection costs from the subsea wells to the cluster manifold that is c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j step 5 further divide the circular orbit and calculate all possible initial cluster center layouts first further bisect the existing circular track that is d v d v 2 d v is the number of points that can be used as initial positions of cluster manifold are obtained that is m p i x p i y p i i 1 2 d v in which x p i x 0 l 0 c o s 2 i 1 π d v y p i y 0 l 0 s i n 2 i 1 π d v second use a simple algorithm to automatically generate all possible initial layout schemes of the cluster manifold and the number of possible initial layout schemes is i d v m d v i m step 6 perform well grouping for each possible initial location layout scheme of cluster manifold in steps 2 4 we optimized the subsea well grouping and cluster manifold layout by unsupervised learning we called the calculation process in steps 2 4 the well grouping calculation because the initial layout schemes of different cluster manifolds may have different optimization design results after completing the well grouping calculation we calculated the well grouping for the initial position of each possible cluster manifold after we carried out the well grouping calculation on the initial location layout schemes for all of the cluster manifolds the total connection between the well and manifold cost for each scheme can be calculated as follows c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j step 7 establish an iteration loop based on step 5 and step 6 first further bisect the existing circular track and calculate all of the possible initial cluster manifold locations second perform the well grouping calculation for the initial position of all of the possible cluster manifolds and calculate the total connection cost of each scheme third compare the minimum value of the total cost of all of the connection schemes according to the minimum total cost of the connection of the previous cycle and terminate the cycle if the minimum value of the total cost of the connection does not change for three consecutive times by default continuing to divide circular tracks would not produce a new optimal design scheme in addition the optimal design scheme corresponding to the connection cost was the optimal well grouping that is the cluster manifold layout scheme if however the total cost changed relative to the previous cycle then the loop would continue to run until the previous termination condition was reached 4 2 optimization of connection schemes between cluster manifolds the overall collaborative optimization algorithm developed in this paper fig 4 produced a new iteration structure which continuously adjusted the wellhead grouping cluster manifold layout and connection relationship between cluster manifolds in numerous iterations this optimization algorithm had three levels corresponding to different calculation accuracies level 1 optimization use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to preliminarily optimize the simple connection scheme of cluster manifold step 1 1 finding candidate points of plem the maximum and minimum abscissa values x m a x and x m i n the maximum and minimum ordinate values y m a x and y m i n of all subsea wellheads were respectively found out the rectangular area composed of the above coordinate values is the optional region of plem the rectangular area was divided into several squares with a length of 0 1 km and the nodes of all the squares were candidate points of plem step 1 2 orderly select a candidate point of plem into the collection v and place the manifolds in the collection u step 1 3 calculate the distance between each manifold in the collection v and each manifold in the collection u select the minimum value of the distance and move the corresponding cluster manifold in the collection u to the collection v step 1 4 repeat step 1 2 until collection u is empty and finally obtain the cluster manifold connection relation matrix step 1 5 repeat step 1 2 step 1 3 and step 1 4 calculate the pipeline length corresponding to all plem candidate points the coordinates of candidate points with the shortest pipeline length are selected as the coordinates of plem and save the cluster manifold connection relation matrix that is b m b m i j m 1 m 1 i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 level 2 optimization adjust the position of cluster manifold according to its connection relationship step 2 1 put all of the other manifolds connected with manifold m i i 1 2 m into the corresponding well group g i step 2 2 calculate the centroids c j x j y j j 1 2 m of all wells and cluster manifolds in well group g i the method of seeking centroids is described above in equation 19 step 2 3 repeat steps 2 1 and 2 2 until the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change level 3 optimization further adjust the grouping scheme of the subsea well the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship between the manifolds step 3 1 calculate the distance l i j between all subsea wells w i i 1 2 n and the cluster manifolds m j j 1 2 m in the adjusted position then compare the distance from each well to each cluster manifold for example the distance between well no 2 and all manifolds is l 21 l 22 l 2 m if l 21 is the minimum distance then assign well no 2 w 2 to well group no 1 g 1 in the meantime let b 21 1 and b 22 b 23 b 2 m equal 0 this results in a new connection between the wellhead and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m step 3 2 transfer the cluster manifold connected to manifold m i to new well group g i then calculate the centroid of g i using the previous method of calculating the centroid to adjust the position of the cluster manifold that is repeat steps 2 1 and 2 2 until the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change step 3 3 continue to adjust the well group and the position of cluster manifold until the scheme converges that is repeat steps 3 1 and 3 2 until the well grouping scheme and the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change step 3 4 use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to adjust the connection scheme between the cluster manifold that is repeat steps 1 1 to step1 5 step 3 5 readjust the division of well groups and the layout scheme of cluster wells that is repeat the level 2 optimization and steps 3 1 to 3 4 until the division of well groups the layout of the cluster manifolds and the connection scheme between cluster manifolds do not change at this point the optimized layout scheme of sps has been obtained 5 verification and comparison 5 1 performance verification of the new algorithm we devised an optimal layout design for a deepwater oilfield with 22 wells using the new algorithm through matlab programming to verify its performance the subsea production well distribution is shown in fig 5 and the well coordinates are given in table 1 this verification was aimed at the shortest pipeline length and the lowest overall cost we carried out different levels of the optimization design for this oilfield fig 6 fig 7 and table 2 show these optimization results because the different optimization objectives did not affect the final result of the level 1 optimization the resulting graph for the level 1 optimization is not shown repeatedly in fig 7 compared with the original level 1 optimization results the level 3 optimization results with pipeline length as the optimization objective effectively reduced the overall length of subsea pipelines and the overall cost of sps because the price of the various pipelines in the sps was different the shortest overall length did not necessarily mean the lowest overall cost in fig 6 the level 1 optimization aimed at the shortest pipeline distance adjusted only the location of the cluster manifold according to the cluster manifold and the subsea wells but it did not adjust the well grouping and the connection relationship between the cluster manifold conversely in fig 7 the level 3 optimization comprehensively adjusted and optimized the well grouping the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship regarding appearance the level 3 optimization design showed a more compact and uniform feature which can greatly reduce the overall cost of the sps in this case the overall cost optimization during iteration process is shown in fig 8 the x axis is the iteration steps and the y axis is the ratio of historical optimal overall cost during current iteration step cc to the final optimized overall cost fc which is defined as cc fc as the number of iterations increase the overall cost gradually decreases until the result of overall cost remain unchanged so that the optimized overall cost is obtained we also conducted case studies for a large deepwater field with 42 subsea wells fig 9 compares the optimized design schemes for six cluster manifolds the scheme on the left is the optimization design result based on the existing optimization method and the scheme on the right hand side is the collaborative optimization result calculated using the new optimization algorithm proposed in this study after comparison it was obvious that the optimization result obtained by the new optimization method was more compact as shown in table 3 compared with the existing optimization design scheme the new scheme did not reduce the overall length of the subsea pipeline but achieved the ultimate goal of reducing overall cost using the layout design with a longer pipeline distance in this scheme well grouping cluster manifold layout and connection scheme between manifolds were not optimal but the overall design scheme after combination achieved the ultimate goal of the lowest cost which was the chief objective of this research that is to achieve overall optimization which minimize the cost several other optimization schemes that were not adopted are shown in fig 10 5 2 case comparison study we used the new optimization algorithm

of the connection relationship among the cluster manifolds this process followed a typical step by step optimization algorithm optimization scheme 1 to contrast previous methods with the proposed method we used the new algorithm to optimize the case study design at three different levels first based on the well grouping applied in previous research we further optimized and adjusted the position and connection mode of the cluster manifold which greatly reduced the pipeline length and overall cost optimization scheme 2 then we used the algorithm to comprehensively optimize the well grouping the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship among the cluster manifolds optimization scheme 3 although the total length of the pipeline increased it effectively reduced the overall cost in summary compared with the existing optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm proposed in this paper was optimized the cost in the well grouping and interconnection between the cluster manifolds and achieved obvious results 6 conclusions this paper proposed an optimal algorithm to determine an optimization scheme design for a well grouping cluster manifold layout

intelligent algorithm layout design unsupervised learning 1 introduction oil production from deepwater fields has experienced consistent growth since 2000 with the maturation of deepwater development concepts deepwater fields have adopted a development mode based on a subsea production system sps at present the deepwater oil field with the largest number of subsea wells is the dalia oil field operated by total in angola which has 78 subsea wells the field however has completed all crude oil processing operations using only one floating production storage and offloading fpso unit this requires a series of sps equipment such as subsea manifold pipeline end terminal plet pipeline end manifold plem and jumper to collect and deliver the crude oil to the fpso growth in the deepwater sector faced significant challenges following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 in this case operators have been forced to reduce costs to adapt to low oil prices thus optimizing the layout of the sps plays a vital role in reducing the facility s construction cost of deepwater oil fields on the basis of the characteristics and development strategies of specific oil and gas fields the layout pattern of various underwater production systems has been formed initially engineers designed the sps but recently an increasing number of sps layout optimization algorithms have been introduced these algorithms primary are used to assist designers in preliminary conceptual design to improve design efficiency the characteristics are reflected in the different connection modes of the underwater wellhead and the manifold and the production platform the four common layout modes are as follows single well tiebacks daisy chain template manifolds and cluster manifolds wang et al 2012 the cluster manifold connection is applicable to almost all of the reservoirs of various sizes and most of the relevant research is based on this layout mode for optimization wang et al 2014a we selected the cluster manifolds with the broadest application prospects as the research object fig 1 shows a typical sps using cluster manifold connection in the layout optimization of the sps based on the position

proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to integrate the optimization of the offshore production system the model defines the number capacity and location of platforms and manifolds as well as the optimal assignment of wells to these facilities while searching for the minimum global investment costs this research has optimized the subsea well grouping cluster manifold layout and connection relationship among cluster manifolds in the sps but the interaction among these three optimization aspects has not been considered comprehensively in this study we established a mathematical model to accurately describe the optimization problems and studied the mechanism of interaction among these optimization problems based on this model finally we developed an optimization algorithm for sps layout to achieve the goal of collaborative optimization we took a deepwater oil field with 22 production wells as an example to analyze and verify the optimization effect and necessity of collaborative optimization finally by comparing our results with the results from the existing optimization method we verified the advanced performance of this new optimization algorithm 2 description of the optimization problem and assumptions 2 1 optimization problem description in the development of deepwater fields with a large number of subsea wells it generally is necessary to connect the subsea wells to multiple cluster manifolds for joint development of the entire oilfield a subsea tree installed on the subsea well is connected to the cluster manifold by the subsea jumper plet subsea pipeline plet subsea jumper cluster manifold connection mode subsea pipelines are used to connect one cluster manifold to another cluster manifold and finally to connect to the fpso the plem is used to optimizing the cluster manifolds layout the cluster manifolds can be directly connected to plem or be connected to plem in series the cluster manifolds be connected in series can reduce the pipeline distance and pigging costs fig 2 shows four well groups which are indicated by dotted lines and each well group includes a cluster manifold and all of the subsea wells connected to it the well locations were fixed before the optimization of sps layout to design the optimum sps layout we optimized the division of the well groups and the connection relationship among the well groups which focused on the following three main problems 1 well grouping allocate subsea wells to appropriate well groups 2 cluster manifolds layout arrange a suitable number of cluster manifolds in a suitable position 3 connection relationship between cluster manifolds connect each cluster manifold in an appropriate form to achieve the goal of reducing the pipeline cost these optimization problems are not three problems in isolation and they affect each other in the optimization process in previous studies the goal of the optimization algorithm was to first optimize the well grouping and cluster manifold layout in coordination and then to optimize the connection relationship between the cluster manifolds on the basis of the previous optimization results neuroth et al 2000 souza and medeiros 2010 gehrlein and pasic 2009 dobersek and goricanec 2009 el mahdy et al 2010 in this study we developed a new optimization algorithm based on the clustering algorithm and minimum spanning tree algorithm for the problems existing in previous research the clustering algorithm is a typical application of unsupervised learning which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets and the minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to optimize the scheme for the connection between manifolds by finding the minimum spanning tree minimum spanning tree is the minimum subsets of edges that can connect all the vertices without forming any cycle and with the minimum total cost we achieved the goal of collaborative optimization for three problems of well grouping cluster manifolds layout and the connection relationship among cluster manifolds and demonstrated that it effectively reduced subsea development costs 2 2 basic assumptions our main purpose was to study the collaborative optimization methods for these three optimization problems to facilitate the establishment of mathematical models and the realization of algorithms this paper simplified some irrelevant conditions and proposed the following basic assumptions 1 seabed topography we assumed that the seabed topography was a flat two dimensional plane there were no restrictions on the design of the malicious terrain and no geopolitical and fishery activities and the position of all subsea equipment was expressed in two dimensional coordinates 2 well slots of cluster manifolds we assumed that the alternative cluster manifold types are 4 slot 6 slot 8 slot 10 slot 12 slot and 14 slot 3 connection mode of subsea equipment we assumed that the connection mode of subsea tree jumper cluster manifold was used when the distance between the well and manifold was less than 100 m whereas the connection mode of subsea tree jumper plet branch pipeline plet jumper cluster manifold was used by default all connections were in a straight line and met the requirements of flow assurance 4 risk assessment we considered the risk assessment of the subsea pipeline and quantified and integrated the risk of subsea pipelines into the overall cost using the accident rate and its maintenance cost 5 cost description the cost in the objective function of this paper considered only the pipeline connection costs of cluster manifold layout and the manufacturing and installation costs of subsea production facilities because the cost of the subsea wellhead and subsea tree did not affect the optimal design of this study the cost did not include these two types of equipment we have considered the pigging by double the length of export pipeline when calculating the overall cost export pipeline refers to the pipeline among manifolds 3 mathematical model 3 1 basic parameters and optimization objectives let the expression of subsea wells be w 1 w 2 w 3 w n in which n is the number of subsea wells and its expression also indicates its coordinates that is w n x w n y w n let the expression of cluster manifolds be m 1 m 2 m m in which m is the number of cluster manifolds and its expression also indicates its coordinates that is m m x m m y m m let the expression of plem be p its coordinates is p x p y p in the construction of the sps each subsea well must be connected to the cluster manifolds so we refer to all of the subsea wells connected to the cluster manifold m m as the well group g m therefore the expression of the well group corresponding to the cluster manifold is g i i 1 2 m in which m is the number of well groups and the number of subsea wells included in the well group is represented by w g 1 w g 2 w g m the clustering center of each well group is the corresponding cluster manifold coordinate that is m i x m i y m i i 1 2 m the value of the number of cluster manifolds m is between the minimum number of cluster manifolds k min and the maximum number of cluster manifolds k max performing an iterative loop on all integers between k min and k max the optimal value of the final iteration result is the optimal number of manifolds as follows 1 k m a x n 4 2 k m i n n 14 where k m a x is the maximum number of cluster manifolds k m i n is the minimum number of cluster manifolds and n is number of subsea wells we set the overall cost of the sps to c m i w g i i 1 2 m that is the cost is related to the number coordinates and combination of the cluster manifolds our optimization objective was to minimize the cost by selecting the optimum number of cluster manifolds well grouping cluster manifold coordinates and cluster manifold combination form then the rough mathematical model of cluster manifold layout and subsea well grouping problem can be expressed in the following optimization problems 3 min m i w g i i 1 2 m c m i w g i i 1 2 m we next established the display expression of the model based on the connection relationship between the subsea wells and the cluster manifolds various constraints and basic assumptions 3 2 connection between subsea well and cluster manifold the grouping problem of subsea wells is a connection problem between the subsea well and cluster manifold to establish a mathematical model we defined a simple and clear connectivity matrix to explain the relationship between subsea well and cluster manifold when assigning a certain number of subsea wells w 1 w 2 w 3 w n to several well groups g 1 g 2 g m n and m represent the number of subsea wells and well groups if the ith subsea well w i i 1 2 n was assigned to the jth well group g j j 1 2 m that is it is connected with the jth cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m binary numbers b i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m can be used to represent their connection relationship as follows 4 b i j 1 w i c o n n e c t i n g w i t h m j 0 w i n o t c o n n e c t i n g w i t h m j because a subsea well can be connected only to a cluster manifold all b i j can fully represent the grouping of the subsea wells that is the connection relationship between the subsea well w i and the cluster manifold m j all the binary numbers b i j can form this connection between the well and the manifold relation matrix that is b b i j n m i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 5 b b i j n m b 11 b 1 m b n 1 b n m n m 3 3 connection relationship between cluster manifolds and plem in a subsea production system cluster manifolds can be connected in series or connected with plem using binary number b m i j i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 to represent the connection relationship between the ith cluster manifold m i i 1 2 m the jth cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m and the plem p all of the binary numbers b m i j can form this connection relation matrix that is b m b m i j m 1 m 1 i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 6 b m b m i j m 1 m 1 b m 1 1 b m 1 m 1 b m m 1 1 b m m 1 m 1 m 1 m 1 3 4 cluster manifold combination form each well group g i i 1 2 m uses different types of cluster manifolds because the commonly used cluster manifold types are only 4 slot 6 slot 8 slot 10 slot 12 slot and 14 slot to facilitate the establishment of the model we set the 4 slot manifold to the 14 slot manifold to be the no 1 manifold to the no 6 manifold use of binary number b s i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 to represent the combination of different types of manifolds indicates the number of no using j manifolds in the ith well group all of the binary numbers b s i j can form the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 7 b s b s i j m 6 b s 11 b s 16 b s m 1 b s m 6 m 6 3 5 cost model using l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m to represent the length between subsea wells w i i 1 2 n and cluster manifolds m j j 1 2 m this paper defined the distance between any two points by euler distance so l i j w i m j b i j we considered the use of the jumper and the plet so the connection cost between subsea wells and cluster manifolds can be represented by c l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 8 c l i j 0 44 0 2 l i j 1 t 0 02 where l i j is the length between subsea well w i and cluster manifold m j and t is production time year all of c l i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m can form the connection between well and manifold cost matrix c l c l i j n m 9 c l

cluster manifolds connection cost matrix c l m c l m i j m m 11 c l m c l m i j m m c l 11 c l 1 m c l m 1 c l m m m m in addition to the connection cost between the subsea wells and the cluster manifold the cost of the cluster manifolds also affects the design of the sps according to the previous concept of setting manifold types for cluster manifolds with different numbers of well slots use m p j j 1 2 6 to represent the cost of the no 1 6 cluster manifolds which include manufacturing costs installation costs and operating costs as follows 12 m p j 4 1 0 02 t j 1 6 1 0 02 t j 2 9 1 0 02

oil fields which belong to china petroleum chemical corporation sinopec use cm to represent the total cost of the cluster manifolds according to the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 i 1 2 m j 1 2 6 7 13 c m i 1 m j 1 6 b s i j m p j where cm is the total cost of the cluster manifolds million usd b s i j is the number of no j manifolds in the ith well group and m p j is the cost of no j cluster manifold according to the connection between well and manifold cost matrix c l c l i j n m and the cluster manifolds connection cost matrix c l m c l m i j m m the total cost between all the subsea equipment can be expressed as follows 14 c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j i 1 m j 1 m c l m i j 3 6 constraints on connection relations and number of well slots when the subsea wells w 1 w 2 w 3 w n are assigned to the well groups g 1 g 2 g m any subsea well must be connected to cluster manifold and it can be connected to only one manifold thus according to the connection between well and manifold relation matrix that is b b i j n m i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 5 set the following constraints 15 j m b i j b i 1 b i 2 b i m 1 according to the engineering practice when selecting manifold well slots one or two well slots need to be reserved for further development at a later stage thus the total number of well slots for each manifold must be greater than the number of wells that is w g i i 1 2 m of its well group on the basis of the cluster manifolds combination matrix that is b s b s i j m 6 set the following constraints 16 w g i j 1 6 2 2 j b s i j we aimed the optimal design of sps at the layout of cluster manifolds and the grouping of subsea wells the basic restriction was that the number of cluster manifolds must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the optimality of the optimization results we did not limit the upper limit of the cluster manifold the restrictions are as follows 17 m 1 and is a positive integer 3 7 mathematical relationships and model establishment of optimization goals according to the previous analysis we transformed the optimization target with the lowest overall cost c into the following mathematical language 18 min c c i 1 n j 1 m c l i j i 1 m j 1 m c l m i j i 1 m j 1 6 b s i j m p j s t j m b i j b i 1 b i 2 b i m 1 w g i j 1 6 2 2 j b s i j m 1 a n d i s a p o s i t i v e i n t e g e r the first and second items on the right side of equation 18 are the overall connection cost and the third item is the overall cost of the cluster manifold to achieve the optimization goal of the lowest overall cost we considered the subsea well grouping the connection relationship with the cluster manifolds the combination form of cluster manifolds and the number of well groups as a whole we also took into account the restrictions in equations 15 17 and eventually formed a connection matrix cluster manifold combination matrix and number of well groups that minimized the overall cost the unknown variables of the new algorithm are the number of cluster manifolds m the connection between well and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m the manifold coordinates m m x m m y m m the plem coordinates p x p y p the connection between the well and the manifold relation matrix b b i j n m and the connection between the manifold and the plem relation matrix b m b m i j m 1 m 1 the lowest overall cost c can be obtained by iterating the above unknown quantities through the algorithm 4 the new algorithm for the layout of sps the previously described relationship among the three optimization problems is shown in fig 3 when optimizing the layout of cluster manifolds we made it as close as possible to each connected subsea well and manifold this ensured that the well grouping and the connection between cluster manifolds affected the layout of the cluster manifold to optimize the well grouping we distributed the wellhead to be the closest to the manifold so it was affected by the layout of cluster manifolds the location of the cluster manifolds determined the connection relationship among them so an interactive relationship existed among the well grouping cluster manifold layout and their connection pattern 4 1 optimization of well grouping and cluster manifold layout step 1 establish circular orbits around subsea wells and generate initial clustering centers first the centroid c 0 x 0 y 0 of all subsea wells is calculated as the center of the circular orbit that is 19 x 0 i 1 n x w i n y 0 i 1 n y w i n second find the subsea well that is farthest from the centroid and use the distance l 0 as the radius of the circular orbit finally arrange the initial clustering center that is the cluster manifold on the circular guide orbit its coordinates are m i x m i y m i i 1 2 m in which x m i x 0 l 0 c o s 2 i 1 π d v y m i y 0 l 0 s i n 2 i 1 π d v step 2 distribute the subsea wells to the well group of the nearest cluster manifold first calculate the distance between each subsea well w i i 1 2 n and each cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m that is l ij w i m j b i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m second compare the distance from each well to each cluster manifold for example the distance between well no 2 and all manifolds is l 21 l 22 l 2 m if l 21 is the minimum distance then assign well no 2 w 2 to well group no 1 g 1 in the meantime let b 21 1 and let b 22 b 23 b 2 m equal 0 this results in a new connection between well and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m 20 b b i j n m b 11 b 12 1 0 b 1 m 0 b n 1 b n 2 b n m n m step 3 adjust the position of the cluster manifolds according to the well grouping calculate the centroid c j x j y j j 1 2 m of all wells in each well group g j j 1 2 m in which x j i 1 n x w i b i j i 1 n b i j y j i 1 n y w i b i j i 1 n b i j j 1 2 m this centroid is the new position of the cluster manifold m j j 1 2 m step 4 establish an iteration loop based on step 2 and step 3 if the position of all cluster manifolds has not changed after the adjustment in step 3 stop the loop otherwise continue to run the loop and continuously adjust the position of the cluster manifolds and the well grouping until the position of the cluster manifolds is not changed then calculate the total connection costs from the subsea wells to the cluster manifold that is c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j step 5 further divide the circular orbit and calculate all possible initial cluster center layouts first further bisect the existing circular track that is d v d v 2 d v is the number of points that can be used as initial positions of cluster manifold are obtained that is m p i x p i y p i i 1 2 d v in which x p i x 0 l 0 c o s 2 i 1 π d v y p i y 0 l 0 s i n 2 i 1 π d v second use a simple algorithm to automatically generate all possible initial layout schemes of the cluster manifold and the number of possible initial layout schemes is i d v m d v i m step 6 perform well grouping for each possible initial location layout scheme of cluster manifold in steps 2 4 we optimized the subsea well grouping and cluster manifold layout by unsupervised learning we called the calculation process in steps 2 4 the well grouping calculation because the initial layout schemes of different cluster manifolds may have different optimization design results after completing the well grouping calculation we calculated the well grouping for the initial position of each possible cluster manifold after we carried out the well grouping calculation on the initial location layout schemes for all of the cluster manifolds the total connection between the well and manifold cost for each scheme can be calculated as follows c l i 1 n j 1 m c l i j step 7 establish an iteration loop based on step 5 and step 6 first further bisect the existing circular track and calculate all of the possible initial cluster manifold locations second perform the well grouping calculation for the initial position of all of the possible cluster manifolds and calculate the total connection cost of each scheme third compare the minimum value of the total cost of all of the connection schemes according to the minimum total cost of the connection of the previous cycle and terminate the cycle if the minimum value of the total cost of the connection does not change for three consecutive times by default continuing to divide circular tracks would not produce a new optimal design scheme in addition the optimal design scheme corresponding to the connection cost was the optimal well grouping that is the cluster manifold layout scheme if however the total cost changed relative to the previous cycle then the loop would continue to run until the previous termination condition was reached 4 2 optimization of connection schemes between cluster manifolds the overall collaborative optimization algorithm developed in this paper fig 4 produced a new iteration structure which continuously adjusted the wellhead grouping cluster manifold layout and connection relationship between cluster manifolds in numerous iterations this optimization algorithm had three levels corresponding to different calculation accuracies level 1 optimization use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to preliminarily optimize the simple connection scheme of cluster manifold step 1 1 finding candidate points of plem the maximum and minimum abscissa values x m a x and x m i n the maximum and minimum ordinate values y m a x and y m i n of all subsea wellheads were respectively found out the rectangular area composed of the above coordinate values is the optional region of plem the rectangular area was divided into several squares with a length of 0 1 km and the nodes of all the squares were candidate points of plem step 1 2 orderly select a candidate point of plem into the collection v and place the manifolds in the collection u step 1 3 calculate the distance between each manifold in the collection v and each manifold in the collection u select the minimum value of the distance and move the corresponding cluster manifold in the collection u to the collection v step 1 4 repeat step 1 2 until collection u is empty and finally obtain the cluster manifold connection relation matrix step 1 5 repeat step 1 2 step 1 3 and step 1 4 calculate the pipeline length corresponding to all plem candidate points the coordinates of candidate points with the shortest pipeline length are selected as the coordinates of plem and save the cluster manifold connection relation matrix that is b m b m i j m 1 m 1 i 1 2 m 1 j 1 2 m 1 level 2 optimization adjust the position of cluster manifold according to its connection relationship step 2 1 put all of the other manifolds connected with manifold m i i 1 2 m into the corresponding well group g i step 2 2 calculate the centroids c j x j y j j 1 2 m of all wells and cluster manifolds in well group g i the method of seeking centroids is described above in equation 19 step 2 3 repeat steps 2 1 and 2 2 until the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change level 3 optimization further adjust the grouping scheme of the subsea well the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship between the manifolds step 3 1 calculate the distance l i j between all subsea wells w i i 1 2 n and the cluster manifolds m j j 1 2 m in the adjusted position then compare the distance from each well to each cluster manifold for example the distance between well no 2 and all manifolds is l 21 l 22 l 2 m if l 21 is the minimum distance then assign well no 2 w 2 to well group no 1 g 1 in the meantime let b 21 1 and b 22 b 23 b 2 m equal 0 this results in a new connection between the wellhead and manifold relation matrix b b i j n m step 3 2 transfer the cluster manifold connected to manifold m i to new well group g i then calculate the centroid of g i using the previous method of calculating the centroid to adjust the position of the cluster manifold that is repeat steps 2 1 and 2 2 until the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change step 3 3 continue to adjust the well group and the position of cluster manifold until the scheme converges that is repeat steps 3 1 and 3 2 until the well grouping scheme and the coordinates of the cluster manifold do not change step 3 4 use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to adjust the connection scheme between the cluster manifold that is repeat steps 1 1 to step1 5 step 3 5 readjust the division of well groups and the layout scheme of cluster wells that is repeat the level 2 optimization and steps 3 1 to 3 4 until the division of well groups the layout of the cluster manifolds and the connection scheme between cluster manifolds do not change at this point the optimized layout scheme of sps has been obtained 5 verification and comparison 5 1 performance verification of the new algorithm we devised an optimal layout design for a deepwater oilfield with 22 wells using the new algorithm through matlab programming to verify its performance the subsea production well distribution is shown in fig 5 and the well coordinates are given in table 1 this verification was aimed at the shortest pipeline length and the lowest overall cost we carried out different levels of the optimization design for this oilfield fig 6 fig 7 and table 2 show these optimization results because the different optimization objectives did not affect the final result of the level 1 optimization the resulting graph for the level 1 optimization is not shown repeatedly in fig 7 compared with the original level 1 optimization results the level 3 optimization results with pipeline length as the optimization objective effectively reduced the overall length of subsea pipelines and the overall cost of sps because the price of the various pipelines in the sps was different the shortest overall length did not necessarily mean the lowest overall cost in fig 6 the level 1 optimization aimed at the shortest pipeline distance adjusted only the location of the cluster manifold according to the cluster manifold and the subsea wells but it did not adjust the well grouping and the connection relationship between the cluster manifold conversely in fig 7 the level 3 optimization comprehensively adjusted and optimized the well grouping the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship regarding appearance the level 3 optimization design showed a more compact and uniform feature which can greatly reduce the overall cost of the sps in this case the overall cost optimization during iteration process is shown in fig 8 the x axis is the iteration steps and the y axis is the ratio of historical optimal overall cost during current iteration step cc to the final optimized overall cost fc which is defined as cc fc as the number of iterations increase the overall cost gradually decreases until the result of overall cost remain unchanged so that the optimized overall cost is obtained we also conducted case studies for a large deepwater field with 42 subsea wells fig 9 compares the optimized design schemes for six cluster manifolds the scheme on the left is the optimization design result based on the existing optimization method and the scheme on the right hand side is the collaborative optimization result calculated using the new optimization algorithm proposed in this study after comparison it was obvious that the optimization result obtained by the new optimization method was more compact as shown in table 3 compared with the existing optimization design scheme the new scheme did not reduce the overall length of the subsea pipeline but achieved the ultimate goal of reducing overall cost using the layout design with a longer pipeline distance in this scheme well grouping cluster manifold layout and connection scheme between manifolds were not optimal but the overall design scheme after combination achieved the ultimate goal of the lowest cost which was the chief objective of this research that is to achieve overall optimization which minimize the cost several other optimization schemes that were not adopted are shown in fig 10 5 2 case comparison study we used the new optimization algorithm to compare the case study with the step by step optimization method used in previous research wang et al 2012 as shown in fig 11 and table 4 this study optimized the design of an sps for a deepwater oil field with 20 subsea wells in west africa according to this optimization method we first determined the location of cluster manifolds and well grouping and then on this basis optimized the design of the connection relationship among the cluster manifolds this process followed a typical step by step optimization algorithm optimization scheme 1 to contrast previous methods with the proposed method we used the new algorithm to optimize the case study design at three different levels first based on the well grouping applied in previous research we further optimized and adjusted the position and connection mode of the cluster manifold which greatly reduced the pipeline length and overall cost optimization scheme 2 then we used the algorithm to comprehensively optimize the well grouping the location of the cluster manifold and the connection relationship among the cluster manifolds optimization scheme 3 although the total length of the pipeline increased it effectively reduced the overall cost in summary compared with the existing optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm proposed in this paper was optimized the cost in the well grouping and interconnection between the cluster manifolds and achieved obvious results 6 conclusions this paper proposed an optimal algorithm to determine an optimization scheme design for a well grouping cluster manifold layout and connection relation between manifolds in the sps this paper considered the cost of subsea pipes cluster manifolds plets and jumpers and established a mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of sps we solved this model according to a newly developed algorithm that collaboratively optimized different optimization problems finally this study considered different deepwater oil fields as examples and devised an optimal layout the proposed algorithm lowered the total cost when compared with that of previous methods we formed the following conclusions 1 when optimizing the layout of sps multiple optimization problems had to be considered for collaborative optimization 2 level 1 to level 3 optimization gradually expanded the scope of collaborative optimization among these levels level 3 optimization reduced the overall cost most effectively future research also will consider the reservoir physical properties crude oil physical properties marine environment and platform topside as well as other influencing factors to more comprehensively optimize the overall sps layout also it will be necessary to optimize the algorithm s programming and

20726,the oscillating buoy wave energy converter obwec is a popular and widely used wave energy converter wec due to the simplicity of its structure and its strong adaptability in this paper the haiyuan no 1 obwec is taken as the research object in which the buoys adopt heave mode of motion in order to further enhance the hydrodynamic performance of the buoys an improved scheme with

energy and increasingly serious environmental pollution the importance of developing and utilizing renewable energy has become increasingly obvious among the many renewable energy sources wave energy has attracted a lot of interest due to its clean renewable and huge reserves as a result the extraction of energy from wave has become an important research direction in the field of ocean engineering pérez et al 2015 gielen et al 2019 so far various wecs have been developed and some examples include pendulum wecs raft wecs constricted channel wecs oscillating water column wecs and obwecs antonio 2010 rusu and onea 2018 amongst these available wecs the obwec has a very broad development prospect due to its small occupied sea area strong adaptability lower construction costs maintenance costs and construction difficulty compared to other wecs shi et al 2016 however low energy conversion efficiency and high construction and maintenance costs are still vital factors restricting the large scale utilization of obwecs cordonnier et al 2015 therefore it is becoming more and more important to improve the energy conversion efficiency by improving wecs the obwec is mainly composed of buoys connecting rods hydraulic transmission systems hydraulic motors generators and protection devices at present the buoys of most obwecs adopt the form of heave motion some typical examples include the aquabuoy device weinstein et al 2004 the archimedes wave swing device souza de prado et al 2006 the double body heave system weber et al 2009 the l 10 wec elwood et al 2009 the powerbuoy device edwards and mekhiche 2013 the 10 kw obwec li et al 2013 the 120 kw full hydraulic obwec zhang et al 2017 obwec with buoys employing heave motion has a simple structure and strong adaptability to the wave propagation direction so they are rugged silva et al 2013 however in actual sea conditions when the buoy is freely placed on the water surface under the action of waves it will have a complex movement of six degrees of freedom mccormick 1981 for translational degrees of freedom the buoy is dominated by heave motion for the degree of freedom of rotation the buoy is dominated by pitching therefore when the buoy is placed facing the wave the movement of the buoy is mainly manifested in heaving and pitching if the buoy adopts heave motion its pitching motion becomes constrained so that a part of the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy is inevitably lost evans 1976 used the regular wave to study the heave motion characteristics of the cylinder and found that the maximum capture width ratio of a cylinder operating in one mode of motion would not exceed 50 qiu et al 2013 designed a pendulum wec based on the motion characteristics of water particles in the wave the capture width ratio of the device reached 60 by optimizing the pendulum wec wave energy is composed of two parts fluid potential energy and fluid kinetic energy therefore both the heaving and pitching motion of the buoy must be used reasonably to improve the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy at present among the available obwecs there are few studies on the longitudinal swing motion of the buoy and the comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic performance differences of the buoy under heaving and longitudinal swing haiyuan no 1 is a self raising obwec independently developed by zhejiang ocean university and its buoy adopts heave motion along the pile foot as shown in fig 1 a the platform completed its sea trial in dongsha sea area of zhoushan city zhejiang province china in 2015 lyu et al 2015 it operated 165 days without faults and its average total energy conversion efficiency is 16 4 this paper improves the motion form of the buoy of the haiyuan no 1 obwec through theoretical analysis then an improvement scheme for the longitudinal swing motion of the buoy is proposed and the physical model of the longitudinal swing structure of the buoy is established as shown in fig 1 b in the two structures although the motion form of the buoy is different they all use the up and down movement of the buoy under the action of waves to push the hydraulic cylinder above the platform to do work as shown in fig 2 in this work buoy 1 represents the buoy for heave motion and buoy 2 represents the buoy for longitudinal swing motion their working principle can be simplified to the following processes firstly the buoy moves up and down under the action of the wave this process converts the wave energy into the buoy s mechanical energy then the connecting rod connected with the buoy pushes the piston rod in the hydraulic transmission system to reciprocate this process converts the mechanical energy into hydraulic energy finally the hydraulic motor drives the generator to work this process converts hydraulic energy into electrical energy in this paper a two dimensional nwt model is established using the adina software to study the hydrodynamic performance differences of the buoy under two different motion forms heaving and longitudinal swing the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 analyzes the wave motion characteristics and then combines the buoy s motion characteristics of the haiyuan no 1 obwec to propose an improvement scheme of the buoy adopting longitudinal swing motion section 3 uses the adina software to establish a two dimensional nwt model section 4 introduces the physical model experiments which validate the consistency of the numerical results section 5 uses regular wave data to analyze and compare the hydrodynamic performance differences between the two buoys section 6 uses the irregular wave data obtained during the sea trial of haiyuan no 1 to analyze and compare the hydrodynamic performance differences between the two buoys section 7 draws the conclusion of the paper 2 improvement scheme design 2 1 theoretical analysis the schematic diagram of the airy wave is shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a xoz cartesian coordinate system is established with the horizontal direction as the x axis and the vertical direction as the z axis for the airy wave the wave surface equation can be expressed as komar and gaughan 1973 1 η h 2 cos k x ω t where h is the incident wave height ω is the angular frequency t is the time and k is the number of waves the above equation meets the following three conditions 1 free water surface boundary condition z 0 2 g φ z 2 φ t 2 0 2 laplace equation 3 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ z 2 0 3 seabed boundary condition z d 4 u z z d φ z z d 0 bringing equation 1 into equations 2 3 and 4 respectively the airy wave velocity potential can be written as 5 φ g h 2 ω cosh k z d cosh k d sin k x ω t according to the relationship between velocity and velocity potential the velocity distribution of the flow field can be obtained as follows 6 u φ x g h k 2 ω cosh k z d cosh k d cos k x ω t 7 a u t g h k 2 cosh k z d cosh k d sin k x ω t where u is the horizontal fluid speed a is the horizontal fluid acceleration d is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration according to morrison s equation morison et al 1950 at any height z the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy per unit height can be expressed as 8 f x f d f i 1 2 c d ρ a u u c m ρ v a where f d is the horizontal drag force f i is the horizontal inertia force c d is the horizontal drag coefficient a is the projected area of the buoy in the horizontal direction per unit height c m is mass coefficient and v is the drainage volume of the buoy per unit height the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy within the height of d z is 9 d f x d f d d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u u d z c m ρ π d 2 4 a d z where d is the diameter of the buoy therefore the total horizontal wave force acting on the buoy can be simplified as 10 f x f d f i z η f x d z c d ρ g d h 2 2 k 1 cos θ cos θ c m ρ g π h d 2 8 k 2 sin θ where k 1 2 k η z sh 2 k η sh 2 k z 8 sh 2 k d k 2 sh k η sh k z ch k d and θ k x ω t at any phase the total horizontal wave force acting on the buoy can be expressed as 11 f x f d max cos θ cos θ f i max sin θ where f d max is the maximum horizontal drag force and f i max is the maximum horizontal inertial force from equation 11 it can be seen that when the buoy is at the wave crest the direction of the horizontal wave force is to the right and when the buoy is at the wave trough the direction of the horizontal wave force is to the left this is shown in fig 4 if the buoy adopts heave motion the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy will be offset by the above constraints therefore compared to the heave motion in theory if the buoy adopts longitudinal swing motion the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy will be utilized which can effectively increase the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy 2 2 calculation of optimized target parameters the optimized target parameters in this work are the average output power p b of the buoy and the capture width ratio β the average output power p b of the buoy can be calculated according to shi et al 2019 12 p b t 1 t 2 c v 2 d t t 2 t 1 13 c α ρ g d t 2 π where c is the pto damping coefficient v is the heave speed of the buoy ρ is the fluid density t 1 and t 2 are any two moments for which t 2 t 1 n t where n is an integer t is the wave period and α is the adjustment coefficient the expression for the buoy s capture width ratio β is 14 β p b p w a v e where p w a v e is the average power of the wave incident on the buoy which can be written as follows 15 p wave 1 32 π ρ g 2 h 2 t d 981 h 2 t d 3 numerical model set up 3 1 governing equation the 2d nwt is built by using the adina software the unsteady and incompressible flow field can be described by the continuity equation and the navier stokes equation as follows girault and raviart 2012 16 u i x i 0 17 u i t u j u i x j x j u u t u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j 1 ρ p x i where u i is the velocity component at time t μ is the dynamic viscosity u t is the eddy viscosity p is the fluid pressure and u i u j represents the reynolds stresses 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the heave and longitudinal swing structure model of the buoy is established by using the structure module in adina and the flow field model is established by using the cfd module the schematic diagram of the computational domain is shown in fig 5 the left side is set to the incident wave boundary and the right side is set to the fixed wall boundary the top is set to the air and the bottom is set to the fluid the horizontal and vertical grid resolutions of the flow field are set to δ x l 100 l is the wave length and δ z h 20 respectively the initial time step is set to 0 002 s to ensure that the implicit solver has sufficient time accuracy han et al 2018 3 3 pto loading the movement of the buoy is hindered by a pto damping force which acts vertically on the center of the upper surface of the buoy the linear pto force can be expressed as 18 f p t o c v 4 model test through the physical model experiments the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model was verified and the movement characteristics of the buoy under the linear pto damping are obtained 4 1 model set up physical model experiments are carried out in zhejiang provincial key laboratory in zhejiang ocean university in china the wave tank has a length of 130 m a width of 6 m and a water depth of 3 5 m one end of the wave tank is equipped with a hydraulic swing wave maker and the other end is equipped with a sponge layer wave eliminator the buoy is 30 m away from the wave maker under the action of both the sponge layer and the larger distance i e 100 m from the buoy to the end of the wave tank the influence of reflected waves on the buoy can be ignored the incident wave height at the position of the buoy is measured by the wave height recorder when no buoy is installed in the wave tank fig 6 a is the improved physical model of the haiyuan no 1 obwec the platform is fixed in the wave tank by means of a tripod the buoy is connected to the rocker and the other end of the rocker is fixed to the platform by a hinge fig 6 b is a wave tank fig 6 c is the buoy structure with a width of 2 m a draft of 1 m and a freeboard of 0 5 m the mass and draft of the buoy can be changed by adding water to the inside of the buoy fig 6 d is a schematic diagram of the link between the buoy and the hydraulic cylinder the lower end of the hydraulic cylinder is linked to the center of the upper surface of the buoy 4 2 numerical results validation in the regular wave the motion equation of the buoy is given as 19 j j a d d θ τ w a v e τ g τ p t o where j is the moment of inertia of the buoy and arm j a d d is the additional moment of inertia due to the movement of the buoy θ is the angular acceleration of the buoy movement τ w a v e is the torque due to the wave buoy interaction τ g is the torque due to gravity and τ p t o is the torque due to the pto system to the buoy the time process of wave surface motion at the position of buoy 2 between the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 7 a when no buoy is installed in the wave tank in the numerical simulation the size of the nwt is set to be the same as the experimental one the incident wave height h and wave period t are set to 0 4 m and 3 s respectively it can be seen that the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement which prove the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model fig 7 b shows the comparison of the heave amplitude h s of buoy 2 between the numerical and experimental results when pto damping is 0 n s m in the numerical simulation the sizes of the buoy and wave tank are set to be the same as that of the experiment the incident wave height and wave period are as the above as the draft of buoy 2 changes from 0 5 m to 0 9 m the heave amplitude of buoy 2 increases from 0 32 m to 0 39 m in both the numerical and experimental results it can be seen that the relative error between the numerical and experimental results is below 5 this shows that there is a good consonance between the numerical and experimental results kim et al 1999 5 results and discussion of regular wave test 5 1 determination of natural vibration period of the buoy the wec needs to utilize the resonance between the buoy and the wave to increase the conversion efficiency so it is very important to determine the buoy s natural vibration period the natural vibration period of simple geometries can be estimated by the empirical formula however for the natural vibration period of complex geometries the empirical formula could be difficult this paper used a numerical method to roughly determine the natural vibration period of the buoy firstly the buoy is placed statically on the surface wave of the nwt and given the buoy an initial velocity in the z direction to get the free attenuation curve of the buoy according to the free attenuation curve the natural vibration period of the buoy can then be calculated as can be seen from fig 8 the natural vibration period of buoy 1 is about 3 4 s and the natural vibration period of buoy 2 is about 4 2 s 5 2 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy without pto damping heave rao is the ratio of buoy s heave amplitude to its wave height the effect of different wave periods on the heave rao of buoy 1 and buoy 2 without pto damping is studied through numerical simulations it can be seen from fig 9 a that as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 1 first increases and then decreases and finally it remains at about 1 when the wave period is 3 4 s i e close to the natural vibration period of buoy 1 the heave rao of buoy 1 reaches its maximum as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 2 also first increases and then it decreases when the wave period is 4 2 s i e close to the natural vibration period of buoy 2 the growth rate of the heave rao of buoy 2 starts to slow down when the wave period is about 5 s the heave rao of buoy 2 reaches its maximum after that as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 2 gradually decreases and it is always greater than 1 when the wave period is less than 3 7 s the heave rao of buoy 1 is greater than that of buoy 2 when the wave period is greater than 3 7 s the heave rao of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 fig 9 b shows the effects of the wavelength buoy s diameter and wave period on the ratio of heave rao of buoy 2 to buoy 1 as the wavelength buoy s diameter increases the ratio of heave rao of buoy 2 to buoy 1 firstly increases and then it decreases generally when the wavelength buoy s diameter is less than 4 5 the ratio remains unchanged when the wavelength buoy s diameter is in the range of 4 5 10 the ratio increases rapidly to a maximum of 1 9 when the wavelength buoy s diameter is greater than 10 the ratio begins to decrease but it is still greater than 1 the common wave period in coastal areas of zhoushan china is 4 s 8 s the wavelength range is 40 m 100 m and the diameter of the buoy is usually less than 5 m in practical applications therefore according to the above study on the heave rao of the buoy without pto damping force it can be concluded that the buoy adopting longitudinal swing motion has more advantages than heave motion 5 3 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy under different wave periods through regular wave numerical simulations the effects of different wave periods on the dynamic performance differences of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are studied under linear pto damping when the pto damping force and the buoyancy force received by the buoy are of the same order of magnitude the capture width ratio of the buoy is close to the maximum therefore according to equation 10 the pto damping c is set to 5000 n s m and the capture width ratio of the buoy under different wave periods is obtained as can be seen from fig 10 a as the wave period increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then decreases under the same wave period the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 occurs when the wave period is about 3 4 s and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 occurs when the wave period is about 4 2 s the wave period is the same as the natural vibration period of the buoy without pto damping when the maximum capture width ratio of the buoy appears which indicates that the occurrence of pto damping will not change the natural vibration period of the buoy and the resonance effect between the buoy and the wave can increase the capture width ratio of the buoy as can be seen from fig 10 b as the wave period increases the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 increases first and then it decreases when the wave period is less than 5 s the ratio gradually increases with the increase of the wave period and the at maximum it reaches 2 4 which suggests that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is 2 4 times that of buoy 1 at most when the wave period is greater than 5 s the ratio gradually decreases as the wave period increases but it is still much greater than 1 the above conclusions indicate that the wave period has a great influence on the buoy s capture width ratio it is generally known that the larger the wave period the larger the corresponding wavelength for a buoy with a fixed specification when the wave period is large the wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the buoy for this case the time for the buoy to move up and down for one cycle will increase thereby reducing the average output power of the buoy therefore when the wave period is large an increase in the capture width ratio can be achieved by increasing the diameter of the buoy in addition when the wave period is close to the buoy s natural vibration period the buoy s capture width ratio is the largest hence in different sea areas it is possible to increase the capture width ratio of the buoy by adjusting the natural frequency of the buoy to make it as close as possible to the wave period which occurs most frequently in the sea area on the whole under the same pto damping coefficient the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is better than that of buoy 1 5 4 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy under different linear pto damping coefficients in order to further study the hydrodynamic performance differences between buoy 1 and buoy 2 the natural vibration periods of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are selected as wave periods respectively the effects of different pto damping coefficients on the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 and buoy 2 under resonance conditions are studied to obtain the variation law of the buoy s capture width ratio with respect to the pto damping coefficient as can be seen from fig 11 a when the wave period is 3 4 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then it decreases when c 10000 n s m the capture width ratio of buoy 2 reaches its maximum value when c 5000 n s m the capture width ratio of buoy 1 reaches its maximum value the maximum capture width ratios of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are 24 3 and 39 0 respectively as can be seen from fig 11 b when the wave period is 3 4 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 gradually increases when the pto damping coefficient is less than 2000 n s m the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 is less than 1 which shows that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 is greater than that of buoy 2 under this condition however due to the relatively small capture width ratio of buoy 1 and buoy 2 it is not suitable for practical applications when the pto damping coefficient c is greater than 2000 n s m the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 is greater than 1 and the maximum ratio is 2 4 this shows that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is better than that of buoy 1 under this condition and as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio gradually increases within a certain range as can be seen from fig 12 a when the wave period is 4 2 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then it decreases under the same pto damping coefficient the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is always greater than that of buoy 1 when the pto damping coefficient c is 7500 n s m the capture width ratios of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 reach their maxima the maximum capture width ratios of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are 20 2 and 41 4 respectively as can be seen from fig 12 b when the wave period is 4 2 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio of the capture width of buoy 2 to buoy 1 gradually increases and the ratio is greater than 2 for this case the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is much greater than buoy 1 the above conclusions indicate that the pto damping coefficient has a great influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy and the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponding to the buoy under different wave periods will change therefore in order to maximize the capture width ratio of the buoy the pto damping coefficient acting on the buoy should be adjusted under different wave periods on the whole regardless of whether the wave period is 3 4 s or 4 2 s the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 which indicates that the buoy adopting the form of longitudinal swing motion can effectively improve the hydrodynamic performance compared to heave motion 6 results and discussion of the irregular wave test 6 1 irregular wave parameter selection in the numerical simulation of irregular waves the wave parameters used are the real wave data of the haiyuan no 1 obwec during the sea trial irregular waves can be regarded as the superposition of several regular waves in this paper the jonswap spectrum is selected as the target spectrum which can be expressed as follows goda 1999 20 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ

wave period respectively f is the wave frequency and γ is the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 since the haiyuan no 1 obwec is installed in the offshore waters the wave propagation direction is relatively consistent so in this paper only the impact of unidirectional irregular waves on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy is studied 6 2 results and discussion the effective wave height h 1 3 in irregular waves is the average value of the maximum one third wave height and the effective wave period t 1 3 is the average value of the maximum one third wave period in the irregular wave test three groups of different irregular wave conditions are selected the test wave conditions are shown in table 1 the pto damping coefficients range from 2500 n s m to 25000 n s m for each group of the test wave conditions it can be seen from fig 13 that in the first group of irregular wave conditions as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 first increases and then it decreases also from fig 13 the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is always greater than that of buoy 1 under the same pto damping coefficient the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 27 15 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 17 92 in other groups of irregular wave conditions the trend of the variation of the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 is the same as that of the first group of irregular wave conditions in the second group of irregular wave conditions the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 24 12 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 16 37 in the third group of irregular wave conditions the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 18 22 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 10 95 in general wecs exhibit lower performance for irregular waves in comparison to regular waves the following reasons are why the buoy s capture width ratio is relatively small han et al 2018 schay et al 2013 1 the difference between the buoy s natural vibration period and the wave period is large which makes it difficult to form a resonance between the buoy and the wave 2 the selection of the pto damping coefficient is not optimal 3 the ratio of the wavelength to the buoy s diameter is too large or too small so there is mismatch between wavelength and buoy s diameter as the effective wave period increases the maximum capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 gradually decreases which is also consistent with the trend of change in fig 10 the above conclusions show that under the action of irregular waves the buoy adopting the form of longitudinal swing motion is more effective in improving the hydrodynamic performance compared to the buoy adopting the form of heave motion and the performance improvement is generally more than 50 7 conclusions in this paper a two dimensional nwt is established by adina to compare and analyze the hydrodynamic performance difference of the buoy under two different motion forms heaving and longitudinal swing to verify the accuracy of the numerical results a physical model experiment is conducted at zhejiang ocean university in china through the comparative analysis of the results of both numerical simulations and physical model experiments the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model is verified in addition the hydrodynamic performance difference of the buoy under two different motion forms i e heaving and longitudinal swing is obtained through the numerical simulation of regular waves and irregular waves based on the above numerical simulation results the following conclusions are drawn 1 the natural vibration period of the buoy has a huge influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy whether it is buoy 1 or buoy 2 the maximum capture width ratio of the buoy always occurs when the natural vibration period of the buoy and the wave period are the same therefore in different sea areas it is possible to increase the capture width ratio of the buoy by adjusting the natural vibration frequency of the buoy to make it as close as possible to the wave period which occurs most frequently in the sea area 2 the wave period has a huge influence on the capture width ratio of the buoy it is generally known that the larger the wave period the larger the corresponding wavelength for a buoy with a fixed specification when the wave period is large the wave length is much larger than the diameter of the buoy at this instance the time for the buoy to move up and down for one cycle increases which will reduce the average output power of the buoy therefore when the wave period is large an increase in the capture width ratio can be achieved by increasing the diameter of the buoy 3 the pto damping coefficient has a huge influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy and the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponding to the buoy under different wave periods will change therefore the pto damping coefficient acting on the buoy should be adjusted under different wave periods to maximize the capture width ratio of the buoy in addition the presence of pto damping does not change the natural vibration period of the buoy 4 in the regular wave test within the range of 2 s 10 s wave period for a wave period of t 3 4 s the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 is at its best however its hydrodynamic performance is still generally lower than that of buoy 2 for a wave period of t 4 2 s the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is at its best and its hydrodynamic performance is generally twice that of buoy 1 for other wave periods the hydrodynamic performance difference between buoy 2 and buoy 1 is between that of the above two wave periods 5 in the irregular wave test the capture width ratios of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increase first and then it decrease as the pto damping coefficient increases under the same pto damping coefficient the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is generally 50 higher than that of buoy 1 the above conclusions indicate that the buoy adopting the longitudinal swing motion can effectively increase the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy compared to when the heave motion is employed the conclusions of this paper can provide guidance for the design improvement of the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy these devices can be deployed in arrays or farms in the future in order to be commercially viable in the future the interaction between buoys after deployment in arrays or farms will be further studied credit authorship contribution

20726,the oscillating buoy wave energy converter obwec is a popular and widely used wave energy converter wec due to the simplicity of its structure and its strong adaptability in this paper the

energy and increasingly serious environmental pollution the importance of developing and utilizing renewable energy has become increasingly obvious among the many renewable energy sources wave energy has attracted a lot of interest due to its clean renewable and huge reserves as a result the extraction of energy from wave has become an important research direction in the field of ocean engineering pérez et al 2015 gielen et al 2019 so far various wecs have been developed and some examples include pendulum wecs raft wecs constricted channel wecs oscillating water column wecs and obwecs antonio 2010 rusu and onea 2018 amongst these available wecs the obwec has a very broad development prospect due to its small occupied sea area strong adaptability lower construction costs maintenance costs and construction difficulty compared to other wecs shi et al 2016 however low energy conversion efficiency and high construction and maintenance costs are still vital factors restricting the large scale utilization of obwecs cordonnier et al 2015 therefore it is becoming more and more important to improve the energy conversion efficiency by improving wecs the obwec is mainly composed of buoys connecting rods hydraulic transmission systems hydraulic motors generators and protection devices at present the buoys of most obwecs adopt the form of heave motion some typical examples include the aquabuoy device weinstein et al 2004 the archimedes wave swing device souza de prado et al 2006 the double body heave system weber et al 2009 the l 10 wec elwood et al 2009 the powerbuoy device edwards and mekhiche 2013 the 10 kw obwec li et al 2013 the 120 kw full hydraulic obwec zhang et al 2017 obwec with buoys employing heave motion has a simple structure and strong adaptability to the wave propagation direction so they are rugged silva et al 2013 however in actual sea conditions when the buoy is freely placed on the water surface under the action of waves it will have a complex movement of six degrees of freedom mccormick 1981 for translational degrees of freedom the buoy is dominated by heave motion for the degree of freedom of rotation the buoy is dominated by pitching therefore when the buoy is placed facing the wave the movement of the buoy is mainly manifested in heaving and pitching if the buoy adopts heave motion its pitching motion becomes constrained so that a part of the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy is inevitably lost evans 1976 used the regular wave to study the heave motion characteristics of the cylinder and found that the maximum capture width ratio of a cylinder operating in one mode of motion would not exceed 50 qiu et al 2013 designed a pendulum wec based on the motion characteristics of water particles in the wave the capture width ratio of the device reached 60 by optimizing the pendulum wec wave energy is composed of two parts fluid potential energy and fluid kinetic energy therefore both the heaving and pitching motion of the buoy must be used reasonably to improve the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy at present among the available obwecs there are few studies on the longitudinal swing motion of the buoy and the comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic performance differences of the buoy under heaving and longitudinal swing haiyuan no 1 is a self raising obwec independently developed by zhejiang ocean university and its buoy adopts heave motion along the pile foot as shown in fig 1 a the platform completed its sea trial in dongsha sea area of zhoushan city zhejiang province china in 2015 lyu et al 2015 it operated 165 days without faults and its average total energy conversion efficiency is 16 4 this paper improves the motion form of the buoy of the haiyuan no 1 obwec through theoretical analysis then an improvement scheme for the longitudinal swing motion of the buoy is proposed and the physical model of the longitudinal swing structure of the buoy is established as shown in fig 1 b in the two structures although the motion form of the buoy is different they all use the up and down movement of the buoy under the action of waves to push the hydraulic cylinder above the platform to do work as shown in fig 2 in this work buoy 1 represents the buoy for heave motion and buoy 2 represents the buoy for longitudinal swing motion their working principle can be simplified to the following processes firstly the buoy moves up and down under the action of the wave this process converts the wave energy into the buoy s mechanical energy then the connecting rod connected with the buoy pushes the piston rod in the hydraulic transmission system to reciprocate this process converts the mechanical energy into hydraulic energy finally the hydraulic motor drives the generator to work this process converts hydraulic energy into electrical energy in this paper a two dimensional nwt model is established using the adina software to study the hydrodynamic performance differences of the buoy under two different motion forms heaving and longitudinal swing the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 analyzes the wave motion characteristics and then combines the buoy s motion characteristics of the haiyuan no 1 obwec to propose an improvement scheme of the buoy adopting longitudinal swing motion section 3 uses the adina software to establish a two dimensional nwt model section 4 introduces the physical model experiments which validate the consistency of the numerical results section 5 uses regular wave data to analyze and compare the hydrodynamic performance differences between the two buoys section 6 uses the irregular wave data obtained during the sea trial of haiyuan no 1 to analyze and compare the hydrodynamic performance differences between the two buoys section 7 draws the conclusion of the paper 2 improvement scheme design 2 1 theoretical analysis the schematic diagram of the airy wave is shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a xoz cartesian coordinate system is established with the horizontal direction as the x axis and the vertical direction as the z axis for the airy wave the wave surface equation can be expressed as komar and gaughan 1973 1 η h 2 cos k x ω t where h is the incident wave height ω is the angular frequency t is the time and k is the number of waves the above equation meets the following three conditions 1 free water surface boundary condition z 0 2 g φ z 2 φ t 2 0 2 laplace equation 3 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ z 2 0 3 seabed boundary condition z d 4 u z z d φ z z d 0 bringing equation 1 into equations 2 3 and 4 respectively the airy wave velocity potential can be written as 5 φ g h 2 ω cosh k z d cosh k d sin k x ω t according to the relationship between velocity and velocity potential the velocity distribution of the flow field can be obtained as follows 6 u φ x g h k 2 ω cosh k z d cosh k d cos k x ω t 7 a u t g h k 2 cosh k z d cosh k d sin k x ω t where u is the horizontal fluid speed a is the horizontal fluid acceleration d is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration according to morrison s equation morison et al 1950 at any height z the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy per unit height can be expressed as 8 f x f d f i 1 2 c d ρ a u u c m ρ v a where f d is the horizontal drag force f i is the horizontal inertia force c d is the horizontal drag coefficient a is the projected area of the buoy in the horizontal direction per unit height c m is mass coefficient and v is the drainage volume of the buoy per unit height the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy within the height of d z is 9 d f x d f d d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u u d z c m ρ π d 2 4 a d z where d is the diameter of the buoy therefore the total horizontal wave force acting on the buoy can be simplified as 10 f x f d f i z η f x d z c d ρ g d h 2 2 k 1 cos θ cos θ c m ρ g π h d 2 8 k 2 sin θ where k 1 2 k η z sh 2 k η sh 2 k z 8 sh 2 k d k 2 sh k η sh k z ch k d and θ k x ω t at any phase the total horizontal wave force acting on the buoy can be expressed as 11 f x f d max cos θ cos θ f i max sin θ where f d max is the maximum horizontal drag force and f i max is the maximum horizontal inertial force from equation 11 it can be seen that when the buoy is at the wave crest the direction of the horizontal wave force is to the right and when the buoy is at the wave trough the direction of the horizontal wave force is to the left this is shown in fig 4 if the buoy adopts heave motion the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy will be offset by the above constraints therefore compared to the heave motion in theory if the buoy adopts longitudinal swing motion the horizontal wave force acting on the buoy will be utilized which can effectively increase the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy 2 2 calculation of optimized target parameters the optimized target parameters in this work are the average output power p b of the buoy and the capture width ratio β the average output power p b of the buoy can be calculated according to shi et al 2019 12 p b t 1 t 2 c v 2 d t t 2 t 1 13 c α ρ g d t 2 π where c is the pto damping coefficient v is the heave speed of the buoy ρ is the fluid density t 1 and t 2 are any two moments for which t 2 t 1 n t where n is an integer t is the wave period and α is the adjustment coefficient the expression for the buoy s capture width ratio β is 14 β p b p w a v e where p w a v e is the average power of the wave incident on the buoy which can be written as follows 15 p wave 1 32 π ρ g 2 h 2 t d 981 h 2 t d 3 numerical model set up 3 1 governing equation the 2d nwt is built by using the adina software the unsteady and incompressible flow field can be described by the continuity equation and the navier stokes

buoy is established by using the structure module in adina and the flow field model is established by using the cfd module the schematic diagram of the computational domain is shown in fig 5 the left side is set to the incident wave boundary and the right side is set to the fixed wall boundary the top is set to the air and the bottom is set to the fluid the horizontal and vertical grid resolutions of the flow field are set to δ x l 100 l is the wave length and δ z h 20 respectively the initial time step is set to 0 002 s to ensure that the implicit solver has sufficient time accuracy han et al 2018 3 3 pto loading the movement of the buoy is hindered by a pto damping force which acts vertically on the center of the upper surface of the buoy the linear pto force can be expressed as 18 f p t o c v 4 model test through the physical model experiments the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model was verified and the movement characteristics of the buoy under the linear pto damping are obtained 4 1 model set up physical model experiments are carried out in zhejiang provincial key laboratory in zhejiang ocean university in china the wave tank has a length of 130 m a width of 6 m and a water depth of 3 5 m one end of the wave tank is equipped with a hydraulic swing wave maker and the other end is equipped with a sponge layer wave eliminator the buoy is 30 m away from the wave maker under the action of both the sponge layer and the larger distance i e 100 m from the buoy to the end of the wave tank the influence of reflected waves on the buoy can be ignored the incident wave height at the position of the buoy is measured by the wave height recorder when no buoy is installed in the wave tank fig 6 a is the improved physical model of the haiyuan no 1 obwec the platform is fixed in the wave tank by means of a tripod the buoy is connected to the rocker and the other end of the rocker is fixed to the platform by a hinge fig 6 b is a wave tank fig 6 c is the buoy structure with a width of 2 m a draft of 1 m and a freeboard of 0 5 m the mass and draft of the buoy can be changed by adding water to the inside of the buoy fig 6 d is a schematic diagram of the link between the buoy and the hydraulic cylinder the lower end of the hydraulic cylinder is linked to the center of the upper surface of the buoy 4 2 numerical results validation in the regular wave the motion equation of the buoy is given as 19 j j a d d θ τ w a v e τ g τ p t o where j is the moment of inertia of the buoy and arm j a d d is the additional moment of inertia due to the movement of the buoy θ is the angular acceleration of the buoy movement τ w a v e is the torque due to the wave buoy interaction τ g is the torque due to gravity and τ p t o is the torque due to the pto system to the buoy the time process of wave surface motion at the position of buoy 2 between the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 7 a when no buoy is installed in the wave tank in the numerical simulation the size of the nwt is set to be the same as the experimental one the incident wave height h and wave period t are set to 0 4 m and 3 s respectively it can be seen that the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement which prove the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model fig 7 b shows the comparison of the heave amplitude h s of buoy 2 between the numerical and experimental results when pto damping is 0 n s m in the numerical simulation the sizes of the buoy and wave tank are set to be the same as that of the experiment the incident wave height and wave period are as the above as the draft of buoy 2 changes from 0 5 m to 0 9 m the heave amplitude of buoy 2 increases from 0 32 m to 0 39 m in both the numerical and experimental results it can be seen that the relative error between the numerical and experimental results is below 5 this shows that there is a good consonance between the numerical and experimental results kim et al 1999 5 results and discussion of regular wave test 5 1 determination of natural vibration period of the buoy the wec needs to utilize the resonance between the buoy and the wave to increase the conversion efficiency so it is very important to determine the buoy s natural vibration period the natural vibration period of simple geometries can be estimated by the empirical formula however for the natural vibration period of complex geometries the empirical formula could be difficult this paper used a numerical method to roughly determine the natural vibration period of the buoy firstly the buoy is placed statically on the surface wave of the nwt and given the buoy an initial velocity in the z direction to get the free attenuation curve of the buoy according to the free attenuation curve the natural vibration period of the buoy can then be calculated as can be seen from fig 8 the natural vibration period of buoy 1 is about 3 4 s and the natural vibration period of buoy 2 is about 4 2 s 5 2 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy without pto damping heave rao is the ratio of buoy s heave amplitude to its wave height the effect of different wave periods on the heave rao of buoy 1 and buoy 2 without pto damping is studied through numerical simulations it can be seen from fig 9 a that as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 1 first increases and then decreases and finally it remains at about 1 when the wave period is 3 4 s i e close to the natural vibration period of buoy 1 the heave rao of buoy 1 reaches its maximum as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 2 also first increases and then it decreases when the wave period is 4 2 s i e close to the natural vibration period of buoy 2 the growth rate of the heave rao of buoy 2 starts to slow down when the wave period is about 5 s the heave rao of buoy 2 reaches its maximum after that as the wave period increases the heave rao of buoy 2 gradually decreases and it is always greater than 1 when the wave period is less than 3 7 s the heave rao of buoy 1 is greater than that of buoy 2 when the wave period is greater than 3 7 s the heave rao of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 fig 9 b shows the effects of the wavelength buoy s diameter and wave period on the ratio of heave rao of buoy 2 to buoy 1 as the wavelength buoy s diameter increases the ratio of heave rao of buoy 2 to buoy 1 firstly increases and then it decreases generally when the wavelength buoy s diameter is less than 4 5 the ratio remains unchanged when the wavelength buoy s diameter is in the range of 4 5 10 the ratio increases rapidly to a maximum of 1 9 when the wavelength buoy s diameter is greater than 10 the ratio begins to decrease but it is still greater than 1 the common wave period in coastal areas of zhoushan china is 4 s 8 s the wavelength range is 40 m 100 m and the diameter of the buoy is usually less than 5 m in practical applications therefore according to the above study on the heave rao of the buoy without pto damping force it can be concluded that the buoy adopting longitudinal swing motion has more advantages than heave motion 5 3 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy under different wave periods through regular wave numerical simulations the effects of different wave periods on the dynamic performance differences of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are studied under linear pto damping when the pto damping force and the buoyancy force received by the buoy are of the same order of magnitude the capture width ratio of the buoy is close to the maximum therefore according to equation 10 the pto damping c is set to 5000 n s m and the capture width ratio of the buoy under different wave periods is obtained as can be seen from fig 10 a as the wave period increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then decreases under the same wave period the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 occurs when the wave period is about 3 4 s and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 occurs when the wave period is about 4 2 s the wave period is the same as the natural vibration period of the buoy without pto damping when the maximum capture width ratio of the buoy appears which indicates that the occurrence of pto damping will not change the natural vibration period of the buoy and the resonance effect between the buoy and the wave can increase the capture width ratio of the buoy as can be seen from fig 10 b as the wave period increases the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 increases first and then it decreases when the wave period is less than 5 s the ratio gradually increases with the increase of the wave period and the at maximum it reaches 2 4 which suggests that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is 2 4 times that of buoy 1 at most when the wave period is greater than 5 s the ratio gradually decreases as the wave period increases but it is still much greater than 1 the above conclusions indicate that the wave period has a great influence on the buoy s capture width ratio it is generally known that the larger the wave period the larger the corresponding wavelength for a buoy with a fixed specification when the wave period is large the wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the buoy for this case the time for the buoy to move up and down for one cycle will increase thereby reducing the average output power of the buoy therefore when the wave period is large an increase in the capture width ratio can be achieved by increasing the diameter of the buoy in addition when the wave period is close to the buoy s natural vibration period the buoy s capture width ratio is the largest hence in different sea areas it is possible to increase the capture width ratio of the buoy by adjusting the natural frequency of the buoy to make it as close as possible to the wave period which occurs most frequently in the sea area on the whole under the same pto damping coefficient the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is better than that of buoy 1 5 4 hydrodynamic performance of the buoy under different linear pto damping coefficients in order to further study the hydrodynamic performance differences between buoy 1 and buoy 2 the natural vibration periods of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are selected as wave periods respectively the effects of different pto damping coefficients on the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 and buoy 2 under resonance conditions are studied to obtain the variation law of the buoy s capture width ratio with respect to the pto damping coefficient as can be seen from fig 11 a when the wave period is 3 4 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then it decreases when c 10000 n s m the capture width ratio of buoy 2 reaches its maximum value when c 5000 n s m the capture width ratio of buoy 1 reaches its maximum value the maximum capture width ratios of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are 24 3 and 39 0 respectively as can be seen from fig 11 b when the wave period is 3 4 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 gradually increases when the pto damping coefficient is less than 2000 n s m the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 is less than 1 which shows that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 is greater than that of buoy 2 under this condition however due to the relatively small capture width ratio of buoy 1 and buoy 2 it is not suitable for practical applications when the pto damping coefficient c is greater than 2000 n s m the ratio of the capture width ratio of buoy 2 to buoy 1 is greater than 1 and the maximum ratio is 2 4 this shows that the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is better than that of buoy 1 under this condition and as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio gradually increases within a certain range as can be seen from fig 12 a when the wave period is 4 2 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increases first and then it decreases under the same pto damping coefficient the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is always greater than that of buoy 1 when the pto damping coefficient c is 7500 n s m the capture width ratios of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 reach their maxima the maximum capture width ratios of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are 20 2 and 41 4 respectively as can be seen from fig 12 b when the wave period is 4 2 s as the pto damping coefficient increases the ratio of the capture width of buoy 2 to buoy 1 gradually increases and the ratio is greater than 2 for this case the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is much greater than buoy 1 the above conclusions indicate that the pto damping coefficient has a great influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy and the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponding to the buoy under different wave periods will change therefore in order to maximize the capture width ratio of the buoy the pto damping coefficient acting on the buoy should be adjusted under different wave periods on the whole regardless of whether the wave period is 3 4 s or 4 2 s the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is greater than that of buoy 1 which indicates that the buoy adopting the form of longitudinal swing motion can effectively improve the hydrodynamic performance compared to heave motion 6 results and discussion of the irregular wave test 6 1 irregular wave parameter selection in the numerical simulation of irregular waves the wave parameters used are the real wave data of the haiyuan no 1 obwec during the sea trial irregular waves can be regarded as the superposition of several regular waves in this paper the jonswap spectrum is selected as the target spectrum which can be expressed as follows goda 1999 20 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 21 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 0191 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 22 t p t 1 3 1 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 23 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p where h 1 3 a and t 1 3 are the effective wave height and wave period respectively f is the wave frequency and γ is the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 since the haiyuan no 1 obwec is installed in the offshore waters the wave propagation direction is relatively consistent so in this paper only the impact of unidirectional irregular waves on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy is studied 6 2 results and discussion the effective wave height h 1 3 in irregular waves is the average value of the maximum one third wave height and the effective wave period t 1 3 is the average value of the maximum one third wave period in the irregular wave test three groups of different irregular wave conditions are selected the test wave conditions are shown in table 1 the pto damping coefficients range from 2500 n s m to 25000 n s m for each group of the test wave conditions it can be seen from fig 13 that in the first group of irregular wave conditions as the pto damping coefficient increases the capture width of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 first increases and then it decreases also from fig 13 the capture width ratio of buoy 2 is always greater than that of buoy 1 under the same pto damping coefficient the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 27 15 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 17 92 in other groups of irregular wave conditions the trend of the variation of the capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 is the same as that of the first group of irregular wave conditions in the second group of irregular wave conditions the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 24 12 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 16 37 in the third group of irregular wave conditions the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 2 is 18 22 and the maximum capture width ratio of buoy 1 is 10 95 in general wecs exhibit lower performance for irregular waves in comparison to regular waves the following reasons are why the buoy s capture width ratio is relatively small han et al 2018 schay et al 2013 1 the difference between the buoy s natural vibration period and the wave period is large which makes it difficult to form a resonance between the buoy and the wave 2 the selection of the pto damping coefficient is not optimal 3 the ratio of the wavelength to the buoy s diameter is too large or too small so there is mismatch between wavelength and buoy s diameter as the effective wave period increases the maximum capture width ratio of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 gradually decreases which is also consistent with the trend of change in fig 10 the above conclusions show that under the action of irregular waves the buoy adopting the form of longitudinal swing motion is more effective in improving the hydrodynamic performance compared to the buoy adopting the form of heave motion and the performance improvement is generally more than 50 7 conclusions in this paper a two dimensional nwt is established by adina to compare and analyze the hydrodynamic performance difference of the buoy under two different motion forms heaving and longitudinal swing to verify the accuracy of the numerical results a physical model experiment is conducted at zhejiang ocean university in china through the comparative analysis of the results of both numerical simulations and physical model experiments the rationality of the grid resolution setting in the numerical model is verified in addition the hydrodynamic performance difference of the buoy under two different motion forms i e heaving and longitudinal swing is obtained through the numerical simulation of regular waves and irregular waves based on the above numerical simulation results the following conclusions are drawn 1 the natural vibration period of the buoy has a huge influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy whether it is buoy 1 or buoy 2 the maximum capture width ratio of the buoy always occurs when the natural vibration period of the buoy and the wave period are the same therefore in different sea areas it is possible to increase the capture width ratio of the buoy by adjusting the natural vibration frequency of the buoy to make it as close as possible to the wave period which occurs most frequently in the sea area 2 the wave period has a huge influence on the capture width ratio of the buoy it is generally known that the larger the wave period the larger the corresponding wavelength for a buoy with a fixed specification when the wave period is large the wave length is much larger than the diameter of the buoy at this instance the time for the buoy to move up and down for one cycle increases which will reduce the average output power of the buoy therefore when the wave period is large an increase in the capture width ratio can be achieved by increasing the diameter of the buoy 3 the pto damping coefficient has a huge influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy and the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponding to the buoy under different wave periods will change therefore the pto damping coefficient acting on the buoy should be adjusted under different wave periods to maximize the capture width ratio of the buoy in addition the presence of pto damping does not change the natural vibration period of the buoy 4 in the regular wave test within the range of 2 s 10 s wave period for a wave period of t 3 4 s the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 1 is at its best however its hydrodynamic performance is still generally lower than that of buoy 2 for a wave period of t 4 2 s the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is at its best and its hydrodynamic performance is generally twice that of buoy 1 for other wave periods the hydrodynamic performance difference between buoy 2 and buoy 1 is between that of the above two wave periods 5 in the irregular wave test the capture width ratios of both buoy 1 and buoy 2 increase first and then it decrease as the pto damping coefficient increases under the same pto damping coefficient the hydrodynamic performance of buoy 2 is generally 50 higher than that of buoy 1 the above conclusions indicate that the buoy adopting the longitudinal swing motion can effectively increase the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy compared to when the heave motion is employed the conclusions of this paper can provide guidance for the design improvement of the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy these devices can be deployed in arrays or farms in the future in order to be commercially viable in the future the interaction between buoys after deployment in arrays or farms will be further studied credit authorship contribution

20727,the conventional methods including cross ambiguity function caf and least square ls methods have intensively studied for the estimation of the delay doppler parameters from moving linear frequency modulated lfm signals due to the characteristic of underwater acoustic multipath propagation in shallow water and the mobility of sound source the traditional methods provide limited

to the motion of source or receiver strong sea currents and fluctuant boundaries in practical applications the doppler effect is commonly used for radial velocity estimation of the moving targets liang et al 2019 due to the doppler effect and multipath propagation the received signal is the sum of some amplitude attenuated time delayed and doppler scaled versions of the source signal li and preisig 2007 the traditional method for estimating the delay doppler parameters is matched filtering mf which estimates the cross ambiguity function caf between the received signal and the source

filtering yu et al 2017 josso and ioana proposed the doppler compensation techniques based on caf which was accomplished by selecting a column corresponding to the absolute maximum in the ambiguity plane josso et al 2009 however each multipath ray has a different doppler scale dependent on its angle of emission in consequence the motion effect compensation with constant speed brings errors in estimating the delay doppler parameters the shallow water propagation channel can be characterized by sparsity wu et al 2020 and the estimation of the channel impulse response cir based on sparse representation has been a hot topic for decades of years cotter and rao 2002 li et al 2019 wu et al 2018 the cir is directly connected with the delay doppler parameters of the multipath propagation considering that the resolution of the matched filtering is limited to the time bandwidth product the researchers investigated a sparse representation based method to improve the resolution of delay doppler estimation sparse representation methods based on basis pursuit bp criterion perform well with high accuracy and resolution but they are inefficient with a very large dictionary matrix chen et al 2001 the orthogonal matching pursuit omp is one of the greedy pursuit algorithms and it is faster than standard approaches based on bp in most cases tropp and gilbert 2007 actually only the headmost several multipath arrivals need to be distinguished which can be implemented by setting the sparse level k in the iterative process by conducting an experiment this paper investigates the effects of a moving source on the time delay and doppler scale of multipath propagations in shallow water using the lfm signals without loss of generality it is assumed that the source and receiver are in the same vertical plane and only the headmost five paths are analyzed here the headmost five paths in shallow water are the direct d wave the surface reflected sr wave the bottom reflected br wave the surface reflected bottom reflected sb wave and the bottom reflected surface reflected bs wave the formulations of the doppler scales of five paths resulted from a moving source are presented in this paper the delay doppler parameters corresponding to the five paths can be estimated by using sparse representation which improves the resolution and accuracy considering the large scale of the dictionary matrix we adopt the greedy algorithm to estimate the delay doppler parameters tropp 2004 different from the standard omp method that requires matrix inversion which leads to a huge consumption of computing resources and limits the applications for omp a modified greedy pursuit algorithm called gram schmidt orthonormal matching pursuit gsomp is proposed in this paper we design an orthonormal basis at each iteration and thus avoids the computing of the inverse matrix to improve the robustness of the algorithm the conventional caf and non greedy ls methods are compared with the proposed method in addition other greedy algorithms including regularized orthogonal matching pursuit romp needell and vershynin 2010 and compressive sampling mp cosamp needell and tropp 2009 are also compared with the proposed gsomp method simulation results show that the proposed gsomp algorithm is well performed in estimating the delay doppler parameters which has advantages of high resolution and accuracy the superiority of the proposed algorithm is further confirmed by at sea experiments 2 the sparse representation model the model of a source with uniform linear motion in the isovelocity waveguide is presented in fig 1 the headmost five paths are investigated since they contain relatively large energy the signals propagating through the five paths arrive at the receiver with different grazing angles which are denoted as θ k k 1 2 5 assuming the sea surface and sea bottom are flat the motion vector v is then projected on the path of the k t h ray with the grazing angle θ k which leads to 1 v k v cos θ k where v k is the radial velocity of the source relative to the receiver of the k t h ray note that v k is defined as positive when the source is approaching the receiver and negative when they are moving far away from each other the doppler scale corresponding to the k t h path can be written as where c is the sound speed the doppler scale d k is dependent on the ratio of the radial velocity v k to the sound speed c the five paths have different propagation lengths resulting in different arrival times at the receiver let τ k denotes the time delay of the k t h path and consider the attenuation coefficient a k of each ray then the signal received at the time t for the k t h ray is expressed as 3 r k t a k x d k t τ k where x t is the source signal the received signal r t is the sum of all the r k t arriving at the receiver which leads to the following expression 4 r t k 1 k a x k d k t τ k w t where w t is the additive gaussian noise and k is the number of multipath in eq 4 we find the received signal r t can be represented as a sum of k signals parameterized by the undetermined parameters of a k d k τ k let δ t δ d and δ τ denote the interval of the observing time doppler scale and time delay respectively the discrete observing time is 5 t n n δ t n 0 n 1 where n is the length of the received signal the discrete parameter sets of d τ are defined as 6 d s d d 0 d 0 δ d d 0 l 1 δ d 7 τ s τ τ 0 τ 0 δ τ τ 0 m 1 δ τ where d 0 and τ 0 are the minimum possible doppler scale and minimum possible time delay respectively there are l and m candidate values for d and τ which means that lm possible columns need to be established let δ t δ τ 1 f s and f s is the sampling frequency of the received signal thus the sparse representation form of r t can be written as 8 r x h w where r r n δ τ t w w n δ τ t n 0 n 1 which are the discrete received signal vector and noise vector respectively the matrix x is the so called redundant dictionary which has the following block form 9 x x 1 x l 10 x i x d i 0 0 0 x d i δ τ x d i 0 x d i n 1 δ τ x d i n 2 δ τ x d i n m δ τ where each block x i i 1 l is the n m toeplitz matrix corresponding to the i th searched doppler scale parameter in the searching space of s d the unknown vector h in eq 8 is to be determined and it can be written as 11 h h 1 h l t where 12 h j h j 1 h j m t j 1 l the delay doppler parameters can be estimated by solving eq 8 there are lm combinations of the delay doppler parameter as candidates and the length of h is lm thus the nonzero elements in h correspond to different delay doppler parameters therefore we can reshape the variable h to a l m matrix and then obtain the estimated results of super resolution in the delay doppler domain the traditional way to obtain the estimation of h is based on the ls criterion and the objective function can be expressed as vaccaro et al 1992 13 h l s arg min h r x h 2 actually the matrix x is an over complete matrix if n lm the solution of the ls method can be obtained as 14 h l s x t x 1 x t r the estimation result is not accurate enough since the ls method has no any constraints on the equation the received signal r is the linear combinations of the k columns in the dictionary matrix x the number of paths k is generally much smaller than l m which means the solution of eq 8 is sparse then eq 8 can be adapted as an optimization problem 15 min h h 0 s t r x h where 0 denotes the l 0 norm which is defined as the number of nonzero elements in the vector one useful method to solve eq 15 is compressed sensing cs which can be empirically divided into two groups the greedy pursuit algorithms e g omp and convex optimization algorithms such as basis pursuit de noising bpdn figueiredo et al 2007 the dimension of the matrix x is n l m and it could be very large in practical applications the computational complexity of the omp and bpdn methods are o nlmk and o n 2 lm 3 respectively choi et al 2017 consequently the computational cost of bpdn is larger than that of omp however the omp method has to calculate inverse matrix in the iterative process a greedy pursuit algorithm called gsomp is specifically designed to avoid the inverse matrix and improve the robustness the gsomp creates an orthonormal basis at each iteration to make the support space consisted of orthonormal bases the details of the gsomp algorithm are as follows gram schmidt orthonormal matching pursuit algorithm input measurement vector r redundant dictionary x sparse level k initialization let the residual e 0 r index set λ 0 support space x 0 iteration index i 1 h ˆ z e r o s l m 1 step 1 find λ i arg max j 1 m l e i 1 x j where x j denotes the j t h column of the matrix x e i 1 x j is the inner product of e i 1 and x j λ i is the selected index step 2 update the index set and support space λ i λ i λ i x i x i 1 x λ where x λ denotes the λ i t h column of x step 3 establish the gram schmidt orthonormal basis of x i denoted as b i and each column of b i is unitized to keep a unit length step 4 calculate h ˆ i b i t b i 1 b i t r by the least square criterion noting that b i t b i i and i is the identity matrix then h ˆ i b i t r the matrix inversion operation is removed step 5 update e i r b i h ˆ i step 6 i i 1 if i k go back to step 1 otherwise stop the iteration output h ˆ λ b t r the support space is denoted as x i x 1 x 2 x i where x i is the selected column vector in each iteration and the length of x i is n let b i b 1 b 2 b i represent the orthonormal basis of the space x i based on the gram schmidt method we have 16 e 1 x 1 b 1 e 1 e 1 e i x i x i b 1 b 1 x i b 2 b 2 x i b i 1 b i 1 b i e i e i where denotes inner product noting that the size of the support space is n i at the i th iteration the computational complexity of the matrix inversion in the omp method is o i 3 ni 2 while the computational complexity of the gram schmidt operation in the gsomp method is o n ni 2 in general case the dominant computational complexity in both operation is o ni 2 the computational cost of the gsomp method is similar to that of the omp method so that the gsomp method maintains the computational efficiency moreover the proposed gsomp method avoids the matrix inversion thus to improve the robustness it should be noticed that the output result contains information about the estimated delay doppler parameters 3 simulation results the lfm signal emitted by the source with starting frequency f 0 and pulse duration t can be expressed as 17 x t cos 2 π f 0 t k 2 t 2 if 0 t t 0 otherwise where k is the chirp rate and the bandwidth of x t can be derived as w kt the simulated lfm signal has a starting frequency of 2000 hz a bandwidth of 2000 hz a sampling frequency of 8000 hz and a pulse duration of 1 s in the simulation the receiver is fixed at a depth of 35 m the source is moving at a constant velocity of 6 ms 1 at a depth of 20 m and 300 m away from the receiver on a 134 m deep channel which has a constant sound speed of 1530 ms 1 the simulated received signal is generated by convolving the source signal with the modeled cir which is produced by the acoustic ray model named bellhop porter and bucker 1987 furthermore the gaussian white noise with the signal to noise ratio snr of 15 db is added to the received signal considering the source is moving away from the receiver the received signal will be stretched thus the observing time window is set as 1 5 s the modeled cir is shown in fig 2 a where the sparsity of the channel is illustrated the direct mf result of the received signal is shown in fig 2 b which indicates that the time delays cannot be estimated with strong doppler effects by the conventional mf method 3 1 comparison of different methods the relative radial velocity is utilized to represent the corresponding doppler scale based on eq 2 to show the estimated results more intuitively the search space of the radial velocity is from 8 to 0 ms 1 with the precision of 0 1 ms 1 hence the dimension of the doppler scale is l 80 the search space of the time delay is from 0 to 80 ms with the precision δτ 1 f s 0 125 ms which leads to the dimension of the time delay m 640 the observing length of the received signal vector is 8000 and consequently there are n 8000 rows and lm 51 200 columns in the matrix x the sparse level used in the simulation is k 5 because only the headmost five paths in the received signals are considered the time delay and radial velocity estimations via different methods are shown in fig 3 where five paths can be found in the surface plots by the caf and ls methods the ls method has a similar performance with the caf method as demonstrated in fig 3 a and b for the caf and ls methods only the global maximum point can be determined while other local maximum points corresponding to the latter arrivals cannot be identified easily in fact each path has a different apparent speed and time delay for multipath propagations in shallow water the gsomp method outperforms the traditional caf and ls methods in terms of resolution which is demonstrated in fig 3 g the gsomp method enables the five paths to be distinguished in the surface plot thus the corresponding delay and radial velocity of each path can be found easily the estimated results of the romp and cosamp methods are shown in fig 3 c and d and fig 3 e and f respectively which cannot provide accurate time delay of the channel compared with the gsomp method the estimated results by the proposed gsomp method are consistent with the referenced values shown in fig 3 h which indicates the high accuracy of the proposed gsomp method the red circle and the highlighted strip in fig 3 h denote the referenced and the estimated results respectively the estimated radial velocity of the first path is almost 6 ms 1 while that of the last path is about 4 4 ms 1 which means each path has a different radial velocity resulted from the different grazing angle one can see that the exact time delay information is estimated by the proposed method instead of the romp and cosamp methods 3 2 statistical performance analysis the statistical performances of the proposed gsomp compared with the romp and cosamp methods are presented in this section because of the low resolution of the caf and ls methods it s difficult to extract the delay doppler parameters in the ambiguity plane therefore we do not compare the caf and ls methods in this subsection the mean square error mse of the estimated time delay and radial velocity can be respectively expressed as 18 mse τ 1 m c n 1 m c τ ˆ τ 2 and 19 mse v 1 m c n 1 m c v ˆ v 2 where m c is the number of independent trials τ ˆ and v ˆ are the estimated time delay and radial velocity respectively the cir is the same as that in the subsection 3 1 the snr and the measurement length are the two main parameters that affect the performance of the methods noting the measurement length is denoted by the percentage of observation which means different percentages of the received signal are selected from the starting time of the signal the number of independent trials is set as m c 200 during the simulation the snr of the received signal varies from 5 db to 35 db with a step of 5 db the percentage of observation represents the length of measurements and varies from 20 to 100 with a step of 10 the mses of the estimated time delay and radial velocity versus snr are displayed in fig 4 where we find the gsomp method can estimate the delay doppler parameters with high accuracy when the snr is larger than 15 db similarly the mses versus percentage of observation are shown in fig 5 where the proposed gsomp method yields quite low mses when the percentage of observation is larger than 60 when the percentage of length reaches 80 the mse τ and the mse v of the gsomp method are 1 047 and 0 106 respectively 4 experimental results the shallow water acoustic experiment was conducted in the east china sea in january 2015 the experimental area was nearly flat and the water depth was about 134 m the sound speed profile ssp collected during the experiment shows a typical characteristic of the mixed layer in winter which has a mean speed of 1530 ms 1 the hydrophone was anchored at the depth of 30 8 m and the source emitting lfm signals was towed by the vessel with linear motion at a speed of 2 5 ms 1 the lfm has a starting frequency of 2000 hz a bandwidth of 2000 hz and a duration of 1 s a depth sensor was tied to the moving source which indicates the source depth is 16 6 m the horizontal distance between the source and the receiver is 364 5 m which is derived from the global positioning system gps it is coincident that the moving direction of the source is almost consistent with the attachment direction between the source and the receiver the sampling rate of the hydrophone is f s 8000 hz the snr of the received signal is about 22 db within the narrow frequency band of the source signal the minimum maximum and the search interval of the radial velocity are set as v min 4 ms 1 v max 0 ms 1 and δv 0 1 ms 1 respectively then the doppler scale can be obtained from eq 2 noting that the doppler effect resulted from a number of factors in real applications and the radial velocity used here is the result of the conversion the search space of the time delay is set τmin 0 τmax 70 ms and δτ 1 f s 0 125 ms the observing length of the received signal vector is 8000 thus there are n 8000 rows and lm 22 400 columns in the dictionary matrix x the surface plots of the caf and ls methods with real data are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively which reveal five apparent paths in the first 70 ms but the resolution of the caf and ls methods is limited that they cannot determine the specific parameters of each path the sparse level is set k 5 and estimations of the gsomp method are shown in fig 6 e and f respectively the estimated parameters can be determined via the proposed gsomp method simply and directly the results demonstrate the high resolution of the gsomp method in estimating the delay doppler parameters as comparisons the surface plots of the romp and cosamp methods are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively the romp and cosamp methods fail to separate the multipath arrivals due to the existing environment noise and these two methods selected multiple column vectors in each iteration so that more interference were introduced in the process the estimated radial velocity by the gsomp method of the first path is 2 1 ms 1 which is close to the real moving speed 2 5 ms 1 of the source the radial velocity is a converted result of the total doppler effects therefore the difference exists between the estimated results and the modeled values from fig 6 f it is clear that each path has different delay doppler parameters the comparisons between the estimated time delays by the gsomp method and the modeled delays are shown in table 1 where the modeled values of the multipath arrivals are bellhop predicted the estimated time delays by the gsomp method are close to the model predicted delays thus it is reasonable that the accuracy of our method is verified 5 conclusions in view of the shortcomings of the caf method on estimating delay doppler parameters a sparse representation based method for moving lfm signals is proposed in this paper to improve the resolution and accuracy of the estimation results since the dictionary matrix is often large in practical problems the improved gsomp method is used to solve the sparse representation model which can avoid the calculation of inverse matrices in the iterative process and improve the robustness of the algorithm to facilitate its application the caf ls romp and cosamp methods are compared with the proposed method in simulations and experiments the results indicate the proposed method performs well in estimating the multipath delay doppler parameters both in terms of resolution and accuracy furthermore the proposed method may be applied to radial velocity measurement active sonar target detection and passive acoustic tomography in the future declaration

r is the linear combinations of the k columns in the dictionary matrix x the number of paths k is generally much smaller than l m which means the solution of eq 8 is sparse then eq 8 can be adapted as an optimization problem 15 min h h 0 s t r x h where 0 denotes the l 0 norm which is defined as the number of nonzero elements in the vector one useful method to solve eq 15 is compressed sensing cs which can be empirically divided into two groups the greedy pursuit algorithms e g omp and convex optimization algorithms such as basis pursuit de noising bpdn figueiredo et al 2007 the dimension of the matrix x is n l m and it could be very large in practical applications the computational complexity of the omp and bpdn methods are o nlmk and o n 2 lm 3 respectively choi et al 2017 consequently the computational cost of bpdn is larger than that of omp however the omp method has to calculate inverse matrix in the iterative process a greedy pursuit algorithm called gsomp is specifically designed to avoid the inverse matrix and improve the robustness the gsomp creates an orthonormal basis at each iteration to make the support space consisted of orthonormal bases the details of the gsomp algorithm are as follows gram schmidt orthonormal matching pursuit algorithm input measurement vector r redundant dictionary x sparse level k initialization let the residual e 0 r index set λ 0 support space x 0 iteration index i 1 h ˆ z e r o s l m 1 step 1 find λ i arg max j 1 m l e i 1 x j where x j denotes the j t h column of the matrix x e i 1 x j is the inner product of e i 1 and x j λ

denoted as b i and each column of b i is unitized to keep a unit length step 4 calculate h ˆ i b i t b i 1 b i t r by the least square criterion noting that b i t b i i and i is the identity matrix then h ˆ i b i t r the matrix inversion operation is removed step 5 update e i r b i h ˆ i step 6 i i 1 if i k go back to step 1 otherwise stop the iteration output h ˆ λ b t r the support space is denoted as x i x 1 x 2 x i where x i is the selected column vector in each iteration and the length of x i is n let b i b 1 b 2 b i represent the orthonormal basis of the space x i based on the gram schmidt method we have 16 e 1 x 1 b 1 e 1 e 1 e i x i x i b 1 b 1 x i b 2 b 2 x i b i 1 b i 1 b i e i e i where denotes inner product noting that the size of the support space is n i at the i th iteration the computational complexity of the matrix inversion in the omp method is o i 3 ni 2 while the computational complexity of the gram schmidt operation in the gsomp method is o n ni 2 in general case the dominant computational complexity in both operation is o ni 2 the computational cost of the gsomp method is similar to that of the omp method so that the gsomp method maintains the computational efficiency moreover the proposed gsomp method avoids the matrix inversion thus to improve the robustness it should be noticed that the output result contains information about the estimated delay doppler parameters 3 simulation results the lfm signal emitted by the source with starting frequency f 0 and pulse duration t can be expressed as 17 x t cos 2 π f 0 t k 2 t 2 if 0 t t 0 otherwise where k is the chirp rate and the bandwidth of x t can be derived as w kt the simulated lfm signal has a starting frequency of 2000 hz a bandwidth of 2000 hz a sampling frequency of 8000 hz and a pulse duration of 1 s in the simulation the receiver is fixed at a depth of 35 m the source is moving at a constant velocity of 6 ms 1 at a depth of 20 m and 300 m away from the receiver on a 134 m deep channel which has a constant sound speed of 1530 ms 1 the simulated received signal is generated by convolving the source signal with the modeled cir which is produced by the acoustic ray model named bellhop porter and bucker 1987 furthermore the gaussian white noise with the signal to noise ratio snr of 15 db is added to the received signal considering the source is moving away from the receiver the received signal will be stretched thus the observing time window is set as 1 5 s the modeled cir is shown in fig 2 a where the sparsity of the channel is illustrated the direct mf result of the received signal is shown in fig 2 b which indicates that the time delays cannot be estimated with strong doppler effects by the conventional mf method 3 1 comparison of different methods the relative radial velocity is utilized to represent the corresponding doppler scale based on eq 2 to show the estimated results more intuitively the search space of the radial velocity is from 8 to 0 ms 1 with the precision of 0 1 ms 1 hence the dimension of the doppler scale is l 80 the search space of the time delay is from 0 to 80 ms with the precision δτ 1 f s 0 125 ms which leads to the dimension of the time delay m 640 the observing length of the received signal vector is 8000 and consequently there are n 8000 rows and lm 51 200 columns in the matrix x the sparse level used in the simulation is k 5 because only the headmost five paths in the received signals are considered the time delay and radial velocity estimations via different methods are shown in fig 3 where five paths can be found in the surface plots by the caf and ls methods the ls method has a similar performance with the caf method as demonstrated in fig 3 a and b for the caf and ls methods only the global maximum point can be determined while other local maximum points corresponding to the latter arrivals cannot be identified easily in fact each path has a different apparent speed and time delay for multipath propagations in shallow water the gsomp method outperforms the traditional caf and ls methods in terms of resolution which is demonstrated in fig 3 g the gsomp method enables the five paths to be distinguished in the surface plot thus the corresponding delay and radial velocity of each path can be found easily the estimated results of the romp and cosamp methods are shown in fig 3 c and d and fig 3 e and f respectively which cannot provide accurate time delay of the channel compared with the gsomp method the estimated results by the proposed gsomp method are consistent with the referenced values shown in fig 3 h which indicates the high accuracy of the proposed gsomp method the red circle and the highlighted strip in fig 3 h denote the referenced and the estimated results respectively the estimated radial velocity of the first path is almost 6 ms 1 while that of the last path is about 4 4 ms 1 which means each path has a different radial velocity resulted from the different grazing angle one can see that the exact time delay information is estimated by the proposed method instead of the romp and cosamp methods 3 2 statistical performance analysis the statistical performances of the proposed gsomp compared with the romp and cosamp methods are presented in this section because of the low resolution of the caf and ls methods it s difficult to extract the delay doppler parameters in the ambiguity plane therefore we do not compare the caf and ls methods in this subsection the mean square error mse of the estimated time delay and radial velocity can be respectively expressed as 18 mse τ 1 m c n 1 m c τ ˆ τ 2 and 19 mse v 1 m c n 1 m c v ˆ v 2 where m c is the number of independent trials τ ˆ and v ˆ are the estimated time delay and radial velocity respectively the cir is the same as that in the subsection 3 1 the snr and the measurement length are the two main parameters that affect the performance of the methods noting the measurement length is denoted by the percentage of observation which means different percentages of the received signal are selected from the starting time of the signal the number of independent trials is set as m c 200 during the simulation the snr of the received signal varies from 5 db to 35 db with a step of 5 db the percentage of observation represents the length of measurements and varies from 20 to 100 with a step of 10 the mses of the estimated time delay and radial velocity versus snr are displayed in fig 4 where we find the gsomp method can estimate the delay doppler parameters with high accuracy when the snr is larger than 15 db similarly the mses versus percentage of observation are shown in fig 5 where the proposed gsomp method yields quite low mses when the percentage of observation is larger than 60 when the percentage of length reaches 80 the mse τ and the mse v of the gsomp method are 1 047 and 0 106 respectively 4 experimental results the shallow water acoustic experiment was conducted in the east china sea in january 2015 the experimental area was nearly flat and the water depth was about 134 m the sound speed profile ssp collected during the experiment shows a typical characteristic of the mixed layer in winter which has a mean speed of 1530 ms 1 the hydrophone was anchored at the depth of 30 8 m and the source emitting lfm signals was towed by the vessel with linear motion at a speed of 2 5 ms 1 the lfm has a starting frequency of 2000 hz a bandwidth of 2000 hz and a duration of 1 s a depth sensor was tied to the moving source which indicates the source depth is 16 6 m the horizontal distance between the source and the receiver is 364 5 m which is derived from the global positioning system gps it is coincident that the moving direction of the source is almost consistent with the attachment direction between the source and the receiver the sampling rate of the hydrophone is f s 8000 hz the snr of the received signal is about 22 db within the narrow frequency band of the source signal the minimum maximum and the search interval of the radial velocity are set as v min 4 ms 1 v max 0 ms 1 and δv 0 1 ms 1 respectively then the doppler scale can be obtained from eq 2 noting that the doppler effect resulted from a number of factors in real applications and the radial velocity used here is the result of the conversion the search space of the time delay is set τmin 0 τmax 70 ms and δτ 1 f s 0 125 ms the observing length of the received signal vector is 8000 thus there are n 8000 rows and lm 22 400 columns in the dictionary matrix x the surface plots of the caf and ls methods with real data are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively which reveal five apparent paths in the first 70 ms but the resolution of the caf and ls methods is limited that they cannot determine the specific parameters of each path the sparse level is set k 5 and estimations of the gsomp method are shown in fig 6 e and f respectively the estimated parameters can be determined via the proposed gsomp method simply and directly the results demonstrate the high resolution of the gsomp method in estimating the delay doppler parameters as comparisons the surface plots of the romp and cosamp methods are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively the romp and cosamp methods fail to separate the multipath arrivals due to the existing environment noise and these two methods selected multiple column vectors in each iteration so that more interference were introduced in the process the estimated radial velocity by the gsomp method of the first path is 2 1 ms 1 which is close to the real moving speed 2 5 ms 1 of the source the radial velocity is a converted result of the total doppler effects therefore the difference exists between the estimated results and the modeled values from fig 6 f it is clear that each path has different delay doppler parameters the comparisons between the estimated time delays by the gsomp method and the modeled delays are shown in table 1 where the modeled values of the multipath arrivals are bellhop predicted the estimated time delays by the gsomp method are close to the model predicted delays thus it is reasonable that the accuracy of our method is verified 5 conclusions in view of the shortcomings of the caf method on estimating delay doppler parameters a sparse representation based method for moving lfm signals is proposed in this paper to improve the resolution and accuracy of the estimation results since the dictionary matrix is often large in practical problems the improved gsomp method is used to solve the sparse representation model which can avoid the calculation of inverse matrices in the iterative process and improve the robustness of the algorithm to facilitate its application the caf ls romp and cosamp methods are compared with the proposed method in simulations and experiments the results indicate the proposed method performs well in estimating the multipath delay doppler parameters both in terms of resolution and accuracy furthermore the proposed method may be applied to radial velocity measurement active sonar target detection and passive acoustic tomography in the future declaration

seismic responses clays suction bucket offshore wind turbine numerical simulation 1 introduction offshore wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years due to its abundant clean and renewable advantages related infrastructure construction is also rising on a large scale along with the development of offshore wind energy resources perveen et al 2014 in the harsh marine environment the offshore wind turbine not only suffers from the long term cyclic load such as wind wave and current but also the accidental load such as earthquake and impact the coupling effect of these loads makes the offshore wind turbine bear huge overturning moment and then causes excessive rotation angle and settlement deformation which will affect the normal operation of the wind turbine and even lead to the overall instability of the wind turbine byrne and houlsby 2003 the selection of foundation is very important for the safe service and engineering cost of offshore wind turbines the depth of sea water and the engineering properties of seabed soil should be fully considered at present the foundation types for offshore wind turbines include gravity foundations monopiles tripod foundations and suction buckets among them suction buckets are often installed in offshore soft clays seabed with shallow water depth because of its simple structure convenient installation low construction cost reusable and strong anti overturning moment it is more and more widely used in construction of offshore wind turbines houlsby and byrne 2000 so far most researches have focused on analyzing the responses of suction bucket foundation under monotonic and cyclic loads such as wind wave and current numerical simulations or model tests were performed to study the ultimate bearing capacity of suction bucket foundation under vertical loads horizontal loads bending moment loads and the combination of these loads maniar 2004 sukumaran et al 1999 cao et al 2003 monajemi and razak 2009 li et al 2014 ahn et al 2014 wang and cheng 2016 jin et al 2019 faizi et al 2019 the bearing capacity failure mechanism and load displacement responses of suction bucket foundation under cyclic loads induced by wind wave and current were also investigated by some researchers chen and randolph 2007 kim et al 2014 cheng et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 jin and liang 2021 gelagoti et al 2018 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2020 kourkoulis et al 2014 studied the influence of different soil foundation interface on seismic response of suction bucket foundation by using non linear three dimensional finite element analyses kim et al 2014 performed seismic fragility analysis of 5 mw offshore wind turbine considering nonlinear soil pile interaction using nonlinear spring elements wang et al 2017 investigated the seismic response of suction bucket with different geometric design in dry sand and saturated sand li et al 2017 performed a comprehensive analysis on the dynamic characteristics of the umbrella suction anchor foundation based on the finite element program ansys yang et al 2017 performed a three dimensional dynamic finite element analysis to predict the seismic responses of suction caisson foundation for an offshore wind turbine located in a sandy seabed by using a unified plasticity model for the large post liquefaction shear deformation of the sand it is very essential to perform the seismic response analysis of suction bucket foundation for the design of offshore wind turbine however the research on seismic responses of suction buckets located in a clayey seabed is still relatively rare in this study three dimensional finite element analysis was performed to predict the seismic responses of suction bucket by using a simplified kinematic hardening constitutive model available in the abaqus library the seismic bearing mechanism of bucket foundation in clays was investigated various factors affecting seismic responses of suction bucket were analyzed including the soil strength seismic intensity and frequency and bucket geometry 2 undrained dynamic constitutive model of saturated clay it is assumed that the behaviours of saturated clay foundations occur with no volume change under undrained conditions because of low permeability when they are subjected to rapid seismic loads for this case from the perspective of total stress the yielding of clays is independent of normal stress and only depends on deviatoric stress prevost 1977 anastasopoulos et al 2011 huang and liu 2015 hence the undrained dynamic non linear behaviour of clays is modeled by a total stress based simple kinematic hardening model the model is available in the abaqus library and has been used to the numerical simulation of soil structure interaction under cyclic or seismic loading anastasopoulos et al 2011 giannakos et al 2012 kourkoulis et al 2014 in the following sections the basic relationship of the model is briefly introduced and then the method of determining model parameters and the predictive ability of the model are discussed 2 1 basic relationship of the model the von mises yield criterion is adopted in this model as represented by eq 1 boldface letters in bold denote tensors unless otherwise specified below 1 f f σ α σ 0 0 σ is the stress tensor α is the backstress tensor σ 0 is the yield stress indicating the size of the yield surface f σ α is the equivalent mises stress with respect to α which is defined by eq 2 2 f σ α 3 2 s α d e v s α d e v where s is deviatoric stress tensor and α d e v is the deviatoric tensor of α given the associated plastic flow the plastic flow rate is defined as follows 3 ε p l ε p l f σ α σ where ε p l is the plastic strain rate ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain rate and ε p l 2 3 ε p l ε p l the model combines isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening to describe the cyclic response of soil the isotropic hardening behavior is controlled by the yield surface size σ 0 the evolution of σ 0 is related to the equivalent plastic strain ε p l which can be expressed as 4 σ 0 σ 0 q 1 e b ε p l where σ 0 is the initial yield stress that is the yield stress or yield surface size at zero plastic strain q and b are material parameters q is the maximum change in the size of the yield surface and b defines the changing rate of the yield surface size as plastic straining increases when q 0 or b 0 σ 0 σ 0 at this case the yield surface size remains unchanged and the model is simplified to pure kinematic hardening model the kinematic hardening behavior is realized by the evolution of backstress α which can be expressed as follows 5 α c 1 σ 0 σ α ε p l γ r α ε p l where c is the initial kinematic hardening modulus γ r determine the rate at which the kinematic hardening moduli decreases with increasing plastic deformation and γ r α ε p l introduces the nonlinear characteristics into the kinematic hardening law fig 1 a and b illustrate the evolution of the isotropic and the kinematic hardening components under uniaxial and multiaxial condition respectively as shown in fig 1 a when the plastic strain is very large σ tends to σ max regardless of softening of soil strength and α tends to the maximum value α s and α s c γ r on the π plane shown in fig 1 b α represents the centre of the yield surface which is always within the circle of radius 2 3 c γ r the yield surface is a circle with a radius of 2 3 σ 0 in addition any stress point on the yield surface must be within the circle with a radius of 2 3 σ max that is this circle is actually the strength limit surface of the material for undrained clay the maximum yield stress σ max is as follows 6 σ max 3 s u where s u is the undrained shear strength of clays 2 2 parameters determination and model predictions in order to simplify the calculation as much as possible in this research the constitutive model only considers the kinematic hardening component refer to the existing studies anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 hence in this case the size of the yield surface represented by eq 4 remains unchanged and satisfies σ 0 σ 0 the constitutive model contains only three model parameters σ 0 c and γ r they can be determined as follows ① the initial yield stress σ 0 actually represents the range of elastic domain of soil namely the size of the initial yield surface which can usually be represented by the following formula 7 σ 0 λ σ max λ 3 s u where the empirical value of λ is 0 1 0 3 ② the initial kinematic hardening modulus c represents the initial stiffness of the soil which is usually considered to be equal to the elastic moduli e empirically e can be taken as the multiple of undrained strength s u that is c e κ s u and κ is empirically taken to be 300 1800 anastasopoulos et al 2011 in addition when the shear wave velocity v s is known the initial maximum shear moduli g 0 can be obtained from the formula g 0 ρ v s 2 ρ is the density of soil and then the hardening modulus c can be determined by the formula of c e 2 1 v g 0 v is poisson s ratio ③ γ r determines the decreasing rate of the kinematic hardening modulus with increasing the plastic deformation which can be determined by eq 8 8 γ r c α s c 3 s u σ 0 cyclic simple shear tests are simulated using above constitutive model based on abaqus software and the simulation results are compared with test results to verify the prediction ability of the constitutive model the finite element model for cyclic simple shear tests is shown in fig 2 the model is a cube with a side length of 10 cm it is discretized by 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r fixed constraints are applied to the bottom boundary the displacement in z and y directions is 0 and only the movement along the shear direction x direction is allowed on lateral boundaries the cyclic displacement along the x direction is applied on the top surface of the model to simulate the cyclic shearing process on the displacement control mode the undrained shear strength of clay s u 20 kpa and the constitutive model parameter σ 0 0 1 σ max 3 46 kpa c 1440 s u 28 800 kpa γ r 924 fig 3 shows the predicted stress strain hysteresis curves under different amplitudes of shear strain γ in the range of 0 0001 0 01 the predictions indicate that the model can simulate the nonlinear and cyclic hysteresis characteristics of clays subjected to cyclic shearing the curves of g g 0 γ and ξ γ can be obtained based on the stress strain hysteresis curves under different strain amplitudes as shown in fig 4 here g g 0 is the shear modulus ratio and ξ is the damping ratio the maximum shear modulus g 0 is assumed to the value when the strain amplitude is below 10 6 the corresponding test results under different strain amplitudes li et al 2019 are also shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the simulation results agree with the test results in the overall however the predicted damping ratio is significantly larger than the test results in the case of large shear strain amplitude such as γ 10 2 which is mainly because the predicted stress strain hysteresis loop is relatively fatter and the corresponding hysteretic loop area is relatively larger as a result the damping ratio is overestimated under the large strain amplitude when the above constitutive model is adopted during numerical simulation if the undrained strength s u is known the parameter γ r can be determined according to eq 8 after obtaining parameters σ 0 and c the value of σ 0 and c actually depends on the empirical coefficients λ and κ respectively in this research the effects of parameters σ 0 and c on numerical simulation results are discussed by setting different λ and κ values fig 5 shows the comparison between test results and predictions of g g 0 γ and ξ γ curves for the same c c 1440 s u and different σ 0 λ 0 1 0 2 0 3 it can be seen that greater g g 0 and smaller ξ can be obtained using greater σ 0 for the same γ which causes the predicted g g 0 γ curves to move upward and ξ γ curves to move down the comparison for the same σ 0 σ 0 0 1 σ max and different c κ 500 1000 1800 is shown in fig 6 contrary to the former smaller g g 0 and greater ξ can be obtained using greater c for the same γ which causes the predicted g g 0 γ curves to move down and ξ γ curves to move upward especially the effects of parameters σ 0 and c is most significant when the shear strain amplitude γ is within the range of 10 4 10 3 3 finite element model referring to the geometric dimensions and loading conditions of the suction bucket foundation of a typical 3 5 mw offshore wind turbine in the north sea as shown in fig 7 a three dimensional finite element model for the interaction between clay ground and suction bucket foundation is established based on abaqus finite element software considering the symmetries of the geometries and loading conditions the model is established according to a half portion of the real case to improve the calculation efficiency as shown in fig 8 suction bucket foundation has a size with the diameter d 20 m length l 10 m the height of wind turbine tower h 30 m trial computation results indicate that setting the height and length of soil domain as 6d 120 m and 3 5d 70 m is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on simulation results the soil and suction bucket are discretized by 26214 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r in order to improve calculation efficiency and ensure calculation accuracy a finer mesh is applied within the depth of the embedment layer where nonlinearities are more prominent while mesh coarseness increases away from the foundation the computer used for the simulation has intel r core tm i7 10700 cpu 2 90 ghz and nvidia geforce gt 730 and intel r uhd graphics 630 and 16 g ram the cpu time for each simulation case is approximately 20 h the stiffness of suction bucket and wind turbine tower is much greater than that of clay especially the overlying soft clay hence the former is set as a rigid body the interaction between the bucket and the surrounding soil is modeled by the surface to surface contact in abaqus in this approach the master surface is defined as a surface that belongs to the material that either is relatively stiff or has a finer mesh geometry and the slave surface corresponds to the softer material or material with a coarser mesh in this study the bucket surface was defined as the master surface and the soil surface in contact with the bucket was defined as the slave surface hard contact was set in the normal direction of contact surface which allowed separation between the interface elements when they subjected to tension the penalty contact method was used in the tangential direction when the two surfaces were in contact the interface behavior was governed by coulomb s friction theory the critical friction shear stress τ c r i t at the contact surface can be expressed by τ c r i t μ p c in terms of frictional coefficient μ and contact pressure p c μ 0 3 in this study tangential slip occurred when the shear stress at the contact surface exceeded τ c r i t in addition the friction shear stress limit at the contact surface was set as τ max α s u to avoid unrealistic τ c r i t due to excessive p c the coefficient α mainly takes into account the disturbance of suction bucket installation to the soil at the contact surface and α is empirically taken as 0 85 dnv recommended practice rp e303 2005 displacement boundary conditions prevent the out of plane movement of the vertical face of symmetry as well as the displacement of the circumferential nodes in the y direction the base boundary of the model is simulated as rigid bedrock while for the vertical boundaries kinematic constrains are introduced forcing the opposite vertical sides to move simultaneously preventing any rotation simulating in that simplified way the seismic response of infinite soil domain tsinidis et al 2013 the vertical force applying to bucket foundation is mainly the dead weight of generator and tower which is about 6 mn the horizontal forces are mainly wave and wind loads which are assumed to be constant as a simplification treatment the wind load is 1 mn at 90 m above the top of suction bucket and the wave load is 3 mn at 10 m above it the resultant force of the two forces is 4 mn and the action point is located at 30 m above the top of the bucket foundation the clay site is subjected to a seismic accelerogram from the loma prieta earthquake record in the united states in 1989 which has a scaled peak ground acceleration pga of 0 1 g as shown in fig 9 the dynamic explicit computation is used during the numerical simulation the fundamental frequency of suction bucket soil interaction system should firstly be calculated before analyzing seismic responses and then the rayleigh damping of soil can be determined according to the first order frequency subsequently the seismic dynamic analysis is carried out according to the following three steps ① step 1 geostatic stress balance analysis that is gravity is applied to the soil and then the initial stress field is obtained while the initial displacement field is basically 0 ② step 2 the horizontal and vertical concentrated loads are applied to the wind turbine tower the responses of foundation system is analyzed using the quasi static method ③ step 3 the seismic load is applied to the clay site according to the selected seismic acceleration time history and the seismic dynamic response of foundation system is analyzed using dynamic explicit method it should be noted that viscous damping effects result from dynamic interaction between the turbine s submerged part and the water are not considered in this study which will lead to conservative results 4 seismic response of suction bucket foundation the rotation angle of bucket foundation at the mudline should not exceed 0 5 or other similar value as dictated by the turbine manufacturer to satisfy the requirements of serviceability limit state sls of offshore wind turbine owt during the design life arany et al 2015 hence it is necessary to analyze seismic dynamic responses of foundation system in the following section the failure mechanism of bucket foundation is firstly analyzed and then various factors affecting seismic responses of suction bucket are analyzed systematically 4 1 rotational bearing mechanism fig 10 shows the bearing mechanism under seismic loads peak acceleration scaling to 0 3 g obvious rotation occurs for the bucket foundation during earthquake however the rotation center of bucket soil system is not fixed at the beginning of earthquake the rotation center is located near point a as shown in fig 10 a and then it moves slowly to the right and lower as the earthquake continues the rotation center vibrates at the front and back up and down when approaching the seismic peak acceleration and moved down obviously after the seismic peak acceleration as shown in fig 10 b and c subsequently the rotation center continues to move slowly to the right and lower and finally tends to be stable as shown in fig 10 d in the process of earthquake the bucket wall near point a is subjected to active soil pressure and gradually separates from the soil behind forming a certain depth of gap while the bucket wall near point c is subjected to passive soil pressure gradually compresses the front soils the uneven vertical displacement occurs during rotation of the bucket foundation the point a mainly produces the upward displacement while the points b and c mainly produce the subsidence displacement and the settlement of point c is greater than that of point b in the overall a certain seismic subsidence occurs for the suction bucket foundation while rotating the shear stress strain curves of three typical nodes around the suction bucket are shown in fig 11 the shear stress strain curves show obvious nonlinear hysteresis and strain accumulation the cumulative shear strain of node 5294 in the passive region with a value of 5 3e 2 is more significant than that of node 4561 in the active region with a value of 7 5e 3 for node 710 in the bottom region the direction of strain accumulation is opposite to the former two due to the rotational bearing mechanism the accumulation of plastic shear strain for these nodes can well explain the accumulated rotation of the suction bucket during earthquake and further verify the prediction ability of the soil constitutive model 4 2 influence of soil strength the undrained shear strength s u is set as five cases of 20 kpa 30 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa and 80 kpa and the seismic peak acceleration for all cases is 0 1 g fig 12 a and b show the rotation angle time curves and settlement time curves of bucket respectively for different cases the rotation angle and settlement gradually increase over time and the higher the soil strength the smaller the rotation angle and settlement however when s u exceeds 60 kpa the change of the rotation angle and settlement tends to be stable which means that the influence of soil strength is no longer significant the peak rotation angle and settlement at different cases are shown in table 1 when the soil strength is 20 kpa and 30 kpa the peak rotation angle exceeds 0 5 the requirements of serviceability limit state of owt in addition in the early stage of earthquake action about the first 5 s the rotation angle and settlement increase rapidly and then gradually slow down however abrupt increasing occurs when approaching the peak acceleration and then slow down again this change trend is more significant when the soil strength is lower the predicted peak rotation angle at different soil strength are plotted in fig 13 it can be clearly seen that the peak rotation angle monotonically decreases with increasing soil strength and the decreasing rate is very large when the soil strength is relative low and gradually tends to be zero the simulation results can be fitted well by the following formula 9 θ 4400 s u 2 44 where θ is the peak rotation angle the fitting curve represented by eq 9 is also shown in fig 13 the formula can be used to approximately estimate the peak rotation angle of suction bucket foundation of owt in clays with different soil strength however the proposed formula is only applicable to those specific dimensions and loading conditions of the bucket for this study the applicability to other cases remains to be verified 4 3 influence of seismic intensity and frequency the seismic peak ground acceleration is set as three cases of 0 1 g 0 2 g and 0 3 g respectively and the soil strength s u for all cases is 40kpa the rotation angle and settlement time history under different cases are shown in fig 14 a and b respectively the influence of seismic intensity on rotation angle and settlement is not significant before the moment corresponding to the peak acceleration after the moment the rotation angle and settlement increase more significantly with larger seismic intensity the values for different earthquake intensities are shown in table 2 obviously the peak rotation angle exceeds the limit value of 0 5 when the peak acceleration is 0 2 g and 0 3 g in order to investigate the effect of seismic frequency on seismic responses of the bucket in addition to the loma prieta earthquake record above two other seismic records are selected for comparison the time history as input for the dynamic analyses along with their acceleration response spectra are shown in fig 15 the peak ground acceleration pga of three seismic waves are scaled to 0 3 g the predominant frequencies of seismic waves for loma prieta northern california and kobe are 2 6 hz 1 6 hz and 0 8 hz respectively the natural frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the 3 5 mw wind turbine structure is usually less than 0 7 hz the rotation angle of suction bucket for three different seismic waves is shown in fig 16 the comparation shows the seismic frequency has a significant effect on dynamic responses of bucket the larger cumulative rotation can occur when the seismic predominant frequency is closer to the frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the wind turbine structure 4 4 influence of bucket geometry four suction buckets with different geometric dimensions are set to study the influence of geometry characteristics on the seismic responses as shown in table 3 the soil strength is 40 kpa and the seismic peak acceleration is 0 3 g for all cases comparing rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 t2 and t3 in fig 17 a it can be concluded that increasing the length of the suction bucket or the embedment ratio can effectively reduce the final rotation angle when the diameter of suction bucket keeps constant comparing with the rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 and t4 we find that final rotation angle can also be effectively reduced by increasing the diameter and length of suction bucket when the embedment ratio keeps constant it should be noted that the geometric size of suction bucket has no significant effect on the rotation angle until reaching the peak acceleration in addition obvious negative rotation occurs when approaching the peak acceleration due to the shaking of the bucket in positive and negative directions and the sloshing phenomenon is more obvious with larger embedment ratio comparing the rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 t2 and t4 it can be concluded that increasing the diameter appropriately l d 0 5 d 20 to d 25 can reduce the final rotation angle more effectively than increasing the skirt length d 20 l d 0 5 to l d 0 7 when maintaining relative smaller embedment ratio it can be seen from fig 17 b that increasing the length or diameter of suction bucket will not reduce the settlement but will slightly increase it this may be because the increase of length or diameter will enhance the stability of bucket foundation and reduce the rotation angle however it will also increase the self weight of bucket foundation resulting in slightly increased settlement in overall the effect of the bucket geometry on settlement is not significant 5 conclusions this paper investigated the seismic responses of suction bucket foundation for offshore wind turbine in clays by performing a series of numerical simulation the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a simplified kinematic hardening model available in the abaqus library was used to capture the undrained dynamic non linear behaviour of clays the method of determining model parameters was introduced and the prediction ability of the model was validated by simulating cyclic simple shear tests then a three dimensional finite element model is developed by setting appropriate boundary and contact condition to analyze seismic responses of suction bucket in clays based on the above soil model 2 the rotational bearing mechanism of suction bucket foundation is revealed by the three dimensional finite element analysis significant accumulated rotation occurs for the suction bucket during the earthquake the rotation center moves continuously and vibrates when approaching the seismic peak acceleration and finally tends to be stable in the overall a certain seismic subsidence occurs for the suction bucket when rotating the shear stress strain curves of soil around the bucket show obvious nonlinear hysteresis and strain accumulation which can well explain the accumulated rotation of the bucket during earthquake 3 the smaller rotation angle and settlement can be obtained with higher soil strength however when soil strength exceeds a certain value its influence is no longer significant it should be noted that the lower soil strength can cause the peak rotation angle to exceed the requirements of serviceability limit state of owt 4 the rotation angle and settlement of suction bucket increases significantly with increasing the seismic intensity after reaching the peak acceleration the peak rotation angle may exceed the limit value of 0 5 under a large seismic peak acceleration in addition the larger cumulative rotation can occur when the seismic predominant frequency is closer to the frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the wind turbine structure 5 increasing the length or diameter of bucket can effectively reduce final rotation angle but have no significant effect on the settlement obvious negative rotation occurs when approaching the peak acceleration due to the shaking of the bucket in positive and negative directions and the sloshing phenomenon is more obvious with larger embedment ratio in addition increasing the diameter appropriately can reduce the final rotation angle more effectively than increasing the skirt length when maintaining relative smaller embedment ratio at present there are few relevant shaking table model test results of suction bucket in clays in the existing literature so the numerical simulation results of the interaction between the bucket and soil have not been verified yet in the follow up work we will try to perform relevant shaking table

seismic responses clays suction bucket offshore wind turbine numerical simulation 1 introduction offshore wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years due to its abundant clean and renewable advantages related infrastructure construction is also rising on a large scale along with the development of offshore wind energy resources perveen et al 2014 in the harsh marine environment the offshore wind turbine not only suffers from the long term cyclic load such as wind wave and current but also the accidental load such as earthquake and impact the coupling effect of these loads makes the offshore wind turbine bear huge overturning moment and then causes excessive rotation angle and settlement deformation which will affect the normal operation of the wind turbine and even lead to the overall instability of the wind turbine byrne and houlsby 2003 the selection of foundation is very important for the safe service and engineering cost of offshore wind turbines the depth of sea water and the engineering properties of seabed soil should be fully considered at present the foundation types for offshore wind turbines include gravity foundations monopiles tripod foundations and suction buckets among them suction buckets are often installed in offshore soft clays seabed with shallow water depth because of its simple structure convenient installation low construction cost reusable and strong anti overturning moment it is more and more widely used in construction of offshore wind turbines houlsby and byrne 2000 so far most researches have focused on analyzing the responses of suction bucket foundation under monotonic and cyclic loads such as wind wave and current numerical simulations or model tests were performed to study the ultimate bearing capacity of suction bucket foundation under vertical loads horizontal loads bending moment loads and the combination of these loads maniar 2004 sukumaran et al 1999 cao et al 2003 monajemi and razak 2009 li et al 2014 ahn et al 2014 wang and cheng 2016 jin et al 2019 faizi et al 2019 the bearing capacity failure mechanism and load displacement responses of suction bucket foundation under cyclic loads induced by wind wave and current were also investigated by some researchers chen and randolph 2007 kim et al 2014 cheng et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 jin and liang 2021 gelagoti et al 2018 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2020 kourkoulis et al 2014 studied the influence of different soil foundation interface on seismic response of suction bucket foundation by using non linear three dimensional finite element analyses kim et al 2014 performed seismic fragility analysis of 5 mw offshore wind turbine considering nonlinear soil pile interaction using nonlinear spring elements wang et al 2017 investigated the seismic response of suction bucket with different geometric design in dry sand and saturated sand li et al 2017 performed a comprehensive analysis on the dynamic characteristics of the umbrella suction anchor foundation based on the finite element program ansys yang et al 2017 performed a three dimensional dynamic finite element analysis to predict the seismic responses of suction caisson foundation for an offshore wind turbine located in a sandy seabed by using a unified plasticity model for the large post liquefaction shear deformation of the sand it is very essential to perform the seismic response analysis of suction bucket foundation for the design of offshore wind turbine however the research on seismic responses of suction buckets located in a clayey seabed is still relatively rare in this study three dimensional finite element analysis was performed to predict the seismic responses of suction bucket by using a simplified kinematic hardening constitutive model available in the abaqus library the seismic bearing mechanism of bucket foundation in clays was investigated various factors affecting seismic responses of suction bucket were analyzed including the soil strength seismic intensity and frequency and bucket geometry 2 undrained dynamic constitutive model of saturated clay it is assumed that the behaviours of saturated clay foundations occur with no volume change under undrained conditions because of low permeability when they are subjected to rapid seismic loads for this case from the perspective of total stress the yielding of clays is independent of normal stress and only depends on deviatoric stress prevost 1977 anastasopoulos et al 2011 huang and liu 2015 hence the undrained dynamic non linear behaviour of clays is modeled by a total stress based simple kinematic hardening model the model is available in the abaqus library and has been used to the numerical simulation of soil structure interaction under cyclic or seismic loading anastasopoulos et al 2011 giannakos et al 2012 kourkoulis et al 2014 in the following sections the basic relationship of the model is briefly introduced and then the method of determining model parameters and the predictive ability of the model are discussed 2 1 basic relationship of the model the von mises yield criterion is adopted in this model as represented by eq 1 boldface letters in bold denote tensors unless otherwise specified below 1 f f σ α σ 0 0 σ is the stress tensor α is the backstress tensor σ 0 is the yield stress indicating the size of the yield surface f σ α is the equivalent mises stress with respect to α which is defined by eq 2 2 f σ α 3 2 s α d e v s α d e v where s is deviatoric stress tensor and α d e v is the deviatoric tensor of α given the associated plastic flow the plastic flow rate is defined as follows 3 ε p l ε p l f σ α σ where ε p l is the plastic strain rate ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain rate and ε p l 2 3 ε p l ε p l the model combines isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening to describe the cyclic response of soil the isotropic hardening behavior is controlled by the yield surface size σ 0 the evolution of σ 0 is related to the equivalent plastic strain ε p l which can be expressed as 4 σ 0 σ 0 q 1 e b ε p l where σ 0 is the initial yield stress that is the yield stress or yield surface size at zero plastic strain q and b are material parameters q is the maximum change in the size of the yield surface and b defines the changing rate of the yield surface size as plastic straining increases when q 0 or b 0 σ 0 σ 0 at this case the yield surface size remains unchanged and the model is simplified to pure kinematic hardening model the kinematic hardening behavior is realized by the evolution of backstress α which can be expressed as follows 5 α c 1 σ 0 σ α ε p l γ r α ε p l where c is the initial kinematic hardening modulus γ r determine the rate at which the kinematic hardening moduli decreases with increasing plastic deformation and γ r α ε p l introduces the nonlinear characteristics into the kinematic hardening law fig 1 a and b illustrate the evolution of the isotropic and the kinematic hardening components under uniaxial and multiaxial condition respectively as shown in fig 1 a when the plastic strain is very large σ tends to σ max regardless of softening of soil strength and α tends to the maximum value α s and α s c γ r on the π plane shown in fig 1 b α represents the centre of the yield surface which is always within the circle of radius 2 3 c γ r the yield surface is a circle with a radius of 2 3 σ 0 in addition any stress point on the yield surface must be within the circle with a radius of 2 3 σ max that is this circle is actually the strength limit surface of the material for undrained clay the maximum yield stress σ max is as follows 6 σ max 3 s u where s u is the undrained shear strength of clays 2 2 parameters determination and model predictions in order to simplify the calculation as much as possible in this research the constitutive model only considers the kinematic hardening component refer to the existing studies anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 hence in this case the size of the yield surface represented by eq 4 remains unchanged and satisfies σ 0 σ 0 the constitutive model contains only three model parameters σ 0 c and γ r they can be determined as follows ① the initial yield stress σ 0 actually represents the range of elastic domain of soil namely the size of the initial yield surface which can usually be represented by the following formula 7 σ 0 λ σ max λ 3 s u where the empirical value of λ is 0 1 0 3 ② the initial kinematic hardening modulus c represents the initial stiffness of the soil which is usually considered to be equal to the elastic moduli e empirically e can be taken as the multiple of undrained strength s u that is c e κ s u and κ is empirically taken to be 300 1800 anastasopoulos et al 2011 in addition when the shear wave velocity v s is known the initial maximum shear moduli g 0 can be obtained from the formula g 0 ρ v s 2 ρ is the density of soil and then the hardening modulus c can be determined by the formula of c e 2 1 v g 0 v is poisson s ratio ③ γ r determines the decreasing rate of the kinematic hardening modulus with increasing the plastic deformation which can be determined by eq 8 8 γ r c α s c 3 s u σ 0 cyclic simple shear tests are simulated using above constitutive model based on abaqus software and the simulation results are compared with test results to verify the prediction ability of the constitutive model the finite element model for cyclic simple shear tests is shown in fig 2 the model is a cube with a side length of 10 cm it is discretized by 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r fixed constraints are applied to the bottom boundary the displacement in z and y directions is 0 and only the movement along the shear direction x direction is allowed on lateral boundaries the cyclic displacement along the x direction is applied on the top surface of the model to simulate the cyclic shearing process on the displacement control mode the undrained shear strength of clay s u 20 kpa and the constitutive model parameter σ 0 0 1 σ max 3 46 kpa c 1440 s u 28 800 kpa γ r 924 fig 3 shows the predicted stress strain hysteresis curves under different amplitudes of shear strain γ in the range of 0 0001 0 01 the predictions indicate that the model can simulate the nonlinear and cyclic hysteresis characteristics of clays subjected to cyclic shearing the curves of g g 0 γ and ξ γ can be obtained based on the stress strain hysteresis curves under different strain amplitudes as shown in fig 4 here g g 0 is the shear modulus ratio and ξ is the damping ratio the maximum shear modulus g 0 is assumed to the value when the strain amplitude is below 10 6 the corresponding test results under different strain amplitudes li et al 2019 are also shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the simulation results agree with the test results in the overall however the predicted damping ratio is significantly larger than the test results in the case of large shear strain amplitude such as γ 10 2 which is mainly because the predicted stress strain hysteresis loop is relatively fatter and the corresponding hysteretic loop area is relatively larger as a result the damping ratio is overestimated under the large strain amplitude when the above constitutive model is adopted during numerical simulation if the undrained strength s u is known the parameter γ r can be determined according to eq 8 after obtaining parameters σ 0 and c the value of σ 0 and c actually depends on the empirical coefficients λ and κ respectively in this research the effects of parameters σ 0 and c on numerical simulation results are discussed by setting different λ and κ values fig 5 shows the comparison between test results and predictions of g g 0 γ and ξ γ curves for the same c c 1440 s u and different σ 0 λ 0 1 0 2 0 3 it can be seen that greater g g 0 and smaller ξ can be obtained using greater σ 0 for the same γ which causes the predicted g g 0 γ curves to move upward and ξ γ curves to move down the comparison for the same σ 0 σ 0 0 1 σ max and different c κ 500 1000 1800 is shown in fig 6 contrary to the former smaller g g 0 and greater ξ can be obtained using greater c for the same γ which causes the predicted g g 0 γ curves to move down and ξ γ curves to move upward especially the effects of parameters σ 0 and c is most significant when the shear strain amplitude γ is within the range of 10 4 10 3 3 finite element model referring to the geometric dimensions and loading conditions of the suction bucket foundation of a typical 3 5 mw offshore wind turbine in the north sea as shown in fig 7 a three dimensional finite element model for the interaction between clay ground and suction bucket foundation is established based on abaqus finite element software considering the symmetries of the geometries and loading conditions the model is established according to a half portion of the real case to improve the calculation efficiency as shown in fig 8 suction bucket foundation has a size with the diameter d 20 m length l 10 m the height of wind turbine tower h 30 m trial computation results indicate that setting the height and length of soil domain as 6d 120 m and 3 5d 70 m is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on simulation results the soil and suction bucket are discretized by 26214 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r in order to improve calculation efficiency and ensure calculation accuracy a finer mesh is applied within the depth of the embedment layer where nonlinearities are more prominent while mesh coarseness increases away from the foundation the computer used for the simulation has intel r core tm i7 10700 cpu 2 90 ghz and nvidia geforce gt 730 and intel r uhd graphics 630 and 16 g ram the cpu time for each simulation case is approximately 20 h the stiffness of suction bucket and wind turbine tower is much greater than that of clay especially the overlying soft clay hence the former is set as a rigid body the interaction between the bucket and the surrounding soil is modeled by the surface to surface contact in abaqus in this approach the master surface is defined as a surface that belongs to the material that either is relatively stiff or has a finer mesh geometry and the slave surface corresponds to the softer material or material with a coarser mesh in this study the bucket surface was defined as the master surface and the soil surface in contact with the bucket was defined as the slave surface hard contact was set in the normal direction of contact surface which allowed separation between the interface elements when they subjected to tension the penalty contact method was used in the tangential direction when the two surfaces were in contact the interface behavior was governed by coulomb s friction theory the critical friction shear stress τ c r i t at the contact surface can be expressed by τ c r i t μ p c in terms of frictional coefficient μ and contact pressure p c μ 0 3 in this study tangential slip occurred when the shear stress at the contact surface exceeded τ c r i t in addition the friction shear stress limit at the contact surface was set as τ max α s u to avoid unrealistic τ c r i t due to excessive p c the coefficient α mainly takes into account the disturbance of suction bucket installation to the soil at the contact surface and α is empirically taken as 0 85 dnv recommended practice rp e303 2005 displacement boundary conditions prevent the out of plane movement of the vertical face of symmetry as well as the displacement of the circumferential nodes in the y direction the base boundary of the model is simulated as rigid bedrock while for the vertical boundaries kinematic constrains are introduced forcing the opposite vertical sides to move simultaneously preventing any rotation simulating in that simplified way the seismic response of infinite soil domain tsinidis et al 2013 the vertical force applying to bucket foundation is mainly the dead weight of generator and tower which is about 6 mn the horizontal forces are mainly wave and wind loads which are assumed to be constant as a simplification treatment the wind load is 1 mn at 90 m above the top of suction bucket and the wave load is 3 mn at 10 m above it the resultant force of the two forces is 4 mn and the action point is located at 30 m above the top of the bucket foundation the clay site is subjected to a seismic accelerogram from the loma prieta earthquake record in the united states in 1989 which has a scaled peak ground acceleration pga of 0 1 g as shown in fig 9 the dynamic explicit computation is used during the numerical simulation the fundamental frequency of suction bucket soil interaction system should firstly be calculated before analyzing seismic responses and then the rayleigh damping of soil can be determined according to the first order frequency subsequently the seismic dynamic analysis is carried out according to the following three steps ① step 1 geostatic stress balance analysis that is gravity is applied to the soil and then the initial stress field is obtained while the initial displacement field is basically 0 ② step 2 the horizontal and vertical concentrated loads are applied to the wind turbine tower the responses of foundation system is analyzed using the quasi static method ③ step 3 the seismic load is applied to the clay site according to the selected seismic acceleration time history and the seismic dynamic response of foundation system is analyzed using dynamic explicit method it should be noted that viscous damping effects result from dynamic interaction between the turbine s submerged part and the water are not considered in this study which will lead to conservative results 4 seismic response of suction bucket foundation the rotation angle of bucket foundation at the mudline should not exceed 0 5 or other similar value as dictated by the turbine manufacturer to satisfy the requirements of serviceability limit state sls of offshore wind turbine owt during the design life arany et al 2015 hence it is necessary to analyze seismic dynamic responses of foundation system in the following section the failure mechanism of bucket foundation is firstly analyzed and then various factors affecting seismic responses of suction bucket are analyzed systematically 4 1 rotational bearing mechanism fig 10 shows the bearing mechanism under seismic loads peak acceleration scaling to 0 3 g obvious rotation occurs for the bucket foundation during earthquake however the rotation center of bucket soil system is not fixed at the beginning of earthquake the rotation center is located near point a as shown in fig 10 a and then it moves slowly to the right and lower as the earthquake continues the rotation center vibrates at the front and back up and down when approaching the seismic peak acceleration and moved down obviously after the seismic peak acceleration as shown in fig 10 b and c subsequently the rotation center continues to move slowly to the right and lower and finally tends to be stable as shown in fig 10 d in the process of earthquake the bucket wall near point a is subjected to active soil pressure and gradually separates from the soil behind forming a certain depth of gap while the bucket wall near point c is subjected to passive soil pressure gradually compresses the front soils the uneven vertical displacement occurs during rotation of the bucket foundation the point a mainly produces the upward displacement while the points b and c mainly produce the subsidence displacement and the settlement of point c is greater than that of point b in the overall a certain seismic subsidence occurs for the suction bucket foundation while rotating the shear stress strain curves of three typical nodes around the suction bucket are shown in fig 11 the shear stress strain curves show obvious nonlinear hysteresis and strain accumulation the cumulative shear strain of node 5294 in the passive region with a value of 5 3e 2 is more significant than that of node 4561 in the active region with a value of 7 5e 3 for node 710 in the bottom region the direction of strain accumulation is opposite to the former two due to the rotational bearing mechanism the accumulation of plastic shear strain for these nodes can well explain the accumulated rotation of the suction bucket during earthquake and further verify the prediction ability of the soil constitutive model 4 2 influence of soil strength the undrained shear strength s u is set as five cases of 20 kpa 30 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa and 80 kpa and the seismic peak acceleration for all cases is 0 1 g fig 12 a and b show the rotation angle time curves and settlement time curves of bucket respectively for different cases the rotation angle and settlement gradually increase over time and the higher the soil strength the smaller the rotation angle and settlement however when s u exceeds 60 kpa the change of the rotation angle and settlement tends to be stable which means that the influence of soil strength is no longer significant the peak rotation angle and settlement at different cases are shown in table 1 when the soil strength is 20 kpa and 30 kpa the peak rotation angle exceeds 0 5 the requirements of serviceability limit state of owt in addition in the early stage of earthquake action about the first 5 s the rotation angle and settlement increase rapidly and then gradually slow down however abrupt increasing occurs when approaching the peak acceleration and then slow down again this change trend is more significant when the soil strength is lower the predicted peak rotation angle at different soil strength are plotted in fig 13 it can be clearly seen that the peak rotation angle monotonically decreases with increasing soil strength and the decreasing rate is very large when the soil strength is relative low and gradually tends to be zero the simulation results can be fitted well by the following formula 9 θ 4400 s u 2 44 where θ is the peak rotation angle the fitting curve represented by eq 9 is also shown in fig 13 the formula can be used to approximately estimate the peak rotation angle of suction bucket foundation of owt in clays with different soil strength however the proposed formula is only applicable to those specific dimensions and loading conditions of the bucket for this study the applicability to other cases remains to be verified 4 3 influence of seismic intensity and frequency the seismic peak ground acceleration is set as three cases of 0 1 g 0 2 g and 0 3 g respectively and the soil strength s u for all cases is 40kpa the rotation angle and settlement time history under different cases are shown in fig 14 a and b respectively the influence of seismic intensity on rotation angle and settlement is not significant before the moment corresponding to the peak acceleration after the moment the rotation angle and settlement increase more significantly with larger seismic intensity the values for different earthquake intensities are shown in table 2 obviously the peak rotation angle exceeds the limit value of 0 5 when the peak acceleration is 0 2 g and 0 3 g in order to investigate the effect of seismic frequency on seismic responses of the bucket in addition to the loma prieta earthquake record above two other seismic records are selected for comparison the time history as input for the dynamic analyses along with their acceleration response spectra are shown in fig 15 the peak ground acceleration pga of three seismic waves are scaled to 0 3 g the predominant frequencies of seismic waves for loma prieta northern california and kobe are 2 6 hz 1 6 hz and 0 8 hz respectively the natural frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the 3 5 mw wind turbine structure is usually less than 0 7 hz the rotation angle of suction bucket for three different seismic waves is shown in fig 16 the comparation shows the seismic frequency has a significant effect on dynamic responses of bucket the larger cumulative rotation can occur when the seismic predominant frequency is closer to the frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the wind turbine structure 4 4 influence of bucket geometry four suction buckets with different geometric dimensions are set to study the influence of geometry characteristics on the seismic responses as shown in table 3 the soil strength is 40 kpa and the seismic peak acceleration is 0 3 g for all cases comparing rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 t2 and t3 in fig 17 a it can be concluded that increasing the length of the suction bucket or the embedment ratio can effectively reduce the final rotation angle when the diameter of suction bucket keeps constant comparing with the rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 and t4 we find that final rotation angle can also be effectively reduced by increasing the diameter and length of suction bucket when the embedment ratio keeps constant it should be noted that the geometric size of suction bucket has no significant effect on the rotation angle until reaching the peak acceleration in addition obvious negative rotation occurs when approaching the peak acceleration due to the shaking of the bucket in positive and negative directions and the sloshing phenomenon is more obvious with larger embedment ratio comparing the rotation angle time curves of the suction bucket t1 t2 and t4 it can be concluded that increasing the diameter appropriately l d 0 5 d 20 to d 25 can reduce the final rotation angle more effectively than increasing the skirt length d 20 l d 0 5 to l d 0 7 when maintaining relative smaller embedment ratio it can be seen from fig 17 b that increasing the length or diameter of suction bucket will not reduce the settlement but will slightly increase it this may be because the increase of length or diameter will enhance the stability of bucket foundation and reduce the rotation angle however it will also increase the self weight of bucket foundation resulting in slightly increased settlement in overall the effect of the bucket geometry on settlement is not significant 5 conclusions this paper investigated the seismic responses of suction bucket foundation for offshore wind turbine in clays by performing a series of numerical simulation the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a simplified kinematic hardening model available in the abaqus library was used to capture the undrained dynamic non linear behaviour of clays the method of determining model parameters was introduced and the prediction ability of the model was validated by simulating cyclic simple shear tests then a three dimensional finite element model is developed by setting appropriate boundary and contact condition to analyze seismic responses of suction bucket in clays based on the above soil model 2 the rotational bearing mechanism of suction bucket foundation is revealed by the three dimensional finite element analysis significant accumulated rotation occurs for the suction bucket during the earthquake the rotation center moves continuously and vibrates when approaching the seismic peak acceleration and finally tends to be stable in the overall a certain seismic subsidence occurs for the suction bucket when rotating the shear stress strain curves of soil around the bucket show obvious nonlinear hysteresis and strain accumulation which can well explain the accumulated rotation of the bucket during earthquake 3 the smaller rotation angle and settlement can be obtained with higher soil strength however when soil strength exceeds a certain value its influence is no longer significant it should be noted that the lower soil strength can cause the peak rotation angle to exceed the requirements of serviceability limit state of owt 4 the rotation angle and settlement of suction bucket increases significantly with increasing the seismic intensity after reaching the peak acceleration the peak rotation angle may exceed the limit value of 0 5 under a large seismic peak acceleration in addition the larger cumulative rotation can occur when the seismic predominant frequency is closer to the frequency ranges of 1p and 3p for the wind turbine structure 5 increasing the length or diameter of bucket can effectively reduce final rotation angle but have no significant effect on the settlement obvious negative rotation occurs when approaching the peak acceleration due to the shaking of the bucket in positive and negative directions and the sloshing phenomenon is more obvious with larger embedment ratio in addition increasing the diameter appropriately can reduce the final rotation angle more effectively than increasing the skirt length when maintaining relative smaller embedment ratio at present there are few relevant shaking table model test results of suction bucket in clays in the existing literature so the numerical simulation results of the interaction between the bucket and soil have not been verified yet in the follow up work we will try to perform relevant shaking table

simplified models and numerical solutions el ouni et al 2012 yuan et al 2018 which fails to present a refined modelling approach or a unified framework for nonlinear dynamic analysis of the stac the mechanism and conditions for the occurrence of harmful vibration under extreme environmental effects have not been well investigated especially an important finding of this article is that in contrast to earlier studies which usually only use the first few modal information for dynamic analysis this paper demonstrates that such an approximation that has been widely adopted will bring unignorable errors take a real anchor cable as an example when only the first mode and the first three modes are used for response analysis the maximum errors are 58 64 and 16 78 respectively therefore it is necessary to develop a more reasonable and accurate dynamic analysis method to re investigate the underlying mechanism and stability properties of nonlinear oscillation of the stac in view of this this paper will first present a generalized dynamic modelling approach and then propose a unified framework for nonlinear dynamic analysis of the stac 2 modelling approach in the past decades extensive research has focused on the dynamic modelling of stacs including the spring model lumped mass model multi body dynamic model taut string model and the finite element model the taut string model with two hinged ends turns out to be the most widely used model due to its simple form see fig 1 since it is a continuous mechanics model the taut string model contains complete modal information and has been widely used in the dynamic analysis of stacs however related studies have proved that the influence of the flexural stiffness and boundary conditions on structural dynamic characteristics cannot be ignored especially for short and medium cables fei et al 2020 regardless of the bending stiffness and the inaccurate simulation of boundary conditions make the taut string model difficult to accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the stac in the actual structure for the boundary conditions at the upper end of the anchor cable since the floating body itself is a flexible structure such as the submerge floating tunnel it is more reasonable to use an elastic boundary instead of a pined boundary in this paper a shallow sagged euler beam model is suggested to simulate the stac see fig 2 due to the fact that the stac usually has a large pretension its sag to span ratio e is usually less than 1 8 and the static configuration y x can thus be described by a quadratic parabola namely y x 4 e x l l x where f and l are the sag and chord length of the cable irvine 1978 e i is the flexural stiffness of the cable according to the dynamic model given in fig 2 the free vibration equation of the stac is dan et al 2019 1 e i 4 u x 4 m 2 u t 2 c u t h 2 u x 2 h d 2 y d x 2 f d where m c are mass per unit length and damping coefficient of the stac h is the

where c m is the additional mass coefficient c d ρ w and d t are drag coefficient water density and the diameter of the cable respectively the combined vibration considering the parametric excitation

the lift force can be approximately expressed as a harmonic function of the vortex shedding frequency ω v that is 5 f l 1 2 ρ w d t c l v sin θ 2 cos ω v t where c l is the lift coefficient 3 analysis method existing methods for dynamic analysis of the stac fall into two categories the time domain method and frequency domain method the frequency domain method is superior to the time domain method due to its convenient stable and time consuming solution however since the frequency domain method usually needs to use the perturbation method the accuracy of the derived solution the solution of the derived system will directly affect the accuracy of the basic solution solution of the original system therefore higher requirements are put forward on the accuracy of the derived solution thus limiting the calculation accuracy and applicability of the frequency domain method the present work is devoted to filling the theoretical gaps of the modelling approach and stability analysis framework of the stac and aims to provide deep insights for understanding the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the system 3 1 improved galerkin s method from eqs 1 4 we can find that the free and forced vibration equations of the stacs are complicated nonlinear equations with both integral term and quadratic nonlinear term in addition since it is a fourth order partial differential equation pde it is usually necessary to separate the variables first and convert it into an ordinary differential equation ode using the galerkin discretization method that is assuming that the motion of cable can be expressed by 6 u x t n 1 φ n x q n t where φ n x is the trial function of the derived system q n t is the generalized coordinates submitting eq 6 into eq 1 and using the orthogonality of the mode shapes we can obtain an infinite number of nonlinear odes about q n t where n is the mode order it is worth noting that the rationality of the mode function selection will directly affect the accuracy and rationality of the calculation results based on the dynamic model present above we propose an improved galerkin method which can give the accurate mode function of the derived system thereby ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analysis conventional method existing research usually uses standard sine function as the trial function for the convenience of analysis namely the mode function of a taut string 7 φ n x sin n π x l the modal frequency of a taut string can be approximately taken as ω n 2 n π l h m although such an approximation brings a lot of convenience it ignores the flexural stiffness and lateral support effect provided by the floating body the mode function in eq 7 cannot accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the stac in view of this this article will present a generalized method to obtain the exact mode shape of the stac system shown in fig 2 suggested method by substituting eq 6 into eq 1 and letting c h c d 0 the exact mode shape φ x of stacs is determined by 8 e i φ h φ m ω 2 φ 0 where m m π d t 2 4 c m ρ w eq 8 is exactly the motion differential equation of the derived system and ω is the modal frequency of the system the general solution of eq 8 is 9 φ x a 1 e p x a 2 e p l x a 3 cos q x a 4 sin q x where p h 2 e i h 2 e i 2 m e i ω 2 q h 2 e i h 2 e i 2 m e i ω 2 the four undetermined coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 can be determined from the boundary conditions below 10 φ 0 0 φ 0 0 φ l 0 e i φ l h φ l k φ l by introducing harmonic vibration hypothesis u x t φ x e i ω t according to the dynamic stiffness method dan et al 2019 we have 11 k α e i k 11 k 12 k 13 k 14 k 12 k 22 k 14 k 24 k 13 k 14 k 11 k k 12 k 14 k 24 k 12 k 22 α a θ a l α b θ b l 0 0 0 0 where α a θ a α b θ b and v a m a v b m b are the nodal displacement and nodal force vector k k e i matrix k is namely the dynamic stiffness matrix of the stac the modal frequencies of the linear undamped system described by eq 8 can be determined by following characteristic equation 12 det k 0 eq 12 is a complicated transcendental equation a prominent method to deal with this problem is to apply the wittrick williams w w algorithms williams and wittrick 1970 the author of this paper has improved the original w w algorithm to make it suitable for complicated structures and complicated boundary conditions more details about w w algorithm can been seen in han et al 2018 after solving ω from eq 12 substituting eq 9 into eq 10 the mode shape function φ x can be solved 13 φ x e p l x e p l x p e 2 p l p q cos q l sin q x eq 13 is the exact mode shape function of the stac according to eqs 12 and 13 any order modal frequency ω n and mode shape φ n x can be determined since ω n and φ n x are both accurately solved using eq 13 instead of eq 7 for subsequent response and stability analysis can not only improve the calculation accuracy but also guarantee the calculation efficiency due to its analytical form 3 2 analytical solution for free vibration the free vibration of the stac described by eq 1 is a fourth order pde with quadratic nonlinear damping dan et al 2019 this section will use the improved galerkin method to derive the perturbation solution for the response of the stac substituting eqs 6 and 13 into eq 1 yields 14 e i n 1 q n φ n h n 1 q n φ n m n 1 q n φ n c n 1 q n φ n η n 1 q n 0 l φ n d x c n 1 φ n q n φ n q n where η e a m g cos θ 2 l e h 2 c 1 2 c d ρ w d t multiply both sides of eq 14 by φ m x and then integrate in the range 0 l according to the orthogonality of the mode shape we have 15 q m 2 ω m ξ m q

coefficient caused by geometric nonlinear of the cable take the stac to be studied below as an example shown in table 2 the first six order modal coupling coefficients f m n are listed in table 1 for the convenience of comparison each number in table 1 is multiplied by 10000 results show that when n 1 the absolute value of f m n is obviously larger than n others essentially the modal coupling coefficient reflects the mutual influence of additional cable forces h between different modes for the first order mode since the mode shape is symmetric and has no mode nodes the cable has the largest elastic elongation and the h is much larger than with other modes therefore only the case of n 1 is considered in the calculation such reasonable simplification can make eq 15 decoupled 16 q m

stability analysis method unlike most studies that separately study the viv and parametric vibration of the stac in order to explore the possible interaction between the two and potentially dangerous vibration phenomena this paper study the combined vibration of viv and parametric vibration of the stac substituting eq 6 into eq 4 and multiplying φ m x both sides by doing integrate in the range 0 l and according to the orthogonality of the mode shape we have 22 q m c m q m q m ω m 2 h ε r cos ω s t ˆ m n 1 q n r m n η n 1 q n f m n k l m cos ω v t ˆ μ m q m q m where μ c 0 l φ m 2 φ m d x 0 l φ

value of r m n is the largest while if m n the absolute value of r m n is much smaller than r m m indicating that the modal coupling effect can basically be ignored in particular for the cable hinged at both ends its mode shape is φ m sin m π x l and thus r m n 0 except when m n in view of this the following will only consider the situation m n for convenience when the excitation frequency ω s 2 ω

condition for the negative real part of the characteristic root is p 0 and q 0 3 4 accuracy verification and discussion based on analytical theory above take the design of a submerged floating tunnel as an example the basic parameters of the stac are given in table 2 take initial displacement u x 0 5 l t 0 0 01 and initial velocity u x 0 5 l t 0 0 as an example according to eq 21 the response of the cable can be obtained during the analysis it should first transform the physical coordinates into generalized coordinates since existing research usually only uses first few modes to calculate the response of the stac it has not been discussed how many modes should be retained for dynamic analysis the analysis method proposed in this article may give some insights about the relationship between calculation accuracy and retained number of modes fig 3 a gives the comparison of the results calculated by the first three and six modes it can be seen that compared with first six modes the maximum relative differences maximum difference maximum displacement 16 78 which illustrates that even if the first three modes are used to response analysis the error is still non negligible to further discuss how many modes should be retained we have calculated the results obtained from the first ten modes respectively see table 3 results shows that compared with the results calculated by first 9 modes using the first 8 modes will lead to a maximum relative difference of 8 16 however the maximum relative difference between the first 9 and 10 modes is only 0 09 which illustrates that at least the first nine order modal information is needed to obtain the response result with ideal accuracy through such self consistent analysis when using the galerkin discretization method for structural dynamic analysis we can determine how many modal information should be retained to ensure the accuracy of the analysis result 4 conclusion the nonlinear vibration of underwater anchor cables is a very significant but complicated problem although some research work has been done its dynamic modelling and analysis methods are still not perfect this paper proposes a refined modelling approach and a unified framework for stability analysis of the stac which is very convenient to obtain high order modal responses and therefore greatly improves the calculation efficiency finally we further suggest a self consistent accuracy verification method which can determine how many modal information should be retained at least in order to obtain response results with ideal accuracy another major contribution of this paper is to provide a framework for stability analysis of the stac it is foreseeable that the reported approach and results obtained in this paper are helpful for further

framework of the stac and aims to provide deep insights for understanding the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the system 3 1 improved galerkin s method from eqs 1 4 we can find that the free and forced vibration equations of the stacs are complicated nonlinear equations with both integral term and quadratic nonlinear term in addition since it is a fourth order partial differential equation pde it is usually necessary to separate the variables first and convert it into an ordinary differential equation ode using the galerkin discretization method that is assuming that the motion of cable can be expressed by 6 u x t n 1 φ n x q n t where φ n x is the trial function of the derived system q n t is the generalized coordinates submitting eq 6 into eq 1 and using the orthogonality of the mode shapes we can obtain an infinite number of nonlinear odes about q n t where n is the mode order it is worth noting that the rationality of the mode function selection will directly affect the accuracy and rationality of the calculation results based on the dynamic model present above we propose an improved galerkin method which can give the accurate mode function of the derived system thereby ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analysis conventional method existing research usually uses standard sine function as the trial function for the convenience of analysis namely the mode function of a taut string 7 φ n x sin n π x l the modal frequency of a taut string can be approximately taken as ω n 2 n π l h m although such an approximation brings a lot of convenience it ignores the flexural stiffness and lateral support effect provided by the floating body the mode function in eq 7 cannot accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the stac in view of this this article will present a generalized method to obtain the exact mode shape of the stac system shown in fig 2 suggested method by substituting eq 6 into eq 1 and letting c h c d 0 the exact mode shape φ x of stacs is determined by 8 e i φ h φ m ω 2 φ 0 where m m π d t 2 4 c m ρ w eq 8 is exactly the motion differential equation of the derived system and ω is the modal frequency of the system the general solution of eq 8 is 9 φ x a 1 e p x a 2 e p l x a 3 cos q x a 4 sin q x where p h 2 e i h 2 e i 2 m e i ω 2 q h 2 e i h 2 e i 2 m e i ω 2 the four undetermined coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 can be determined from the boundary conditions below 10 φ 0 0 φ 0 0 φ l 0 e i φ l h φ l k φ l by introducing harmonic vibration hypothesis u x t φ x e i ω t according to the dynamic stiffness method dan et al 2019 we

nodal force vector k k e i matrix k is namely the dynamic stiffness matrix of the stac the modal frequencies of the linear undamped system described by eq 8 can be determined by following characteristic equation 12 det k 0 eq 12 is a complicated transcendental equation a prominent method to deal with this problem is to apply the wittrick williams w w algorithms williams and wittrick 1970 the author of this paper has improved the original w w algorithm to make it suitable for complicated structures and complicated boundary conditions more details about w w algorithm can been seen in han et al 2018 after solving ω from eq 12 substituting eq 9 into eq 10 the mode shape function φ x can be solved 13 φ x e p l x e p l x p e 2 p l p q cos q l sin q x eq 13 is the exact mode shape function of the stac according to eqs 12 and 13 any order modal frequency ω n and mode shape φ n x can be determined since ω n and φ n x are both accurately solved using eq 13 instead of eq 7 for subsequent response and stability analysis can not only improve the calculation accuracy but also guarantee the calculation efficiency due to its analytical form 3 2 analytical solution for free vibration the free vibration of the stac described by eq 1 is a fourth order pde with quadratic nonlinear damping dan et al 2019 this section will use the improved galerkin method to derive the perturbation solution for the response of the stac substituting eqs 6 and 13 into eq 1 yields 14 e i n 1 q n φ n h n 1 q n φ n m n 1 q n φ n c n 1 q n φ n η n 1 q n 0 l φ n d x c n 1 φ n q n φ n q n where η e a m g cos θ 2 l e h 2 c 1 2 c d ρ w d t multiply both sides of eq 14 by φ m x and then integrate in the range 0 l according to the orthogonality of the mode shape we have 15 q m 2 ω m ξ m q

coefficient caused by geometric nonlinear of the cable take the stac to be studied below as an example shown in table 2 the first six order modal coupling coefficients f m n are listed in table 1 for the convenience of comparison each number in table 1 is multiplied by 10000 results show that when n 1 the absolute value of f m n is obviously larger than n others essentially the modal coupling coefficient reflects the mutual influence of additional cable forces h between different modes for the first order mode since the mode shape is symmetric and has no mode nodes the cable has the largest elastic elongation and the h is much larger than with other modes therefore only the case of n 1 is considered in the calculation such reasonable simplification can make eq 15 decoupled 16 q m

stability analysis method unlike most studies that separately study the viv and parametric vibration of the stac in order to explore the possible interaction between the two and potentially dangerous vibration phenomena this paper study the combined vibration of viv and parametric vibration of the stac substituting eq 6 into eq 4 and multiplying φ m x both sides by doing integrate in the range 0 l

at both ends its mode shape is φ m sin m π x l and thus r m n 0 except when m n in view of this the following will only consider the situation m n for convenience when the excitation frequency ω s 2 ω

condition for the negative real part of the characteristic root is p 0 and q 0 3 4 accuracy verification and discussion based on analytical theory above take the design of a submerged floating tunnel as an example the basic parameters of the stac are given in table 2 take initial displacement u x 0 5 l t 0 0 01 and initial velocity u x 0 5 l t 0 0 as an example according to eq 21 the response of the cable can be obtained during the analysis it should first transform the physical coordinates into generalized coordinates since existing research usually only uses first few modes to calculate the response of the stac it has not been discussed how many modes should be retained for dynamic analysis the analysis method proposed in this article may give some insights about the relationship between calculation accuracy and retained number of modes fig 3 a gives the comparison of the results calculated by the first three and six modes it can be seen that compared with first six modes the maximum relative differences maximum difference maximum displacement 16 78 which illustrates that even if the first three modes are used to response analysis the error is still non negligible to further discuss how many modes should be retained we have calculated the results obtained from the first ten modes respectively see table 3 results shows that compared with the results calculated by first 9 modes using the first 8 modes will lead to a maximum relative difference of 8 16 however the maximum relative difference between the first 9 and 10 modes is only 0 09 which illustrates that at least the first nine order modal information is needed to obtain the response result with ideal accuracy through such self consistent analysis when using the galerkin discretization method for structural dynamic analysis we can determine how many modal information should be retained to ensure the accuracy of the analysis result 4 conclusion the nonlinear vibration of underwater anchor cables is a very significant but complicated problem although some research work has been done its dynamic modelling and analysis methods are still not perfect this paper proposes a refined modelling approach and a unified framework for stability analysis of the stac which is very convenient to obtain high order modal responses and therefore greatly improves the calculation efficiency finally we further suggest a self consistent accuracy verification method which can determine how many modal information should be retained at least in order to obtain response results with ideal accuracy another major contribution of this paper is to provide a framework for stability analysis of the stac it is foreseeable that the reported approach and results obtained in this paper are helpful for further
