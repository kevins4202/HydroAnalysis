1450,in situ thermal recovery is utilized extensively for unconventional bitumen extraction in the cold lake beaver river clbr basin in alberta canada public health concerns have been raised over potable groundwater contamination and arsenic release adjacent to these operations within the clbr basin which have been linked to subsurface heating of aquifer sediments under localized heated conditions as bearing aquifer sediments have been shown to undergo water rock interactions and release constituents at near neutral ph conditions however release mechanisms have yet to be conclusively reported to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes of aquifer heating and solute transport in detail this study applies a novel heated column design to mimic saturated aquifer materials in contact with a thermal recovery well while constraining flow and geochemical conditions two column experiment scenarios were considered using 1 quartz sio2 sand with 0 6 wt pyrite fes2 and 2 aquifer sediments collected from the clbr region heated temperature gradients between 50 c and 90 c were maintained within a 0 6 m section of the 3 m column with a flow rate of one pore volume per week during heated low oxygen 3 mg l 1 conditions results generally show increases in ph al as b mn mo si and zn concentrations within and downgradient of the column heating section constituent release is primarily attributed to thermal desorption from fe oxides clay and silicate mineral dissolution competitive anion exchange and increased mixing overall results suggest that these mechanisms are responsible for increasing constituent concentrations in groundwater adjacent to in situ thermal recovery operations keywords hydrogeochemistry in situ thermal recovery aquifer heating arsenic 1 introduction proven unconventional oil reserves in canada are primarily bituminous oil sands with an estimated volume of approximately 171 billion bbl dusseault 2001 lines 2008 mcglade 2012 approximately 20 of these oil sand reserves are sufficiently shallow for surface mining extraction with the remaining 80 located at depth extraction of heavy and extra heavy oils from low permeability units below 80 m from surface can be performed in situ with steam aided extraction processes commonly referred to as thermal recovery chopra et al 2010 two of the most extensively used thermal recovery methods include steam assisted gravity drainage sagd and cyclic steam stimulation css both methods inject pressurized steam at 200 c 300 c fennell 2008 giraldo and macmillan 2016 into the permeable bitumen substrate thereby lowering the viscosity of the oil and allowing the steam oil mixture to be extracted to surface jiang et al 2010 in comparison to surface oil sands mining in situ thermal bitumen extraction has the capacity to generally satisfy higher environmental standards by producing significantly lower quantities of solid waste such as tailings in addition to creating much less surface disturbance however to access the bituminous strata in situ operations require installation of injection and recovery wells through regional non saline aquifers which provide an abundant supply of potable groundwater to municipal and rural residents and the agricultural industry fennell 2011 consequently public health concerns have been raised over the potential impacts to potable groundwater aquifers from thermal injection wells fennell 2008 javed and siddique 2016 alberta energy regulator 2016 as well as to surface environments from uncontrolled release of bitumen from the reservoir korosi et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that heat transfer to aquifer sediments cause water rock interactions and compositional changes in the groundwater geochemistry fennell 2008 bonte et al 2013 moncur et al 2015b javed and siddique 2016 elevated temperatures alter the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions of local aquifer systems which can lead to increases in mineral solubility reaction rates and dissolved constituent concentrations nordstrom and munoz 1994 stumm and morgan 1995 subsequently the mobility of these constituents can then become influenced by the physical transport of thermal and groundwater flow regimes domenico and schwartz 1990 their ultimate fate is dictated by the chemical nature of the individual species as well as the downgradient geochemical conditions appelo and postma 2005 arsenic as has been identified as a primary constituent of concern in these systems which has surpassed background concentrations by an order of magnitude in groundwater monitoring wells downgradient from thermal recovery operations located in the cold lake beaver river clbr basin of alberta fennell 2008 canadian natural resources limited 2006 arsenic concentrations greater than the 0 01 mg l 1 limit for drinking water set by the world health organization who have been identified in natural groundwaters within canada moncur et al 2015a europe asia and the americas sharma and sohn 2009 these elevated concentrations are generally attributed to the presence of as bearing minerals in the aquifer and aquitard units coupled with slow groundwater flow rates and either elevated ph conditions 8 5 or strong subsurface reducing conditions at neutral ph smedley and kinniburgh 2002 anthropogenic activities can also introduce as into groundwater systems and have been recorded in areas surrounding industrial sites including metal mines and tailings ponds surface releases of geothermal waste fluids aquifer thermal energy storage systems pressure treated wood facilities and in situ thermal recovery operations fennell 2008 ilgen et al 2011 bonte et al 2013 moncur et al 2015a laboratory batch experiments and field scale tests have investigated high temperature 50 c 150 c reactions for the athabasca aquifer sediments and mechanisms of as release although all conclusions have indicated that elevated temperatures are at the root cause of as liberation proposed mechanisms thus far have included reductive dissolution of fe rich smectite clay fennell 2008 sulfide mineral dissolution moncur et al 2015a and ion exchange javed and siddique 2016 based on these findings there remains a gap in understanding the hydrogeochemical and reactive transport processes that are responsible for producing elevated as concentrations from sagd and css operations to examine these processes in greater detail this study applies two heated column experiment scenarios using 1 quartz sio2 sand with 0 6 wt pyrite fes2 and 2 aquifer sediments collected from the empress formation within the clbr region together these experiments mimic the conditions of a saturated aquifer unit in contact with an in situ thermal recovery well and help to elucidate the controlling geochemical and transport behavior of dissolved constituents under localized elevated temperature conditions particular focus is directed towards investigating thermodynamic and kinetic water rock interactions as well as the mechanisms of temperature dependent solute release migration and fate in saturated media 2 methodology 2 1 column materials and construction all column materials were selected for their stability and thermal tolerances at temperatures of up to 200 c the column itself was a 3 m long by 0 05 m diameter ptfe column with threaded ptfe column end caps housing water inflow and outflow tubing fig 1 water sampling ports were installed at 0 1 m intervals along the length of the column and were comprised of threaded stainless steel fittings and 0 1 m lengths of perforated glass wool filled ptfe tubing input water flow was controlled using a micro peristaltic pump and was sourced from a sealed 25 l glass carboy of deionized water regularly purged with ultra pure n2 g to generate a heated zone within the column six 120 v stainless steel cartridge heaters backer marathon inc were radially staggered at 0 1 m intervals inside the column between 1 0 m and 1 6 m from the column input likewise a cooling section from 1 9 m and 2 4 m was set up using two lengths of ptfe tubing inside the column which conveyed refrigerated approx 5 c water insulation tape was wrapped around the heating and cooling sections to minimize heat loss and heat gain respectively column temperature profiles were monitored using thermistors positioned at 0 1 m intervals in the heating section at 0 2 m spacing from both ends of the heating section and at 0 3 m intervals in all other sections thermistors and heat cartridges were monitored and controlled with a campbell scientific cr1000 data logger coupled with a 16 channel control port module and multiplexer complex flow regimes due to fluctuations in water density during heated experiments were taken into account when considering the orientation of the column a horizontal alignment was thought to minimize these effects due to the controlled flow gradient and minimized water density effects during heating column output water tubing was positioned 0 5 m higher than the inflow location to maintain a positive pressure gradient and outflow was collected to monitor flow rates to control dissolved oxygen do within the column and thus better mimic subsurface conditions the column and input water pump were placed inside a custom built anaerobic chamber continuously flushed with ultra pure n2 g oxygen gas concentrations within the chamber were monitored using a calibrated so 210 oxygen sensor apogee instruments inc the anaerobic chamber was constructed using 0 5 in welded acrylic panels with a removable lid and sealed with a Â¼ in butyl rubber gasket gas tubing and water inflow outflow and sampling ports were accessed outside of the chamber using tubing extensions coupled with threaded stainless steel fittings holes used to convey electrical wiring through the acrylic panels were enclosed using silicone sealant 2 2 bromide tracer tests hydraulic properties and flow characteristics were obtained in experiments 1 and 2 by conducting chemical tracer tests in both heated and unheated conditions using bromide 99 9 nabr as the conservative solute the tracer solution was pumped into the column at a rate of 0 2 ml min 1 consistent with the unheated and heated experiments tracer samples were collected from the 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m sampling ports relative to the column input to reduce possible effects caused by water withdrawals during porewater sampling small samples were collected 5 ml 6 ml 0 5 of the total column pore volume flow rate measurements were measured weekly at the output end using a graduated cylinder bromide concentrations were analyzed using a double junction cole parmer bromide ion selective electrode ise determination of the average linear velocity v and longitudinal dispersivity d l for each aquifer material was carried out by fitting data to a modelled breakthrough curve according to eq 1 domenico and schwartz 1990 1 c c 0 0 5 erfc x vt 2 avt where c c 0 represents the normalized concentration of the solution a is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion and x refers to the distance from the source where the solution is measured at a given time t each breakthrough curve was modelled by applying the least squares method coupled with the microsoft excel solver function 2 3 experiment design and sediment characterization 2 3 1 experiment 1 quartz sand with pyrite chemical physical and hydraulic parameters of the 30 40 sieve quartz sand unimin corp le sueur mn usa accusand used in experiment 1 were characterized by schroth et al 1996 and williams and oostrum 2000 pyrite grains were prepared from a 9 cm 8 cm 6 cm pyrite crystal weinrich minerals inc using a braun chipmunk rock chipper and sieved to 30 55 mesh size the 0 6 wt of pyrite selected for the column material was based on the average percentage of sulfide minerals present in bonnyville grand centre and marie creek formation sediments identified by javed et al 2014 which was shown to range between 0 09 wt and 2 79 wt qualitative characterization of the pre experimentation pyrite grains was carried out using a tungsten filament tescan vega ii xmu scanning electron microscope equipped with an oxford x ray detection system capable of energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem edx elemental analysis of the pyrite grains was performed using standard methods garcia et al 2009 at the geological survey of canada inorganic geochemistry research laboratory gsc igrl using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer la icp ms with a 40 Î¼m spot size and one minute of ablation at a 10 hz repetition rate before la icp ms analysis pyrite grains were ultrasonicated in deionized water to remove any surface contamination 2 3 2 experiment 2 aquifer sediment aquifer sediments located within the clbr basin used in experiment 2 were provided by the alberta geological survey borehole wr99 1 andriashek 2003 the aquifer material was collected between core depth intervals 122 m to 134 m and 208 m to 213 m bgs from the empress formation unit 3 and unit 1 respectively and was stored for 17 years prior to initiating the column experiment material used for the heated column experiment was made as a composite sample of both depth intervals x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf was used to characterize the mineralogy and total elemental composition of the bulk sediment while sem edx was also performed to identify sediment surface characteristics and elemental abundance bulk xrd of three samples was performed in two analytical runs with a rigaku ultima iv diffractometer using cu kÎ± radiation at an accelerating voltage of 40 kv and 40 ma and range of 4 2Î¸ 100 2Î¸ in the first run samples were scanned continuously at a step width of 0 02 2Î¸ and 3 00 minute while samples in the second run were scanned at a step width of 0 05 2Î¸ and 0 75 minute the parameters in the first run were used to identify major silicate and non silicate minerals while the slower step width of the second trial was used to identify less abundant minerals as described by javed et al 2014 xrf analysis used a claisse m4 fluxer for sample preparation followed by analysis using a rigaku supermini 200 spectrometer 2 3 3 sulfur sequential extractions sequential extraction tests were performed at the gsc igrl to identify the sources of sulfur associated with the empress formation sediments and to better understand the mechanisms by which sulfur species are liberated different sulfur fractions were isolated using a modified sequential extraction method coupled to the distillation reflux apparatus reported by xiao quan et al 1992 and chen et al 1997 although sequential extractions were designed to target sulfur bearing fractions other phases such as clays and oxides were also extracted these phases along with the sulfur fractions are considered in the results and discussion of this study the four phase sequential extraction procedure table 1 began with the removal of weakly adsorbed and surface bound sulfur fraction by adding 30 ml of 1 0 m ammonium acetate solution buffered at ph 7 0 to the sediment sample which was then mechanically shaken for two hours afterwards the sediment solution mixture was centrifuged at 3800 rpm for ten minutes the supernatant was then collected for analysis and the sediment residue was rinsed with 5 ml of deionized water this extraction method was repeated using 40 ml of 1 0 m ammonium acetate buffered to ph 5 0 to remove the surface and carbonate bound fraction once surface and carbonate bound s was extracted the sediment residue was poured into a three neck boiling flask with 10 ml of deionized water the flask was then coupled to a distillation reflux apparatus and a dropping funnel which was used to add 10 ml of 2 0 m hcl resulting in a 1 0 m concentration in the flask and was brought to a gentle boil for one hour volatile h2s g was trapped in 10 ml of 0 05 m naoh in a 30 ml test tube via a stream of n2 g after one hour 0 1 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the naoh solution to oxidize the trapped s fraction which was subsequently collected as the phase 3b sample solution from the boiling flask was collected as the phase 3a sample following phase 3 3 0 g of granular zn s was added to the sediment residue in the boiling flask and the system was purged with n2 g for several minutes a dropping funnel was used to slowly add 20 ml of 6 0 m hcl similarly the phase 4 solution was heated to a gentle boil for one hour after which 0 1 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the naoh solution and the sulfate collected as the phase 4b sample the final residue and solution i e phase 4a was not analyzed due to the elevated concentration of dissolved zn however to allow for comparisons with sequential extraction results three fresh sediment samples underwent aqua regia digestion at 90 c for three hours and were analyzed using icp oes to determine the total solid phase concentrations quality assurance and control methods were carried out using teflon boiling chips to represent blank samples as well as by using a till standard previously characterized by hall et al 1996 each phase of the extraction test was run in triplicate using the aquifer sediment blank and till standard samples to validate reproducibility of the procedure and investigate the distribution of results 2 4 heated and unheated column experiments prior to commencing each experiment the column was flushed with deionized water air dried and then gradually filled with sediment 6 7 kg in experiment 1 8 1 kg in experiment 2 and gently compacted afterwards the sediment pore space was flushed with co2 g to remove atmospheric gases and input water was pumped at a rate of 0 2 ml min 1 one pore volume per week until fully saturated outflow volumes were measured regularly to establish steady state conditions and confirm that the system was completely saturated both experiments 1 and 2 were performed using deionized low oxygen 3 mg l 1 input water during experiment 1 the two week unheated phase and initial eight week heated phase were conducted without the use of an anaerobic chamber following the initial eight week heated phase the column was placed in an anaerobic chamber for an additional eight weeks with an o2 g partial pressure kept below 2 kpa experiment 2 was performed entirely in the anaerobic chamber with an unheated phase of approximately two weeks to establish a reference condition while the heated phase was run for approximately two months although the column was placed in the anaerobic chamber conditions inside the column were not anaerobic due to the presence of dissolved oxygen for the heated phase of each experiment the heat cartridges were programmed to reach an internal column temperature gradient from 50 c at the start of the heating section 1 0 m from input end to 90 c at the end of the heating section 1 6 m from input end which generally aligns with field observations from thermal recovery operations which estimate temperatures of approximately 100 c in the aquifer units adjacent to the steam injection well fennell 2008 giraldo and macmillan 2016 temperature control for the heat cartridges was based on measurements of temperature at 10 s intervals that were averaged and recorded each minute water samples were collected once a week at 0 3 m intervals beginning with the 3 0 m sampling port closest to the outflow each sampling period included an hour pause between each sample collection to allow for replacement of the volume of extracted water sampling periods for ph do so4 and fe2 analysis were alternated on a weekly basis with dissolved element concentrations analyses using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro arcos and icp ms thermofisher x2 us epa method 6020 lichte et al 1987 arbogast 1996 for analysis of ph do so4 and fe2 each sample consisted of two 5 ml aliquots filtered to 0 45 Î¼m with the first 5 ml aliquot sulfate concentrations and ph were measured using the hach sulfaver 4 method us epa method 8051 on a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer model dr2800 01b1 and a double junction cole parmer atc ph temperature probe respectively the second aliquot was used to measure do concentrations with an oakton do probe and fe2 concentrations using the hach 1 10 phenanthroline method on the dr 2800 for both the sulfate and fe2 concentrations samples were diluted by half using deionized water to produce a 10 ml sample in experiment 2 total alkalinity was also measured from separate 0 5 ml samples and using the hach tntplus 870 colorimetric method on the dr 2800 water samples for icp oes ms analysis were collected as full 10 ml aliquots filtered to 0 45 Î¼m and refrigerated in sealed 2 hno3 washed and dried 15 ml hdpe vials prior to analysis samples were acidified using ultrapure hno3 to 1 v v and left for three weeks to ensure complete desorbtion from vial walls 2 4 1 geochemical and surface complexation modelling geochemical modelling was performed using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 to determine the mineral saturation indices the minteq v4 database allison et al 1991 was specifically selected based on its integration of reaction enthalpies and demonstrated accuracy for calculating quartz solubility at high temperatures appelo and postma 2005 in addition basaluminite al4 oh 10so4 albite na alsi3o8 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 f oh 2 and high femg smectite ca0 025na0 1k0 2fe0 5 2 fe0 2 3 mg1 15al1 25si3 5h2o12 from the watq4f phreeqc and llnl databases were included in the geochemical models to investigate the specific saturation indices of these minerals of interest unheated and heated phase surface complexation models scm were also developed in phreeqc to simulate reactive transport of arsenic sorption and desorption as a function of temperature in experiment 2 this model integrates an electrostatic diffuse double layer model from dzombak and morel 1990 originally developed for ferrihydrite fe oh 3 am however because this model has also been applied for goethite Î± feo oh dixit and hering 2003 and fe oxyhydroxides in natural sediments postma et al 2007 bonte et al 2014 it was selected to simulate as bearing fe oxides in empress formation aquifer sediments temperature regimes within the scm were defined using average temperature data from the column in experiment 2 parameterization of heat transport during heated conditions makes use of the equation 2 r t 1 1 n Ï s Îº s n Ï w Îº w where the thermal retardation factor r t is a function of porosity n the density Ï and specific heat capacity Îº of the sediments Ï s 2 65 kg dm 3 Îº s 0 830 kj k 1 kg 1 and water Ï w 1 kg dm 3 Îº w 4 18 kj k 1 kg 1 flow characteristics and boundary conditions were attained from the br tracer test while initial geochemical conditions reflected average unheated concentrations table 2 transport in the 3 0 m column was discretized using 60 cells at 0 05 m intervals with an advective time step of 10 080 s for each cell which is consistent with the column flow rate of approximately one pore volume per week i e 0 2 ml min 1 the intrinsic sorption equilibrium constant log k for as onto fe oxyhydroxide was optimized to 4 05 which differs from the value of 4 9 and 5 41 reported in bonte et al 2014 and in the minteq v4 database respectively however as bonte et al 2014 notes log k values can vary considerably between synthetic and natural fe oxides which supports use of the optimized value to better reflect arsenate sorption by fe oxides associated with the aquifer sediments in this study additionally this model applies the change in enthalpy h r value developed by bonte et al 2014 based on van t hoff sorption isotherm coefficients surface parameters for goethite from dixit and hering 2003 and measured fe concentrations from phase 3a of the sequential extraction using empress formation aquifer sediments 3 results and discussion 3 1 column flow and transport although most natural aquifer units typically exist in low temperature environments 5 c 20 c the results of this study build on the work of fennell 2008 and bonte et al 2014 to examine flow behavior in high temperature zones and gain insight into the processes that occur in localized heated aquifer systems similar to those encountered at in situ thermal recovery operations modelled breakthrough curves for unheated and heated tracer tests at 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m from experiment 1 align well with measured data r 2 0 975 0 995 fig 2 unheated tracer measurements were collected at 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m while heated results were collected at 1 7 m and 2 5 m as they were located downgradient from the heating section due to possible volatilization of br at high temperatures heated tracer tests were run with a lower heating gradient from 50 c to 80 c for experiment 2 unheated tracer measurements were collected at 0 5 m while heated measurements were collected at 1 7 m and 2 5 m modelled breakthrough curves fit to measured data produced r2 values ranging from 0 969 to 0 992 unheated and heated tracer test results show that longitudinal dispersivity a l increases as a function of temperature in experiment 1 a l exhibits an order of magnitude increase from 25 c to 80 c with values of 1 9 10 3 m to 6 2 10 2 m whereas in experiment 2 a l increases from 9 1 10 2 m to 3 5 10 1 m in contrast linear velocity v l changes minimally between experiments and temperatures with values of 4 1 10 6 m s 1 to 4 4 10 6 m s 1 and 4 5 10 6 m s 1 to 4 9 10 6 m s 1 for experiments 1 and 2 respectively these results suggest that the fluid flow properties are temperature dependent with concomitant impacts on constituent transport the minimal changes in v l and column outflow rate 6 10 for both unheated and heated conditions primarily reflects the programmed pumping rate nonetheless the earlier arrival of br during the heated tracer tests results likely reflect changes in the hydraulic conductivity as temperature is known to control both water density and viscosity the relationship between temperature and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 3 k Ïkg Î¼ where k denotes the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 Ï refers to the temperature dependent fluid density k is the absolute permeability g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 and Î¼ is the temperature dependent viscosity in the temperature range of most fresh groundwater systems between 5 c and 20 c water typically has a similar density and viscosity and hydraulic conductivity becomes solely dependent on material properties however in higher temperature systems water viscosity and density are considerably reduced which consequently increases hydraulic conductivity levy et al 1989 cho et al 1999 based on the permeability of quartz sand measured by williams and oostrum 2000 and assuming this value remains constant within the observed temperature range eq 3 predicts that the k within the heated section would be approximately 2 5 times higher than unheated section given the consistency of the linear flow rate this suggests that increased dispersion is a primary characteristic of flow behavior under heated conditions changes in temperature dependent a l should introduce additional mixing along the heated unheated interface sections of the column which should lead to a wider distribution of br concentration with increasing transport this effect can be seen in the breakthrough curves and is likely a fundamental expression of temperature dependent dispersion end of column flow rate measurements from each tracer test were found to be approximately 0 17 ml min 1 or roughly one pore flush per week which generally reflects the programmed pumping rate of 0 2 ml min 1 differences between these two values are primarily attributed to sampling volume losses which are on the order of approximately 0 015 0 025 ml min 1 velocity for experiments 1 and 2 determined from modelled breakthrough curves was 4 78 10 6 m s 1 and 4 28 10 6 m s 1 respectively based on an average of both unheated and heated experiments porosity calculated using darcy s law with measured flow rate and model derived velocity for experiments 1 and 2 was 0 35 and 0 31 respectively 3 2 experiment 1 quartz sand with pyrite 3 2 1 quartz sand and pyrite composition chemical characterization of the quartz sand by schroth et al 1996 indicates that total fe mn and zn concentrations are 7 65 g kg 1 40 1 mg kg 1 and 7 1 mg kg 1 respectively while total fe oxide concentrations are 0 35 g kg 1 in addition the prewashed sand with water exhibits a relatively low cation exchange capacity 0 62 cmol kg 1 schroth et al 1996 sem micrographs of pyrite grains in experiment 1 show that surfaces are angular with fresh conchoidal fractures smaller sized fragments on larger grain surfaces are also evident and illustrate that finer bound particles 50 Î¼m were produced during the crystal fragmentation pyrite grain surfaces also exhibit very minute signs of pitting which suggests that oxidation has only recently commenced and is consistent with the four week exposure period between crushing and conducting surface analysis similar findings by murphy and strongin 2008 and chandra and gerson 2010 have established that pyrite can undergo oxidation after exposure to atmospheric conditions la icp ms results of pyrite samples n 9 exhibit a wide distribution of trace element concentrations after two rounds of analysis these trends demonstrate spatial heterogeneity within the original cubic crystal sample and suggest that the original pyrite crystal likely had substantial inclusions substitutions and or crystal zoning features average abundance generally follows the trend as 251 131 ppm se pb zn cu co al mn v ni however higher and lower concentrations of these elements were observed in individual samples 3 2 2 column experiment 1 unheated conditions during the unheated phase of experiment 1 temperatures throughout the column were maintained at approximately 25 c initial ph and do measurements at the column input 0 3 m are consistent with values measured in the input water 5 5 and 1 5 mg l 1 respectively but suggest some equilibration with the atmosphere and column materials dissolved oxygen mn si and so4 concentrations increased with distance over the column fig 3 while localized increases were also observed for al as fe and zn however ph and cu remained relatively unchanged the observed increases in al as fe mn so and zn are consistent with microbially mediated pyrite oxidation at ambient temperatures nordstrom 2011 the increase in do suggested undesired oxygen ingress and subsequently lead to enclosure of the column in the anaerobic chamber for the remainder of the experiment these initial outcomes were also consistent with the sem results above that indicated oxidation of pyrite grains left exposed to atmospheric conditions after being crushed and were subjected to moderate concentrations of dissolved oxygen 4 2 mg l 1 to 5 5 mg l 1 within the column porewater increases in si concentration are attributed to quartz dissolution in addition to the liberation of water soluble si due to the quartz sand being unwashed prior to initiating the experiment geochemical modelling results indicate that gibbsite al oh 3 and goethite are at saturation in the first 1 0 m of the column and increase above saturation between 1 0 m to 3 0 m while quartz reaches saturation at 1 2 m of the column and downgradient sampling locations fig 4 these trends suggest that in addition to pyrite al fe oxyhydroxides likely present on sediment surfaces and quartz are dissolving during unheated conditions the dissolution of trace aluminosilicate minerals could also affect al and si concentrations to some extent however their contributions should be minimal in comparison to the dominant sources furthermore aloh3 am ferrihydrite and sio2 am tend to remain undersaturated during the unheated phase and suggest that these minerals are not controlling al fe and si concentrations respectively 3 2 3 column experiment 1 heated conditions upon initiating the heated phase a temperature gradient from 50 c to 90 c was maintained in the heating section of the column while the cooling section lowered the temperature to approximately 14 c over the course of the initial twelve week period do concentrations decrease within the heating section in relation to unheated conditions from approximately 5 mg l 1 to 3 mg l 1 once the column was contained in the anaerobic chamber following week 9 do concentrations decrease uniformly to 3 mg l 1 by week 16 throughout the column similarly in the initial 12 weeks of the heated experiment ph generally decreases in the heated section from approximately 5 5 in unheated conditions to 4 with the exception of week 6 where ph exhibits a rapid increase up to 7 after column enclosure in the anaerobic chamber ph increases to 7 5 in the heating section by week 16 and remains above ph 5 at all downgradient locations manganese and si concentrations increase overall across the column during the heated phase but their absolute concentrations are generally lower than for the unheated phase mn concentrations generally decrease from week 1 to week 17 with the noteworthy exception of an increase downgradient of the heating section during week 9 similarly si concentrations decrease between weeks 1 and 9 while the column is uncontained and upon enclosure subsequently increase from approximately 1 mg l 1 to 4 mg l 1 downgradient of the heating section between weeks 10 and 17 at locations within and downgradient of the heating section there were concurrent increases of so4 al cu fe zn and to lesser extent as in comparison to unheated conditions sulfate concentrations are highest in the initial uncontained weeks of the experiment with spikes reaching maximums of 104 80 70 and 44 mg l 1 in weeks 4 2 6 and 8 respectively conversely sulfate concentrations are generally lower in subsequent contained weeks and are similar to unheated conditions although concentrations within the cooling section are approximately 15 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 higher during week 12 than in week 10 measured so4 concentrations are found to account for almost all of the total s concentration as such the presence of sulfoxy anions i e sulfite and thiosulfate are generally assumed to undergo complete oxidation into sulfate though low concentrations could be present liberation of al cu and zn is most evident during weeks 5 7 and 9 is characterized by rapid increases within the heating section as well as increases downgradient of the heating section which appear to be unaffected by cooling section the highest concentrations of al and zn reach up to 1 4 mg l 1 and 3 0 mg l 1 respectively at the end of the column during week 9 while cu increases to 0 5 mg l 1 within and downgradient of the heating section similarly fe concentrations are highest during week 7 9 11 and 12 as fe2 and reach 2 6 mg l 1 in week 7 downgradient of the heating section and to 3 7 mg l 1 in week 9 within the heating section in addition the increases in al cu fe and zn during week 7 and week 9 to coincide with the lowest ph during week 8 and week 10 for as heated phase concentrations exceed unheated phase concentrations during week 3 5 7 and 17 downgradient of the heating section at 1 8 m the highest as concentration is observed during week 7 at 3 3 Î¼g l 1 while the most consistent as release occurs during week 17 with concentrations between 1 Î¼g l 1 and 3 Î¼g l 1 at all sampling points from 0 9 m trends for ph do sulfate and metal loid concentrations are attributed to microbially mediated pyrite oxidation at elevated temperatures norris and owen 1993 and dissolution reactions through the consumption of o2 aq the rapid decrease in ph between week 1 and week 10 is consistent with the influence of temperature on sulfide mineral oxidation rates belzile et al 2004 and acid production the subsequent return to near neutral ph in week 17 is attributed to a decrease in sulfide oxidation rates likely due to the decrease in do availability and slower rates of o2 aq diffusion through the oxidized rim of pyrite grains davis and ritchie 1986 although sulfate release was expected to be relatively constant trends do not appear uniform results indicate that concentrations increase irregularly in the initial weeks of the experiment concurrent with inferred precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides and gradually decrease following week 6 which is supported by the reduced rate of pyrite oxidation however it is important to note that sulfate is produced at all weeks of the experiment including week 17 which suggests that oxidation reactions persist as would be expected given the availability of do geochemical modelling results indicate that both ferrihydrite and goethite are at or above saturation in the column heating section between week 1 and week 7 and are likely precipitating as a result of pyritic sulfide and iron oxidation downgradient of the heating section al oh 3 am reaches and maintains saturation during weeks 5 to 9 and then returns back to undersaturation during week 11 while ferrihydrite is characteristically undersaturated in this section during most weeks of the heated experiment this undersaturation is particularly evident during week 5 to week 11 when ph is less than 5 which agrees with the ph control on ferrihydrite solubility schwertmann 1991 blowes et al 2014 conversely basaluminite al4 so4 oh 10Ë5 h2o is oversaturated downgradient of the heating section during all weeks of the experiment and is possibly precipitating furthermore schwertmannite fe16 oh so4 12 13o16Ë10 12h2o was not included in the geochemical model but tends to approach stability at ph 3 5 regenspurg et al 2004 and may exert a control on fe and or so4 during week 10 the overall trends in al and fe concentrations suggest that they are controlled by reactions involving al fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases in addition it is likely that precipitation of these phases strongly influences as cu mn si so4 and zn concentrations through attenuation mechanisms such as sorption and or co precipitation pierce and moore 1982 trivedi and axe 2001 jang et al 2003 sanchez espaÃ±a et al 2006 although mobility and solubility of cu mn and zn tend to increase with lower ph the presence of oxyhydroxides and hydroxysulfates suggests that a combination of these controls are likely responsible for the observed constituent concentrations and behavior over the course of the heated experiment in comparison to unheated conditions si concentrations increase during week 1 and week 5 of the heated experiment and suggest that release is controlled by quartz dissolution from elevated temperatures and as a ph response caused by pyrite oxidation the peaks in si concentration during weeks 1 3 and 5 correspond to ph increases during weeks 2 4 and 6 respectively and suggest that ph and temperature enhance quartz solubility concurrently within the heated section at these moments the higher si concentrations decrease immediately after the cooling section and generally stay low through the rest of the column geochemical modelling results indicate that quartz is undersaturated in the heating section and shifts towards saturation during the cooling section which is consistent with the data and proposed mechanisms of si release however sio2 am remains undersaturated in the column suggesting that this mineral phase is not controlling si removal instead the results of this study propose that al fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases control si concentrations through co precipitation and or sorption which have been demonstrated by davis et al 2001 and sanchez espaÃ±a and reyes 2019 as dominant attenuation mechanisms although as was found to be the most abundant trace element in the pyrite mineral composition the observed dissolved constituent concentrations maximum of 3 Î¼g l 1 and ph and do conditions from experiment 1 suggest that as released from pyrite dissolution generally remains immobile which is believed to be a function of the redox state under oxidizing conditions as v dominates and can readily adsorb onto and co precipitate with amorphous and crystalline al fe oxyhydroxide minerals pierce and moore 1982 sharma and sohn 2009 as well as hydroxysulfate minerals such as schwertmannite sanchez espaÃ±a and reyes 2019 conversely as iii is adsorbed less preferentially particularly in the presence of as v qi and pichler 2016 and is typically more abundant in reducing environments sharma and sohn 2009 although as speciation was not completed in this study the results of the column experiment and the phreeqc simulation allude to arsenate as the dominant as species due to the availability of o2 aq in addition as concentrations from weeks 5 to 11 suggests that al fe oxyhydroxide and or hydroxysulfate dissolution acts as a primary release control during this time and subsequently shifts to desorption previous investigations by yang et al 2008 and xu et al 2012 have demonstrated that adsorption strength of as from fe oxides generally decreases with increasing ph while bonte et al 2013 and bonte et al 2014 document thermal desorption of as from fe oxyhydroxides at elevated temperatures 3 3 experiment 2 aquifer sediment 3 3 1 aquifer sediment characterization and geochemistry andriashek 2003 classifies the aquifer material from the empress formation used in experiment 2 as sand to sand and fine gravel visual observations indicate that the grains are subangular to subrounded the presence of organic matter was not recorded in the wr99 1 core log andriashek 2003 or visually observed in the homogenized aquifer sediments though javed et al 2014 identified 0 1 total organic carbon toc in sand sediments from clbr strata bulk xrd analyses indicate that sediments are primarily composed of quartz and calcite caco3 with lesser amounts of albite and muscovite plus minor enstatite fe mg sio3 and sericite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 the mineralogy is generally consistent with previous clbr aquifer sediment characterizations andriashek 2003 fennell 2008 javed et al 2014 moncur et al 2015b however previous studies also observed minor pyrite typically in the form of euhedral crystals and inclusions within precambrian granitic bedrock and as individual framboidal grains which were suggested to be neominerals formed in the aquifer and aquitards sediments post deposition moncur et al 2015a while xrd results from this study did not detect sulfide minerals the sequential extraction tests discussed below do indicate their presence similarly xrd analysis did not detect fe oxyhydroxide minerals such as goethite though quantitative sem data as well as sequential extraction results suggests they are likely present sem edx scans indicate that the aquifer sediments mainly contain si al ca and fe consistent with xrf results in some instances the sem edx detected fe as fe oxide and fe carbonate phases fig 5 the occurrence of fe oxides is consistent with visual observation of a rust coloured precipitate found on numerous sediment surfaces further the fe oxides identified by sem edx contained minor 3 5 5 6 wt si trace 0 5 1 0 wt al and ca and in one case trace 0 8 0 9 wt as and p based on these results as well as descriptions from previous reports by fennell 2008 javed et al 2014 and moncur et al 2015b this phase was likely an aggregate fe oxyhydroxide mineral such as a poorly crystallized goethite which was suggested to be a carrier of as fennell 2008 also indicates that fe rich smectite clays such as nontronite na0 3fe2 sial 4o10 oh 2 n h2o or saponite ca na 0 2 mg fe 3 si al 4o10 oh 2 4 h2o from the muriel lake formation contribute approximately 8 Î¼g g 1 as the presence of clays in the shallower aquifer material used for this study is consistent with andriashek 2003 who indicates that the clay fraction is approximately 10 15 wr99 1 122 134 m however these sediments were also homogenized with sand and gravel material from a lower depth interval wr99 1 208 213 m and could explain why clay minerals were not detected by xrd though it is likely that they are present to some degree 3 3 2 sequential extractions of sulfur species and solid phase results supernatant samples collected during each extraction phase were used to assess the concentrations of individual sulfur fractions as well as the release of associated elements tables 3 and 4 in comparison to the digested s concentration the cumulative s concentration from the sequential extraction is generally lower by roughly 100 ppm to 1000 ppm although this finding indicates that some s components were incompletely dissolved by the extraction phases it is important to note that the phase 4a sample was not analyzed due to particularly high zn concentrations further the sequential extractions aimed to determine the source s of s accessible during the column experiment and by natural groundwaters and thus these coarse sediments were left uncrushed it is reasonable to assume that crushing would dissolve more of the sediment resulting in greater total s concentrations additionally the differences between xrf and aqua regia digested concentrations suggest that the total sulfide pool is likely less than the accessible sulfide fraction phase 4b as sulfide minerals are also encapsulated within the aluminosilicate mass phase 1 results show that 252 68 2 ppm 70 s was removed from the sediment surfaces demonstrating that the primary s fraction is surficially bound the results also show that the extractant used in phase 1 was most successful in removing the adsorbed s as the fraction in phase 2 was below detection limits 10 ppm and suggests that adsorbed s is weakly bound on crystalline and amorphous phases and is not associated with carbonate minerals data from phase 3a 3b and 4b indicate that the somewhat variable sulfur concentrations are reasonable based on the duration and exposure of the sediment to natural aquifer conditions in sample 2 and sample 3 these fractions represent approximately 19 22 of the total s extracted whereas in sample 1 phase 3a and 3b account for 9 12 and phase 4b makes up to 27 of the available sulfur pool the supernatant from phase 3a returned high concentrations of al and si 1570 434 and 1558 376 ppm which is likely due to dissolution of aluminosilicate and or clay minerals however due to the comparatively lower concentrations of k and na as well as the strength of the 1 0 m hcl solution concentration used in phase 3a the observations suggest that these constituents are also likely a component of the fe oxides aluminum and si were identified as part of the fe oxide precipitates from sem edx analysis and similarly were suggested to be contained in the secondary fe phase proposed in experiment 1 calcium was also identified during sem edx of the fe precipitate however the measured concentrations in phases 1 through 3 in addition to those for mg are attributed to the presence of water soluble ca and mg fractions as well as ca and mg carbonate and aluminosilicate minerals as expected ca concentrations increase up to 2586 1923 ppm when subjected to ph 5 solutions in phase 2 and phase 3a conversely mg exhibits similar concentrations in phase 1 and 2 before increasing to 749 244 ppm in phase 3a this finding suggests that mg carbonates did not completely dissolve in phase 2 or alternatively that mg concentrations in phase 3a are associated with an aluminosilicate mineral fraction digested ca concentrations were found to be somewhat lower than cumulative totals for ca in phases 1 2 and 3a after careful review of the results ca concentrations show a wide variability between each sample and extraction phase this observed variability is captured in the standard deviation but suggests that considerable diversity in ca is present in the different solid phases based on the duration between the time of sampling and the sediment characterization it is possible that some degree of carbonate dissolution had occurred due to ph buffering reactions apart from the water soluble fractions i e phase 1 and 2 fe concentrations in the phase 3a and digested samples supports the occurrence of fe oxide fe rich clay and fe sulfide minerals not detected using bulk xrd in addition sequential as cu ni mn p and pb concentrations are the highest in phase 3a which were below or only slightly above their respective detection limits in phase 1 and 2 these results strongly suggest that these constituents are associated with the fraction hosting fe oxides and fe rich clays which tend to dissolve under the same conditions similarly as concentrations below detection limits in the water soluble and carbonate fractions closely resemble those reported by javed and siddique 2016 while the digested fractions also align well with javed and siddique 2016 and moncur et al 2015a in addition it is important to recognize that since the sequential extractions were focused on s species the digested concentrations were higher in most cases than the subtotal of phase 1 2 and 3a due to the absence of phase 4a data overall xrf concentrations of al ca k mg na and si were found to be consistent with the mineralogy identified through xrd noteworthy differences are observed between the total concentrations obtained by xrf and aqua regia digestions and indicates that complete dissolution of alumino silicate minerals did not occur nevertheless this comparison indicates that the undigested minerals and accessory inclusions contribute to the dominant pools of most constituents with the exception of as and s 3 3 3 column experiment 2 unheated conditions results from unheated conditions in experiment 2 indicate that ph is consistently near neutral approx 7 2 do concentrations are 4 mg l 1 throughout the column and ca k mg na and s concentrations rapidly increase with distance along the column fig 6 in comparison to field data collected by fennell 2008 in alberta aquifers unheated concentrations of constituents measured at the end of the column in experiment 2 are higher by approximately one to two orders of magnitude with the exception of si fig 6 and fig 7 in contrast moncur et al 2015a indicates that groundwater parameters ph do as fe k mg na si and so4 within the empress formation aquifer are quite similar to those measured within the column apart from ca which is higher in experiment 2 by approximately 300 mg l 1 unheated experiment results suggest that aqueous geochemistry reflects a transient pulse of weakly bound surface fractions of as b ca cu k mg mn mo na ni s si and zn due to the storage period of aquifer material prior to initiating the column experiment there is potential that this time lead to the production of labile oxidation and or ph buffering products such as so4 and ca that could be more easily dissolved and mobilized although the constituents released during the unheated phase likely reflect pseudo weathering processes that occurred during this storage period comparisons with moncur et al 2015a suggest that the overall geochemical data from the unheated phase provides a reasonable analog for natural conditions and a basis to rationalize the weakly adsorbed and water soluble fractions 3 3 4 column experiment 2 heated conditions during the heated phase temperatures within the heating section were controlled using a temperature gradient from 50 c at 1 0 m to 90 c at 1 6 m while temperatures within the cooling section gradually decreased over the course of the experiment to approx 12 c after improvements were made to the circulation of refrigerated water overall trends for total alkalinity increase with distance along the column with a gradual decrease over the course of the experiment the ph in the heating section remains consistently between 7 and 9 and drops between 6 5 and 8 in the cooling section in weeks 3 to 9 ph peaks at 1 5 m reaching a maximum of 8 9 do remained between 3 and 4 mg l 1 throughout the experiment calcium k mg na and s concentrations successively decrease from week 1 to week 7 which is consistent with the continual flushing of weakly adsorbed water soluble ions fig 6 similarly mn concentrations released during unheated conditions appear to be transported downgradient during week 1 of the heated experiment overall mn concentrations during the heated phase remain below 1 0 mg l 1 fig 7 while cu and ni concentrations are less than in unheated phase and remain below 0 012 and 0 004 mg l 1 respectively however cu and ni concentrations increase after the heated section of the column iron concentrations remain low throughout the experiment 0 040 mg l 1 while overall al as mo si zn concentrations increase in comparison to unheated results fig 7 overall b concentrations decrease over time with the highest concentrations during the unheated phase during the heated phase b concentration trends gradually rise to a peak at the end of the heating section and remain relatively constant afterwards over the course of experiment 2 the ph increases towards alkaline conditions 8 in the unheated and heating sections and drops below 8 following the heating section indicating that oh is being produced and consumed respectively in the case of total alkalinity trends indicate that bicarbonate is produced through the heating section but that the rate of production decreases over time these results coupled with geochemical modelling fig 8 suggest that ph and total alkalinity are responding to clay and carbonate mineral dissolution within the heating section and as secondary gibbsite subsequently precipitates downgradient furthermore the relatively constant do concentrations throughout the column generally indicates that the column apparatus did inhibit oxygen ingress and that reactions within the heating section are not consuming o2 aq the release of cu mn ni and zn is attributed to desorption from fe oxide and dissolution of clay minerals in the heating section which is consistent with the highest concentrations of the sequential extraction found in phase 3a table 4 however lower amounts of cu mn and zn were also present in the adsorbed and carbonate fraction within the heating section zn exhibits a peak concentration up to 0 16 mg l 1 during week 1 and up to 0 07 mg l 1 in week 7 similarly notable mn concentrations increase following the heating section in week 1 approaching 1 mg l 1 in experiment 1 the occurrence of these constituents was associated with pyrite dissolution along with a corresponding increase in sulfide mineral oxidation products however in the heated phase of experiment 2 fe concentrations remain below 0 05 mg l 1 while overall trends for so4 are associated with flushing of the water soluble fraction consistent with phase 1 of the sequential extraction based on these results there is limited evidence to demonstrate that sulfide mineral oxidation occurs and contributes to constituent mobilization the measured fe trends geochemical modelling results for goethite and lack of dysoxic to anoxic reducing conditions generally discounts the potential for fe oxyhydroxide dissolution geochemical modelling indicates that goethite was above saturation for the duration of the experiment which contrasts findings by moncur et al 2016 that indicate fe oxyhydroxides are undersaturated due to greater reducing conditions although fe oxyhydroxide dissolution is unfavourable during this experiment it is possible that these minerals could dissolve under lower o2 aq concentrations it is also important to note that mineral dissolution constituent release and transport in localized zones of aquifer heating can lead to potential changes in the physical properties of aquifer sediments by altering pore space and or mineral stability however in these heated experiments the total mass transfer was found to be very small likely due to the relatively short duration approx eight weeks of the heated phase for example the mass transfer for sulfur the constituent with the highest concentration was 1 1 g in experiment 2 and 0 4 g in experiment 1 compared to the total mass of the column sediment which was 8 1 kg and 6 7 kg respectively additional investigation into the long term consequences of mass transport caused by aquifer heating would require prolonged experiments to gain further insight of the effects the week 5 to week 7 results indicate that b fe k mg mn na ni and s concentrations had reached near steady state conditions while total alkalinity al mo and si were decreasing week on week within the heating section conversely as and zn concentrations were increasing within the heating section during the same period these differences suggest that there were ongoing reactions occurring within the heating section which likely include clay and aluminosilicate mineral dissolution in conjunction with desorption from fe oxides the dissolution of clay and aluminosilicates at 90 c and circumneutral ph is supported by the geochemical modelling results of this study which indicate that these minerals are undersaturated as well as kinetic dissolution investigations for smectite cama and ganor 2015 and muscovite lammers et al 2017 in comparison to trends in the unheated phase results from the heated phase suggest that the increased solubility of muscovite lammers et al 2017 and quartz knauss and wolery 1988 are controlling the increases in al and si concentrations while the sharp decrease in al following the heating section is likely being controlled by gibbsite precipitation undersaturation of muscovite within the heating section aligns with the peak al concentrations and oversaturation of gibbsite downgradient of 1 8 m aligns with rapid al decreases gibbsite dissolution within the heating section also has the potential to release al as geochemical modelling results indicate that it is undersaturated quartz is maintained near saturation throughout the column with a slight undersaturation in the heated section corresponding with the overall release of si which suggests that quartz solubility is the primary control on si concentrations throughout the column similarly smectite dissolution throughout the heated column experiment is supported by geochemical modelling results and suggests that it is dissolving and influencing si and al concentrations however the low concentrations of fe 0 025 mg l 1 throughout the experiment suggest that smectite dissolution is not contributing to substantive releases overall trends for si reflect similar findings by fennell 2008 who shows an increase in si concentrations in groundwater due to localized aquifer heating from a thermal recovery well although geochemical modelling results indicate that the dominant mechanism for si release is controlled by clay and alumino silicate mineral dissolution due to elevated temperatures si also exhibits a noteworthy decrease of about 5 mg l 1 between week 1 and week 7 this decrease suggests that si concentrations decrease as clay minerals dissolve and become less abundant over the duration of the experiment alternatively a portion of the early stage si release could also be influenced by desorption from aluminosilicates and or fe oxyhydroxides which is supported by the adsorbed si fraction results of the sequential extraction test as well as the decrease in si adsorption that can occur with increasing temperature bonte et al 2014 surface complexation modelling based on the modified log k and the established h r bonte et al 2014 indicate that simulated as concentrations increase within the heating section as temperatures reach up to 90 c and decrease at downgradient locations whereas as concentrations remain consistent across the column during unheated conditions fig 9 these scm results are in agreement with observed as trends and provide a rationale for as release due to thermally driven desorption within the heating section and suggest that this mechanism is shared for the release of zn although the magnitude for as and zn releases are different previous studies have found that both constituents can be sorbed by fe oxyhydroxides pierce and moore 1982 trivedi and axe 2001 jang et al 2003 qi and pichler 2016 the observed differences between the two elements are potentially linked to the initial adsorbed concentrations as well as their potential to be resorbed downgradient of the heating section zinc was also shown to be present in the adsorbed and carbonate fraction i e phase 2 which could explain why concentrations in the heating section tend to exhibit spikes whereas as release trends were more gradual arsenic concentrations during the unheated phase of this study were on the order of 2 Î¼g l 1 and generally align with groundwater concentrations reported by moncur et al 2015a the authors indicate that as concentrations within the empress formation aquifer are between 1 Î¼g l 1 to 60 Î¼g l 1 though there was no indication if any measurements were proximal to thermal recovery operations the overall increase in as concentration up to 10 Î¼g l 1 during the heated phase reflects field and batch test observations by fennell 2008 moncur et al 2016 and javed and siddique 2016 however those studies also measured up to 20 higher as concentrations discrepancies between the results of this experiment to those of the above authors are primarily attributed to the different types of experiments performed which did not consider transport and to a degree the different aquifer sediments used in each study although increases in as have been observed in all studies the mechanisms for as release proposed by the above authors have been inconsistent thus far fennell 2008 suggests that as release at elevated temperatures is primarily controlled by the ligand promoted reductive dissolution of fe rich smectite clay minerals alternatively moncur et al 2016 suggests under natural unheated conditions pyrite oxidation is responsible for elevated as concentrations within shallow aquifers with fe oxyhydroxide dissolution the driving process for as release at greater depths javed and siddique 2016 proposes that as is liberated at high temperatures from exchangeable and adsorbed surface sites from fe oxides contained within the aquifer sediments there is potential that all of these mechanisms play a role in the observed trends from this study however the consistent as release within and downgradient of heating section during all weeks of the heated experiment in conjunction with the comparable results of the scm simulations demonstrate that thermally controlled desorption of as is the driving process this mechanism aligns well with the conclusions presented by javed and siddique 2016 as well as kersten and vlasova 2009 and bonte et al 2014 who indicate that adsorption of oxyanions such as arsenate and arsenite is generally an exothermic reaction and decreases with increasing temperature results during the first three weeks of the heated phase also indicate that b and mo are released within and downgradient of the heating section and gradually decrease during week 5 and week 7 in addition geochemical modelling shows that as b and mo occur as oxyanions at all times throughout the column these findings agree well with bonte et al 2013 who suggests that as b and mo behave similarly as oxyanions and can be mobilized due to desorption from fe oxyhydroxides at elevated temperatures up to 60 c despite comparable scm results and measured as concentrations the simulated as trend immediately downgradient of the heating section between 1 8 and 2 4 m slightly underpredicts as concentrations by approximately 1 3 Î¼g l 1 suggesting that additional as release mechanisms are occurring possible reasons for this discrepancy could stem from fe rich clay dissolution as proposed by fennell 2008 alternatively swedlund and webster 1999 and xu et al 2012 have demonstrated that si can act as a competitive anion and affect as adsorption in particular xu et al 2012 indicates that at alkaline conditions ph 8 dissociated silicate species led to significantly increased desorption of as v from the surface of ferric and manganese binary oxide fmbo sfe mn which is represented by the reaction 4 s fe mn aso 4 h 3 sio 4 oh s fe mn sio 4 2 haso 4 2 h 2 o ph 8 due to similar trends observed for si and as and the occurrence of alkaline ph during the heated phase it is reasonable that this reaction could also be contributing to as release in addition moncur et al 2016 indicates that as v was the dominant as species in weathered sediments from the clbr region and supports the potential for competitive anion exchange although this reaction contrasts findings by fennell 2008 that indicate si is not an aggressive competitor for removal of adsorbed as at circumneutral ph competitive exchange between as and si at alkaline ph still holds true for this study moreover this relationship between as and si provides a rationale to describe why simulated as concentrations are lower than observed as concentrations over 1 8 m to 2 4 m and why si concentrations gradually decrease over the same distance in the column results of experiment 2 and the scm support as desorption from fe oxyhydroxide minerals as originally proposed by kersten and vlasova 2009 bonte et al 2014 and javed and siddique 2016 and indicate that the dominant hydrogeochemical controls for its release are due to the effects of localized high temperatures coupled with dissolution of clays concurrent release of competitive anions such as si and increased mixing importantly the results from this study reflect the duration in which the aquifer sediments were exposed to elevated temperature conditions compared to the batch tests conducted by fennell 2008 moncur et al 2015b and javed and siddique 2016 the heated column experiments demonstrate that the column design closely resembles the flow transport and geochemical processes within localized zones of aquifer heating furthermore these results and those of the sequential extraction highlight the linkages between the physical and geochemical conditions in temperature affected aquifers and how geochemical conditions can continue to evolve after relatively shorter test durations based on these outcomes ongoing heated column experiments could allow for additional insights into the release and or attenuation mechanisms and control s of particular species such as as while geochemical conditions are driven towards equilibrium 4 conclusions the heated column experiments conducted in this study were able to effectively characterize the hydrogeochemical evolution of porewater from different aquifer materials when exposed to temperatures up to 90 c results from the heated tracer tests indicate that higher temperatures cause substantial increases in dispersivity for both material types within the column heating section changes in hydraulic conductivity are believed to be occurring as this parameter is inherently linked to viscosity and density of the fluid liberation of al cu fe mn ni so4 si and zn was observed during the heated phase of experiment 1 decreasing trends in ph and the production of so4 and metals were indicative of pyrite oxidation while the overall behavior of metals as si and so4 is likely controlled by the attenuation and release from al and fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases conversely increased concentrations of as b cu mn mo ni and zn and to some extent si during experiment 2 are attributed to thermal desorption from fe oxides at elevated temperatures in conjunction with low o2 aq concentrations and near alkaline ph liberation of al and si are primarily associated with clay muscovite and quartz dissolution as a result of elevated temperatures while attenuation of al is likely controlled by gibbsite precipitation the release of metals and metalloids from the heated column experiments provide insight into the potential reactions and mechanisms that can take place in field conditions where aquifers are exposed to localized heating results demonstrate that the addition of heat plays a dominant role in constituent release and transport and shows that subsequent reactions are inherently controlled by the strong relationship between rate and temperature outcomes of this study support the need for detailed mineralogical characterization and water quality monitoring programs as part of in situ thermal recovery projects to assess the potential effects of localized aquifer heating furthermore the application of geochemical models can help to better define mechanisms of constituent release and attenuation which can lead to informed

1450,in situ thermal recovery is utilized extensively for unconventional bitumen extraction in the cold lake beaver river clbr basin in alberta canada public health concerns have been raised over potable groundwater contamination and arsenic release adjacent to these operations within the clbr basin which have been linked to subsurface heating of aquifer sediments under localized heated conditions as bearing aquifer sediments have been shown to undergo water rock interactions and release constituents at near neutral ph conditions however release mechanisms have yet to be conclusively

has the capacity to generally satisfy higher environmental standards by producing significantly lower quantities of solid waste such as tailings in addition to creating much less surface disturbance

were selected for their stability and thermal tolerances at temperatures of up to 200 c the column itself was a 3 m long by 0 05 m diameter ptfe column with threaded ptfe column end caps housing water inflow and outflow tubing fig 1 water sampling ports were installed at 0 1 m intervals along the length of the column and were comprised of threaded stainless steel fittings and 0 1 m lengths of perforated glass wool filled ptfe tubing input water flow was controlled using a micro peristaltic pump and was sourced from a sealed 25 l glass carboy of deionized water regularly purged with ultra pure n2 g to generate a heated zone within the column six 120 v stainless steel cartridge heaters backer marathon inc were radially staggered at 0 1 m intervals inside the column between 1 0 m and 1 6 m from the column input likewise a cooling section from 1 9 m and 2 4 m was set up using two lengths of ptfe tubing inside the column which conveyed refrigerated approx 5 c water insulation tape was wrapped around the heating and cooling sections to minimize heat loss and heat gain respectively column temperature profiles were monitored using thermistors positioned at 0 1 m intervals in the heating section at 0 2 m spacing from both ends of the heating section and at 0 3 m intervals in all other sections thermistors and heat cartridges were monitored and controlled with a campbell scientific cr1000 data logger coupled with a 16 channel control port module and multiplexer complex flow regimes due to fluctuations in water density during heated experiments were taken into account when considering the orientation of the column a horizontal alignment was thought to minimize these effects due to the controlled flow gradient and minimized water density effects during heating column output water tubing was positioned 0 5 m higher than the inflow location to maintain a positive pressure gradient and outflow was collected to monitor flow rates to control dissolved oxygen do within the column and thus better mimic subsurface conditions the column and input water pump were placed inside a custom built anaerobic chamber continuously flushed with ultra pure n2 g oxygen gas concentrations within the chamber were monitored using a calibrated so 210 oxygen sensor apogee instruments inc the anaerobic chamber was constructed using 0 5 in welded acrylic panels with a removable lid and sealed with a Â¼ in butyl rubber gasket gas tubing and water inflow outflow and sampling ports were accessed outside of the chamber using tubing extensions coupled with threaded stainless steel fittings holes used to convey electrical wiring through the acrylic panels were enclosed using silicone sealant 2 2 bromide tracer tests hydraulic properties and flow characteristics were obtained in experiments 1 and 2 by conducting chemical tracer tests in both heated and unheated conditions using bromide 99 9 nabr as the conservative solute the tracer solution was pumped into the column at a rate of 0 2 ml min 1 consistent with the unheated and heated experiments tracer samples were collected from the 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m sampling ports relative to the column input to reduce possible effects caused by water withdrawals during porewater sampling small samples were collected 5 ml 6 ml 0 5 of the total column pore volume flow rate measurements were measured weekly at the output end using a graduated cylinder bromide concentrations were analyzed using a double junction cole parmer bromide ion selective electrode ise determination of the average linear velocity v and longitudinal dispersivity d l for each aquifer material was carried out by fitting data to a modelled breakthrough curve according to eq 1 domenico and schwartz 1990 1 c c 0 0 5 erfc x vt 2 avt where c c 0 represents the normalized concentration of the solution a is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion and x refers to the distance from the source where the solution is measured at a given time t each breakthrough curve was modelled by applying the least squares method coupled with the microsoft excel solver function 2 3 experiment design and sediment characterization 2 3 1 experiment 1 quartz sand with pyrite chemical physical and hydraulic parameters of the 30 40 sieve quartz sand unimin corp le sueur mn usa accusand used in experiment 1 were characterized by schroth et al 1996 and williams and oostrum 2000 pyrite grains were prepared from a 9 cm 8 cm 6 cm pyrite crystal weinrich minerals inc using a braun chipmunk rock chipper and sieved to 30 55 mesh size the 0 6 wt of pyrite selected for the column material was based on the average percentage of sulfide minerals present in bonnyville grand centre and marie creek formation sediments identified by javed et al 2014 which was shown to range between 0 09 wt and 2 79 wt qualitative characterization of the pre experimentation pyrite grains was carried out using a tungsten filament tescan vega ii xmu scanning electron microscope equipped with an oxford x ray detection system capable of energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem edx elemental analysis of the pyrite grains was performed using standard methods garcia et al 2009 at the geological survey of canada inorganic geochemistry research laboratory gsc igrl using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer la icp ms with a 40 Î¼m spot size and one minute of ablation at a 10 hz repetition rate before la icp ms analysis pyrite grains were ultrasonicated in deionized water to remove any surface contamination 2 3 2 experiment 2 aquifer sediment aquifer sediments located within the clbr basin used in experiment 2 were provided by the alberta geological survey borehole wr99 1 andriashek 2003 the aquifer material was collected between core depth intervals 122 m to 134 m and 208 m to 213 m bgs from the empress formation unit 3 and unit 1 respectively and was stored for 17 years prior to initiating the column experiment material used for the heated column experiment was made as a composite sample of both depth intervals x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf was used to characterize the mineralogy and total elemental composition of the bulk sediment while sem edx was also performed to identify sediment surface characteristics and elemental abundance bulk xrd of three samples was performed in two analytical runs with a rigaku ultima iv diffractometer using cu kÎ± radiation at an accelerating voltage of 40 kv and 40 ma and range of 4 2Î¸ 100 2Î¸ in the first run samples were scanned continuously at a step width of 0 02 2Î¸ and 3 00 minute while samples in the second run were scanned at a step width of 0 05 2Î¸ and 0 75 minute the parameters in the first run were used to identify major silicate and non silicate minerals while the slower step width of the second trial was used to identify less abundant minerals as described by javed et al 2014 xrf analysis used a claisse m4 fluxer for sample preparation followed by analysis using a rigaku supermini 200 spectrometer 2 3 3 sulfur sequential extractions sequential extraction tests were performed at the gsc igrl to identify the sources of sulfur associated with the empress formation sediments and to better understand the mechanisms by which sulfur species are liberated different sulfur fractions were isolated using a modified sequential extraction method coupled to the distillation reflux apparatus reported by xiao quan et al 1992 and chen et al 1997 although sequential extractions were designed to target sulfur bearing fractions other phases such as clays and oxides were also extracted these phases along with the sulfur fractions are considered in the results and discussion of this study the four phase sequential extraction procedure table 1 began with the removal of weakly adsorbed and surface bound sulfur fraction by adding 30 ml of 1 0 m ammonium acetate solution buffered at ph 7 0 to the sediment sample which was then mechanically shaken for two hours afterwards the sediment solution mixture was centrifuged at 3800 rpm for ten minutes the supernatant was then collected for analysis and the sediment residue was rinsed with 5 ml of deionized water this extraction method was repeated using 40 ml of 1 0 m ammonium acetate buffered to ph 5 0 to remove the surface and carbonate bound fraction once surface and carbonate bound s was extracted the sediment residue was poured into a three neck boiling flask with 10 ml of deionized water the flask was then coupled to a distillation reflux apparatus and a dropping funnel which was used to add 10 ml of 2 0 m hcl resulting in a 1 0 m concentration in the flask and was brought to a gentle boil for one hour volatile h2s g was trapped in 10 ml of 0 05 m naoh in a 30 ml test tube via a stream of n2 g after one hour 0 1 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the naoh solution to oxidize the trapped s fraction which was subsequently collected as the phase 3b sample solution from the boiling flask was collected as the phase 3a sample following phase 3 3 0 g of granular zn s was added to the sediment residue in the boiling flask and the system was purged with n2 g for several minutes a dropping funnel was used to slowly add 20 ml of 6 0 m hcl similarly the phase 4 solution was heated to a gentle boil for one hour after which 0 1 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the naoh solution and the sulfate collected as the phase 4b sample the final residue and solution i e phase 4a was not analyzed due to the elevated concentration of dissolved zn however to allow for comparisons with sequential extraction results three fresh sediment samples underwent aqua regia digestion at 90 c for three hours and were analyzed using icp oes to determine the total solid phase concentrations quality assurance and control methods were carried out using teflon boiling chips to represent blank samples as well as by using a till standard previously characterized by hall et al 1996 each phase of the extraction test was run in triplicate using the aquifer sediment blank and till standard samples to validate reproducibility of the procedure and investigate the distribution of results 2 4 heated and unheated column experiments prior to commencing each experiment the column was flushed with deionized water air dried and then gradually filled with sediment 6 7 kg in experiment 1 8 1 kg in experiment 2 and gently compacted afterwards the sediment pore space was flushed with co2 g to remove atmospheric gases and input water was pumped at a rate of 0 2 ml min 1 one pore volume per week until fully saturated outflow volumes were measured regularly to establish steady state conditions and confirm that the system was completely saturated both experiments 1 and 2 were performed using deionized low oxygen 3 mg l 1 input water during experiment 1 the two week unheated phase and initial eight week heated phase were conducted without the use of an anaerobic chamber following the initial eight week heated phase the column was placed in an anaerobic chamber for an additional eight weeks with an o2 g partial pressure kept below 2 kpa experiment 2 was performed entirely in the anaerobic chamber with an unheated phase of approximately two weeks to establish a reference condition while the heated phase was run for approximately two months although the column was placed in the anaerobic chamber conditions inside the column were not anaerobic due to the presence of dissolved oxygen for the heated phase of each experiment the heat cartridges were programmed to reach an internal column temperature gradient from 50 c at the start of the heating section 1 0 m from input end to 90 c at the end of the heating section 1 6 m from input end which generally aligns with field observations from thermal recovery operations which estimate temperatures of approximately 100 c in the aquifer units adjacent to the steam injection well fennell 2008 giraldo and macmillan 2016 temperature control for the heat cartridges was based on measurements of temperature at 10 s intervals that were averaged and recorded each minute water samples were collected once a week at 0 3 m intervals beginning with the 3 0 m sampling port closest to the outflow each sampling period included an hour pause between each sample collection to allow for replacement of the volume of extracted water sampling periods for ph do so4 and fe2 analysis were alternated on a weekly basis with dissolved element concentrations analyses using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro arcos and icp ms thermofisher x2 us epa method 6020 lichte et al 1987 arbogast 1996 for analysis of ph do so4 and fe2 each sample consisted of two 5 ml aliquots filtered to 0 45 Î¼m with the first 5 ml aliquot sulfate concentrations and ph were measured using the hach sulfaver 4 method us epa method 8051 on a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer model dr2800 01b1 and a double junction cole parmer atc ph temperature probe respectively the second aliquot was used to measure do concentrations with an oakton do probe and fe2 concentrations using the hach 1 10 phenanthroline method on the dr 2800 for both the sulfate and fe2 concentrations samples were diluted by half using deionized water to produce a 10 ml sample in experiment 2 total alkalinity was also measured from separate 0 5 ml samples and using the hach tntplus 870 colorimetric method on the dr 2800 water samples for icp oes ms analysis were collected as full 10 ml aliquots filtered to 0 45 Î¼m and refrigerated in sealed 2 hno3 washed and dried 15 ml hdpe vials prior to analysis samples were acidified using ultrapure hno3 to 1 v v and left for three weeks to ensure complete desorbtion from vial walls 2 4 1 geochemical and surface complexation modelling geochemical modelling was performed using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 to determine the mineral saturation indices the minteq v4 database allison et al 1991 was specifically selected based on its integration of reaction enthalpies and demonstrated accuracy for calculating quartz solubility at high temperatures appelo and postma 2005 in addition basaluminite al4 oh 10so4 albite na alsi3o8 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 f oh 2 and high femg smectite ca0 025na0 1k0 2fe0 5 2 fe0 2 3 mg1 15al1 25si3 5h2o12 from the watq4f phreeqc and llnl databases were included in the geochemical models to investigate the specific saturation indices of these minerals of interest unheated and heated phase surface complexation models scm were also developed in phreeqc to simulate reactive transport of arsenic sorption and desorption as a function of temperature in experiment 2 this model integrates an electrostatic diffuse double layer model from dzombak and morel 1990 originally developed for ferrihydrite fe oh 3 am however because this model has also been applied for goethite Î± feo oh dixit and hering 2003 and fe oxyhydroxides in natural sediments postma et al 2007 bonte et al 2014 it was selected to simulate as bearing fe oxides in empress formation aquifer sediments temperature regimes within the scm were defined using average temperature data from the column in experiment 2 parameterization of heat transport during heated conditions makes use of the equation 2 r t 1 1 n Ï s Îº s n Ï w Îº w where the thermal retardation factor r t is a function of porosity n the density Ï and specific heat capacity Îº of the sediments Ï s 2 65 kg dm 3 Îº s 0 830 kj k 1 kg 1 and water Ï w 1 kg dm 3 Îº w 4 18 kj k 1 kg 1 flow characteristics and boundary conditions were attained from the br tracer test while initial geochemical conditions reflected average unheated concentrations table 2 transport in the 3 0 m column was discretized using 60 cells at 0 05 m intervals with an advective time step of 10 080 s for each cell which is consistent with the column flow rate of approximately one pore volume per week i e 0 2 ml min 1 the intrinsic sorption equilibrium constant log k for as onto fe oxyhydroxide was optimized to 4 05 which differs from the value of 4 9 and 5 41 reported in bonte et al 2014 and in the minteq v4 database respectively however as bonte et al 2014 notes log k values can vary considerably between synthetic and natural fe oxides which supports use of the optimized value to better reflect arsenate sorption by fe oxides associated with the aquifer sediments in this study additionally this model applies the change in enthalpy h r value developed by bonte et al 2014 based on van t hoff sorption isotherm coefficients surface parameters for goethite from dixit and hering 2003 and measured fe concentrations from phase 3a of the sequential extraction using empress formation aquifer sediments 3 results and discussion 3 1 column flow and transport although most natural aquifer units typically exist in low temperature environments 5 c 20 c the results of this study build on the work of fennell 2008 and bonte et al 2014 to examine flow behavior in high temperature zones and gain insight into the processes that occur in localized heated aquifer systems similar to those encountered at in situ thermal recovery operations modelled breakthrough curves for unheated and heated tracer tests at 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m from experiment 1 align well with measured data r 2 0 975 0 995 fig 2 unheated tracer measurements were collected at 0 5 m 1 7 m and 2 5 m while heated results were collected at 1 7 m and 2 5 m as they were located downgradient from the heating section due to possible volatilization of br at high temperatures heated tracer tests were run with a lower heating gradient from 50 c to 80 c for experiment 2 unheated tracer measurements were collected at 0 5 m while heated measurements were collected at 1 7 m and 2 5 m modelled breakthrough curves fit to measured data produced r2 values ranging from 0 969 to 0 992 unheated and heated tracer test results show that longitudinal dispersivity a l increases as a function of temperature in experiment 1 a l exhibits an order of magnitude increase from 25 c to 80 c with values of 1 9 10 3 m to 6 2 10 2 m whereas in experiment 2 a l increases from 9 1 10 2 m to 3 5 10 1 m in contrast linear velocity v l changes minimally between experiments and temperatures with values of 4 1 10 6 m s 1 to 4 4 10 6 m s 1 and 4 5 10 6 m s 1 to 4 9 10 6 m s 1 for experiments 1 and 2 respectively these results suggest that the fluid flow properties are temperature dependent with concomitant impacts on constituent transport the minimal changes in v l and column outflow rate 6 10 for both unheated and heated conditions primarily reflects the programmed pumping rate nonetheless the earlier arrival of br during the heated tracer tests results likely reflect changes in the hydraulic conductivity as temperature is known to control both water density and viscosity the relationship between temperature and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 3 k Ïkg Î¼ where k denotes the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 Ï refers to the temperature dependent fluid density k is the absolute permeability g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 and Î¼ is the temperature dependent viscosity in the temperature range of most fresh groundwater systems between 5 c and 20 c water typically has a similar density and viscosity and hydraulic conductivity becomes solely dependent on material properties however in higher temperature systems water viscosity and density are considerably reduced which consequently increases hydraulic conductivity levy et al 1989 cho et al 1999 based on the permeability of quartz sand measured by williams and oostrum 2000 and assuming this value remains constant within the observed temperature range eq 3 predicts that the k within the heated section would be approximately 2 5 times higher than unheated section given the consistency of the linear flow rate this suggests that increased dispersion is a primary characteristic of flow behavior under heated conditions changes in temperature dependent a l should introduce additional mixing along the heated unheated interface sections of the column which should lead to a wider distribution of br concentration with increasing transport this effect can be seen in the breakthrough curves and is likely a fundamental expression of temperature dependent dispersion end of column flow rate measurements from each tracer test were found to be approximately 0 17 ml min 1 or roughly one pore flush per week which generally reflects the programmed pumping rate of 0 2 ml min 1 differences between these two values are primarily attributed to sampling volume losses which are on the order of approximately 0 015 0 025 ml min 1 velocity for experiments 1 and 2 determined from modelled breakthrough curves was 4 78 10 6 m s 1 and 4 28 10 6 m s 1 respectively based on an average of both unheated and heated experiments porosity calculated using darcy s law with measured flow rate and model derived velocity for experiments 1 and 2 was 0 35 and 0 31 respectively 3 2 experiment 1 quartz sand with pyrite 3 2 1 quartz sand and pyrite composition chemical characterization of the quartz sand by schroth et al 1996 indicates that total fe mn and zn concentrations are 7 65 g kg 1 40 1 mg kg 1 and 7 1 mg kg 1 respectively while total fe oxide concentrations are 0 35 g kg 1 in addition the prewashed sand with water exhibits a relatively low cation exchange capacity 0 62 cmol kg 1 schroth et al 1996 sem micrographs of pyrite grains in experiment 1 show that surfaces are angular with fresh conchoidal fractures smaller sized fragments on larger grain surfaces are also evident and illustrate that finer bound particles 50 Î¼m were produced during the crystal fragmentation pyrite grain surfaces also exhibit very minute signs of pitting which suggests that oxidation has only recently commenced and is consistent with the four week exposure period between crushing and conducting surface analysis similar findings by murphy and strongin 2008 and chandra and gerson 2010 have established that pyrite can undergo oxidation after exposure to atmospheric conditions la icp ms results of pyrite samples n 9 exhibit a wide distribution of trace element concentrations after two rounds of analysis these trends demonstrate spatial heterogeneity within the original cubic crystal sample and suggest that the original pyrite crystal likely had substantial inclusions substitutions and or crystal zoning features average abundance generally follows the trend as 251 131 ppm se pb zn cu co al mn v ni however higher and lower concentrations of these elements were observed in individual samples 3 2 2 column experiment 1 unheated conditions during the unheated phase of experiment 1 temperatures throughout the column were maintained at approximately 25 c initial ph and do measurements at the column input 0 3 m are consistent with values measured in the input water 5 5 and 1 5 mg l 1 respectively but suggest some equilibration with the atmosphere and column materials dissolved oxygen mn si and so4 concentrations increased with distance over the column fig 3 while localized increases were also observed for al as fe and zn however ph and cu remained relatively unchanged the observed increases in al as fe mn so and zn are consistent with microbially mediated pyrite oxidation at ambient temperatures nordstrom 2011 the increase in do suggested undesired oxygen ingress and subsequently lead to enclosure of the column in the anaerobic chamber for the remainder of the experiment these initial outcomes were also consistent with the sem results above that indicated oxidation of pyrite grains left exposed to atmospheric conditions after being crushed and were subjected to moderate concentrations of dissolved oxygen 4 2 mg l 1 to 5 5 mg l 1 within the column porewater increases in si concentration are attributed to quartz dissolution in addition to the liberation of water soluble si due to the quartz sand being unwashed prior to initiating the experiment geochemical modelling results indicate that gibbsite al oh 3 and goethite are at saturation in the first 1 0 m of the column and increase above saturation between 1 0 m to 3 0 m while quartz reaches saturation at 1 2 m of the column and downgradient sampling locations fig 4 these trends suggest that in addition to pyrite al fe oxyhydroxides likely present on sediment surfaces and quartz are dissolving during unheated conditions the dissolution of trace aluminosilicate minerals could also affect al and si concentrations to some extent however their contributions should be minimal in comparison to the dominant sources furthermore aloh3 am ferrihydrite and sio2 am tend to remain undersaturated during the unheated phase and suggest that these minerals are not controlling al fe and si concentrations respectively 3 2 3 column experiment 1 heated conditions upon initiating the heated phase a temperature gradient from 50 c to 90 c was maintained in the heating section of the column while the cooling section lowered the temperature to approximately 14 c over the course of the initial twelve week period do concentrations decrease within the heating section in relation to unheated conditions from approximately 5 mg l 1 to 3 mg l 1 once the column was contained in the anaerobic chamber following week 9 do concentrations decrease uniformly to 3 mg l 1 by week 16 throughout the column similarly in the initial 12 weeks of the heated experiment ph generally decreases in the heated section from approximately 5 5 in unheated conditions to 4 with the exception of week 6 where ph exhibits a rapid increase up to 7 after column enclosure in the anaerobic chamber ph increases to 7 5 in the heating section by week 16 and remains above ph 5 at all downgradient locations manganese and si concentrations increase overall across the column during the heated phase but their absolute concentrations are generally lower than for the unheated phase mn concentrations generally decrease from week 1 to week 17 with the noteworthy exception of an increase downgradient of the heating section during week 9 similarly si concentrations decrease between weeks 1 and 9 while the column is uncontained and upon enclosure subsequently increase from approximately 1 mg l 1 to 4 mg l 1 downgradient of the heating section between weeks 10 and 17 at locations within and downgradient of the heating section there were concurrent increases of so4 al cu fe zn and to lesser extent as in comparison to unheated conditions sulfate concentrations are highest in the initial uncontained weeks of the experiment with spikes reaching maximums of 104 80 70 and 44 mg l 1 in weeks 4 2 6 and 8 respectively conversely sulfate concentrations are generally lower in subsequent contained weeks and are similar to unheated conditions although concentrations within the cooling section are approximately 15 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 higher during week 12 than in week 10 measured so4 concentrations are found to account for almost all of the total s concentration as such the presence of sulfoxy anions i e sulfite and thiosulfate are generally assumed to undergo complete oxidation into sulfate though low concentrations could be present liberation of al cu and zn is most evident during weeks 5 7 and 9 is characterized by rapid increases within the heating section as well as increases downgradient of the heating section which appear to be unaffected by cooling section the highest concentrations of al and zn reach up to 1 4 mg l 1 and 3 0 mg l 1 respectively at the end of the column during week 9 while cu increases to 0 5 mg l 1 within and downgradient of the heating section similarly fe concentrations are highest during week 7 9 11 and 12 as fe2 and reach 2 6 mg l 1 in week 7 downgradient of the heating section and to 3 7 mg l 1 in week 9 within the heating section in addition the increases in al cu fe and zn during week 7 and week 9 to coincide with the lowest ph during week 8 and week 10 for as heated phase concentrations exceed unheated phase concentrations during week 3 5 7 and 17 downgradient of the heating section at 1 8 m the highest as concentration is observed during week 7 at 3 3 Î¼g l 1 while the most consistent as release occurs during week 17 with concentrations between 1 Î¼g l 1 and 3 Î¼g l 1 at all sampling points from 0 9 m trends for ph do sulfate and metal loid concentrations are attributed to microbially mediated pyrite oxidation at elevated temperatures norris and owen 1993 and dissolution reactions through the consumption of o2 aq the rapid decrease in ph between week 1 and week 10 is consistent with the influence of temperature on sulfide mineral oxidation rates belzile et al 2004 and acid production the subsequent return to near neutral ph in week 17 is attributed to a decrease in sulfide oxidation rates likely due to the decrease in do availability and slower rates of o2 aq diffusion through the oxidized rim of pyrite grains davis and ritchie 1986 although sulfate release was expected to be relatively constant trends do not appear uniform results indicate that concentrations increase irregularly in the initial weeks of the experiment concurrent with inferred precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides and gradually decrease following week 6 which is supported by the reduced rate of pyrite oxidation however it is important to note that sulfate is produced at all weeks of the experiment including week 17 which suggests that oxidation reactions persist as would be expected given the availability of do geochemical modelling results indicate that both ferrihydrite and goethite are at or above saturation in the column heating section between week 1 and week 7 and are likely precipitating as a result of pyritic sulfide and iron oxidation downgradient of the heating section al oh 3 am reaches and maintains saturation during weeks 5 to 9 and then returns back to undersaturation during week 11 while ferrihydrite is characteristically undersaturated in this section during most weeks of the heated experiment this undersaturation is particularly evident during week 5 to week 11 when ph is less than 5 which agrees with the ph control on ferrihydrite solubility schwertmann 1991 blowes et al 2014 conversely basaluminite al4 so4 oh 10Ë5 h2o is oversaturated downgradient of the heating section during all weeks of the experiment and is possibly precipitating furthermore schwertmannite fe16 oh so4 12 13o16Ë10 12h2o was not included in the geochemical model but tends to approach stability at ph 3 5 regenspurg et al 2004 and may exert a control on fe and or so4 during week 10 the overall trends in al and fe concentrations suggest that they are controlled by reactions involving al fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases in addition it is likely that precipitation of these phases strongly influences as cu mn si so4 and zn concentrations through attenuation mechanisms such as sorption and or co precipitation pierce and moore 1982 trivedi and axe 2001 jang et al 2003 sanchez espaÃ±a et al 2006 although mobility and solubility of cu mn and zn tend to increase with lower ph the presence of oxyhydroxides and hydroxysulfates suggests that a combination of these controls are likely responsible for the observed constituent concentrations and behavior over the course of the heated experiment in comparison to unheated conditions si concentrations increase during week 1 and week 5 of the heated experiment and suggest that release is controlled by quartz dissolution from elevated temperatures and as a ph response caused by pyrite oxidation the peaks in si concentration during weeks 1 3 and 5 correspond to ph increases during weeks 2 4 and 6 respectively and suggest that ph and temperature enhance quartz solubility concurrently within the heated section at these moments the higher si concentrations decrease immediately after the cooling section and generally stay low through the rest of the column geochemical modelling results indicate that quartz is undersaturated in the heating section and shifts towards saturation during the cooling section which is consistent with the data and proposed mechanisms of si release however sio2 am remains undersaturated in the column suggesting that this mineral phase is not controlling si removal instead the results of this study propose that al fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases control si concentrations through co precipitation and or sorption which have been demonstrated by davis et al 2001 and sanchez espaÃ±a and reyes 2019 as dominant attenuation mechanisms although as was found to be the most abundant trace element in the pyrite mineral composition the observed dissolved constituent concentrations maximum of 3 Î¼g l 1 and ph and do conditions from experiment 1 suggest that as released from pyrite dissolution generally remains immobile which is believed to be a function of the redox state under oxidizing conditions as v dominates and can readily adsorb onto and co precipitate with amorphous and crystalline al fe oxyhydroxide minerals pierce and moore 1982 sharma and sohn 2009 as well as hydroxysulfate minerals such as schwertmannite sanchez espaÃ±a and reyes 2019 conversely as iii is adsorbed less preferentially particularly in the presence of as v qi and pichler 2016 and is typically more abundant in reducing environments sharma and sohn 2009 although as speciation was not completed in this study the results of the column experiment and the phreeqc simulation allude to arsenate as the dominant as species due to the availability of o2 aq in addition as concentrations from weeks 5 to 11 suggests that al fe oxyhydroxide and or hydroxysulfate dissolution acts as a primary release control during this time and subsequently shifts to desorption previous investigations by yang et al 2008 and xu et al 2012 have demonstrated that adsorption strength of as from fe oxides generally decreases with increasing ph while bonte et al 2013 and bonte et al 2014 document thermal desorption of as from fe oxyhydroxides at elevated temperatures 3 3 experiment 2 aquifer sediment 3 3 1 aquifer sediment characterization and geochemistry andriashek 2003 classifies the aquifer material from the empress formation used in experiment 2 as sand to sand and fine gravel visual observations indicate that the grains are subangular to subrounded the presence of organic matter was not recorded in the wr99 1 core log andriashek 2003 or visually observed in the homogenized aquifer sediments though javed et al 2014 identified 0 1 total organic carbon toc in sand sediments from clbr strata bulk xrd analyses indicate that sediments are primarily composed of quartz and calcite caco3 with lesser amounts of albite and muscovite plus minor enstatite fe mg sio3 and sericite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 the mineralogy is generally consistent with previous clbr aquifer sediment characterizations andriashek 2003 fennell 2008 javed et al 2014 moncur et al 2015b however previous studies also observed minor pyrite typically in the form of euhedral crystals and inclusions within precambrian granitic bedrock and as individual framboidal grains which were suggested to be neominerals formed in the aquifer and aquitards sediments post deposition moncur et al 2015a while xrd results from this study did not detect sulfide minerals the sequential extraction tests discussed below do indicate their presence similarly xrd analysis did not detect fe oxyhydroxide minerals such as goethite though quantitative sem data as well as sequential extraction results suggests they are likely present sem edx scans indicate that the aquifer sediments mainly contain si al ca and fe consistent with xrf results in some instances the sem edx detected fe as fe oxide and fe carbonate phases fig 5 the occurrence of fe oxides is consistent with visual observation of a rust coloured precipitate found on numerous sediment surfaces further the fe oxides identified by sem edx contained minor 3 5 5 6 wt si trace 0 5 1 0 wt al and ca and in one case trace 0 8 0 9 wt as and p based on these results as well as descriptions from previous reports by fennell 2008 javed et al 2014 and moncur et al 2015b this phase was likely an aggregate fe oxyhydroxide mineral such as a poorly crystallized goethite which was suggested to be a carrier of as fennell 2008 also indicates that fe rich smectite clays such as nontronite na0 3fe2 sial 4o10 oh 2 n h2o or saponite ca na 0 2 mg fe 3 si al 4o10 oh 2 4 h2o from the muriel lake formation contribute approximately 8 Î¼g g 1 as the presence of clays in the shallower aquifer material used for this study is consistent with andriashek 2003 who indicates that the clay fraction is approximately 10 15 wr99 1 122 134 m however these sediments were also homogenized with sand and gravel material from a lower depth interval wr99 1 208 213 m and could explain why clay minerals were not detected by xrd though it is likely that they are present to some degree 3 3 2 sequential extractions of sulfur species and solid phase results supernatant samples collected during each extraction phase were used to assess the concentrations of individual sulfur fractions as well as the release of associated elements tables 3 and 4 in comparison to the digested s concentration the cumulative s concentration from the sequential extraction is generally lower by roughly 100 ppm to 1000 ppm although this finding indicates that some s components were incompletely dissolved by the extraction phases it is important to note that the phase 4a sample was not analyzed due to particularly high zn concentrations further the sequential extractions aimed to determine the source s of s accessible during the column experiment and by natural groundwaters and thus these coarse sediments were left uncrushed it is reasonable to assume that crushing would dissolve more of the sediment resulting in greater total s concentrations additionally the differences between xrf and aqua regia digested concentrations suggest that the total sulfide pool is likely less than the accessible sulfide fraction phase 4b as sulfide minerals are also encapsulated within the aluminosilicate mass phase 1 results show that 252 68 2 ppm 70 s was removed from the sediment surfaces demonstrating that the primary s fraction is surficially bound the results also show that the extractant used in phase 1 was most successful in removing the adsorbed s as the fraction in phase 2 was below detection limits 10 ppm and suggests that adsorbed s is weakly bound on crystalline and amorphous phases and is not associated with carbonate minerals data from phase 3a 3b and 4b indicate that the somewhat variable sulfur concentrations are reasonable based on the duration and exposure of the sediment to natural aquifer conditions in sample 2 and sample 3 these fractions represent approximately 19 22 of the total s extracted whereas in sample 1 phase 3a and 3b account for 9 12 and phase 4b makes up to 27 of the available sulfur pool the supernatant from phase 3a returned high concentrations of al and si 1570 434 and 1558 376 ppm which is likely due to dissolution of aluminosilicate and or clay minerals however due to the comparatively lower concentrations of k and na as well as the strength of the 1 0 m hcl solution concentration used in phase 3a the observations suggest that these constituents are also likely a component of the fe oxides aluminum and si were identified as part of the fe oxide precipitates from sem edx analysis and similarly were suggested to be contained in the secondary fe phase proposed in experiment 1 calcium was also identified during sem edx of the fe precipitate however the measured concentrations in phases 1 through 3 in addition to those for mg are attributed to the presence of water soluble ca and mg fractions as well as ca and mg carbonate and aluminosilicate minerals as expected ca concentrations increase up to 2586 1923 ppm when subjected to ph 5 solutions in phase 2 and phase 3a conversely mg exhibits similar concentrations in phase 1 and 2 before increasing to 749 244 ppm in phase 3a this finding suggests that mg carbonates did not completely dissolve in phase 2 or alternatively that mg concentrations in phase 3a are associated with an aluminosilicate mineral fraction digested ca concentrations were found to be somewhat lower than cumulative totals for ca in phases 1 2 and 3a after careful review of the results ca concentrations show a wide variability between each sample and extraction phase this observed variability is captured in the standard deviation but suggests that considerable diversity in ca is present in the different solid phases based on the duration between the time of sampling and the sediment characterization it is possible that some degree of carbonate dissolution had occurred due to ph buffering reactions apart from the water soluble fractions i e phase 1 and 2 fe concentrations in the phase 3a and digested samples supports the occurrence of fe oxide fe rich clay and fe sulfide minerals not detected using bulk xrd in addition sequential as cu ni mn p and pb concentrations are the highest in phase 3a which were below or only slightly above their respective detection limits in phase 1 and 2 these results strongly suggest that these constituents are associated with the fraction hosting fe oxides and fe rich clays which tend to dissolve under the same conditions similarly as concentrations below detection limits in the water soluble and carbonate fractions closely resemble those reported by javed and siddique 2016 while the digested fractions also align well with javed and siddique 2016 and moncur et al 2015a in addition it is important to recognize that since the sequential extractions were focused on s species the digested concentrations were higher in most cases than the subtotal of phase 1 2 and 3a due to the absence of phase 4a data overall xrf concentrations of al ca k mg na and si were found to be consistent with the mineralogy identified through xrd noteworthy differences are observed between the total concentrations obtained by xrf and aqua regia digestions and indicates that complete dissolution of alumino silicate minerals did not occur nevertheless this comparison indicates that the undigested minerals and accessory inclusions contribute to the dominant pools of most constituents with the exception of as and s 3 3 3 column experiment 2 unheated conditions results from unheated conditions in experiment 2 indicate that ph is consistently near neutral approx 7 2 do concentrations are 4 mg l 1 throughout the column and ca k mg na and s concentrations rapidly increase with distance along the column fig 6 in comparison to field data collected by fennell 2008 in alberta aquifers unheated concentrations of constituents measured at the end of the column in experiment 2 are higher by approximately one to two orders of magnitude with the exception of si fig 6 and fig 7 in contrast moncur et al 2015a indicates that groundwater parameters ph do as fe k mg na si and so4 within the empress formation aquifer are quite similar to those measured within the column apart from ca which is higher in experiment 2 by approximately 300 mg l 1 unheated experiment results suggest that aqueous geochemistry reflects a transient pulse of weakly bound surface fractions of as b ca cu k mg mn mo na ni s si and zn due to the storage period of aquifer material prior to initiating the column experiment there is potential that this time lead to the production of labile oxidation and or ph buffering products such as so4 and ca that could be more easily dissolved and mobilized although the constituents released during the unheated phase likely reflect pseudo weathering processes that occurred during this storage period comparisons with moncur et al 2015a suggest that the overall geochemical data from the unheated phase provides a reasonable analog for natural conditions and a basis to rationalize the weakly adsorbed and water soluble fractions 3 3 4 column experiment 2 heated conditions during the heated phase temperatures within the heating section were controlled using a temperature gradient from 50 c at 1 0 m to 90 c at 1 6 m while temperatures within the cooling section gradually decreased over the course of the experiment to approx 12 c after improvements were made to the circulation of refrigerated water overall trends for total alkalinity increase with distance along the column with a gradual decrease over the course of the experiment the ph in the heating section remains consistently between 7 and 9 and drops between 6 5 and 8 in the cooling section in weeks 3 to 9 ph peaks at 1 5 m reaching a maximum of 8 9 do remained between 3 and 4 mg l 1 throughout the experiment calcium k mg na and s concentrations successively decrease from week 1 to week 7 which is consistent with the continual flushing of weakly adsorbed water soluble ions fig 6 similarly mn concentrations released during unheated conditions appear to be transported downgradient during week 1 of the heated experiment overall mn concentrations during the heated phase remain below 1 0 mg l 1 fig 7 while cu and ni concentrations are less than in unheated phase and remain below 0 012 and 0 004 mg l 1 respectively however cu and ni concentrations increase after the heated section of the column iron concentrations remain low throughout the experiment 0 040 mg l 1 while overall al as mo si zn concentrations increase in comparison to unheated results fig 7 overall b concentrations decrease over time with the highest concentrations during the unheated phase during the heated phase b concentration trends gradually rise to a peak at the end of the heating section and remain relatively constant afterwards over the course of experiment 2 the ph increases towards alkaline conditions 8 in the unheated and heating sections and drops below 8 following the heating section indicating that oh is being produced and consumed respectively in the case of total alkalinity trends indicate that bicarbonate is produced through the heating section but that the rate of production decreases over time these results coupled with geochemical modelling fig 8 suggest that ph and total alkalinity are responding to clay and carbonate mineral dissolution within the heating section and as secondary gibbsite subsequently precipitates downgradient furthermore the relatively constant do concentrations throughout the column generally indicates that the column apparatus did inhibit oxygen ingress and that reactions within the heating section are not consuming o2 aq the release of cu mn ni and zn is attributed to desorption from fe oxide and dissolution of clay minerals in the heating section which is consistent with the highest concentrations of the sequential extraction found in phase 3a table 4 however lower amounts of cu mn and zn were also present in the adsorbed and carbonate fraction within the heating section zn exhibits a peak concentration up to 0 16 mg l 1 during week 1 and up to 0 07 mg l 1 in week 7 similarly notable mn concentrations increase following the heating section in week 1 approaching 1 mg l 1 in experiment 1 the occurrence of these constituents was associated with pyrite dissolution along with a corresponding increase in sulfide mineral oxidation products however in the heated phase of experiment 2 fe concentrations remain below 0 05 mg l 1 while overall trends for so4 are associated with flushing of the water soluble fraction consistent with phase 1 of the sequential extraction based on these results there is limited evidence to demonstrate that sulfide mineral oxidation occurs and contributes to constituent mobilization the measured fe trends geochemical modelling results for goethite and lack of dysoxic to anoxic reducing conditions generally discounts the potential for fe oxyhydroxide dissolution geochemical modelling indicates that goethite was above saturation for the duration of the experiment which contrasts findings by moncur et al 2016 that indicate fe oxyhydroxides are undersaturated due to greater reducing conditions although fe oxyhydroxide dissolution is unfavourable during this experiment it is possible that these minerals could dissolve under lower o2 aq concentrations it is also important to note that mineral dissolution constituent release and transport in localized zones of aquifer heating can lead to potential changes in the physical properties of aquifer sediments by altering pore space and or mineral stability however in these heated experiments the total mass transfer was found to be very small likely due to the relatively short duration approx eight weeks of the heated phase for example the mass transfer for sulfur the constituent with the highest concentration was 1 1 g in experiment 2 and 0 4 g in experiment 1 compared to the total mass of the column sediment which was 8 1 kg and 6 7 kg respectively additional investigation into the long term consequences of mass transport caused by aquifer heating would require prolonged experiments to gain further insight of the effects the week 5 to week 7 results indicate that b fe k mg mn na ni and s concentrations had reached near steady state conditions while total alkalinity al mo and si were decreasing week on week within the heating section conversely as and zn concentrations were increasing within the heating section during the same period these differences suggest that there were ongoing reactions occurring within the heating section which likely include clay and aluminosilicate mineral dissolution in conjunction with desorption from fe oxides the dissolution of clay and aluminosilicates at 90 c and circumneutral ph is supported by the geochemical modelling results of this study which indicate that these minerals are undersaturated as well as kinetic dissolution investigations for smectite cama and ganor 2015 and muscovite lammers et al 2017 in comparison to trends in the unheated phase results from the heated phase suggest that the increased solubility of muscovite lammers et al 2017 and quartz knauss and wolery 1988 are controlling the increases in al and si concentrations while the sharp decrease in al following the heating section is likely being controlled by gibbsite precipitation undersaturation of muscovite within the heating section aligns with the peak al concentrations and oversaturation of gibbsite downgradient of 1 8 m aligns with rapid al decreases gibbsite dissolution within the heating section also has the potential to release al as geochemical modelling results indicate that it is undersaturated quartz is maintained near saturation throughout the column with a slight undersaturation in the heated section corresponding with the overall release of si which suggests that quartz solubility is the primary control on si concentrations throughout the column similarly smectite dissolution throughout the heated column experiment is supported by geochemical modelling results and suggests that it is dissolving and influencing si and al concentrations however the low concentrations of fe 0 025 mg l 1 throughout the experiment suggest that smectite dissolution is not contributing to substantive releases overall trends for si reflect similar findings by fennell 2008 who shows an increase in si concentrations in groundwater due to localized aquifer heating from a thermal recovery well although geochemical modelling results indicate that the dominant mechanism for si release is controlled by clay and alumino silicate mineral dissolution due to elevated temperatures si also exhibits a noteworthy decrease of about 5 mg l 1 between week 1 and week 7 this decrease suggests that si concentrations decrease as clay minerals dissolve and become less abundant over the duration of the experiment alternatively a portion of the early stage si release could also be influenced by desorption from aluminosilicates and or fe oxyhydroxides which is supported by the adsorbed si fraction results of the sequential extraction test as well as the decrease in si adsorption that can occur with increasing temperature bonte et al 2014 surface complexation modelling based on the modified log k and the established h r bonte et al 2014 indicate that simulated as concentrations increase within the heating section as temperatures reach up to 90 c and decrease at downgradient locations whereas as concentrations remain consistent across the column during unheated conditions fig 9 these scm results are in agreement with observed as trends and provide a rationale for as release due to thermally driven desorption within the heating section and suggest that this mechanism is shared for the release of zn although the magnitude for as and zn releases are different previous studies have found that both constituents can be sorbed by fe oxyhydroxides pierce and moore 1982 trivedi and axe 2001 jang et al 2003 qi and pichler 2016 the observed differences between the two elements are potentially linked to the initial adsorbed concentrations as well as their potential to be resorbed downgradient of the heating section zinc was also shown to be present in the adsorbed and carbonate fraction i e phase 2 which could explain why concentrations in the heating section tend to exhibit spikes whereas as release trends were more gradual arsenic concentrations during the unheated phase of this study were on the order of 2 Î¼g l 1 and generally align with groundwater concentrations reported by moncur et al 2015a the authors indicate that as concentrations within the empress formation aquifer are between 1 Î¼g l 1 to 60 Î¼g l 1 though there was no indication if any measurements were proximal to thermal recovery operations the overall increase in as concentration up to 10 Î¼g l 1 during the heated phase reflects field and batch test observations by fennell 2008 moncur et al 2016 and javed and siddique 2016 however those studies also measured up to 20 higher as concentrations discrepancies between the results of this experiment to those of the above authors are primarily attributed to the different types of experiments performed which did not consider transport and to a degree the different aquifer sediments used in each study although increases in as have been observed in all studies the mechanisms for as release proposed by the above authors have been inconsistent thus far fennell 2008 suggests that as release at elevated temperatures is primarily controlled by the ligand promoted reductive dissolution of fe rich smectite clay minerals alternatively moncur et al 2016 suggests under natural unheated conditions pyrite oxidation is responsible for elevated as concentrations within shallow aquifers with fe oxyhydroxide dissolution the driving process for as release at greater depths javed and siddique 2016 proposes that as is liberated at high temperatures from exchangeable and adsorbed surface sites from fe oxides contained within the aquifer sediments there is potential that all of these mechanisms play a role in the observed trends from this study however the consistent as release within and downgradient of heating section during all weeks of the heated experiment in conjunction with the comparable results of the scm simulations demonstrate that thermally controlled desorption of as is the driving process this mechanism aligns well with the conclusions presented by javed and siddique 2016 as well as kersten and vlasova 2009 and bonte et al 2014 who indicate that adsorption of oxyanions such as arsenate and arsenite is generally an exothermic reaction and decreases with increasing temperature results during the first three weeks of the heated phase also indicate that b and mo are released within and downgradient of the heating section and gradually decrease during week 5 and week 7 in addition geochemical modelling shows that as b and mo occur as oxyanions at all times throughout the column these findings agree well with bonte et al 2013 who suggests that as b and mo behave similarly as oxyanions and can be mobilized due to desorption from fe oxyhydroxides at elevated temperatures up to 60 c despite comparable scm results and measured as concentrations the simulated as trend immediately downgradient of the heating section between 1 8 and 2 4 m slightly underpredicts as concentrations by approximately 1 3 Î¼g l 1 suggesting that additional as release mechanisms are occurring possible reasons for this discrepancy could stem from fe rich clay dissolution as proposed by fennell 2008 alternatively swedlund and webster 1999 and xu et al 2012 have demonstrated that si can act as a competitive anion and affect as adsorption in particular xu et al 2012 indicates that at alkaline conditions ph 8 dissociated silicate species led to significantly increased desorption of as v from the surface of ferric and manganese binary oxide fmbo sfe mn which is represented by the reaction 4 s fe mn aso 4 h 3 sio 4 oh s fe mn sio 4 2 haso 4 2 h 2 o ph 8 due to similar trends observed for si and as and the occurrence of alkaline ph during the heated phase it is reasonable that this reaction could also be contributing to as release in addition moncur et al 2016 indicates that as v was the dominant as species in weathered sediments from the clbr region and supports the potential for competitive anion exchange although this reaction contrasts findings by fennell 2008 that indicate si is not an aggressive competitor for removal of adsorbed as at circumneutral ph competitive exchange between as and si at alkaline ph still holds true for this study moreover this relationship between as and si provides a rationale to describe why simulated as concentrations are lower than observed as concentrations over 1 8 m to 2 4 m and why si concentrations gradually decrease over the same distance in the column results of experiment 2 and the scm support as desorption from fe oxyhydroxide minerals as originally proposed by kersten and vlasova 2009 bonte et al 2014 and javed and siddique 2016 and indicate that the dominant hydrogeochemical controls for its release are due to the effects of localized high temperatures coupled with dissolution of clays concurrent release of competitive anions such as si and increased mixing importantly the results from this study reflect the duration in which the aquifer sediments were exposed to elevated temperature conditions compared to the batch tests conducted by fennell 2008 moncur et al 2015b and javed and siddique 2016 the heated column experiments demonstrate that the column design closely resembles the flow transport and geochemical processes within localized zones of aquifer heating furthermore these results and those of the sequential extraction highlight the linkages between the physical and geochemical conditions in temperature affected aquifers and how geochemical conditions can continue to evolve after relatively shorter test durations based on these outcomes ongoing heated column experiments could allow for additional insights into the release and or attenuation mechanisms and control s of particular species such as as while geochemical conditions are driven towards equilibrium 4 conclusions the heated column experiments conducted in this study were able to effectively characterize the hydrogeochemical evolution of porewater from different aquifer materials when exposed to temperatures up to 90 c results from the heated tracer tests indicate that higher temperatures cause substantial increases in dispersivity for both material types within the column heating section changes in hydraulic conductivity are believed to be occurring as this parameter is inherently linked to viscosity and density of the fluid liberation of al cu fe mn ni so4 si and zn was observed during the heated phase of experiment 1 decreasing trends in ph and the production of so4 and metals were indicative of pyrite oxidation while the overall behavior of metals as si and so4 is likely controlled by the attenuation and release from al and fe oxyhydroxide and hydroxysulfate phases conversely increased concentrations of as b cu mn mo ni and zn and to some extent si during experiment 2 are attributed to thermal desorption from fe oxides at elevated temperatures in conjunction with low o2 aq concentrations and near alkaline ph liberation of al and si are primarily associated with clay muscovite and quartz dissolution as a result of elevated temperatures while attenuation of al is likely controlled by gibbsite precipitation the release of metals and metalloids from the heated column experiments provide insight into the potential reactions and mechanisms that can take place in field conditions where aquifers are exposed to localized heating results demonstrate that the addition of heat plays a dominant role in constituent release and transport and shows that subsequent reactions are inherently controlled by the strong relationship between rate and temperature outcomes of this study support the need for detailed mineralogical characterization and water quality monitoring programs as part of in situ thermal recovery projects to assess the potential effects of localized aquifer heating furthermore the application of geochemical models can help to better define mechanisms of constituent release and attenuation which can lead to informed

1451,over more than a century of intense industrial production and associated accidental release petroleum products e g gasoline diesel fuel oil have contaminated a significant portion of the world s groundwater resources groundwater remediation is generally a complex task especially where aquifers and the associated contaminant distribution are highly heterogeneous the ability to predict the efficiency of such remediation is of crucial importance as the costs are strongly linked to the treatment design and duration in this study a coupled simulation optimization s o framework consisting of a process based reactive transport simulation model linked with particle swarm optimization pso was developed it was subsequently applied for the design of a real world in situ bio treatment of a btex contaminated aquifer in france in the application the optimization framework was used to simultaneously determine optimal well locations and their optimal injection rates both constituting key elements of the enhanced biodegradation design problem the optimization of the treatment efficiency was examined in terms of three different regulatory objectives 1 minimization of the residual napl mass of the key contaminant i e benzene in the source zone 2 reduction of the maximum concentration of benzene in groundwater and 3 minimization of the time required to reduce the benzene concentration in groundwater to below a threshold value our analysis of potential optimal remediation strategies showed that i the complexity of the biodegradation behavior at real sites may favor very different remediation options as a result of varying remediation targets ii the long term behavior of the contaminants after the end of the active treatment period which is often neglected showed to have a significant influence on remediation design that requires increased attention iii pso has shown to be a very efficient algorithm in the context of the present study the insights that can be gained from such a framework will provide decision support to select the most suitable remediation strategy while facing different regulatory objectives keywords groundwater bioremediation particle swarm optimization reactive transport modeling 1 introduction over more than a century of intense industrial production and associated accidental release petroleum products e g gasoline diesel fuel oil have contaminated a significant fraction of groundwater resources that despite the massive research and remediation efforts over the last three decades still remain a primary concern for groundwater quality water soluble and mobile gasoline components such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes isomers btex have caused thousands of contaminant plumes in groundwater originating from spills and other sources that can persist for decades or centuries barker et al 1987 the majority of the released organic compounds are toxic chemicals that often exceed drinking water standards in the 1970s biodegradation has been recognized as an important mechanism for reducing the concentration of organic contaminants like btex borden et al 1997 chapelle 1999 davis et al 1999 prommer et

occurrence of biodegradation processes are monitored natural attenuation mna wiedemeier et al 1999 wilson et al 1994 and enhanced in situ biodegradation chen et al 2010 gibson et al 1998 hÃ¶hener et al 1998 hunkeler et al 1999 enhanced in situ biodegradation of oxidisable organic pollutants relies on the injection of electron acceptors and nutrients to stimulate microbial activity and thus improving the rate of biodegradation by supplying growth limiting reactants e g farhadian et al 2008 hyman and dupont 2001 megharaj et al 2011 the technical challenge is to inject the electron acceptors and nutrients in such a way that they are adequately dispersed throughout the contaminated area chapelle 1999 the efficiency of any selected remediation scheme will depend on how effectively the amendments can be transported to the zones where particular reactants are deficient to achieve this several design parameters can be adjusted to control the bio treatment process zou et al 2009 by manipulating the naturally occurring flow solute transport and biogeochemical reaction processes the most important parameters that affect the design and thus the efficiency of the in situ bioremediation process might be i the number and locations of wells akbarnejad nesheli et al 2016 bayer and finkel 2007 kumar et al 2013 minsker and shoemaker 1998a ii the extraction fan et al 2014 he et al 2010 li et al 2015 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 and the injection rates zou et al 2009 applied at each well iii the concentrations of electron acceptors huang et al 2008 and iv nutrient concentration hu et al 2007 hu and chan 2015 given the complexity of the interactions that can result from variations in the setup of the bioremediation scheme it is not surprising that the first attempts to systematically optimize bioremediation schemes by coupling numerical process models with optimization algorithms have already been made over 30 years ago gorelick et al 1984 and minsker and shoemaker 1998b for example developed initial approaches to support decision makers in the design and operation of groundwater in situ bioremediation schemes they used non linear optimization combined with finite element groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations to determine optimal well locations as well as extraction and injection rates later minsker and shoemaker 1998b 1998a presented a coupled optimal control and simulation model to determine the location of extraction and injection wells and the pumping rates in cost effective in situ bioremediation yoon and shoemaker 1999 studied eight optimization algorithms to design an in situ bioremediation system with least cost and identified an algorithm with the best combination of efficiency and accuracy shieh and peralta 2005 proposed a simulation optimization model for the selection of a cost effective remediation strategy they combined a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to search for optimal control of in situ bioremediation and applied the bioplume ii model for simulating the transport and bioremediation processes yadav et al 2016 also used bioplume iii on a synthetic case study where they compared the performance of different surrogate modeling techniques to reduce the computational cost of in situ bioremediation design they employed particle swarm optimization pso to solve a simple hypothetical problem the proposed simulation optimization model was later used on the same synthetic case study to design an optimal in situ bioremediation system where biological clogging is accounted for yadav et al 2018 hu et al 2007 developed a control system for in situ bioremediation of groundwater using a genetic algorithm for the multi objective optimization method under uncertainty their objectives included minimizing the overall cost and the cleanup duration prasad and mathur 2008 applied a neural network embedded monte carlo approach to determine the potential well locations for in situ bioremediation of contaminated groundwater in order to minimize the total remediation cost kumar et al 2013 proposed a methodology based on support vector machine and pso techniques to determine well locations and pumping rates to achieve an optimal cost of an in situ bioremediation design subsequently kumar et al 2015 proposed a multi objective optimization approach to design an efficient in situ bioremediation system by using a hybrid metaheuristic technique based on differential evolution genetic algorithms and simulated annealing most recently akbarnejad nesheli et al 2016 and raei et al 2017 developed a multi objective simulation optimization approach to determine the optimal design of an in situ bioremediation design for hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater both studies employed bioplume to simulate the in situ bioremediation processes while a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the multi objective function the proposed approaches minimized the design and operational costs along with a pre defined water quality objective table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of previous studies employing reactive transport models to optimize bioremediation it lists the employed objective function s the type of process model the key biogeochemical reactions and the optimisation method respectively for each of the references it can be seen that a diverse range of approaches have been explored with numerous combinations of reaction types complexity and optimisation methods however interestingly all of the compiled studies have only investigated synthetic cases and none of the studies has used real field data it is also important to note that only two studies explored the impact of aquifer heterogeneity i e hu et al 2007 and zou et al 2009 however none of the investigated cases encapsulated the level of complexity that can occur in the field although the spatial distributions of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity can play a substantial role for bioremediation success therefore we suggest that while significant progress has been made in the theoretical development of the simulation optimization s o approach the uptake of this approach for solving realistic field scale problems has remained extremely limited despite the enormous potential for cost saving and environmental benefits compernolle et al 2013 several factors may have contributed to this lack of practical applications firstly the use of combined s o methods for in situ bioremediation problems comes at substantial computational costs which makes many complex reactive transport field scale problems intractable secondly there are currently few general purpose and easy to use s o codes available to practitioners at the field project level overall the advantages of the s o approach in solving real world problems have not been adequately demonstrated because most if not all studies presented in the literature have see table 1 used simplified hypothetical examples finally and perhaps most importantly under typical real world conditions the optimization objectives have to consider stakeholders who have complex problems to solve which clearly involve strict environmental regulations but may also involve additional considerations that the stakeholders may or may not wish to consider however as outlined by loucks 2012 decision makers don t know what they want until they know what they can get in this context focusing solely on finding an optimal solution with the definition of a unique objective function or the definition of a unique complex multi objective function may not be easily adapted to a decision making process optimization should be viewed as a complementary tool allowing to explore and better understand what option stakeholders have and what impact may result maier et al 2014 an often overlooked point is that applications to real field sites should also consider site specific operational constraints such as possible and excluded well positions inter well distances or simply that the rate of injection cannot be larger than the pumped volumes addressing some of the research gaps associated with real world applications involving well placement among other considerations we develop in this new study a s o framework for determining the optimal design of an in situ bio treatment process the framework consists of two main parts a coupled flow and reactive transport simulation model and a pso algorithm the present study utilizes existing pso methodologies within the s o model framework for decision making in a complex real world context and explores the challenges of achieving an optimal design for in situ bioremediation under real world constraints we examine how the definition of specific objective functions impacts optimization and ultimately bioremediation treatment efficiency this illustrates how stakeholders can explore possible management alternatives and then learn by witnessing in this virtual environment how specific optimization objectives trigger different optimal management responses eventually we use the results obtained from a field site in france to assess the applicability and usefulness of our proposed s o approach as an environmental decision making tool 2 study site 2 1 site description the study site for this research was an actively operating petrol station that is located in the north of france fig 1 at the site a leaking underground storage tank from 1992 to 1997 was discovered and removed in 1997 the leak has caused a petroleum hydrocarbon contamination within soil and groundwater the contaminated aquifer is about 10 m thick and is underlain by a clay aquitard it consists mostly of limestone and silt the general natural flow direction at the site is towards the north west and the average groundwater elevation within the shallow aquifer is approximately 2 to 3 m below the land surface the groundwater velocity at the field site is estimated to range between 17 and 25 m yr 1 the accidental leakage resulted in a soil contamination with a release of mostly monoaromatic hydrocarbons and a dissolved contaminant plume in the groundwater of more than 70 m in length for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex the maximum concentrations of the contaminants in groundwater were recorded in the piezometer p4 for benzene in piezometers pz2 and p1 for toluene and in p1 for ethylbenzene and xylenes from the btex concentrations measured at monitoring wells within the impacted area it was possible to define four separate source zones of different btex compositions fig 1 the zone affected by contamination around each monitoring well was approximated during the model calibration procedure using measured dissolved concentrations as constraints see also figs s1 and s2 the maximum observed concentrations of benzene are 11 mg l 1 in the source zone 3 mg l 1 at a location 50 m downstream of the sources and under 1 Î¼g l 1 at 75 m downstream fig 1 the hydrochemical analysis of the contaminated zone showed that the electron acceptors oxygen nitrate and sulphate were depleted within the contaminated zone indicating that natural biodegradation processes occurred at the site an overview of the ambient groundwater chemistry in the uncontaminated zone is provided in table 2 2 2 remediation strategy enhanced in situ biodegradation was selected as the most feasible approach for groundwater remediation at this site in situ bioremediation involves a mechanism for stimulating endogenous bacterial activities which convert contaminants to innocuous end products via electron acceptor amendments in such a system groundwater is abstracted using extraction wells and if necessary treated to remove residual dissolved constituents the treated groundwater is then mixed with electron acceptors or where needed also with other amendments that eliminate reaction rate limitations and re injected upstream or midstream of the contamination source and plumes through injection wells the first four decision variables considered in our study are common variables in contaminant remediation studies including 1 the number of extraction injecting wells 2 well locations 3 extraction injecting rates 4 operating period the investigated remediation scheme selected for this study consisted of i a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 injection scheme which provides additional electron accepting capacity to the aquifer and thus facilitating enhanced biodegradation huling et al 1990 and ii a downstream groundwater extraction scheme the maximum electron acceptor concentration that can be added to contaminated groundwater as h2o2 is 100 200 mg l 1 farhadian et al 2008 which is much higher than the solubility limited maximum dissolved oxygen concentration 8 10 mg l 1 once injected the hydrogen peroxide transforms successively to oxygen and water whereby based on the reaction stoichiometry the dissolved oxygen concentration is 47 1 of the amended hydrogen peroxide concentration i e prior to the transformation therefore the design oxygen concentration of the treatment fluid was set to 50 mg l 1 for a range of practical and technical reasons it was decided that the treatment scheme would include 4 extraction wells all located downstream of the contaminant plume see fig 5 the maximum allowable total extraction rate was 18 m3 d 1 and the operating duration of the bioremediation was limited to 3 years the total number of injection wells 12 was constrained by budget considerations and their injection rate by the field injection capacity in relation to the number of injection wells operating on average at 1 5 m3 d 1 four extraction wells were considered each with a capacity of 4 5 m3 d 1 in order to be consistent with the maximum total injection rate of 18 m3 d 1 with some of the typical bioremediation design variables such as the injectant hydrogen peroxide concentration being fixed the decision variables for this study were therefore i the position of the 12 injection wells and ii their injection rates we recognize that fixing the locations of the extraction wells may yield suboptimal remediation as the locations of the extraction wells can be highly sensitive to the optimal remediation design yielding policies that can be greatly influenced by the chosen objective function bayer and finkel 2007 2 3 flow and reactive transport process models in a first step a process based flow and reactive transport model was developed and calibrated to reproduce the previously collected field observations from the study site the objective was to simulate the biogeochemical behavior of the contaminated aquifer under the influence of different variants of the remediation system as accurately as possible 2 3 1 modeling tools and approach unconfined groundwater flow under varying extraction and injection schemes was simulated with the three dimensional finite difference flow code modflow harbaugh et al 2000 based on the numerical solution for groundwater flow the reactive transport of contaminants and other groundwater constituents was simulated with the reactive transport simulator pht3d prommer et al 2003 which couples mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 through an operator splitting approach for the model application discussed in this study the original phreeqc database was extended to incorporate all relevant site specific reactions in particular the microbially mediated degradation reactions and the corresponding degradation kinetics of the key organic contaminants that were found at the study site were appended 2 3 2 flow and reactive transport model setup the model domain was discretised into 56 columns x direction and 48 rows y direction in total covering an area of approximately 150 120 m with a constant thickness of 8 m the grid resolution was locally refined within the bio treatment zone i e the area of main interest and the area of the steepest biogeochemical gradients fig 2 no flow boundaries were implemented in the north and south with constant head boundaries along the western and eastern boundaries imposing an easterly regional hydraulic gradient of 2 corresponding to the field observed natural groundwater flow which indicate a mostly easterly gradient with subtle southerly variations spatial variations in hydraulic conductivity were parameterized through the pilot point method lavenue et al 1995 de marsily et al 1984 yeh and yoon 1981 in the pilot point method the unknown parameters are estimated for a set of points distributed within the domain the corresponding spatially distributed parameter field is obtained through kriging the pilot point values over the model domain the btex compounds were considered separately in order to account for their differing degradation characteristics a fifth compound that served as a proxy for all the prevailing low solubility compounds and lumped those into a single compound was also included each of the simulated compounds was included twice in the reaction network once as a mobile dissolved species and secondly as an immobile light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl species estimated lnapl concentrations were used to define the initial concentrations in all model grid cells that were coinciding with the source zone areas that were identified during the site characterisation zero initial concentrations were applied outside these source zones the release of the dissolved contaminants from the lnapl source zone was simulated through the commonly used first order mass transfer kinetic formulation barry et al 2002 mayer and miller 1996 powers et al 1991 1 r org dis Î± c org sat c o rg where c o rg is the concentration of the organic compound in the groundwater c org sat is the multi component solubility of the organic compound following raoult s law and Î± is a mass transfer coefficient that was assumed to be the same for all included organic compounds there are various approaches and levels of complexity to model the biodegradation of organic compounds especially where multiple electron acceptors play a role for the model application in the present paper a relatively simple approach i e a first order reaction limited by the presence absence of electron acceptors was selected to quantify the degradation rates of each considered compound b t e x 2 c o rg t k c o rg if ea 0 with k being the first order rate constant of the biodegradation reaction and ea in the present study representing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the groundwater the geochemical response to degradation of the organic compounds including electron acceptor consumption is quantified through the so called partial equilibrium approach using all present electron acceptors barry et al 2002 d affonseca et al 2011 postma and jakobsen 1996 the approach assumes that the oxidation of the organic compound is the rate limiting step in the overall redox reaction therefore the electron accepting step can be modelled as an equilibrium reaction in which the sequence of electron acceptor consumption is controlled by thermodynamics the extension of the frequently used first order kinetics bauer et al 2006 bekins et al 1998 cozzarelli et al 2010 was adopted from atteia and hÃ¶hener 2012 other key input parameters used in the reactive transport model are listed in table 3 the modified method of characteristics mmoc option was selected to simulate advective transport the model simulations started with an initially clean aquifer except for the non zero napl concentrations the model was then run for a spin up period of 1000 days during which the btex plumes fully evolved before the remediation wells were switched on 2 3 3 model calibration prior to applying the s o procedure the model was calibrated in two stages using field measurements as calibration constraints the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 was used to minimize the residuals between the simulated and the corresponding head and concentration observations collected from the study site s monitoring network in the first phase of the model calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivities at 32 pilot points were estimated with only the observed hydraulic head measurements being used as constraints steady state conditions were assumed for the groundwater flow simulations as the impact of temporal changes in groundwater flow directions and velocities were considered negligible in the second phase of the model calibration additional flow and reactive transport parameters porosity dispersivities source zone concentration dissolution and degradation rate constants were jointly estimated using all 12 head and 52 concentration measurements for the second calibration phase initial parameter estimates for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution were taken from the results of the first phase initial estimates of the adjustable parameters and of the parameter bounds for the reactive transport simulations were adopted from studies reported in the literature the final estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution is shown in fig 3 fig 4 summarizes the observed and simulated post calibration dissolved benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene the normalized root mean square errors achieved for the individual btex compounds were 9 12 13 and 10 respectively based on these metrics the flow and transport model was considered to be sufficiently calibrated with respect to the selected level of model complexity and parameterization while the model possibly still contained some minor structural errors it was considered to represent the best available process description and to be suitable to underpin the determination of the optimal design of groundwater bioremediation under different objectives 3 pso based optimization of groundwater bioremediation design generally optimization problems involve an objective function subject to a series of constraints that define a feasible region for the decision variables min f x subject to x s where s is the feasible region f is the objective function and x is the vector of decision variables the location of the n w injection wells of the treatment fluid and injection rates q n inj associated with each well n are the decision variables of the optimization problem the objective functions and constraints considered in this study are described in the following two sections 3 1 objective functions the objectives of any biotreatment implementation and what might be considered as optimal in terms of treatment efficiency is in general site specific these objectives will depend on the hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics of the site downstream receptors the regulatory environment operational aspects such as whether the site has ongoing operations and or the future use of the site in many studies the treatment efficiency is evaluated from the perspective of minimizing the mass of residual contaminants at the endpoint of treatment luo et al 2014 yang et al 2013b however evaluating the effectiveness of treatment should alternatively or in addition be based on the residual mass flux of dissolved contaminants emitting from the source zone brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2014 yang et al 2013a in our study both the dissolved contaminant concentrations in groundwater and the immobile mass in the source area of benzene were considered in the formulation of the objective functions benzene was selected as the target compound because it poses the highest risk from a health perspective e g johnson et al 2003 three separate groundwater bioremediation optimization objectives were considered independently in order to assess their impact on the optimal remediation design for the studied system 1 the first objective function was defined to minimize the immobile mass of benzene as napl in the source zone see fig 5 the source zone area included four distinct sources as discussed previously see fig 2 the remaining mass of benzene is in our framework expressed as a percentage f m of mass remaining in the aquifer at the end of the remediation activities 3 min f m mass end mass 0 100 where mass 0 and mass end are the total solute mass in the aquifer at the beginning and end of the remediation activities respectively 2 the minimization of the maximum dissolved benzene concentration along the profile a a see fig 5 located immediately downstream of the source area was defined as the second objective function note that the position of the maximum benzene concentration along the profile may change in order to consider a potential rebound effect i e an increase in concentrations in the phase after the active treatment has stopped the maximum benzene concentration 4 years after the end of the treatment period was used 4 min f c c end where f c expresses the maximum contaminant concentration found along the profile a a emitted by the source at the end of the treatment period c end 3 the third optimization objective was to minimize the time required to achieve a benzene concentration of less than 1 Î¼g l 1 at the observation point pobs located at the centre of the plume fig 5 5 min f t t c obs c lim where f t expresses the time t required to obtain a concentration c obs at the observation point equal to a concentration limit c lim 3 2 decision variables the initially investigated treatment process consisted of 4 extraction wells that were located downstream of the contaminant source area and two rows of six injection wells in a staggered arrangement upstream of the source area fig 5 however the injection wells were allowed to be positioned freely in a different i e optimized arrangement in order to maximize the overall remediation efficiency the selected decision variables of the optimization problem were therefore the locations x y coordinates of these 12 wells n w 12 and the rates at which the treatment fluids were injected at these wells in total assuming constant injection rates the optimization problem included 36 decision variables d 36 the search space for possible well positions is shown in fig 5 68 m x 110 m and 30 m y 85 m the minimum distance d min between two injection wells was defined to be 4 m see constraints section this distance prevented two extraction wells from being placed in the same model grid cell as already stated above the total allowable pumping rate was set to 18 m3 d 1 given that for logistical reasons all of the extracted water was proposed to be reinjected the average injection rate per well was 1 5 m3 d 1 however while the total injection rate was linked to the extraction rate variations among the injection wells were allowed given the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of the contaminated aquifer the physical capacity for injection was thought to be limited to 2 m3 d 1 per well based on preliminary model simulation results and field observations the maximum injection rate q n inj max was therefore set to 2 m3 d 1 per well and the minimum injection rate q n inj min was set to 0 m3 d 1 well unused fig 5 illustrates the initial design of the treatment system prior to optimization subsequently referred to as reference case 3 3 formulation of optimization constraints the optimization of the well locations and the injection rates was subject to a range of practical constraints 1 the location in x and y of a well must be between the specified lower and upper bounds x n min y n min and x n max y n max to ensure a realistic location of the injection wells such that 6 x n min x n x n max n 1 2 n w 7 y n min y n y n max n 1 2 n w 2 well locations are not considered to be discrete but rather continuous with a well to well distance constraint added to ensure a valid configuration of a well pattern d min denotes the minimum distance between any pair of wells and should be choosen such that that two wells cannot be in the same cell i e about 4 m thus 8 x m x m 1 2 y m y m 1 2 d min m n 1 2 n w 3 the maximum injection rate also should not exceed the well capacity therefore the injection rate of a well must be between the lower and upper limits specified q j min and q j max so that 9 q n inj min q n inj q n inj max n 1 2 n w 4 for practical reasons of managing treatment i e to avoid excessive fluid storage the total flow rates of injection and extraction must be balanced in our system the pumping flow will be considered as fixed and known a priori thus 10 n 1 n w q n inj q pump n 1 2 n w each optimization objective expressed in eqs 3 4 or 5 was independently combined with the constraints defined by eqs 6 10 and constitute the three optimization models of the studied groundwater bioremediation system 3 4 pso algorithm pso is a stochastic optimization method developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on the reproduction of the social behavior of animals living in swarms such as bird flocking or fish schooling in pso a swarm of candidate solutions or particles moves around the user defined decision variable vector space or simply the decision space searching for the best treatment performance which is defined by a fitness or objective function in a d dimensional vector space the position of each particle represents d unknown decision variables of the problem each particle has a randomly generated initial velocity which determines the rate of change of its position in the decision space to discover the optimal solution each particle moves iteratively according to two factors its own best previous experience its pbest position and the best experience among all other particles the gbest position of the swarm let the position of the i th particle in a d dimensional space at iteration t be expressed as x i t x i 1 t x i d t and the velocity v i t v i 1 t v i d t the particle s position is updated following eqs 11 and 12 11 x i d t 1 x i d t v i d t 1 12 v i d t 1 w v i d t c 1 r 1 x i d pbest t x i d t c 2 r 2 x d gbest t x i d t where the subscript i denotes the particle t denotes the iteration number r 1 and r 2 are random numbers uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 c 1 and c 2 are the cognitive and social parameters respectively and w is the inertia weight parameter at iteration t 1 the particle positions are updated and the associated objective function values are determined then pbest and gbest positions are updated based on these objective function values this process is repeated until no further improvement in the gbest position s objective function values is observed this basic version of pso is simple to implement and has been shown to be very effective at solving highly nonlinear optimization problems involving reactive transport models e g rawson et al 2016 rathi et al 2017 prommer et al 2018 stolze et al 2019 among others a variation of this basic algorithm was employed in our study largely based on the approach proposed by onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 this approach was chosen for this study as it has been shown to be particularly effective at handling the optimization of well locations among other aspects of the constraints considered in this study 3 5 s o model for groundwater contamination bioremediation within the s o framework the numerical process simulators modflow and pht3d were employed as modular subroutines that were called by the main optimization program fig 6 illustrates the main components of the s o model within a flow chart the major steps employed are step 1 initializes the population size step 2 initializes the values of w c 1 c 2 step 3 initializes each particle position with random elements drawn from a uniform distribution defined by upper and lower bounds of each design variable step 4 checks the constraints for constrained optimization direct application of eqs 6 7 and 9 may cause some particles to become infeasible to handle these infeasible particles the absorb technique was applied helwig and wanka 2008 in the absorb technique if a particle has violated the boundaries of a feasible region it will be set at its nearest bound onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 the corresponding velocity components are also set to zero helwig and wanka 2008 the approach used to handle constraints expressed by eqs 8 and 10 is the repair method i e special operators are used to repair an infeasible particle or to adjust it so it satisfies the constraints onwunalu 2010 for the minimum and maximum pumping rate of each well the values were clipped when above or below the given limits for the total rate if the rate is too high all well discharges are equally scaled in order to reach the maximum total discharge if two wells are too close to each other they are moved along the line passing through their initial position to reach a new position corresponding to the minimum distance this process is continued until all minimum distances are satisfied step 5 initializes each component of the velocities in a similar fashion to step 3 steps 6 and 7 compute the objective function for all particles in our application the objective function is evaluated in all cases by sequentially performing modflow and pht3d simulations step 8 updates the pbest position for each particle and the gbest position for the swarm new particle velocities are computed in step 9 step 10 updates all components of the positions of all particles in step 11 the constraints as mentioned in step 4 are checked steps 12 and 13 evaluate the objective function based on the new particle positions steps 8 through 13 are repeated until termination criteria have been met e g in this study when a maximum number of iterations was reached the employed pso algorithm is easy to implement which was done in this study using python scripts and readily parallelized for distributed cluster based processors all results presented below use a cluster of 20 processors using the message passing interface mpi gropp et al 1999 in our parallel implementation of the pso algorithm a master processor initiates each iteration by sending a series of design variables each corresponding to a particle position to a set of subordinate processors each subordinate processor sequentially executes the flow and transport model computes the objective function and the constraints and sends the results back to the master processor the master processor completes the iteration by updating the pbest and gbest positions as well as the velocities of the swarm and the entire process begins again with the next iteration 3 5 1 pso settings the pso algorithm has several control settings that must be specified prior to performing an optimization run banks et al 2007 shi and eberhart 1998 however there are no uniformly accepted standard values for these settings as the most suitable values are problem specific clerc and kennedy 2002 therefore an appropriate adjustment of the pso settings can result in a significantly faster convergence of the algorithm and a reduction of the potential to fall into local minima the critical settings include population size the maximum number of iterations and the weights of the inertia w with less critical settings involving the cognitive c 1 and social c 2 components respectively of the velocity equation like other optimization algorithms these settings can involve some trial and error to establish in numerous previous studies values of c 1 c 2 1 193 or c 1 c 2 1 496 were successfully used helwig and wanka 2008 however a number of numerical experiments performed in this study indicated that c 1 c 2 0 9 provided even better results and this value was therefore used throughout this study shi and eberhart 1999 suggested the use of a linearly decreasing inertia weight starting at 0 9 and successively decreasing to 0 4 for our study a linearly decreasing inertia weight from 1 2 to 0 4 showed to achieve convergence with the least number of iterations based on trial and error testing the population size was set to 15 particles our results also show that the pso algorithm we ve employed likely does not suffer from premature convergence and achieves good practical solutions to the various design problems we ve considered 4 results and discussion 4 1 pso algorithm performance fig 7 illustrates the pso convergence for each of the three considered objectives it is evident that the stochastic movement of the swarm can already greatly reduce the objective function during the first iteration for both f c and f t there was also a significant further decrease over the first 10 iterations while for f m the decrease of the objective function was substantially slower although this effect might be slightly different for different initializations of the random number generator the results show that minimizing f c is more sensitive to changes in positioning of the wells and flow rates than minimizing f m minimization of f t no longer improved beyond 20 iterations this might be due to a very slow change of c obs with time and therefore a low sensitivity of this objective moreover the runs performed with different random starting particle swarms not shown showed more reproducible curves of f c clearly indicating to be a better constrained optimization problem in case of using this objective 4 2 optimization result the simulation results illustrate how the objective functions varied for the three types of constraints mass c max on profile a a time to reach c limit at p obs interestingly minimizing f m reduced the remaining amount of benzene in the source area at the end of the treatment phase compared to the reference treatment case by only 2 7 i e from 26 1 to 25 4 however this evidently small decrease in mass was accompanied by a much more pronounced reduction of cend for benzene from 219 to 173 Î¼g l 1 at the benchmark location directly downstream from the source area 4 years after the end of treatment these results highlight that a marked decrease in contaminant mass flux can occur in conjunction with a relatively small decrease of the contaminant mass in the source this is consistent with the previous study of difilippo and brusseau 2008 who also found that the combination of heterogeneous media and non ideal mass transfer can lead to a significant mass flux reduction with a limited reduction of the overall contaminant mass directly minimizing f c leads to a further decreased cend i e it reduces benzene concentrations from 219 base case to 131 Î¼g l 1 after optimization however the mass of residual benzene as napl at the end of the treatment is in this case slightly higher 25 6 for the minimization of f c vs 25 4 for the minimization of f m this shows that it is possible to reduce the flux of contaminants emitted by the source while being less effective on reducing the mass of remaining benzene in the source area minimizing f t reduced the time required to achieve a benzene concentration lower than 1 Î¼g l 1 at the observation point pobs by 280 days more than 9 months and by 84 days compared with the results obtained from the minimization of f m however the mass of residual benzene at the end of the treatment period is in this case 13 higher than for the reference case and almost 16 higher compared to the results obtained when minimizing f m furthermore fig 8b shows a significant rise in benzene concentrations downstream of the source area after 2500 days i e after treatment has ceased given that in this case the mass does not decrease it is possible that a rebound might still occur at a later stage i e outside the period that was considered for the optimization all key optimization results are summarized in table 4 and in fig 8 in the present study a variation of the injection rates was not considered as the rates are already highly limited by the small hydraulic conductivity a decrease of the injection rates would have led to a longer removal of the product mass which is already long for a field remediation interestingly for all three studied optimization scenarios benzene concentrations at a virtual observation point located at the site boundary p obs show no major change at the end of the treatment see fig 8c concentrations of tex are similar but are not shown as they are associated with a much lower environmental risk however we note on fig 8b that after stopping treatment benzene concentrations at the profile a a increase at this site groundwater flow is relatively slow and a significant persistence of oxygen within the aquifer was observed during the period characterized by the persistence of oxygen benzene concentrations remained low but as some residual napl mass was still remaining in the source it is plausible that the concentrations in p obs could increase again after a longer period of time although it is known that rebound effects often occur during remediation e g mcdade et al 2005 thomson et al 2008 the time of its appearance is difficult to assess as it depends not only on the local hydraulic conductivity but also on reaction rates in the presented case a rebound can be observed at the observation profile downstream of the source zone after between a few months up to more than a year after the end of the treatment depending on the treatment strategy by favouring injection locations inside or close to the source zone the f m and f c treatments show a delayed rebound however three years after the end of the treatment the optimized injection did not differ significantly from the reference case as the system was getting back to its long term quasi equilibrium state 4 3 optimal design the optimal locations of wells and injection rates that were determined for the three investigated minimization objectives are presented fig 9 furthermore simulated oxygen concentrations after 700 days simulation time are also presented in fig 9 as can be seen when the optimization objective is to minimize f m the optimal well locations coincide with the source area and the close vicinity of it the resulting simulated oxygen concentrations therefore show to be relatively uniform near the source area these contour maps also show that oxygen is the main electron acceptor during the treatment it is evident that in this case the optimized solution favors biodegradation in the source zone in order to accelerate napl dissolution which occurs when aqueous phase benzene concentrations drop significantly below the equilibrium concentration the positions of the injection wells that promote the minimization of f c are mainly determined to be in zones where hydraulic conductivities are lower see fig 9b as the residual mass of benzene as napl is mostly found in this area therefore to minimize the benzene concentration in the groundwater directly downstream from the source area 4 years after stopping the treatment h2o2 is mainly injected into the residual source zone see fig s3 in the case where the objective is to minimize f t the most favorable configuration is one in which the wells are positioned in the areas of the highest hydraulic conductivities this results in a preferential treatment of areas characterized by high benzene fluxes at the beginning of the treatment interestingly the case in which f c is minimized it seems possible to remove the well pi1 for which the optimized abstraction rate is almost zero also in the case in which f t is minimized 3 injection wells have low flow rates and removing them completely is unlikely to have any detrimental effect on the overall performance these results indicate that the proposed pso optimization approach produces logical and tractable results the approach allows for the management of complex variables i e both the position of the wells and their injection rates which would probably not have been achievable by human trial and error the proposed method also creates a clear foundation for the management decisions that are required during the treatment process design which will most likely involve multiple parallel objectives and provides a potential mechanism for addressing the effects of various sources of uncertainty on the optimal remediation strategy in fact it is quite necessary to point out that there exists some potential for uncertainty in some aspects of the proposed model which could impact the optimal remediation strategies presented in this study for example due to parameter uncertainty and potential flaws in the structure of the numerical model e g lithological assumptions boundary conditions etc there may be significant uncertainty in the optimal remediation policy however addressing such an issue for highly nonlinear models such as the model presented in this study is complex computationally demanding and as a result an active area of further research therefore conducting optimization under uncertainty in the context of the remediation problems posed herein is considered to be beyond the scope of this study however reducing computational demands through machine learning based surrogate modeling e g yadav et al 2016 siade et al 2020 may yet prove effective for real world problems and remains a topic of future research 5 conclusions in this paper a coupled simulation optimization s o framework has been developed and used as a decision making tool for optimizing the design of a real world in situ bio treatment system by studying the role of the objective function formulation a flow and reactive transport simulation model and a pso based optimization model were both developed and subsequently coupled this framework was used to construct an effective s o model that could simultaneously determine optimal well locations and their optimal injection rates that constituted key elements of an enhanced biodegradation design problem the proposed approach was then applied to a petroleum contaminated site in france to support the design of a groundwater bioremediation system in our study the optimization of treatment efficiency was examined in terms of three different objectives 1 minimization of the residual napl mass of benzene in the source zone 2 reduction of the maximum concentration of benzene in groundwater and 3 minimization of the time required to reduce the benzene concentration in groundwater to below a threshold value the results show that at least for our study site reducing the flux of emitted contaminants is a more effective objective than the reduction of the residual napl mass a clear relationship between the flux decrease and the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity this relationship coincides with the remediation benefits forecasted by wood et al 2005 in this paper we show that this relationship also extends to optimization as the position and injection rates of the injection wells for minimizing the required treatment duration in order to reach a complete site clean up is strongly dependent on the site specific relationship between mass flux reduction and source zone mass removal consequently the remedial effort dedicated to minimizing the required treatment duration in order to reach a complete site clean up is strongly dependent on the site specific relationship between mass flux reduction and source zone mass removal the objective functions that we formulated in our work did not allow to decrease the mass flux of benzene very quickly while also ascertaining that there is no significant rebound of benzene concentration after the end of the active bioremediation phase in the presence of reactants here oxygen and where slow groundwater flow velocities persist the overall treatment efficiency can only be analyzed once the amended oxygen has migrated across the entire length of the plume this last point highlights the difficulty of defining the objective function such that the achieved contaminant concentration levels eliminate all potential environmental concerns and rebound effect must be considered therefore in practice multiple objectives may have to be considered simultaneously one of the key advantages of our proposed s o framework is that it allows for the ability to define arbitrary objective functions while obtaining optimization results within a reasonable time frame due to its ability to handle nonlinear nonconvex constrained optimization problems and its ease of implementation it is therefore possible to assess multiple objective functions and through this procedure to better understand the impact of various bioremediation design parameters in a heterogeneous aquifer medium and under the influence of the additionally induced biogeochemical transformations this can provide valuable support to decision makers in the selection of an optimal design in which treatment efficiency is maximized importantly the illustrative effect of the framework and the discussions that it could facilitate among stakeholders when multiple solutions are available will lead to a better understanding of everyone s interests and concerns and eventually culminate in more widely acceptable decisions employing formal multi objective pso mopso algorithms e g coello et al 2004 siade et al 2019 would be a useful and logical future extension of this work

1451,over more than a century of intense industrial production and associated accidental release petroleum products e g gasoline diesel fuel oil have contaminated a significant portion of the world s groundwater resources groundwater remediation is generally a complex task especially where aquifers and the associated contaminant distribution are highly heterogeneous the ability to predict the efficiency of such remediation is of crucial importance as the costs are strongly linked to the treatment design and duration in this study a coupled simulation optimization s o framework consisting of a process based reactive transport simulation model linked with particle swarm optimization pso was developed it was subsequently applied for the design of a real world in situ bio treatment of a btex contaminated aquifer in france in the application the optimization framework was used to simultaneously determine optimal well locations and their optimal injection rates both constituting key elements of the enhanced biodegradation design problem the optimization of the treatment efficiency was examined in terms of three different regulatory objectives 1 minimization of the residual napl mass of the key contaminant i e benzene in the source zone 2 reduction of the maximum concentration of benzene in groundwater and 3 minimization of the time required to reduce the benzene concentration in groundwater to below a threshold value our analysis of potential optimal remediation strategies showed that i the complexity of the biodegradation behavior at real sites may favor very different remediation options as a result of varying remediation targets ii the long term behavior of the contaminants after the end of the active treatment period which is often neglected showed to have a significant influence on remediation design that requires increased attention iii pso has shown to be a very efficient algorithm in the context of the present study the insights that can be gained from such a framework will provide decision support to select the most suitable remediation strategy while facing different regulatory objectives keywords groundwater bioremediation particle swarm optimization reactive transport modeling 1 introduction over more than a century of intense industrial production and associated accidental release petroleum products e g gasoline diesel fuel oil have contaminated a significant fraction of groundwater resources that despite the massive research and remediation efforts over the last three decades still remain a primary concern for groundwater quality water soluble and mobile gasoline components such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes isomers btex have caused thousands of contaminant plumes in groundwater originating from spills and other sources that can persist for decades or centuries barker et al 1987 the majority of the released organic compounds are toxic chemicals that often exceed drinking water standards in the 1970s biodegradation has been recognized as an important mechanism for reducing the concentration of organic contaminants like btex borden et al 1997 chapelle 1999 davis et al 1999 prommer et al 1999 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cerniglia 1993 haritash and kaushik 2009 and chlorinated hydrocarbons wiedemeier et al 1997 the two major site remediation technologies that rely on the occurrence of biodegradation processes are monitored natural attenuation mna wiedemeier et al 1999 wilson et al 1994 and enhanced in situ biodegradation chen et al 2010 gibson et al 1998 hÃ¶hener et al 1998 hunkeler et al 1999 enhanced in situ biodegradation of oxidisable organic pollutants relies on the injection of electron acceptors and nutrients to stimulate microbial activity and thus improving the rate of biodegradation by supplying growth limiting reactants e g farhadian et al 2008 hyman and dupont 2001 megharaj et al 2011 the technical challenge is to inject the electron acceptors and nutrients in such a way that they are adequately dispersed throughout the contaminated area chapelle 1999 the efficiency of any selected remediation scheme will depend on how effectively the amendments can be transported to the zones where particular reactants are deficient to achieve this several design parameters can be adjusted to control the bio treatment process zou et al 2009 by manipulating the naturally occurring flow solute transport and biogeochemical reaction processes the most important parameters that affect the design and thus the efficiency of the in situ bioremediation process might be i the number and locations of wells akbarnejad nesheli et al 2016 bayer and finkel 2007 kumar et al 2013 minsker and shoemaker 1998a ii the extraction fan et al 2014 he et al 2010 li et al 2015 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 and the injection rates zou et al 2009 applied at each well iii the concentrations of electron acceptors huang et al 2008 and iv nutrient concentration hu et al 2007 hu and chan 2015 given the complexity of the interactions that can result from variations in the setup of the bioremediation scheme it is not surprising that the first attempts to systematically optimize bioremediation schemes by coupling numerical process models with optimization algorithms have already been made over 30 years ago gorelick et al 1984 and minsker and shoemaker 1998b for example developed initial approaches to support decision makers in the design and operation of groundwater in situ bioremediation schemes they used non linear optimization combined with finite element groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations to determine optimal well locations as well as extraction and injection rates later minsker and shoemaker 1998b 1998a presented a coupled optimal control and simulation model to determine the location of extraction and injection wells and the pumping rates in cost effective in situ bioremediation yoon and shoemaker 1999 studied eight optimization algorithms to design an in situ bioremediation system with least cost and identified an algorithm with the best combination of efficiency and accuracy shieh and peralta 2005 proposed a simulation optimization model for the selection of a cost effective remediation strategy they combined a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to search for optimal control of in situ bioremediation and applied the bioplume ii model for simulating the transport and bioremediation processes yadav et al 2016 also used bioplume iii on a synthetic case study where they compared the performance of different surrogate modeling techniques to reduce the computational cost of in situ bioremediation design they employed particle swarm optimization pso to solve a simple hypothetical problem the proposed simulation optimization model was later used on the same synthetic case study to design an optimal in situ bioremediation system where biological clogging is accounted for yadav et al 2018 hu et al 2007 developed a control system for in situ bioremediation of groundwater using a genetic algorithm for the multi objective optimization method under uncertainty their objectives included minimizing the overall cost and the cleanup duration prasad and mathur 2008 applied a neural network embedded monte carlo approach to determine the potential well locations for in situ bioremediation of contaminated groundwater in order to minimize the total remediation cost kumar et al 2013 proposed a methodology based on support vector machine and pso techniques to determine well locations and pumping rates to achieve an optimal cost of an in situ bioremediation design subsequently kumar et al 2015 proposed a multi objective optimization approach to design an efficient in situ bioremediation system by using a hybrid metaheuristic technique based on differential evolution genetic algorithms and simulated annealing most recently akbarnejad nesheli et al 2016 and raei et al 2017 developed a multi objective simulation optimization approach to determine the optimal design of an in situ bioremediation design for hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater both studies employed bioplume to simulate the in situ bioremediation processes while a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the multi objective function the proposed approaches minimized the design and operational costs along with a pre defined water quality objective table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of previous studies employing reactive transport models to optimize bioremediation it lists the employed objective function s the type of process model the key biogeochemical reactions and the optimisation method respectively for each of the references it can be seen that a diverse range of approaches have been explored with numerous combinations of reaction types complexity and optimisation methods however interestingly all of the compiled studies have only investigated synthetic cases and none of the studies has used real field data it is also important to note that only two studies explored the impact of aquifer heterogeneity i e hu et al 2007 and zou et al 2009 however none of the investigated cases encapsulated the level of complexity that can occur in the field although the spatial distributions of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity can play a substantial role for bioremediation success therefore we suggest that while significant progress has been made in the theoretical development of the simulation optimization s o approach the uptake of this approach for solving realistic field scale problems has remained extremely limited despite the enormous potential for cost saving and environmental benefits compernolle et al 2013 several factors may have contributed to this lack of practical applications firstly the use of combined s o methods for in situ bioremediation problems comes at substantial computational costs which makes many complex reactive transport field scale problems intractable secondly there are currently few general purpose and easy to use s o codes available to practitioners at the field project level overall the advantages of the s o approach in solving real world problems have not been adequately demonstrated because most if not all studies presented in the literature have see table 1 used simplified hypothetical examples finally and perhaps most importantly under typical real world conditions the optimization objectives have to consider stakeholders who have complex problems to solve which clearly involve strict environmental regulations but may also involve additional considerations that the stakeholders may or may not wish to consider however as outlined by loucks 2012 decision makers don t know what they want until they know what they can get in this context focusing solely on finding an optimal solution with the definition of a unique objective function or the definition of a unique complex multi objective function may not be easily adapted to a decision making process optimization should be viewed as a complementary tool allowing to explore and better understand what option stakeholders have and what impact may result maier et al 2014 an often overlooked point is that applications to real field sites should also consider site specific operational constraints such as possible and excluded well positions inter well distances or simply that the rate of injection cannot be larger than the pumped volumes addressing some of the research gaps associated with real world applications involving well placement among other considerations we develop in this new study a s o framework for determining the optimal design of an in situ bio treatment process the framework consists of two main parts a coupled flow and reactive transport simulation model and a pso algorithm the present study utilizes existing pso methodologies within the s o model framework for decision making in a complex real world context and explores the challenges of achieving an optimal design for in situ bioremediation under real world constraints we examine how the definition of specific objective functions impacts optimization and ultimately bioremediation treatment efficiency this illustrates how stakeholders can explore possible management alternatives and then learn by witnessing in this virtual environment how specific optimization objectives trigger different optimal management responses eventually we use the results obtained from a field site in france to assess the applicability and usefulness of our proposed s o approach as an environmental decision making tool 2 study site 2 1 site description the study site for this research was an actively operating petrol station that is located in the north of france fig 1 at the site a leaking underground storage tank from 1992 to 1997 was discovered and removed in 1997 the leak has caused a petroleum hydrocarbon contamination within soil and groundwater the contaminated aquifer is about 10 m thick and is underlain by a clay aquitard it consists mostly of limestone and silt the general natural flow direction at the site is towards the north west and the average groundwater elevation within the shallow aquifer is approximately 2 to 3 m below the land surface the groundwater velocity at the field site is estimated to range between 17 and 25 m yr 1 the accidental leakage resulted in a soil contamination with a release of mostly monoaromatic hydrocarbons and a dissolved contaminant plume in the groundwater of more than 70 m in length for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex the maximum concentrations of the contaminants in groundwater were recorded in the piezometer p4 for benzene in piezometers pz2 and p1 for toluene and in p1 for ethylbenzene and xylenes from the btex concentrations measured at monitoring wells within the impacted area it was possible to define four separate source zones of different btex compositions fig 1 the zone affected by contamination around each monitoring well was approximated during the model calibration procedure using measured dissolved concentrations as constraints see also figs s1 and s2 the maximum observed concentrations of benzene are 11 mg l 1 in the source zone 3 mg l 1 at a location 50 m downstream of the sources and under 1 Î¼g l 1 at 75 m downstream fig 1 the hydrochemical analysis of the contaminated zone showed that the electron acceptors oxygen nitrate and sulphate were depleted within the contaminated zone indicating that natural biodegradation processes occurred at the site an overview of the ambient groundwater chemistry in the uncontaminated zone is provided in table 2 2 2 remediation strategy enhanced in situ biodegradation was selected as the most feasible approach for groundwater remediation at this site in situ bioremediation involves a mechanism for stimulating endogenous bacterial activities which convert contaminants to innocuous end products via electron acceptor amendments in such a system groundwater is abstracted using extraction wells and if necessary treated to remove residual dissolved constituents the treated groundwater is then mixed with electron acceptors or where needed also with other amendments that eliminate reaction rate limitations and re injected upstream or midstream of the contamination source and plumes through injection wells the first four decision variables considered in our study are common variables in contaminant remediation studies including 1 the number of extraction injecting wells 2 well locations 3 extraction injecting rates 4 operating period the investigated remediation scheme selected for this study consisted of i a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 injection scheme which provides additional electron accepting capacity to the aquifer and thus facilitating enhanced biodegradation huling et al 1990 and ii a downstream groundwater extraction scheme the maximum electron acceptor concentration that can be added to contaminated groundwater as h2o2 is 100 200 mg l 1 farhadian et al 2008 which is much higher than the solubility limited maximum dissolved oxygen concentration 8 10 mg l 1 once injected the hydrogen peroxide transforms successively to oxygen and water whereby based on the reaction stoichiometry the dissolved oxygen concentration is 47 1 of the amended hydrogen peroxide concentration i e prior to the transformation therefore the design oxygen concentration of the treatment fluid was set to 50 mg l 1 for a range of practical and technical reasons it was decided that the treatment scheme would include 4 extraction wells all located downstream of the contaminant plume see fig 5 the maximum allowable total extraction rate was 18 m3 d 1 and the operating duration of the bioremediation was limited to 3 years the total number of injection wells 12 was constrained by budget considerations and their injection rate by the field injection capacity in relation to the number of injection wells operating on average at 1 5 m3 d 1 four extraction wells were considered each with a capacity of 4 5 m3 d 1 in order to be consistent with the maximum total injection rate of 18 m3 d 1 with some of the typical bioremediation design variables such as the injectant hydrogen peroxide concentration being fixed the decision variables for this study were therefore i the position of the 12 injection wells and ii their injection rates we recognize that fixing the locations of the extraction wells may yield suboptimal remediation as the locations of the extraction wells can be highly sensitive to the optimal remediation design yielding policies that can be greatly influenced by the chosen objective function bayer and finkel 2007 2 3 flow and reactive transport process models in a first step a process based flow and reactive transport model was developed and calibrated to reproduce the previously collected field observations from the study site the objective was to simulate the biogeochemical behavior of the contaminated aquifer under the influence of different variants of the remediation system as accurately as possible 2 3 1 modeling tools and approach unconfined groundwater flow under varying extraction and injection schemes was simulated with the three dimensional finite difference flow code modflow harbaugh et al 2000 based on the numerical solution for groundwater flow the reactive transport of contaminants and other groundwater constituents was simulated with the reactive transport simulator pht3d prommer et al 2003 which couples mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 through an operator splitting approach for the model application discussed in this study the original phreeqc database was extended to incorporate all relevant site specific reactions in particular the microbially mediated degradation reactions and the corresponding degradation kinetics of the key organic contaminants that were found at the study site were appended 2 3 2 flow and reactive transport model setup the model domain was discretised into 56 columns x direction and 48 rows y direction in total covering an area of approximately 150 120 m with a constant thickness of 8 m the grid resolution was locally refined within the bio treatment zone i e the area of main interest and the area of the steepest biogeochemical gradients fig 2 no flow boundaries were implemented in the north and south with constant head boundaries along the western and eastern boundaries imposing an easterly regional hydraulic gradient of 2 corresponding to the field observed natural groundwater flow which indicate a mostly easterly gradient with subtle southerly variations spatial variations in hydraulic conductivity were parameterized through the pilot point method lavenue et al 1995 de marsily et al 1984 yeh and yoon 1981 in the pilot point method the unknown parameters are estimated for a set of points distributed within the domain the corresponding spatially distributed parameter field is obtained through kriging the pilot point values over the model domain the btex compounds were considered separately in order to account for their differing degradation characteristics a fifth compound that served as a proxy for all the prevailing low solubility compounds and lumped those into a single compound was also included each of the simulated compounds was included twice in the reaction network once as a mobile dissolved species and secondly as an immobile light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl species estimated lnapl concentrations were used to define the initial concentrations in all model grid cells that were coinciding with the source zone areas that were identified during the site characterisation zero initial concentrations were applied outside these source zones the release of the dissolved contaminants from the lnapl source zone was simulated through the commonly used first order mass transfer kinetic formulation barry et al 2002 mayer and miller 1996 powers et al 1991 1 r org dis Î± c org sat c o rg where c o rg is the concentration of the organic compound in the groundwater c org sat is the multi component solubility of the organic compound following raoult s law and Î± is a mass transfer coefficient that was assumed to be the same for all included organic compounds there are various approaches and levels of complexity to model the biodegradation of organic compounds especially where multiple electron acceptors play a role for the model application in the present paper a relatively simple approach i e a first order reaction limited by the presence absence of electron acceptors was selected to quantify the degradation rates of each considered compound b t e x 2 c o rg t k c o rg if ea 0 with k being the first order rate constant of the biodegradation reaction and ea in the present study representing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the groundwater the geochemical response to degradation of the organic compounds including electron acceptor consumption is quantified through the so called partial equilibrium approach using all present electron acceptors barry et al 2002 d affonseca et al 2011 postma and jakobsen 1996 the approach assumes that the oxidation of the organic compound is the rate limiting step in the overall redox reaction therefore the electron accepting step can be modelled as an equilibrium reaction in which the sequence of electron acceptor consumption is controlled by thermodynamics the extension of the frequently used first order kinetics bauer et al 2006 bekins et al 1998 cozzarelli et al 2010 was adopted from atteia and hÃ¶hener 2012 other key input parameters used in the reactive transport model are listed in table 3 the modified method of characteristics mmoc option was selected to simulate advective transport the model simulations started with an initially clean aquifer except for the non zero napl concentrations the model was then run for a spin up period of 1000 days during which the btex plumes fully evolved before the remediation wells were switched on 2 3 3 model calibration prior to applying the s o procedure the model was calibrated in two stages using field measurements as calibration constraints the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 was used to minimize the residuals between the simulated and the corresponding head and concentration observations collected from the study site s monitoring network in the first phase of the model calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivities at 32 pilot points were estimated with only the observed hydraulic head measurements being used as constraints steady state conditions were assumed for the groundwater flow simulations as the impact of temporal changes in groundwater flow directions and velocities were considered negligible in the second phase of the model calibration additional flow and reactive transport parameters porosity dispersivities source zone concentration dissolution and degradation rate constants were jointly estimated using all 12 head and 52 concentration measurements for the second calibration phase initial parameter estimates for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution were taken from the results of the first phase initial estimates of the adjustable parameters and of the parameter bounds for the reactive transport simulations were adopted from studies reported in the literature the final estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution is shown in fig 3 fig 4 summarizes the observed and simulated post calibration dissolved benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene the normalized root mean square errors achieved for the individual btex compounds were 9 12 13 and 10 respectively based on these metrics the flow and transport model was considered to be sufficiently calibrated with respect to the selected level of model complexity and parameterization while the model possibly still contained some minor structural errors it was considered to represent the best available process description and to be suitable to underpin the determination of the optimal design of groundwater bioremediation under different objectives 3 pso based optimization of groundwater bioremediation design generally optimization problems involve an objective function subject to a series of constraints that define a feasible region for the decision variables min f x subject to x s where s is the feasible region f is the objective function and x is the vector of decision variables the location of the n w injection wells of the treatment fluid and injection rates q n inj associated with each well n are the decision variables of the optimization problem the objective functions and constraints considered in this study are described in the following two sections 3 1 objective functions the objectives of any biotreatment implementation and what might be considered as optimal in terms of treatment efficiency is in general site specific these objectives will depend on the hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics of the site downstream receptors the regulatory environment operational aspects such as whether the site has ongoing operations and or the future use of the site in many studies the treatment efficiency is evaluated from the perspective of minimizing the mass of residual contaminants at the endpoint of treatment luo et al 2014 yang et al 2013b however evaluating the effectiveness of treatment should alternatively or in addition be based on the residual mass flux of dissolved contaminants emitting from the source zone brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2014 yang et al 2013a in our study both the dissolved contaminant concentrations in groundwater and the immobile mass in the source area of benzene were considered in the formulation of the objective functions benzene was selected as the target compound because it poses the highest risk from a health perspective e g johnson et al 2003 three separate groundwater bioremediation optimization objectives were considered independently in order to assess their impact on the optimal remediation design for the studied system 1 the first objective function was defined to minimize the immobile mass of benzene as napl in the source zone see fig 5 the source zone area included four distinct sources as discussed previously see fig 2 the remaining mass of benzene is in our framework expressed as a percentage f m of mass remaining in the aquifer at the end of the remediation activities 3 min f m mass end mass 0 100 where mass 0 and mass end are the total solute mass in the aquifer at the beginning and end of the remediation activities respectively 2 the minimization of the maximum dissolved benzene concentration along the profile a a see fig 5 located immediately downstream of the source area was defined as the second objective function note that the position of the maximum benzene concentration along the profile may change in order to consider a potential rebound effect i e an increase in concentrations in the phase after the active treatment has stopped the maximum benzene concentration 4 years after the end of the treatment period was used 4 min f c c end where f c expresses the maximum contaminant concentration found along the profile a a emitted by the source at the end of the treatment period c end 3 the third optimization objective was to minimize the time required to achieve a benzene concentration of less than 1 Î¼g l 1 at the observation point pobs located at the centre of the plume fig 5 5 min f t t c obs c lim where f t expresses the time t required to obtain a concentration c obs at the observation point equal to a concentration limit c lim 3 2 decision variables the initially investigated treatment process consisted of 4 extraction wells that were located downstream of the contaminant source area and two rows of six injection wells in a staggered arrangement upstream of the source area fig 5 however the injection wells were allowed to be positioned freely in a different i e optimized arrangement in order to maximize the overall remediation efficiency the selected decision variables of the optimization problem were therefore the locations x y coordinates of these 12 wells n w 12 and the rates at which the treatment fluids were injected at these wells in total assuming constant injection rates the optimization problem included 36 decision variables d 36 the search space for possible well positions is shown in fig 5 68 m x 110 m and 30 m y 85 m the minimum distance d min between two injection wells was defined to be 4 m see constraints section this distance prevented two extraction wells from being placed in the same model grid cell as already stated above the total allowable pumping rate was set to 18 m3 d 1 given that for logistical reasons all of the extracted water was proposed to be reinjected the average injection rate per well was 1 5 m3 d 1 however while the total injection rate was linked to the extraction rate variations among the injection wells were allowed given the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of the contaminated aquifer the physical capacity for injection was thought to be limited to 2 m3 d 1 per well based on preliminary model simulation results and field observations the maximum injection rate q n inj max was therefore set to 2 m3 d 1 per well and the minimum injection rate q n inj min was set to 0 m3 d 1 well unused fig 5 illustrates the initial design of the treatment system prior to optimization subsequently referred to as reference case 3 3 formulation of optimization constraints the optimization of the well locations and the injection rates was subject to a range of practical constraints 1 the location in x and y of a well must be between the specified lower and upper bounds x n min y n min and x n max y n max to ensure a realistic location of the injection wells such that 6 x n min x n x n max n 1 2 n w 7 y n min y n y n max n 1 2 n w 2 well locations are not considered to be discrete but rather continuous with a well to well distance constraint added to ensure a valid configuration of a well pattern d min denotes the minimum distance between any pair of wells and should be choosen such that that two wells cannot be in the same cell i e about 4 m thus 8 x m x m 1 2 y m y m 1 2 d min m n 1 2 n w 3 the maximum injection rate also should not exceed the well capacity therefore the injection rate of a well must be between the lower and upper limits specified q j min and q j max so that 9 q n inj min q n inj q n inj max n 1 2 n w 4 for practical reasons of managing treatment i e to avoid excessive fluid storage the total flow rates of injection and extraction must be balanced in our system the pumping flow will be considered as fixed and known a priori thus 10 n 1 n w q n inj q pump n 1 2 n w each optimization objective expressed in eqs 3 4 or 5 was independently combined with the constraints defined by eqs 6 10 and constitute the three optimization models of the studied groundwater bioremediation system 3 4 pso algorithm pso is a stochastic optimization method developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on the reproduction of the social behavior of animals living in swarms such as bird flocking or fish schooling in pso a swarm of candidate solutions or particles moves around the user defined decision variable vector space or simply the decision space searching for the best treatment performance which is defined by a fitness or objective function in a d dimensional vector space the position of each particle represents d unknown decision variables of the problem each particle has a randomly generated initial velocity which determines the rate of change of its position in the decision space to discover the optimal solution each particle moves iteratively according to two factors its own best previous experience its pbest position and the best experience among all other particles the gbest position of the swarm let the position of the i th particle in a d dimensional space at iteration t be expressed as x i t x i 1 t x i d t and the velocity v i t v i 1 t v i d t the particle s position is updated following eqs 11 and 12 11 x i d t 1 x i d t v i d t 1 12 v i d t 1 w v i d t c 1 r 1 x i d pbest t x i d t c 2 r 2 x d gbest t x i d t where the subscript i denotes the particle t denotes the iteration number r 1 and r 2 are random numbers uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 c 1 and c 2 are the cognitive and social parameters respectively and w is the inertia weight parameter at iteration t 1 the particle positions are updated and the associated objective function values are determined then pbest and gbest positions are updated based on these objective function values this process is repeated until no further improvement in the gbest position s objective function values is observed this basic version of pso is simple to implement and has been shown to be very effective at solving highly nonlinear optimization problems involving reactive transport models e g rawson et al 2016 rathi et al 2017 prommer et al 2018 stolze et al 2019 among others a variation of this basic algorithm was employed in our study largely based on the approach proposed by onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 this approach was chosen for this study as it has been shown to be particularly effective at handling the optimization of well locations among other aspects of the constraints considered in this study 3 5 s o model for groundwater contamination bioremediation within the s o framework the numerical process simulators modflow and pht3d were employed as modular subroutines that were called by the main optimization program fig 6 illustrates the main components of the s o model within a flow chart the major steps employed are step 1 initializes the population size step 2 initializes the values of w c 1 c 2 step 3 initializes each particle position with random elements drawn from a uniform distribution defined by upper and lower bounds of each design variable step 4 checks the constraints for constrained optimization direct application of eqs 6 7 and 9 may cause some particles to become infeasible to handle these infeasible particles the absorb technique was applied helwig and wanka 2008 in the absorb technique if a particle has violated the boundaries of a feasible region it will be set at its nearest bound onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 the corresponding velocity components are also set to zero helwig and wanka 2008 the approach used to handle constraints expressed by eqs 8 and 10 is the repair method i e special operators are used to repair an infeasible particle or to adjust it so it satisfies the constraints onwunalu 2010 for the minimum and maximum pumping rate of each well the values were clipped when above or below the given limits for the total rate if the rate is too high all well discharges are equally scaled in order to reach the maximum total discharge if two wells are too close to each other they are moved along the line passing through their initial position to reach a new position corresponding to the minimum distance this process is continued until all minimum distances are satisfied step 5 initializes each component of the velocities in a similar fashion to step 3 steps 6 and 7 compute the objective function for all particles in our application the objective function is evaluated in all cases by sequentially performing modflow and pht3d simulations step 8 updates the pbest position for each particle and the gbest position for the swarm new particle velocities are computed in step 9 step 10 updates all components of the positions of all particles in step 11 the constraints as mentioned in step 4 are checked steps 12 and 13 evaluate the objective function based on the new particle positions steps 8 through 13 are repeated until termination criteria have been met e g in this study when a maximum number of iterations was reached the employed pso algorithm is easy to implement which was done in this study using python scripts and readily parallelized for distributed cluster based processors all results presented below use a cluster of 20 processors using the message passing interface mpi gropp et al 1999 in our parallel implementation of the pso algorithm a master processor initiates each iteration by sending a series of design variables each corresponding to a particle position to a set of subordinate processors each subordinate processor sequentially executes the flow and transport model computes the objective function and the constraints and sends the results back to the master processor the master processor completes the iteration by updating the pbest and gbest positions as well as the velocities of the swarm and the entire process begins again with the next iteration 3 5 1 pso settings the pso algorithm has several control settings that must be specified prior to performing an optimization run banks et al 2007 shi and eberhart 1998 however there are no uniformly accepted standard values for these settings as the most suitable values are problem specific clerc and kennedy 2002 therefore an appropriate adjustment of the pso settings can result in a significantly faster convergence of the algorithm and a reduction of the potential to fall into local minima the critical settings include population size the maximum number of iterations and the weights of the inertia w with less critical settings involving the cognitive c 1 and social c 2 components respectively of the velocity equation like other optimization algorithms these settings can involve some trial and error to establish in numerous previous studies values of c 1 c 2 1 193 or c 1 c 2 1 496 were successfully used helwig and wanka 2008 however a number of numerical experiments performed in this study indicated that c 1 c 2 0 9 provided even better results and this value was therefore used throughout this study shi and eberhart 1999 suggested the use of a linearly decreasing inertia weight starting at 0 9 and successively decreasing to 0 4 for our study a linearly decreasing inertia weight from 1 2 to 0 4 showed to achieve convergence with the least number of iterations based on trial and error testing the population size was set to 15 particles our results also show that the pso algorithm we ve employed likely does not suffer from premature convergence and achieves good practical solutions to the various design problems we ve considered 4 results and discussion 4 1 pso algorithm performance fig 7 illustrates the pso convergence for each of the three considered objectives it is evident that the stochastic movement of the swarm can already greatly reduce the objective function during the first iteration for both f c and f t there was also a significant further decrease over the first 10 iterations while for f m the decrease of the objective function was substantially slower although this effect might be slightly different for different initializations of the random number generator the results show that minimizing f c is more sensitive to changes in positioning of the wells and flow rates than minimizing f m minimization of f t no longer improved beyond 20 iterations this might be due to a very slow change of c obs with time and therefore a low sensitivity of this objective moreover the runs performed with different random starting particle swarms not shown showed more reproducible curves of f c clearly indicating to be a better constrained optimization problem in case of using this objective 4 2 optimization result the simulation results illustrate how the objective functions varied for the three types of constraints mass c max on profile a a time to reach c limit at p obs interestingly minimizing f m reduced the remaining amount of benzene in the source area at the end of the treatment phase compared to the reference treatment case by only 2 7 i e from 26 1 to 25 4 however this evidently small decrease in mass was accompanied by a much more pronounced reduction of cend for benzene from 219 to 173 Î¼g l 1 at the benchmark location directly downstream from the source area 4 years after the end of treatment these results highlight that a marked decrease in contaminant mass flux can occur in conjunction with a relatively small decrease of the contaminant mass in the source this is consistent with the previous study of difilippo and brusseau 2008 who also found that the combination of heterogeneous media and non ideal mass transfer can lead to a significant mass flux reduction with a limited reduction of the overall contaminant mass directly minimizing f c leads to a further decreased cend i e it reduces benzene concentrations from 219 base case to 131 Î¼g l 1 after optimization however the mass of residual benzene as napl at the end of the treatment is in this case slightly higher 25 6 for the minimization of f c vs 25 4 for the minimization of f m this shows that it is possible to reduce the flux of contaminants emitted by the source while being less effective on reducing the mass of remaining benzene in the source area minimizing f t reduced the time required to achieve a benzene concentration lower than 1 Î¼g l 1 at the observation point pobs by 280 days more than 9 months and by 84 days compared with the results obtained from the minimization of f m however the mass of residual benzene at the end of the treatment period is in this case 13 higher than for the reference case and almost 16 higher compared to the results obtained when minimizing f m furthermore fig 8b shows a significant rise in benzene concentrations downstream of the source area after 2500 days i e after treatment has ceased given that in this case the mass does not decrease it is possible that a rebound might still occur at a later stage i e outside the period that was considered for the optimization all key optimization results are summarized in table 4 and in fig 8 in the present study a variation of the injection rates was not considered as the rates are already highly limited by the small hydraulic conductivity a decrease of the injection rates would have led to a longer removal of the product mass which is already long for a field remediation interestingly for all three studied optimization scenarios benzene concentrations at a virtual observation point located at the site boundary p obs show no major change at the end of the treatment see fig 8c concentrations of tex are similar but are not shown as they are associated with a much lower environmental risk however we note on fig 8b that after stopping treatment benzene concentrations at the profile a a increase at this site groundwater flow is relatively slow and a significant persistence of oxygen within the aquifer was observed during the period characterized by the persistence of oxygen benzene concentrations remained low but as some residual napl mass was still remaining in the source it is plausible that the concentrations in p obs could increase again after a longer period of time although it is known that rebound effects often occur during remediation e g mcdade et al 2005 thomson et al 2008 the time of its appearance is difficult to assess as it depends not only on the local hydraulic conductivity but also on reaction rates in the presented case a rebound can be observed at the observation profile downstream of the source zone after between a few months up to more than a year after the end of the treatment depending on the treatment strategy by favouring injection locations inside or close to the source zone the f m and f c treatments show a delayed rebound however three years after the end of the treatment the optimized injection did not differ significantly from the reference case as the system was getting back to its long term quasi equilibrium state 4 3 optimal design the optimal locations of wells and injection rates that were determined for the three investigated minimization objectives are presented fig 9 furthermore simulated oxygen concentrations after 700 days simulation time are also presented in fig 9 as can be seen when the optimization objective is to minimize f m the optimal well locations coincide with the source area and the close vicinity of it the resulting simulated oxygen concentrations therefore show to be relatively uniform near the source area these contour maps also show that oxygen is the main electron acceptor during the treatment it is evident that in this case the optimized solution favors biodegradation in the source zone in order to accelerate napl dissolution which occurs when aqueous phase benzene concentrations drop significantly below the equilibrium concentration the positions of the injection wells that promote the minimization of f c are mainly determined to be in zones where hydraulic conductivities are lower see fig 9b as the residual mass of benzene as napl is mostly found in this area therefore to minimize the benzene concentration in the groundwater directly downstream from the source area 4 years after stopping the treatment h2o2 is mainly injected into the residual source zone see fig s3 in the case where the objective is to minimize f t the most favorable configuration is one in which the wells are positioned in the areas of the highest hydraulic conductivities this results in a preferential treatment of areas characterized by high benzene fluxes at the beginning of the treatment interestingly the case in which f c is minimized it seems possible to remove the well pi1 for which the optimized abstraction rate is almost zero also in the case in which f t is minimized 3 injection wells have low flow rates and removing them completely is unlikely to have any detrimental effect on the overall performance these results indicate that the proposed pso optimization approach produces logical and tractable results the approach allows for the management of complex variables i e both the position of the wells and their injection rates which would probably not have been achievable by human trial and error the proposed method also creates a clear foundation for the management decisions that are required during the treatment process design which will most likely involve multiple parallel objectives and provides a potential mechanism for addressing the effects of various sources of uncertainty on the optimal remediation strategy in fact it is quite necessary to point out that there exists some potential for uncertainty in some aspects of the proposed model which could impact the optimal remediation strategies presented in this study for example due to parameter uncertainty and potential flaws in the structure of the numerical model e g lithological assumptions boundary conditions etc there may be significant uncertainty in the optimal remediation policy however addressing such an issue for highly nonlinear models such as the model presented in this study is complex computationally demanding and as a result an active area of further research therefore conducting optimization under uncertainty in the context of the remediation problems posed herein is considered to be beyond the scope of this study however reducing computational demands through machine learning based surrogate modeling e g yadav et al 2016 siade et al 2020 may yet prove effective for real world problems and remains a topic of future research 5 conclusions in this paper a coupled simulation optimization s o framework has been developed and used as a decision making tool for optimizing the design of a real world in situ bio treatment system by studying the role of the objective function formulation a flow and reactive transport simulation model and a pso based optimization model were both developed and subsequently coupled this framework was used to construct an effective s o model that could simultaneously determine optimal well locations and their optimal injection rates that constituted key elements of an enhanced biodegradation design problem the proposed approach was then applied to a petroleum contaminated site in france to support the design of a groundwater bioremediation system in our study the optimization of treatment efficiency was examined in terms of three different objectives 1 minimization of the residual napl mass of benzene in the source zone 2 reduction of the maximum concentration of benzene in groundwater and 3 minimization of the time required to reduce the benzene concentration in groundwater to below a threshold value the results show that at least for our study site reducing the flux of emitted contaminants is a more effective objective than the reduction of the residual napl mass a clear relationship between the flux decrease and the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity this relationship coincides with the remediation benefits forecasted by wood et al 2005 in this paper we show that this relationship also extends to optimization as the position and injection rates of the injection wells for minimizing the required treatment duration in order to reach a complete site clean up is strongly dependent on the site specific relationship between mass flux reduction and source zone mass removal consequently the remedial effort dedicated to minimizing the required treatment duration in order to reach a complete site clean up is strongly dependent on the site specific relationship between mass flux reduction and source zone mass removal the objective functions that we formulated in our work did not allow to decrease the mass flux of benzene very quickly while also ascertaining that there is no significant rebound of benzene concentration after the end of the active bioremediation phase in the presence of reactants here oxygen and where slow groundwater flow velocities persist the overall treatment efficiency can only be analyzed once the amended oxygen has migrated across the entire length of the plume this last point highlights the difficulty of defining the objective function such that the achieved contaminant concentration levels eliminate all potential environmental concerns and rebound effect must be considered therefore in practice multiple objectives may have to be considered simultaneously one of the key advantages of our proposed s o framework is that it allows for the ability to define arbitrary objective functions while obtaining optimization results within a reasonable time frame due to its ability to handle nonlinear nonconvex constrained optimization problems and its ease of implementation it is therefore possible to assess multiple objective functions and through this procedure to better understand the impact of various bioremediation design parameters in a heterogeneous aquifer medium and under the influence of the additionally induced biogeochemical transformations this can provide valuable support to decision makers in the selection of an optimal design in which treatment efficiency is maximized importantly the illustrative effect of the framework and the discussions that it could facilitate among stakeholders when multiple solutions are available will lead to a better understanding of everyone s interests and concerns and eventually culminate in more widely acceptable decisions employing formal multi objective pso mopso algorithms e g coello et al 2004 siade et al 2019 would be a useful and logical future extension of this work

1452,remediation of heavy metal contaminated aquifers is a challenging process because they cannot be degraded by microorganisms together with the usually limited effectiveness of technologies applied today for treatment of heavy metal contaminated groundwater this creates a need for new remediation technologies we therefore developed a new treatment in which permeable adsorption barriers are established in situ in aquifers by the injection of colloidal iron oxides these adsorption barriers aim at the immobilization of heavy metals in aquifers groundwater which was assessed in a large scale field study in a brownfield site colloidal iron oxide goethite nanoparticles were used to install an in situ adsorption barrier in a very heterogeneous contaminated aquifer of a brownfield in asturias spain the groundwater contained high concentrations of heavy metals with up to 25 mg l zinc 1 3 mg l lead 40 mg l copper 0 1 mg l nickel and other minor heavy metal pollutants below 1 mg l high amounts of zinc 900 mg kg lead 2000 mg kg nickel 190 mg kg were also present in the sediment ca 1500 kg of goethite nanoparticles of 461 266 nm diameter were injected at low pressure 0 6 bar into the aquifer through nine screened injection wells for each injection well a radius of influence of at least 2 5 m was achieved within 8 h creating an in situ barrier of 22 3 9 m despite the extremely high heavy metal contamination and the strong heterogeneity of the aquifer successful immobilization of contaminants was observed in the tested area the contaminant concentrations were strongly reduced immediately after the injection and the abatement of the heavy metals continued for a total post injection monitoring period of 189 days the iron oxide particles were found to adsorb heavy metals even at ph values between 4 and 6 where low adsorption would have been expected the study demonstrated the applicability of iron oxide nanoparticles for installing adsorption barriers for containment of heavy metals in contaminated groundwater under real conditions keywords nanoremediation heavy metals iron oxide nanoparticles in situ remediation permeable barriers contaminated aquifer abbreviations iw injection well mcw multichannel well 1 introduction heavy metals and metalloid contaminations such as zn as pb cu are of particular importance for groundwater resources since their high toxicity can cause diseases even at low concentrations marcovecchio et al 2007 however heavy metal ions are non degradable and thus very persistent and mobile in the environment posing severe threats for both ecosystems and human health besides locally enhanced concentrations from geogenic sources heavy metals are extensively released into the environment as a result of industrial activities such as plating ceramics and glass production mining and battery manufacturing as well as from fertilizers for agricultural purposes and accidental oil spills from tankers uwamariya 2013 hence heavy metals and metalloids are present in groundwater and soil of a significant number of contaminated sites according to a report by the european commission more than 30 of around 2 8 million potentially contaminated sites across europe contain heavy metals as main pollutants in both soil and groundwater paya perez and rodrÃ­guez eugenio 2018 however up until 2015 only ca 58 000 of these contaminated sites were remediated the most applied technology for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater is pump treat where contaminated groundwater is pumped into above ground installations and treated by either chemical precipitation or reverse osmosis adsorption ion exchange or electrochemical deposition the clean water is commonly reinjected into the ground al saad et al 2012 barakat 2011 or discharged in sewage systems or surface water bodies depending on national legislative frameworks and residual contamination levels after treatments typically the pump treat method requires the installation of large facilities on site and investments or operation costs in the million euro range which are limiting factors for remediation efforts hence in many cases in depth remediation is economically not feasible due to e g low concentrations of contaminants location in urban or sealed areas prohibiting constructions or installations for water treatments or limited financial resources of the responsible for clean up here we demonstrate a new technology to mitigate the spreading of heavy metal contaminations by installing an in situ permeable adsorption barrier using iron oxide nanoparticles braunschweig et al 2013 khin et al 2012 saha et al 2013 skjolding et al 2016 the concept includes that colloidal nanoparticles can be introduced into aquifers through injection wells where due to their minute size they can spread in the subsurface with the pumped water once they reached the target radius of influence they should aggregate and subsequently deposit at the surface of the aquifer matrix iron oxides are naturally present in aquifers have low toxicity and pose no danger to the environment or the operators cabellos et al 2018 gonzÃ¡lez andrÃ©s et al 2017 moreover iron oxide nanoparticles offer larger surface areas in comparison to bulk iron oxide which in turn increases the adsorption sites for heavy metals waychunas et al 2005 unlike other iron based nanomaterials such as nano zerovalent iron nzvi saleh et al 2006 tiraferri et al 2008 tosco et al 2014 iron oxide nanoparticles can remain colloidal in the injection fluids consequently they form stable suspensions and do not clog the pores of the aquifer matrix during injection due to coagulation or corrosion which allows for injection at low pressure thus avoiding a potential fracking of the underground contact with electrolytes e g groundwater induces the aggregation of the iron oxide colloids which can be exploited to specifically tune the propagation of the colloids through the aquifer during their injection bianco et al 2017 tiraferri et al 2017 tosco et al 2012 their finite and controllable mobility and their gentle injection makes colloidal iron oxides particularly suitable for groundwater remediation at field scale iron oxides and in particular goethite Î± feooh are known to adsorb many metal loid s such as arsenate zn2 pb2 cu2 and others from contaminated water abdus salam and adekola 2005 mohapatra et al 2010 montalvo and smolders 2019 rodda et al 1993 the affinity of goethite towards heavy metals is ph dependent abdus salam and adekola 2005 al saad et al 2012 montalvo and smolders 2019 and is strongest at neutral to slightly alkaline ph values at neutral ph values heavy metals still dissolve in water and are transported with groundwater but also strongly adsorb to goethite nanoparticles in contrast the electrostatic attraction between goethite and metal ions decreases at acidic ph while the solubility of metal ions decreases at strong alkaline conditions this study presents a field test of injecting colloidal iron oxides for the installation of an in situ adsorption barrier for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated groundwater the objectives of the study were i to evaluate the use of goethite colloids for implementing a stable and permeable in situ adsorption barrier for heavy metals and ii to determine the efficiency of these nanoparticles in removing mobile heavy metal contamination from groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 site description the nitrastur site is an abandoned 20 ha flat brownfield located near langreo asturias northern spain historically it was used over 48 years 1950 1998 for the production of nitrogen based products such as fertilizers the whole site area is covered by a layer of madeground 177 000 m2 with a variable thickness between 2 m and 9 m the madeground materials include slag from furnaces wastes from coal washing and partially burned pyrites pyrite ashes which are typically rich in heavy metals as well as construction debris underneath the madeground there is a 3 6 m thick layer of quaternary alluvial deposits of sandy silty gravels with boulders which define the unconfined and porous aquifer of the site beneath the aquifer there is a less permeable very hard slate and sandstone layer from the carboniferous acting as an aquitard wcisÅo et al 2016 the groundwater level is located close to the contact area between the madeground and the alluvial materials ca 2 3 m below the surface fig 1 the groundwater flows with an average velocity of 1 1 m day towards an adjacent perennial river the main source of contamination on the site is the madeground fedje et al 2017 wcisÅo et al 2016 its high levels of heavy metals from the pyrite ashes leach into the groundwater and become mobilized by rainwater seepage and groundwater fluctuation according to gallego et al 2016 who performed a sequential extraction of the madeground zn pb and cu are the most mobile heavy metals leaching into the underlying aquifer gallego et al 2016 wcisÅo et al 2016 in the test area the electrical conductivity was relatively low 923 2670 Î¼s cm and the oxidation reduction potential of about 400 mv indicated oxic conditions 2 2 installation of the barrier the technology demonstration was conducted in a ca 22 m 35 m area of the site where the thickness of the madeground layer was the lowest 2 3 m the adsorption barrier was installed with nine injection wells that were placed in two lines perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to maximize the efficiency fig 2a b the distance between the injection wells was 4 m allowing an overlap of one meter considering a radius of influence of 2 5 m for each well the injection wells had a diameter of 76 mm 3 in and were screened from ca 1 m below the water table at 3 5 m below surface down to the bottom of the aquifer at 6 5 m below surface to avoid intrusion of the iron oxides into the unsaturated zone fig 2 furthermore 11 regularly screened monitoring wells and 4 multichannel wells mcw with 3 channels each were installed for groundwater monitoring fig 2a and c the multichannel wells provided vertical profiles of the heavy metal concentrations and the migration of the iron oxide colloids during the injection inside mcw 1 and mcw 2 and downstream of the barrier mcw3 and mcw4 two upstream p1 and p2 and nine downstream regular monitoring wells p3 p11 were installed to assess the heavy metal removal by the adsorption barrier and to identify putative migration of colloids slug tests using a cylindrical slug with a diameter of 2 5 cm and length of 100 0 cm were carried out in all nine injection wells before installing the adsorption barrier the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was found to be 5 08 4 53 10 4 m s during a pilot study on the site data not shown it was found that the conductivity of the aquifer varies strongly with depth showing a highly permeable layer in the bottom part of the aquifer and less conductive materials in the upper part close to the madeground the existence of a higher conductivity layer at the bottom of the aquifer was also confirmed by the monitoring data registered during our iron oxide injection see below a faster breakthrough of the colloid suspension was observed already after 1 h in the deepest sampling ports of mcw1 and mcw2 at 6 m 6 3 m depths compared to the two upper ports although it was expected after 5 h 2 3 production and injection of the iron oxide nanoparticles the suspensions of colloidal goethite were synthesized and coated with humic acids at the university of duisburg essen according to meckenstock and bosch 2014 these humic acid coated goethite colloids have been previously shown to successfully immobilize heavy metals in laboratory experiments montalvo and smolders 2019 montalvo et al 2018 and to be mobile in similar porous media bianco et al 2017 tiraferri et al 2017 the colloid suspension was produced with a goethite content of ca 100 g l a humic acid content of 6 g l for stabilization of the suspended particles and a ph of 9 10 and remained stably colloidal during storage in 1200 l intermediate bulk containers ibcs for several months however for the present study the 15 m3 suspension was freshly produced and shipped to the site within one week from production the colloid suspension was analyzed with x ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which revealed that the nanoparticles consisted solely of low crystalline goethite see supplementary materials s1 to s3 the hydrodynamic diameters of the colloids were measured with dynamic light scattering nano zs malvern instruments revealing an average size of dh 461 266 nm n2 physisorption autosorb 1 quantachrome was evaluated with bet isotherms and revealed an average specific surface area of 161 0 0 2 m2 g min max deviation from duplicate analysis on the site the colloids were diluted 1 10 with municipal water and injected with packers into the injection wells at a flowrate of ca 30 6 l min prior to each injection ca 1 m3 of water was injected into each well in order to reduce the direct contact between groundwater and the iron oxide suspension which would trigger aggregation and thus deposition of the colloids bianco et al 2017 considering the relatively shallow water table we injected only into two parallel wells per day to avoid a strong increase of the groundwater table and possible daylighting the injection pressure in each well was monitored continuously above the packer at the surface in order to detect possible pore clogging or fracturing during before and after injection groundwater samples 200 ml each were collected from 24 wells 11 monitoring wells p1 11 9 injection wells iw1 9 and 4 multichannel wells mcw1 4 in addition soil samples from well iw5 were analyzed to determine the iron content of the sediment in various depths an additional well p12 was drilled ca two months after the application and the iron content was compared to the one before injection to determine the spreading and the deposition of the nanoparticles 2 4 analysis of groundwater heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater samples were analyzed with icp ms x series ii thermofisher scientific prior to analysis the samples were treated with hcl 37 analar normapur vwr prolabo and h2o2 30 rotipuran carl roth gmbh co kg to completely dissolve potentially occurring ferric oxide nanoparticles in addition the ph sentix 41 wtw and electric conductivity tetracon 325 wtw were measured in untreated groundwater samples the sediment samples from iw5 and p12 were dried 105 c ed 53 binder sieved 2 mm and grinded in a planetary mill 45 min pm 100 cm retsch tablets were prepared with homogenized sediment samples and hoechst wax c micropowder merck in a 1 6 mass ratio and the samples analyzed using wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence wdxrf pw 2400 philips the iron content of the sediment samples was also determined according to the dithionite citrate bicarbonate extraction protocol mehra and jackson 1958 and served as indicator to trace the propagation of goethite nanoparticles after injection 3 results 3 1 injection of the ferric oxide colloids for installation of the permeable adsorption barrier the injection was started in iw1 on day 0 on the next day day 1 the the suspension was injected in iw5 and iw7 simultaneously at the end of this day traces of brownish iron oxide fluid were observed in the downstream wells p3 p4 and p5 as well as in the deepest port of mcw3 fig 3b and d indicating the presence of a high conductivity layer at the lower part of the aquifer in order to prevent downstream migration of the nanoparticles the nanotune approach developed at politecnico di torino was applied by equally injecting a total volume of ca 26 700 l of a destabilizing agent 1 mm cacl2 in water according to tiraferri et al 2017 into p3 p4 and p5 bianco et al 2017 the iron oxide injection was resumed on day 3 by injecting nanoparticles into iw2 and iw4 continued by iw6 and iw8 on day 4 and iw3 and iw9 on day 5 no visible traces of goethite colloids were found in the other downstream wells throughout the application the injection pressure remained between 0 4 and 0 6 bars for all the wells and no daylighting occurred the detailed properties of the suspension are shown in table s9 supplementary materials within the first two weeks after the injection of the goethite nanoparticles the ph in the wells returned to their pre injection values with the exception of some of the wells located in the acidic area iw2 iw3 iw4 iw5 p7 and p8 in which the ph varied between 3 and 7 in comparison to pre inejction values of 2 4 fig s4a b the injection of the destabilizing agent did not alter the ph in the wells p3 p4 and p5 no significant increase in mobile organic carbon was observed fig s8 supplementary materials indicating that the humic acid was not released from the goethite nanoparticles during the monitoring period slug tests were carried out in all the injection wells immediately day 6 and ca one year day 325 after the injection the measured values were 2 63 0 76 10 4 m s and 4 52 4 31 10 4 m s respectively the lower values immediately after the injection were presumably due to the presence of the still suspended particles in the wellbore nevertheless the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer returned to the pre injection conditions 5 08 4 53 10 4 m s and was not affected by the injection one week after the injection the iron concentrations returned to their initial pre injection values in all wells indicating that the colloids were deposited at the matrix surfaces within less than one week after the injection and were not continuously exported from the barrier with the groundwater flow fig 3 two months after the injection a sediment core was drilled 2 m away from iw5 at p12 in the central region of the barrier to monitor the distribution of the iron oxides fig 2a even at 2 m distance from the injection well the iron content in the sediment was increased by on average 2000 mg kg sediment compared to the background level of the neighboring sediment core taken during installation of well iw5 before the injection fig 4 this increased iron content showed that the injected colloids did not precipitate only around the wellbore but were successfully delivered to the intended radius of influence of 2 5 m an accumulation of iron oxides was specifically observed from 6 to 6 3 m depth where most likely more of the iron oxide colloids was delivered due to the highly conductive zone at the bottom of the aquifer 3 2 monitoring of water chemistry before the injection analysis of groundwater samples revealed a strong heterogeneity of the ph in the test area while water of most of the wells showed a neutral ph some wells p3 p4 p6 p7 iw2 iw3 iw4 and iw5 showed ph values below 5 even reaching values down to ph 3 at some sampling times fig 5 this acidic area was partially buffered by the injection solution of the ferric oxide colloids ph 9 5 but the original ph values recovered in all wells shortly less than one week after the injection supplementary info s4a b prior to the injection of the iron oxide colloids high heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater were around 25 17 mg l for zn 40 25 mg l for cu and 1 3 2 5 mg l for pb fig 5 the highest concentrations were found inside the acidic area e g in p3 p4 p6 and p7 iw2 iw3 and iw5 where heavy metal concentrations were found to be ca ten times higher than in the rest of the wells analysis of the sediment profile obtained from cores of iw5 showed that high amounts of heavy metals were present not only in the madeground 0 3 m below surface but also in all depths of the aquifer materials fig 6 the total metal content of the aquifer sediment was higher than 1500 mg kg in all depths reaching 7320 mg kg just below the groundwater table 3 3 immobilization of heavy metals by the adsorption barrier right after the injection on day 0 the heavy metal concentrations of zn cu and pb sharply decreased in all wells fig 7a f full data set in supplementary fig s5a e except for a few data points the heavy metal concentrations remained below 50 of the background values even for the wells located in the acidic area the concentrations of the dominant pollutants zn and cu were reduced from more than 25 mg l to below 3 mg l in some wells e g p6 more than 90 of the heavy metals were immobilized from the groundwater the immobilization of the heavy metals continued throughout the monitoring period of 189 days after the injection in the post injection sampling on days 35 and 189 an increase of zn cu and pb concentrations was observed in all wells notably in the acidic area p3 p4 p6 iw3 iw4 iw5 fig 7a f this increase is attributed to leaching from the madeground layer into the aquifer as a consequence of rain events supplementary material fig s6 for example in the weeks of the last sampling date day 189 a total precipitation of more than 120 l m2 was recorded in the nearby meteorological station the leached heavy metals are more mobile in low ph conditions hence the effect is pronounced in the wells located in the acidic area 3 4 adsorption of heavy metals we estimated the efficiency of the barrier by calculating the contaminant flux and the adsorption for the injection wells the cross section area of the installed barrier was ca 22 m 3 m perpendicular to the groundwater flow in each injection well 16 5 0 7 m3 colloid suspension were injected with an iron oxide concentration of ca 10 kg m3 hence on average ca 22 5 kg of goethite was delivered to each cross section unit area of 1 m2 previous studies montalvo and smolders 2019 found that under favorable conditions ph 6 1 to 7 0 the adsorption capacities of the present goethite colloids in a multi element system similar to the groundwater are 9 g kgnanoparticles for zn and 51 g kgnanoparticles for cu therefore the injected amount of iron oxides is expected to adsorb 202 5 g zn and 1147 5 g cu per unit cross section area of 1 m2 considering average concentrations of 25 mg zn l and 40 mg cu l in groundwater of the wells in the acidic area e g iw2 or iw3 a porosity of 25 and a groundwater flow velocity of 1 1 m day the groundwater transported a mass of ca 6 9 g zn and ca 11 g cu per day across a unit cross section area this means that the amount of injected goethite is expected to become saturated in about 29 days for zn and 104 days for cu nevertheless the concentrations of mobile zn and cu remained below 1 mg l in iw2 and iw3 until 128 days after the injection fig 7d e the apparently enhanced longevity of the installed barrier could be partially explained by the ph changes in the injection area the ph values of the samples collected from some of the wells inside the acidic area iw2 iw3 iw4 iw5 p7 and p8 were increased from 2 to 3 to 3 7 fig s4a b it is known that the mobility of metals decreases at alkaline phs chuan et al 1996 krÃ³l et al 2020 however this trend was not observed for all the wells especially for those outside the acidic area the post injection ph values remained neutral to slightly acidic throughout the monitoring period nevertheless reduction in heavy metal concentrations was observed both inside and outside the acidic area reduction in metal concentrations was observed across the ph values even in p3 and p7 where the ph values remained below 4 after the injection aditionally seepage water from rainfall events introduced unknown amount of heavy metals from the madeground layer into the aquifer causing fluctuations in incoming metal fluxes such fluctuations are also observed in the pre injection data changes in groundwater velocity and presence of other iron minerals in the sediment may have influenced the longevity of the installed barrier too in the following 2 3 months the concentrations increased only in the acidic area where the injected goethite nanoparticles became saturated in all other wells where initial concentrations were lower a continuous decrease in heavy metal concentrations was recorded throughout the monitoring period after injection 189 days 4 discussion heavy metal contamination of groundwater is a world wide problem but only few technologies are available for its remediation the most applied pump and treat technology has considerable disadvantages such as ineffectiveness at lower heavy metal concentrations or its high costs dolgormaa et al 2018 since financial limitations constitute a major drawback for remediation there is a strong demand for in situ technologies that are cheaper and easier to implement karn et al 2009 perelo 2010 we therefore conducted a demonstration scale experiment to install an in situ adsorption barrier based on colloidal iron oxides that can be injected into aquifers the concept of the in situ adsorption barrier for heavy metals is based on three pillars first the injected iron oxide nanoparticles must be perfectly colloidal since they have to travel over several meters in the aquifer without clogging the pore space second the particles must be metastable that is they must precipitate shortly after the injection and cover the sediment to become immobile so the in situ adsorption barrier stays at the point of injection and particles do not dislocate with the groundwater flow third the iron oxides have to adsorb the heavy metals in the groundwater below the remediation targets the colloidal goethite used in this study was proven to be ideally injectable into the aquifer the constantly low pressure throughout the injection confirmed that the colloidal iron oxides in the suspension did not agglomerate and did not clog the pores around the wellbores this observation was confirmed by measuring the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer with slug tests before and after the injection the mobility of the goethite nanoparticles is thus superior compared to other nanomaterials such as nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which tends to aggregate and block the pores epa 2009 kocur et al 2014 phenrat et al 2007 hence high pressure is required to push nzvi into the sediment he et al 2010 which may lead to fracturing of the aquifer and thus uncontrolled and inhomogeneous spreading of the particles in contrast the goethite nanoparticles were effectively transported over the intended radius of influence which exceeded 2 5 m at low pressure 1 bar this was confirmed by elevated iron concentrations in the groundwater samples taken from mcw 1 and mcw 2 during the injection which are located inside the barrier region figs 3c d and s7a b iron concentrations were increased only in days 3 and 1 respectively which were the exact days that goethite nanoparticles were injected into the nearby wells of iw2 and iw9 respectively however the injected goethite nanoparticles were clearly metastable and aggregated shortly after the injection was finished and were deposited at the matrix surfaces which is a prerequisite to establish a stationary in situ permeable barrier reduction in mobile iron concentrations shortly after injection indicated that the injected goethite nanoparticles were immobilized fig 3c and s7a b the successful delivery of the nanoparticles was verified by the elevated iron content in the sediments 2 m away from the injection point proving that the injected particles were indeed deposited in the barrier region i e they neither accumulated near wellbores nor were transported with the groundwater the elevated iron content shown in fig 4 is between 900 and 2100 mg kg in depth between 4 and 5 m below surface this value matches the expected increase in iron content due to injection of ca 10 kg m3 of goethite nanoparticles at deeper zones however the observed iron concentrations exceeded the expected amount this is probably due to preferential flow of the injected goethite nanoparticle suspension into the highly conductive zone at the bottom of the aquifer very high iron content in this zone is hence attributed to accumulation of the goethite nanoparticles from the adjacent depth e g 5 to 6 m this observation is in agreement with a three dimensional injection study velimirovic et al 2020 where the delivery and the fate of similar goethite nanoparticles were observed and modelled in both the study by velimirovic et al 2020 and the present study goethite colloids became immobile shortly after the injection ended forming a stable in situ barrier of the intended radius of influence similar to the present study velimirovic et al 2020 also observed preferential migration of the injected colloids in a highly conductive zone and hence deposition of the colloids according to the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer although this inhomogeneity seems to be a disadvantage of the injection method it is indeed favorable as more iron oxide is delivered to the regions through which the contaminated groundwater flows hence the largest deposition of goethite particles is at the very place of the highest contaminant flux this is highly desired since it provides an automated passive regulation to deposit the adsorbent exactly where it is needed the third requirement is the effectiveness of the barrier iron oxides are excellent adsorbents for heavy metals in general al saad et al 2012 dolgormaa et al 2018 shen et al 2020 uwamariya 2013 and our goethite colloids showed particularly effective absorbance for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater montalvo and smolders 2019 montalvo et al 2018 furthermore the small size of the iron oxide colloids offers much higher surface area for adsorption of toxic metals in comparison to bulk iron oxides the analysis of the groundwater samples taken after the implementation of the adsorption barrier showed that the concentrations of the dissolved toxic metals such as zn cu and pb were reduced during the post injection monitoring period of 189 days high inflow concentrations of heavy metals were observed from the madeground layer into the aquifer across the test area baragaÃ±o et al 2020 conducted controlled flooding experiments in an upstream well nearby the area of the pilot study see fig 2b and observed leaching of heavy metals from the madeground layer into the aquifer rainfall events and accordingly occurring seepage water transports unknown amounts of heavy metals from the madeground layer to the aquifer and hence affect the observations in the downstream monitoring wells despite continuous inflow of toxic metals from the overlaying madeground layer especially on days 35 and 189 due to heavy rainfall and low ph values in some parts of the tested area which may lead to partial release of the metals concentrations of the toxic metals remained below 50 of the background values even at wells with ph values below 4 e g p3 and p7 and in some cases more than 90 of the toxic metals were eliminated from the groundwater over our monitoring period of 189 days although generally higher dissolved heavy metal concentrations were measured in the wells located in the acidic area the goethite nanoparticles still reduced the concentrations significantly fig 7 for example the concentrations of zn measured in monitoring well p7 within the acidic ph area decreased from ca 45 mg l to ca 5 mg l this was somehow surprising since most metal cations adsorb to a lesser extent to iron oxides at ph values below 6 0 montalvo and smolders 2019 okazaki et al 1986 however the adsorption capacity of the injected iron oxide must have been sufficiently high to overcome this limitation at the same time a reduction from 7 mg l to 1 mg l of zn was observed in p10 which was located within the neutral ph area nevertheless the amount of iron oxide nanoparticles required for a similar adsorption capacity in a barrier is potentially higher compared to an aquifer with neutral ph conditions montalvo and smolders 2019 the current study also presents some projections about the long term fate of the injected goethite nanoparticles and of the sorbed metals since no mobile iron was detected in the downstream monitoring wells and after the injection one concludes that the injected goethite nanoparticles were bound to the sediment matrix hence the risk of particle bound transport of pollutants is negligible goethite is one of the most thermodynamically stable iron oxide minerals and dissolves at ambient conditions only at very low ph at presence of iron complexing compounds e g oxalic acid or under anoxic conditions e g by reducing agents and or anerobic microbial reduction schwertmann 1991 although a portion of the in situ adsorption barrier was located in an acidic area no indication of iron dissolution was observed previous studies e g vermeer et al 1999 showed that the addition of the humic acid can enhance the adsorption of heavy metals to iron oxides the present study cannot distinguish between the adsorption of heavy metals to goethite or humic acid nevertheless the negligible amount of humic acid released suggests that the transport of the toxic heavy metals with humic acid is not expected in long term rebound of adsorbed heavy metals from humic acid coated goethite may occure if the ph of groundwater drops significantly chuan et al 1996 violante et al 2010 anoxic conditions evolve or strong fe complexing agents are introduced the latter two scenarios can be excluded from the site properties and history however the reduction in the ph values correlates with the rainfall events and inflow of metal rich leachate from the madeground layer which in longer monitoring times leads to fluctuations in observed metal concentrations furthermore competition among divalent cations for adsorption onto humic acid coated goethite will eventually result in the release of heavy metals with lower affinities montalvo and smolders 2019 observed that as more adsorption sites became occupied with time cd and ni were released from goethite nanoparticles and became replaced with cu and zn hence under multielement contamination conditions remobilization of low affine heavy metals might occur and the competition of the present heavy metals for adsorption must be taken into account for designing an in situ adsorption barrier for plume treatment it is also important to consider the heavy metal content associated with the solid phase in the aquifer in our case the heavy metal content of the sediment accounted for several hundred mg kg fig 6 in chemical equilibrium these sediment associated heavy metals are constantly being released from and adsorbed to the sediment with identical reaction rates after the injection of the iron oxide colloidal particles however the sediment associated heavy metals will also adsorb to the pristine iron oxides newly introduced into the aquifer which likely exhibit a stronger affinity for these metals than the ambient sediment material see e g montalvo and smolders 2019 furthermore injected goethite colloids are deposited on the surface of the sediment particles placing them in immediate proximity to the sediment associated heavy metals this promotes a flux of heavy metals from the sediment to the iron oxides consequently sediment associated heavy metals may compete with the mobile dissolved heavy metals from groundwater for adsorption sites on the introduced nanoparticles nevertheless even at the extreme heavy metal content of the sediment at the nitrastur site the injected goethite nanoparticles efficiently immobilized the dissolved heavy metal contaminants for example in iw5 where high amounts of sediment associated heavy metals were present fig 6 the concentrations of dissolved zn and cu were reduced from 20 to 30 mg l to lower than 2 mg l therefore it is important that both the heavy metal concentration in the groundwater and the content in the sediment must be included in calculating the adsorption capacities of an in situ barrier if the heavy metal content of the sediment is too high the lifetime of the in situ barrier will be significantly reduced these facts have to be taken into account in evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of the in situ adsorption barrier conclusions and environmental implications the present study demonstrates the applicability of colloidal goethite nanoparticles for in situ immobilization of toxic metals in groundwater ca 1500 kg of humic acid goethite nanoparticles were injected in 150 m3 suspension into a contaminated aquifer to form a permeable adsorption barrier of 21 m 9 m and 3 m thickness results of this demonstration study confirmed previous micro and mesoscale studies that the colloidal goethite nanoparticles are easily injectable in aquifers at low pressures they follow the pattern of hydraulic conductivity of the sediment and precipitate within one to two days after the injection without clogging the pore space in this way they form a stable and in situ permeable adsorption barrier which adsorbs and immobilizes dissolved heavy metals from the contaminant plume despite the excessive heavy metal concentrations in both sediment and groundwater the heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater were significantly reduced to less than 50 of the original concentrations after the injection of the goethite nanoparticles immobilization of heavy metals was successfully observed both inside the barrier domain and further downstream the goethite colloids provide an ecologically harmless technology that poses no risk to the environment and to the operators involved hence ferric oxide colloid based in situ adsorption

1452,remediation of heavy metal contaminated aquifers is a challenging process because they cannot be degraded by microorganisms together with the usually limited effectiveness of technologies applied today for treatment of heavy metal contaminated groundwater this creates a need for new remediation technologies we therefore developed a new treatment in which permeable adsorption barriers are established in situ in aquifers by the injection of colloidal iron oxides these adsorption barriers aim at the immobilization of heavy metals in aquifers groundwater which was assessed in a large scale field study in a brownfield site colloidal iron oxide goethite nanoparticles were used to install an in situ adsorption barrier in a very heterogeneous contaminated aquifer of a brownfield in asturias spain the groundwater contained high concentrations of heavy metals with up to 25 mg l zinc 1 3 mg l lead 40 mg l copper 0 1 mg l nickel and other minor heavy metal pollutants below 1 mg l high amounts of zinc 900 mg kg lead 2000 mg kg nickel 190 mg kg were also present in the sediment ca 1500 kg of goethite nanoparticles of 461 266 nm diameter were injected at low pressure 0 6 bar into the aquifer through nine screened injection wells for each injection well a radius of influence of at least 2 5 m was achieved within 8 h creating an in situ barrier of 22 3 9 m despite the extremely high heavy metal contamination and the strong heterogeneity of the aquifer successful immobilization of contaminants was observed in the tested area the contaminant concentrations were strongly reduced immediately after the injection and the abatement of the heavy metals continued for a total post injection monitoring period of 189 days the iron oxide particles were found to adsorb heavy metals even at ph values between 4 and 6 where low adsorption would have been expected the study demonstrated the applicability of iron oxide nanoparticles for installing adsorption barriers for containment of heavy metals in contaminated groundwater under real conditions keywords nanoremediation heavy metals iron oxide nanoparticles in situ remediation permeable barriers contaminated aquifer abbreviations iw injection well mcw multichannel well 1 introduction heavy metals and metalloid contaminations such as zn as pb cu are of particular importance for groundwater resources since their high toxicity can cause diseases even at low concentrations marcovecchio et al 2007 however heavy metal ions are non degradable and thus very persistent and mobile in the environment posing severe threats for both ecosystems and human health besides locally enhanced concentrations from geogenic sources heavy metals are extensively released into the environment as a result of industrial activities such as plating ceramics and glass production mining and battery manufacturing as well as from fertilizers for agricultural purposes and accidental oil spills from tankers uwamariya 2013 hence heavy metals and metalloids are present in groundwater and soil of a significant number of contaminated sites according to a report by the european commission more than 30 of around 2 8 million potentially contaminated sites across europe contain heavy metals as main pollutants in both soil and groundwater paya perez and rodrÃ­guez eugenio 2018 however up until 2015 only ca 58 000 of these contaminated sites were remediated the most applied technology for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater is pump treat where contaminated groundwater is pumped into above ground installations and treated by either chemical precipitation or reverse osmosis adsorption ion exchange or electrochemical deposition the clean water is commonly reinjected into the ground al saad et al 2012 barakat 2011 or discharged in sewage systems or surface water bodies depending on national legislative frameworks and residual contamination levels after treatments typically the pump treat method requires the installation of large facilities on site and investments or operation costs in the million euro range which are limiting factors for remediation efforts hence in many cases in depth remediation is economically not feasible due to e g low concentrations of contaminants location in urban or sealed areas prohibiting constructions or installations for water treatments or limited financial resources of the responsible for clean up here we demonstrate a new technology to mitigate the spreading of heavy metal contaminations by installing an in situ permeable adsorption barrier using iron oxide nanoparticles braunschweig et al 2013 khin et al 2012 saha et al 2013 skjolding et al 2016 the concept includes that colloidal nanoparticles can be introduced into aquifers through injection wells where due to their minute size they can spread in the subsurface with the pumped water once they reached the target radius of influence they should aggregate and subsequently deposit at the surface of the aquifer matrix iron oxides are naturally present in aquifers have low toxicity and pose no danger to the environment or the operators cabellos et al 2018 gonzÃ¡lez andrÃ©s et al 2017 moreover iron oxide nanoparticles offer larger surface areas in comparison to bulk iron oxide which in turn increases the adsorption sites for heavy metals waychunas et al 2005 unlike other iron based nanomaterials such as nano zerovalent iron nzvi saleh et al 2006 tiraferri et al 2008 tosco et al 2014 iron oxide nanoparticles can remain colloidal in the injection fluids consequently they form stable suspensions and do not clog the pores of the aquifer matrix during injection due to coagulation or corrosion which allows for injection at low pressure thus avoiding a potential fracking of the underground contact with electrolytes e g groundwater induces the aggregation of the iron oxide colloids which can be exploited to specifically tune the propagation of the colloids through the aquifer during their injection bianco et al 2017 tiraferri et al 2017 tosco et al 2012 their finite and controllable mobility and their gentle injection makes colloidal iron oxides particularly suitable for groundwater remediation at field scale iron oxides and in particular goethite Î± feooh are known to adsorb many metal loid s such as arsenate zn2 pb2 cu2 and others from contaminated water abdus salam and adekola 2005 mohapatra et al 2010 montalvo and smolders 2019 rodda et al 1993 the affinity of goethite towards heavy metals is ph dependent abdus salam and adekola 2005 al saad et al 2012 montalvo and smolders 2019 and is strongest at neutral to slightly alkaline ph values at neutral ph values heavy metals still dissolve in water and are transported with groundwater but also strongly adsorb to goethite nanoparticles in contrast the electrostatic attraction between goethite and metal ions decreases at acidic ph while the solubility of metal ions decreases at strong alkaline conditions this study presents a field test of injecting colloidal iron oxides for the installation of an in situ adsorption barrier for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated groundwater the objectives of the study were i to evaluate the use of goethite colloids for implementing a stable and permeable in situ adsorption barrier for heavy metals and ii to determine the efficiency of these nanoparticles in removing mobile heavy metal contamination from groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 site description the nitrastur site is an abandoned 20 ha flat brownfield located near langreo asturias northern spain historically it was used over 48 years 1950 1998 for the production of nitrogen based products such as fertilizers the whole site area is covered by a layer of madeground 177 000 m2 with a variable thickness between 2 m and 9 m the madeground materials include slag from furnaces wastes from coal washing and partially burned pyrites pyrite ashes which are typically rich in heavy metals as well as construction debris underneath the madeground there is a 3 6 m thick layer of quaternary alluvial deposits of sandy silty gravels with boulders which define the unconfined and porous aquifer of the site beneath the aquifer there is a less permeable very hard slate and sandstone layer from the carboniferous acting as an aquitard wcisÅo et al 2016 the groundwater level is located close to the contact area between the madeground and the alluvial materials ca 2 3 m below the surface fig 1 the groundwater flows with an average velocity of 1 1 m day towards an adjacent perennial river the main source of contamination on the site is the madeground fedje et al 2017 wcisÅo et al 2016 its high levels of heavy metals from the pyrite ashes leach into the groundwater and become mobilized by rainwater seepage and groundwater fluctuation according to gallego et al 2016 who performed a sequential extraction of the madeground zn pb and cu are the most mobile heavy metals leaching into the underlying aquifer gallego et al 2016 wcisÅo et al 2016 in the test area the electrical conductivity was relatively low 923 2670 Î¼s cm and the oxidation reduction potential of about 400 mv indicated oxic conditions 2 2 installation of the barrier the technology demonstration was conducted in a ca 22 m 35 m area of the site where the thickness of the madeground layer was the lowest 2 3 m the adsorption barrier was installed with nine injection wells that were placed in two lines perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to maximize the efficiency fig 2a b the distance between the injection wells was 4 m allowing an overlap of one meter considering a radius of influence of 2 5 m for each well the injection wells had a diameter of 76 mm 3 in and were screened from ca 1 m below the water table at 3 5 m below surface down to the bottom of the aquifer at 6 5 m below surface to avoid intrusion of the iron oxides into the unsaturated zone fig 2 furthermore 11 regularly screened monitoring wells and 4 multichannel wells mcw with 3 channels each were installed for groundwater monitoring fig 2a and c the multichannel wells provided vertical profiles of the heavy metal concentrations and the migration of the iron oxide colloids during the injection inside mcw 1 and mcw 2 and downstream of the barrier mcw3 and mcw4 two upstream p1 and p2 and nine downstream regular monitoring wells p3 p11 were installed to assess the heavy metal removal by the adsorption barrier and to identify putative migration of colloids slug tests using a cylindrical slug with a diameter of 2 5 cm and length of 100 0 cm were carried out in all nine injection wells before installing the adsorption barrier the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was found to be 5 08 4 53 10 4 m s during a pilot study on the site data not shown it was found that the conductivity of the aquifer varies strongly with depth showing a highly permeable layer in the bottom part of the aquifer and less conductive materials in the upper part close to the madeground the existence of a higher conductivity layer at the bottom of the aquifer was also confirmed by the monitoring data registered during our iron oxide injection see below a faster breakthrough of the colloid suspension was observed already after 1 h in the deepest sampling ports of mcw1 and mcw2 at 6 m 6 3 m depths compared to the two upper ports although it was expected after 5 h 2 3 production and injection of the iron oxide nanoparticles the suspensions of colloidal goethite were synthesized and coated with humic acids at the university of duisburg essen according to meckenstock and bosch 2014 these humic acid coated goethite colloids have been previously shown to successfully immobilize heavy metals in laboratory experiments montalvo and smolders 2019 montalvo et al 2018 and to be mobile in similar porous media bianco et al 2017 tiraferri et al 2017 the colloid suspension was produced with a goethite content of ca 100 g l a humic acid content of 6 g l for stabilization of the suspended particles and a ph of 9 10 and remained stably colloidal during storage in 1200 l intermediate bulk containers ibcs for several months however for the present study the 15 m3 suspension was freshly produced and shipped to the site within one week from production the colloid suspension was analyzed with x ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which revealed that the nanoparticles consisted solely of low crystalline goethite see supplementary materials s1 to s3 the hydrodynamic diameters of the colloids were measured with dynamic light scattering nano zs malvern instruments revealing an average size of dh 461 266 nm n2 physisorption autosorb 1 quantachrome was evaluated with bet isotherms and revealed an average specific surface area of 161 0 0 2 m2 g min max deviation from duplicate analysis on the site the colloids were diluted 1 10 with municipal water and injected with packers into the injection wells at a flowrate of ca 30 6 l min prior to each injection ca 1 m3 of water was injected into each well in order to reduce the direct contact between groundwater and the iron oxide suspension which would trigger aggregation and thus deposition of the colloids bianco et al 2017 considering the relatively shallow water table we injected only into two parallel wells per day to avoid a strong increase of the groundwater table and possible daylighting the injection pressure in each well was monitored continuously above the packer at the surface in order to detect possible pore clogging or fracturing during before and after injection groundwater samples 200 ml each were collected from 24 wells 11 monitoring wells p1 11 9 injection wells iw1 9 and 4 multichannel wells mcw1 4 in addition soil samples from well iw5 were analyzed to determine the iron content of the sediment in various depths an additional well p12 was drilled ca two months after the application and the iron content was compared to the one before injection to determine the spreading and the deposition of the nanoparticles 2 4 analysis of groundwater heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater samples were analyzed with icp ms x series ii thermofisher scientific prior to analysis the samples were treated with hcl 37 analar normapur vwr prolabo and h2o2 30 rotipuran carl roth gmbh co kg to completely dissolve potentially occurring ferric oxide nanoparticles in addition the ph sentix 41 wtw and electric conductivity tetracon 325 wtw were measured in untreated groundwater

determined according to the dithionite citrate bicarbonate extraction protocol mehra and jackson 1958 and served as indicator to trace the propagation of goethite nanoparticles after injection 3 results 3 1 injection of the ferric oxide colloids for installation of the permeable adsorption barrier the injection was started in iw1 on day 0 on the next day day 1 the the suspension was injected in iw5 and iw7 simultaneously at the end of this day traces of brownish iron oxide fluid were observed in the downstream wells p3 p4 and p5 as well as in the deepest port of mcw3 fig 3b and d indicating the presence of a high conductivity layer at the lower part of the aquifer in order to prevent downstream migration of the nanoparticles the nanotune approach developed at politecnico di torino was applied by equally injecting a total volume of ca 26 700 l of a destabilizing agent 1 mm cacl2 in water according to tiraferri et al 2017 into p3 p4 and p5 bianco et al 2017 the iron oxide injection was resumed on day 3 by injecting nanoparticles into iw2 and iw4 continued by iw6 and iw8 on day 4 and iw3 and iw9 on day 5 no visible traces of goethite colloids were found in the other downstream wells throughout the application the injection pressure remained between 0 4 and 0 6 bars for all the wells and no daylighting occurred the detailed properties of the suspension are shown in table s9 supplementary materials within the first two weeks after the injection of the goethite nanoparticles the ph in the wells returned to their pre injection values with the exception of some of the wells located in the acidic area iw2 iw3 iw4 iw5 p7 and p8 in which the ph varied between 3 and 7 in comparison to pre inejction values of 2 4 fig s4a b the injection of the destabilizing agent did not alter the ph in the wells p3 p4 and p5 no significant increase in mobile organic carbon was observed fig s8 supplementary materials indicating that the humic acid was not released from the goethite nanoparticles during the monitoring period slug tests were carried out in all the injection wells immediately day 6 and ca one year day 325 after the injection the measured values were 2 63 0 76 10 4 m s and 4 52 4 31 10 4 m s respectively the lower values immediately after the injection were presumably due to the presence of the still suspended particles in the wellbore nevertheless the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer returned to the pre injection conditions 5 08 4 53 10 4 m s and was not affected by the injection one week after the injection the iron concentrations returned to their initial pre injection values in all wells indicating that the colloids were deposited at the matrix surfaces within less than one week after the injection and were not continuously exported from the barrier with the groundwater flow fig 3 two months after the injection a sediment core was drilled 2 m away from iw5 at p12 in the central region of the barrier to monitor the distribution of the iron oxides fig 2a even at 2 m distance from the injection well the iron content in the sediment was increased by on average 2000 mg kg sediment compared to the background level of the neighboring sediment core taken during installation of well iw5 before the injection fig 4 this increased iron content showed that the injected colloids did not precipitate only around the wellbore but were successfully delivered to the intended radius of influence of 2 5 m an accumulation of iron oxides was specifically observed from 6 to 6 3 m depth where most likely more of the iron oxide colloids was delivered due to the highly conductive zone at the bottom of the aquifer 3 2 monitoring of water chemistry before the injection analysis of groundwater samples revealed a strong heterogeneity of the ph in the test area while water of most of the wells showed a neutral ph some wells p3 p4 p6 p7 iw2 iw3 iw4 and iw5 showed ph values below 5 even reaching values down to ph 3 at some sampling times fig 5 this acidic area was partially buffered by the injection solution of the ferric oxide colloids ph 9 5 but the original ph values recovered in all wells shortly less than one week after the injection supplementary info s4a b prior to the injection of the iron oxide colloids high heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater were around 25 17 mg l for zn 40 25 mg l for cu and 1 3 2 5 mg l for pb fig 5 the highest concentrations were found inside the acidic area e g in p3 p4 p6 and p7 iw2 iw3 and iw5 where heavy metal concentrations were found to be ca ten times higher than in the rest of the wells analysis of the sediment profile obtained from cores of iw5 showed that high amounts of heavy metals were present not only in the madeground 0 3 m below surface but also in all depths of the aquifer materials fig 6 the total metal content of the aquifer sediment was higher than 1500 mg kg in all depths reaching 7320 mg kg just below the groundwater table 3 3 immobilization of heavy metals by the adsorption barrier right after the injection on day 0 the heavy metal concentrations of zn cu and pb sharply decreased in all wells fig 7a f full data set in supplementary fig s5a e except for a few data points the heavy metal concentrations remained below 50 of the background values even for the wells located in the acidic area the concentrations of the dominant pollutants zn and cu were reduced from more than 25 mg l to below 3 mg l in some wells e g p6 more than 90 of the heavy metals were immobilized from the groundwater the immobilization of the heavy metals continued throughout the monitoring period of 189 days after the injection in the post injection sampling on days 35 and 189 an increase of zn cu and pb concentrations was observed in all wells notably in the acidic area p3 p4 p6 iw3 iw4 iw5 fig 7a f this increase is attributed to leaching from the madeground layer into the aquifer as a consequence of rain events supplementary material fig s6 for example in the weeks of the last sampling date day 189 a total precipitation of more than 120 l m2 was recorded in the nearby meteorological station the leached heavy metals are more mobile in low ph conditions hence the effect is pronounced in the wells located in the acidic area 3 4 adsorption of heavy metals we estimated the efficiency of the barrier by calculating the contaminant flux and the adsorption for the injection wells the cross section area of the installed barrier was ca 22 m 3 m perpendicular to the groundwater flow in each injection well 16 5 0 7 m3 colloid suspension were injected with an iron oxide concentration of ca 10 kg m3 hence on average ca 22 5 kg of goethite was delivered to each cross section unit area of 1 m2 previous studies montalvo and smolders 2019 found that under favorable conditions ph 6 1 to 7 0 the adsorption capacities of the present goethite colloids in a multi element system similar to the groundwater are 9 g kgnanoparticles for zn and 51 g kgnanoparticles for cu therefore the injected amount of iron oxides is expected to adsorb 202 5 g zn and 1147 5 g cu per unit cross section area of 1 m2 considering average concentrations of 25 mg zn l and 40 mg cu l in groundwater of the wells in the acidic area e g iw2 or iw3 a porosity of 25 and a groundwater flow velocity of 1 1 m day the groundwater transported a mass of ca 6 9 g zn and ca 11 g cu per day across a unit cross section area this means that the amount of injected goethite is expected to become saturated in about 29 days for zn and 104 days for cu nevertheless the concentrations of mobile zn and cu remained below 1 mg l in iw2 and iw3 until 128 days after the injection fig 7d e the apparently enhanced longevity of the installed barrier could be partially explained by the ph changes in the injection area the ph values of the samples collected from some of the wells inside the acidic area iw2 iw3 iw4 iw5 p7 and p8 were increased from 2 to 3 to 3 7 fig s4a b it is known that the mobility of metals decreases at alkaline phs chuan et al 1996 krÃ³l et al 2020 however this trend was not observed for all the wells especially for those outside the acidic area the post injection ph values remained neutral to slightly acidic throughout the monitoring period nevertheless reduction in heavy metal concentrations was observed both inside and outside the acidic area reduction in metal concentrations was observed across the ph values even in p3 and p7 where the ph values remained below 4 after the injection aditionally seepage water from rainfall events introduced unknown amount of heavy metals from the madeground layer into the aquifer causing fluctuations in incoming metal fluxes such fluctuations are also observed in the pre injection data changes in groundwater velocity and presence of other iron minerals in the sediment may have influenced the longevity of the installed barrier too in the following 2 3 months the concentrations increased only in the acidic area where the injected goethite nanoparticles became saturated in all other wells where initial concentrations were lower a continuous decrease in heavy metal concentrations was recorded throughout the monitoring period after injection 189 days 4 discussion heavy metal contamination of groundwater is a world wide problem but only few technologies are available for its remediation the most applied pump and treat technology has considerable disadvantages such as ineffectiveness at lower heavy metal concentrations or its high costs dolgormaa et al 2018 since financial limitations constitute a major drawback for remediation there is a strong demand for in situ technologies that are cheaper and easier to implement karn et al 2009 perelo 2010 we therefore conducted a demonstration scale experiment to install an in situ adsorption barrier based on colloidal iron oxides that can be injected into aquifers the concept of the in situ adsorption barrier for heavy metals is based on three pillars first the injected iron oxide nanoparticles must be perfectly colloidal since they have to travel over several meters in the aquifer without clogging the pore space second the particles must be metastable that is they must precipitate shortly after the injection and cover the sediment to become immobile so the in situ adsorption barrier stays at the point of injection and particles do not dislocate with the groundwater flow third the iron oxides have to adsorb the heavy metals in the groundwater below the remediation targets the colloidal goethite used in this study was proven to be ideally injectable into the aquifer the constantly low pressure throughout the injection confirmed that the colloidal iron oxides in the suspension did not agglomerate and did not clog the pores around the wellbores this observation was confirmed by measuring the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer with slug tests before and after the injection the mobility of the goethite nanoparticles is thus superior compared to other nanomaterials such as nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which tends to aggregate and block the pores epa 2009 kocur et al 2014 phenrat et al 2007 hence high pressure is required to push nzvi into the sediment he et al 2010 which may lead to fracturing of the aquifer and thus uncontrolled and inhomogeneous spreading of the particles in contrast the goethite nanoparticles were effectively transported over the intended radius of influence which exceeded 2 5 m at low pressure 1 bar this was confirmed by elevated iron concentrations in the groundwater samples taken from mcw 1 and mcw 2 during the injection which are located inside the barrier region figs 3c d and s7a b iron concentrations were increased only in days 3 and 1 respectively which were the exact days that goethite nanoparticles were injected into the nearby wells of iw2 and iw9 respectively however the injected goethite nanoparticles were clearly metastable and aggregated shortly after the injection was finished and were deposited at the matrix surfaces which is a prerequisite to establish a stationary in situ permeable barrier reduction in mobile iron concentrations shortly after injection indicated that the injected goethite nanoparticles were immobilized fig 3c and s7a b the successful delivery of the nanoparticles was verified by the elevated iron content in the sediments 2 m away from the injection point proving that the injected particles were indeed deposited in the barrier region i e they neither accumulated near wellbores nor were transported with the groundwater the elevated iron content shown in fig 4 is between 900 and 2100 mg kg in depth between 4 and 5 m below surface this value matches the expected increase in iron content due to injection of ca 10 kg m3 of goethite nanoparticles at deeper zones however the observed iron concentrations exceeded the expected amount this is probably due to preferential flow of the injected goethite nanoparticle suspension into the highly conductive zone at the bottom of the aquifer very high iron content in this zone is hence attributed to accumulation of the goethite nanoparticles from the adjacent depth e g 5 to 6 m this observation is in agreement with a three dimensional injection study velimirovic et al 2020 where the delivery and the fate of similar goethite nanoparticles were observed and modelled in both the study by velimirovic et al 2020 and the present study goethite colloids became immobile shortly after the injection ended forming a stable in situ barrier of the intended radius of influence similar to the present study velimirovic et al 2020 also observed preferential migration of the injected colloids in a highly conductive zone and hence deposition of the colloids according to the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer although this inhomogeneity seems to be a disadvantage of the injection method it is indeed favorable as more iron oxide is delivered to the regions through which the contaminated groundwater flows hence the largest deposition of goethite particles is at the very place of the highest contaminant flux this is highly desired since it provides an automated passive regulation to deposit the adsorbent exactly where it is needed the third requirement is the effectiveness of the barrier iron oxides are excellent adsorbents for heavy metals in general al saad et al 2012 dolgormaa et al 2018 shen et al 2020 uwamariya 2013 and our goethite colloids showed particularly effective absorbance for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater montalvo and smolders 2019 montalvo et al 2018 furthermore the small size of the iron oxide colloids offers much higher surface area for adsorption of toxic metals in comparison to bulk iron oxides the analysis of the groundwater samples taken after the implementation of the adsorption barrier showed that the concentrations of the dissolved toxic metals such as zn cu and pb were reduced during the post injection monitoring period of 189 days high inflow concentrations of heavy metals were observed from the madeground layer into the aquifer across the test area baragaÃ±o et al 2020 conducted controlled flooding experiments in an upstream well nearby the area of the pilot study see fig 2b and observed leaching of heavy metals from the madeground layer into the aquifer rainfall events and accordingly occurring seepage water transports unknown amounts of heavy metals from the madeground layer to the aquifer and hence affect the observations in the downstream monitoring wells despite continuous inflow of toxic metals from the overlaying madeground layer especially on days 35 and 189 due to heavy rainfall and low ph values in some parts of the tested area which may lead to partial release of the metals concentrations of the toxic metals remained below 50 of the background values even at wells with ph values below 4 e g p3 and p7 and in some cases more than 90 of the toxic metals were eliminated from the groundwater over our monitoring period of 189 days although generally higher dissolved heavy metal concentrations were measured in the wells located in the acidic area the goethite nanoparticles still reduced the concentrations significantly fig 7 for example the concentrations of zn measured in monitoring well p7 within the acidic ph area decreased from ca 45 mg l to ca 5 mg l this was somehow surprising since most metal cations adsorb to a lesser extent to iron oxides at ph values below 6 0 montalvo and smolders 2019 okazaki et al 1986 however the adsorption capacity of the injected iron oxide must have been sufficiently high to overcome this limitation at the same time a reduction from 7 mg l to 1 mg l of zn was observed in p10 which was located within the neutral ph area nevertheless the amount of iron oxide nanoparticles required for a similar adsorption capacity in a barrier is potentially higher compared to an aquifer with neutral ph conditions montalvo and smolders 2019 the current study also presents some projections about the long term fate of the injected goethite nanoparticles and of the sorbed metals since no mobile iron was detected in the downstream monitoring wells and after the injection one concludes that the injected goethite nanoparticles were bound to the sediment matrix hence the risk of particle bound transport of pollutants is negligible goethite is one of the most thermodynamically stable iron oxide minerals and dissolves at ambient conditions only at very low ph at presence of iron complexing compounds e g oxalic acid or under anoxic conditions e g by reducing agents and or anerobic microbial reduction schwertmann 1991 although a portion of the in situ adsorption barrier was located in an acidic area no indication of iron dissolution was observed previous studies e g vermeer et al 1999 showed that the addition of the humic acid can enhance the adsorption of heavy metals to iron oxides the present study cannot distinguish between the adsorption of heavy metals to goethite or humic acid nevertheless the negligible amount of humic acid released suggests that the transport of the toxic heavy metals with humic acid is not expected in long term rebound of adsorbed heavy metals from humic acid coated goethite may occure if the ph of groundwater drops significantly chuan et al 1996 violante et al 2010 anoxic conditions evolve or strong fe complexing agents are introduced the latter two scenarios can be excluded from the site properties and history however the reduction in the ph values correlates with the rainfall events and inflow of metal rich leachate from the madeground layer which in longer monitoring times leads to fluctuations in observed metal concentrations furthermore competition among divalent cations for adsorption onto humic acid coated goethite will eventually result in the release of heavy metals with lower affinities montalvo and smolders 2019 observed that as more adsorption sites became occupied with time cd and ni were released from goethite nanoparticles and became replaced with cu and zn hence under multielement contamination conditions remobilization of low affine heavy metals might occur and the competition of the present heavy metals for adsorption must be taken into account for designing an in situ adsorption barrier for plume treatment it is also important to consider the heavy metal content associated with the solid phase in the aquifer in our case the heavy metal content of the sediment accounted for several hundred mg kg fig 6 in chemical equilibrium these sediment associated heavy metals are constantly being released from and adsorbed to the sediment with identical reaction rates after the injection of the iron oxide colloidal particles however the sediment associated heavy metals will also adsorb to the pristine iron oxides newly introduced into the aquifer which likely exhibit a stronger affinity for these metals than the ambient sediment material see e g montalvo and smolders 2019 furthermore injected goethite colloids are deposited on the surface of the sediment particles placing them in immediate proximity to the sediment associated heavy metals this promotes a flux of heavy metals from the sediment to the iron oxides consequently sediment associated heavy metals may compete with the mobile dissolved heavy metals from groundwater for adsorption sites on the introduced nanoparticles nevertheless even at the extreme heavy metal content of the sediment at the nitrastur site the injected goethite nanoparticles efficiently immobilized the dissolved heavy metal contaminants for example in iw5 where high amounts of sediment associated heavy metals were present fig 6 the concentrations of dissolved zn and cu were reduced from 20 to 30 mg l to lower than 2 mg l therefore it is important that both the heavy metal concentration in the groundwater and the content in the sediment must be included in calculating the adsorption capacities of an in situ barrier if the heavy metal content of the sediment is too high the lifetime of the in situ barrier will be significantly reduced these facts have to be taken into account in evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of the in situ adsorption barrier conclusions and environmental implications the present study demonstrates the applicability of colloidal goethite nanoparticles for in situ immobilization of toxic metals in groundwater ca 1500 kg of humic acid goethite nanoparticles were injected in 150 m3 suspension into a contaminated aquifer to form a permeable adsorption barrier of 21 m 9 m and 3 m thickness results of this demonstration study confirmed previous micro and mesoscale studies that the colloidal goethite nanoparticles are easily injectable in aquifers at low pressures they follow the pattern of hydraulic conductivity of the sediment and precipitate within one to two days after the injection without clogging the pore space in this way they form a stable and in situ permeable adsorption barrier which adsorbs and immobilizes dissolved heavy metals from the contaminant plume despite the excessive heavy metal concentrations in both sediment and groundwater the heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater were significantly reduced to less than 50 of the original concentrations after the injection of the goethite nanoparticles immobilization of heavy metals was successfully observed both inside the barrier domain and further downstream the goethite colloids provide an ecologically harmless technology that poses no risk to the environment and to the operators involved hence ferric oxide colloid based in situ adsorption

1453,pharmaceutically active compounds have increasingly been detected in groundwater worldwide despite constituting a risk for human health and ecosystems their fate in the environment has still not been exhaustively investigated this study characterizes the transport behavior of five selected pharmaceutically active compounds antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in two sediments coarse quartz sand and sandy loam using column experiments with long term injection of spiked groundwater transport parameters were estimated using an analytical reactive transport model when five selected compounds were injected simultaneously transport behavior of antipyrine carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were similar to the conservative tracer in both sediments and under varying redox conditions atenolol and caffeine were retarded significantly stronger in the sandy loam sediment than in the coarse quartz sand biodegradation of caffeine was observed in both sediments after an adaption period and depended on dissolved oxygen the identification of biodegradation processes was supported by monitoring of intracellular adenosine triphosphate atpitc as a measure for microbial activity atpitc was present in varying concentrations in all sediments and was highest when biodegradation of pharmaceuticals especially caffeine was observed when only caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were injected simultaneously sulfamethoxazole was degraded while caffeine degradation was reduced the latter seemed to be influenced by low concentrations in dissolved oxygen rather than the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole results of these experiments emphasize the impact on pharmaceutical sorption and bio degradation of sediment type and redox conditions as well as available time for microbial adaption and the combination of pharmaceuticals that are released together into groundwater keywords pharmaceuticals groundwater column experiments numerical modeling biodegradation 1 introduction newly developed organic compounds and their metabolites have been increasingly observed in the environment e g bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 Ã¶llers et al 2001 sui et al 2015 tang et al 2019 often referred to as eocs emerging organic compounds their fate in the environment remains largely unresolved kÃ¼mmerer 2009 lapworth et al 2012 an important subset of eocs are pharmaceutically active compounds scheytt et al 2004 stemming from untreated sewage effluents septic tanks hospital effluents as well as agriculture and livestock activities aus der beek et al 2016 lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 or illegitimate disposal of expired medication via toilets and waste gauthier et al 2008 ternes et al 2002 they enter aquatic systems in considerable concentrations lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 yamamoto et al 2009 potentially ending up in groundwater bexfield et al 2019 lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 sui et al 2015 considering the use of groundwater for drinking water supply its contamination with pharmaceuticals poses a risk to human health bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 bioactive effects can arise even at concentration levels of few ng l that have actually been detected in drinking water ericson et al 2002 wennmalm and gunnarsson 2005 besides immediate health risks e g elevated risk of cancer the increasing presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in groundwater is also likely to lead to a multiplication of antibiotic resistant bacteria andrade et al 2020 haack et al 2012 szekeres et al 2018 in contrast to pesticides pharmaceuticals have hardly been considered by legislators to date and they have only recently come in the focus of research understanding the fate of pharmaceuticals in aquifers allows determining their potential for natural attenuation this is of great interest in order to estimate their threat to ecosystems and human health as well as to set reasonable threshold values the potential for natural attenuation of most pharmaceutically active compounds is not sufficiently investigated greenhagen et al 2014 regnery et al 2017 for these reasons it is absolutely required to conduct environmental studies on pharmaceutical transport behavior lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 williams et al 2006 especially interactions between compounds are inadequately understood regnery et al 2017 the systematic assessment of transport processes however is difficult at complex field sites where boundary conditions cannot be controlled a proven alternative approach are laboratory investigations using flow through column experiments banzhaf and hebig 2016 they are supposed to reflect natural conditions of the saturated zone schaffer et al 2012 while conditions are easily controllable and the complexity of the domain under investigation is reduced so far column experiments have been conducted to study pharmaceutical transport under varying physico chemical conditions such as changes in ph schaffer et al 2012 redox conditions and temperature alidina et al 2015 burke et al 2014 and sediment properties greenhagen et al 2014 kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 the present study is built on research by kiecak et al 2020 who conducted laboratory column experiments with sediments from different study sites to examine transport parameters for selected pharmaceuticals at different flow rates one study site was the alluvial vistrenque aquifer in france where pharmaceutically active compounds occur in groundwater and surface water mainly stemming from waste water treatment plant effluents kiecak et al 2019 the sandy loam sediment from the vistrenque aquifer was investigated in our present study the selection of pharmaceuticals for this study was based on their occurrence at the field site in france and on their global relevance it includes the antiepileptic and antipsychotic drug carbamazepine the beta blocker atenolol the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the analgesic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug phenazone prior tradename antipyrine as well as the stimulant caffeine carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and caffeine are worldwide among the most frequently reported pharmaceutical compounds in the environment specifically in groundwater aus der beek et al 2016 bexfield et al 2019 sui et al 2015 the occurrence of atenolol and antipyrine is less frequent however both compounds have been detected in several environmental studies from countries all over the world aus der beek et al 2016 findings of kiecak et al 2020 showed that sorption processes in aquifer sediments are significant for the transport of several pharmaceutical compounds whereas flow rates turned out not to significantly influence transport behavior the type of sediment was identified to play a major role while their study provided important answers regarding the transport behavior of the listed pharmaceuticals biodegradation could not clearly be identified which raised further questions previous research has found strong indications that biodegradation plays a key role in the natural attenuation of pharmaceutically active compounds lam et al 2004 ternes et al 2002 xu et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2009 especially caffeine and atenolol are known to be degraded by microorganisms dash and gummadi 2010 godfrey et al 2007 koroÅ¡a et al 2020 a commonly applied method for the identification of biodegradation in column experiments is the use of an abiotic control in order to distinguish between biotic and abiotic processes this can be achieved for example by adding sodium azide to the feed water of the abiotic control column burke et al 2013 kiecak et al 2020 maeng et al 2011 or a combination of sodium azide and mercury chloride de wilt et al 2018 hamon et al 2014 martin et al 2018 or sodium azide and copper sulphate hillebrand et al 2013 and additionally by autoclaving of the sediment e g radke and maier 2014 however all of these methods threaten to have an undesired effect on sediment properties and experimental conditions the addition of the above mentioned biocidal compounds in too high concentrations might influence the sorption behavior of the organic compounds under investigation chefetz et al 2006 hillebrand et al 2013 martin et al 2018 vanderford et al 2011 other studies have shown that microbial activity might only be reduced instead of inhibited by application of sodium azide at a given concentration abel et al 2013 cabrol et al 2017 therefore it needs to be monitored if sodium azide in concentrations reported to not affect sorption of other compounds and as applied previously kiecak et al 2020 also is sufficient for creating abiotic conditions it further needs to be tested whether microbial communities in column experiments do in fact have enough time to adapt to the newly introduced compounds to start biodegradation when confronted with short pulse injection periods lag phases corresponding to adaption periods might be required for a change in the metabolic state of microorganisms which respond to changes in surrounding substrate conditions by activating new enzymatic pathways and repairing damaged cells especially microorganisms in nutrient poor conditions like in groundwater aquifers often suffer from cell damages when first encountering a new substrate barford et al 1982 wood et al 1995 lag phases for caffeine degradation of less than three days have been reported in several studies when degradation was actively enhanced li and mclachlan 2019 nayak et al 2012 pÃ©rez et al 2009 topp et al 2006 in column experiments of de wilt et al 2018 under aerobic to nitrate reducing conditions a lag phase of 27 days before caffeine degradation was observed for atenolol degradation li and mclachlan 2019 observed adaption periods of 15 28 days in incubation tests antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole have been found to be recalcitrant in many studies where degradation did not occur within the timeframe of the experiments benotti and brownawell 2009 li and mclachlan 2019 baumgarten et al 2011 found that the adaption period for sulfamethoxazole was not finished even after two years alidina et al 2014 on the other hand found that adaption of the microbial community did not play a significant role for the contaminant removal in their managed aquifer recharge setting overall little is still known about the role and duration of adaption periods for microbial degradation of pharmaceuticals in aquifers in this study long term laboratory column experiments with continuous injection of pharmaceuticals were carried out in order to examine the transport behavior of selected pharmaceuticals with focus on the identification and quantification of biodegradation providing more time for microorganisms to adapt to substrate conditions biological control parameters were measured in order to estimate microbial activity within the columns and to differentiate between sorption biotic and abiotic degradation redox conditions within the columns were not actively controlled instead the establishment of different redox conditions was monitored at the column outlets to get insight into interaction effects of pharmaceutical compounds an additional experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole on the biodegradation of caffeine as supposedly easier degradable compound 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up stainless steel columns were packed with sediments according to kiecak et al 2020 the two sediments selected for this study are in the following referred to as v and g sediment v sediment is a sandy loam from the vistrenque alluvial aquifer in france with 29 grain size fraction 0 063 mm cation exchange capacity of 2 48 cmolc kg a specific surface of 2 97 m2 g obtained from kiecak et al 2020 tc and toc fractions were 1 27 0 42 0 07 0 10 respectively sediment v was packed in columns va and vb g sediment is coarse technical quartz sand dorsilit nr 5f quarzsande gmbh germany with homogeneous grain size distribution of 1 2 mm cation exchange capacity of 0 07 cmolc kg and a specific surface of 0 25 m2 g obtained from kiecak et al 2020 since we expected low sorption for the technical quartzsand it was chosen as a reference to the v sediment the total carbon and total organic carbon fraction tc toc were measured with the toc 5050 shimadzu kyoto japan analyzer and are 0 07 0 10 and 0 00 0 00 respectively g sediment was packed in columns ga gb g1 and g2 after packing the columns were saturated with local groundwater hco3 ca mg water facies from neuherberg germany the used groundwater is geochemically similar to groundwater from the vistrenque aquifer from where the v sediment was sampled properties of the vistrenque groundwater from the sampling point caissargue can be found in kiecak et al 2019 local groundwater was chosen to be able to constantly provide fresh feed water for the columns in order to obtain a chemical equilibrium between substrate and feed water the sediment columns were flushed with pure groundwater for one month prior to the start of the experiments the ionic composition of the inflow and outflow after equilibration are given in the supplementary s2 during both equilibration and the experiments a peristaltic pump generated water flow from the bottom to the top of the columns at a constant flow rate although flow velocity had no impact on the transport behavior of pharmaceuticals in this sediment kiecak et al 2020 flow velocities typically found in such porous aquifers were chosen cf banzhaf and hebig 2016 with the start of each column experiment groundwater spiked with conservative tracers and pharmaceuticals as reactive tracers were continuously injected into the columns the abiotic control columns va and ga were additionally spiked with 50 mg l sodium azide according to kiecak et al 2019 and kiecak et al 2020 fraction samplers were used to obtain samples of the column outflow at defined time intervals hoses were sterile packaged before being implemented in the fraction collector the test tubes for the samples were steam sterilized before use a polystyrene construction served to protect the samples in the fraction collectors from possible effects of photolysis properties of the columns and the experimental set up are summarized in table 1 2 2 tracer solutions for long term injection stock solutions were created for the injection of pharmaceutical spiked groundwater using distilled water as solvent for antipyrine atenolol and caffeine whereas methanol was used for the less water soluble compounds carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole a detailed description of the chemicals used in the experiments can be found in kiecak et al 2019 in order to eliminate residues of methanol in the feed water the pipetted stock solution was evaporated from dry and clean 5 l schott bottles under the fume hood next groundwater was added to the bottles to create the feed water solutions fresh feed water solutions were regularly recreated to have constant supply for the long term experiments in order to establish water transport characteristics sodium chloride was added to the first injection volume for each column as a conservative tracer target concentrations were 0 18 mg l for pharmaceuticals similarly to concentrations used by banzhaf et al 2012 ensuring that concentrations in our samples can be measured directly and quantified precisely without the need for preconcentration and 80 mg l for chloride only in the first injection volume to the ga gb va and vb columns groundwater spiked with all 5 selected pharmaceuticals antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole was continuously injected where ga and va were the abiotic controls to g1 column groundwater spiked with caffeine only was injected to g2 column feed water spiked with caffeine and sulfamethoxazole was injected the total duration of the injections is given in table 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pharmaceutical concentrations uhplc ms ms measurements pharmaceutical concentrations in inflow and outflow samples were analyzed using

groundwater input solutions and samples were additionally measured employing a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a kyoto japan redox conditions within the columns were not actively controlled or manipulated in this investigation in order to study conditions closer to natural conditions 2 3 3 biological control parameter adenosine triphosphate atp atp concentrations indirectly give information about the amount of cells in the water sample intracellular atp provides information on living cells crouch et al 1993 hammes et al 2010 in order to obtain this measure extracellular atp that is suspended freely in water was centrifuged out of the suspension intracellular atp concentrations were measured using the bioluminescent reaction of atp with luciferin catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase deluca and mcelroy 1978 lundin and thore 1975 mcelroy and deluca 1983 for this study the promega bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay was applied bioluminescence was measured as relative light units rlu using the glomax luminometer promega madison usa 2 4 numerical modeling numerical modeling of tracer breakthrough curves and estimation of transport parameters was performed using the stanmod software cxtfit 2 0 deterministic equilibrium and two site non equilibrium transport models based on the convection dispersion equation cde toride et al 1999 were tested to fit the transport models to the measured data the cde one dimensional steady state flow in homogeneous subsoil without a production term is presented in eq 1 according to toride et al 1999 where r f

water fluxes input boundary conditions were set to step input and initial concentrations were set to zero except for chloride where background concentrations of the groundwater were measured zero

mass transfer coefficient Ï partitioning and mass transfer between two sorption sites both equilibrium and non equilibrium models cannot account for temporal dynamics in degradation e g as a result of changing redox conditions or occurring lag phases in order to still get an approximated estimate in these cases we temporally divided the experiment according to occurring redox conditions and adaption periods and successively fitted the degradation coefficient this procedure was only used for the compound caffeine in gb and g1 further coefficients describing water and compound transport

compounds do concentrations ranged between 0 00 and 1 83 mg l in vb between 0 00 and 6 30 mg l in va between 0 02 and 5 98 mg l in gb between 0 08 and 7 45 mg l in ga between 0 76 and 8 12 mg l in g1 and between 0 00 and 5 62 mg l in g2 the variations in nitrate and do concentrations over time for all columns are displayed in the supplementary details s3 sulfate was not reduced at any point in any of the experiments microbial activity in the columns was estimated via measurements of intracellular atp atp itc in the outflow samples atp itc concentrations in all samples were greater than the background concentration in pure groundwater of 3 6e 04 Î¼g l in v columns atp itc concentrations in the biotic setting were greater than in the abiotic setting range of 1 5e 02 1 5e 00 Î¼g l and mean of 2 1e 01 Î¼g l in vb vs a range of 1 4e 02 6 1e 01 and mean of 1 4e 01 Î¼g l in va but not on a statistically significant level welch two sample t test df 14 52 p 0 61 in g columns the concentrations in the biotic setting were significantly greater than in the abiotic setting welch two sample t test df 10 96 p 0 05 with a range of 1 5e 02 5 0e 01 Î¼g l and a mean concentration of 1 4e 01 Î¼g l in gb and a range of 4 1e 03 1 1e 01 Î¼g l and mean of 3 2e 02 Î¼g l in ga these results suggest that adding the indicated amount of sodium azide to the feed water was significantly but not fully inhibiting microbial activity in ga coarse sand while it was not sufficient in the more fine grained sediment in va this corresponds to findings of martin et al 2018 according to which lower concentrations 50 mg l of sodium azide are effectively biocidal in a more sandy material in our investigation however this means we cannot fully consider the control columns va and ga to be free of biodegradation processes atp itc concentrations were generally lower in g1 and g2 columns where only one or two compounds were injected respectively the range was 9 8e 03 7 8e 02 Î¼g l for g1 only caffeine injected and 1 8e 02 3 3e 01 Î¼g l for g2 caffeine and sulfamethoxazole injected 3 2 breakthrough curves and long term transport parameters of pharmaceuticals the modeling results of all experiments are given in table 2 overall tendencies of the five selected compounds and two selected sediments for retardation were atenolol caffeine carbamazepine antipyrine sulfamethoxazole retardation was overall stronger in sandy loam sediment v than in coarse quartz sand g the general tendency for degradation of the compounds was atenolol sulfamethoxazole antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine was either almost completely removed under oxic conditions or hardly degraded under anoxic conditions since pharmaceutical concentrations detected in groundwater bodies are usually significantly lower than concentrations used in this laboratory study the modeled values as presented above might not be directly transferrable to field conditions however many laboratory tests for the exploration of biodegradation and sorption of organic contaminants in water sediment systems work with concentrations at the Î¼g l to mg l level kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 we can assume that our results still provide valuable information for the comparison of the behavior of the different compounds in the environment furthermore biodegradation rates of some compounds in this study are assumed to be redox dependent a range is given for caffeine biodegradation rates in gb where the lowest value was estimated for nitrate reducing conditions and the highest value for oxic conditions estimated first order degradation rates cannot exactly reflect the biodegradation process over time and distance as we do not know the spatial heterogeneity of microbial degradation activity or the occurrence of degradation hotspots within the columns the necessary simplification made here however still gives a valid estimation for the whole system under investigation and is similar to field studies where degradation coefficients are derived from measurements in wells the so estimated first order degradation coefficients are thus useful for describing and comparing a compound s biodegradability see regnery et al 2015 the transport behavior of the individual compounds in this investigation will be further described in the following sections the breakthrough and long term concentration curves for all five pharmaceuticals are displayed together with the variations in do and atp itc concentrations in fig 1 for vb and va columns and in fig 2 for gb and ga columns 3 2 1 atenolol atenolol was subject to sorption and retardation in both sediments but stronger in the v sediment figs 1 and 2 over the entire duration of the experiments the overall lowest recovery was found for atenolol in the v sediment fig 3 this sediment has a significant amount of clay and a greater specific surface of 2 97 m2 g compared to the g sediment 0 25 m2 g ionic sorption of the cationic compound atenolol to the negatively charged surface of clay minerals was assumed by martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 besides the clay fraction the higher carbon content in the v sediment likely enhanced sorption as compared to the g sediment kiecak et al 2019 found a correlation of carbon content in sediment with atenolol sorption a generally high sorption affinity of atenolol was observed by burke et al 2013 atenolol transport behavior in the v sediment was best simulated using a two site non equilibrium model which allowed accounting for two different sorption sites this resulted in a partitioning coefficient Î² describing the partitioning of the compound between the two sorption sites as a fraction of 0 52 and 0 45 in vb and va respectively and a mass transfer coefficient Ï 0 02 in both vb and va this suggests that atenolol was adsorbed to more than one ionic sorption site in the v sediment with a minor exchange between the sorption sites besides sorption atenolol was also subject to degradation in the v sediment however results from the vb and va column experiments did not allow to clearly determine whether this was in fact a result of biodegradation or rather abiotic degradation processes atenolol removal due to biodegradation was observed in the g sediment microbial activity was significantly higher in gb than in the control column ga this presumably resulted in the higher degradation rates implying that more biotransformation was observed in gb however irreversible sorption of atenolol taking place at the same time cannot be ruled out and might to some extent also be the reason for atenolol removal here in both sediments atenolol removal seemed to be independent from do concentrations 3 2 2 caffeine caffeine was subject to retardation in both sediments comparable to atenolol it was sorbed stronger in the v sediment the breakthrough curve of caffeine in v sediment was not captured properly by measurements and consequently by the model as slowly increasing caffeine concentrations in the beginning were followed by an abrupt increase to the plateau martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 assumed predominantly irreversible ionic sorption of the cationic compound caffeine to negatively charged surfaces of clay minerals which might have occurred in in the v sediment of our study too the dynamics of this process however could not be captured adequately by transport models implemented in cxtfit 2 0 therefore two equilibrium fitting scenarios were carried out a to all available data and b with improved fit to the plateau concentrations this resulted in two different retardation coefficients 2 6 1 6 in vb 2 5 1 1 in va for scenario a b respectively possibly referring to different sorption processes fig 1 solid and dashed yellow lines respectively we presumably observed biodegradation of caffeine in all biotic settings in the biotic settings vb and gb caffeine transport behavior was in strong contrast to the control columns va and ga figs 1 and 2 dropping caffeine concentrations were coinciding with an increase in atpitc concentrations indicating biological degradation biodegradation of caffeine is strongly depending on redox conditions the first enzymatic steps in the biological conversion of caffeine are the successful removal of three methyl groups which is catalyzed by oxidative demethylase enzymes glÃ¼ck and lingens 1987 middelhoven and lommen 1984 yamaoka yano and mazzafera 1999 a full caffeine degradation pathway by the common bacteria pseudomonas putida has been presented by yamaoka yano and mazzafera 1999 dash and gummadi 2010 found the process to be driven by a variety of microorganisms including klebsiella rhodococcus and algaligenes sp using n demethylase enzymes either as hydrolysis or as described before as an oxidation process rauch williams et al 2010 wood et al 1995 alidina et al 2014 godfrey et al 2007 and topp et al 2006 all observed enhanced biodegradation of caffeine with increased oxygen supply in soil and aquatic environments in contrast de wilt et al 2018 found in their column experiments that caffeine was degraded under all tested redox conditions including nitrate and sulfate reducing conditions as displayed in figs 1 and 2 caffeine degradation in our experiments clearly coincided with the occurrence of oxic conditions however the inset of caffeine biodegradation did not occur immediately with rising do concentrations but after a lag time the duration of the lag time was estimated to be around 5 7 days in vb 8 days in gb and 17 18 days in g1 de wilt et al 2018 found that under aerobic and nitrate reducing conditions comparable to our study the lag phase for caffeine degradation lasted 27 days in contrast hebig et al 2017 observed an almost immediate removal of caffeine in their column experiments when organic carbon was present in the substrate as described in section 2 4 we divided the gb column experiment into periods of similar redox conditions presence of oxygen and or nitrate in order to capture the temporally varying caffeine biodegradation degradation coefficients were then estimated by successively fitting them for each period the range of estimated caffeine biodegradation rates in gb is given in table 2 for the g1 experiment the estimated degradation coefficient was readjusted for the period after the adaption phase in general it was a challenge to capture the temporal dynamics of caffeine sorption and biodegradation using cxtfit as a transport model other more refined modeling approaches might be recommendable for future studies taking into account variable chemical and biological boundary conditions 3 2 3 antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole transport behavior of antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole hardly differed from the conservative tracer in both sediments when five compounds were injected simultaneously retardation coefficients around 1 degradation coefficients close to 0 regardless of occurring redox conditions a low affinity to sorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole was confirmed by alidina et al 2014 and kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 a low potential for degradation of these two compounds was found by a variety of studies amy and drewes 2007 gauthier et al 2008 lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 radke and maier 2014 regnery et al 2015 zero degradation was observed for antipyrine by pieper et al 2010 in a bioreactor experiment overall those three compounds exhibit a low potential for natural attenuation and thus an increased contamination risk 3 3 comparison of long term and pulse injection experiments experiments of kiecak et al 2020 comprised mostly the same sediments compounds and column set up as presented here instead of steady long term injection pulse injections were conducted at different flow rates with injection durations between 9 7 and 23 h g sediment and 16 to 51 3 h v sediment transport parameters obtained from both pulse and long term injection experiments are compared in fig 4 there is general agreement in the low retardation of all compounds in g sediment as well as of antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in g and v sediment low degradation rates of antipyrine in both sediments as well as low degradation of atenolol and carbamazepine in the g sediment where found in both studies however differences were observed in caffeine degradation in g sediment with biotic conditions where degradation rates varied across a large range in the long term experiments due to the occurrence of different redox conditions from oxic to nitrate reducing under oxic conditions caffeine degradation was estimated to be stronger in the long term experiments but it was found to be equal or even smaller under nitrate reducing conditions the pulse injection experiments also suggested considerably greater degradation rates for atenolol in v sediment whereas atenolol retardation coefficients were lower than obtained from the corresponding long term experiment thus atenolol removal was estimated to be more a sorption process in the long term experiments where it had been classified as degradation process in the pulse injection experiment similarly caffeine retardation was estimated to be larger in the long term injection experiments than in the pulse injection experiments it is possible that the duration of pulse injection experiments might not be long enough to capture the plateau concentrations of compounds in a sediment where they are subject to strong retardation 3 4 interaction effects on sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in g1 where caffeine was the only injected compound it was degraded after approx 120 t t0 420 h fig 5 while redox conditions remained oxic caffeine was entirely depleted from this point on until the end of the experiment in the complementary g2 experiment where caffeine was injected simultaneously with sulfamethoxazole the latter was degraded Î¼ 0 69 d 1 this was in contrast to the gb column experiment with five compounds sulfamethoxazole degradation was thus enhanced when fewer degradable compounds were present at the same time caffeine degradation was strongly impaired in g2 we may hypothesize that caffeine degradation was affected in the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole for instance liu et al 2009 observed low toxic effects of certain antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole on soil microbial activity similarly nÃ¤slund et al 2008 found that the biodegradation of organic pollutants in marine sediments was inhibited in the presence of antibiotics in our study however results of the gb and vb column experiments suggested that sulfamethoxazole did not suppress the biodegradation of caffeine in g2 anoxic conditions established early in the experiment see fig s3 in the supplementary details which might be the cause for reduced caffeine degradation in comparison to g1 therefore we conclude that low concentrations in do rather than inhibition by the antibiotic led to the strongly reduced caffeine degradation overall from the results of this study we cannot clearly determine to what extent redox conditions required adaption time or the presence of sulfamethoxazole contributed to the reduction of caffeine degradation in g2 as compared to g1 further research would be required to shed more light on the effects of antibiotics on the degradation of groundwater pollutants 3 5 methodological notes strong variations in dissolved oxygen do and nitrate concentrations could partly be traced back to varying concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon doc monitored in the column inflow and outflow since these variations were unrelated to pharmaceutical loads they were assumed to be due to varying amounts of residual methanol which was used as solvent for 2 out of 5 compounds methanol was attempted to be evaporated from a dry and clean 5 l schott bottle within 30 min under the fume hood before adding fresh groundwater however based on a follow up test we suggest an evaporation time of 4 5 h in order to make sure that methanol concentrations are negligible in this study an absolute maximum of 0 018 vol methanol was estimated to have remained in the solution if it was not evaporated at all the metabolization of methanol bound carbon possibly caused biological depletion of dissolved oxygen and nitrate cf anthony 1986 do was temporally depleted in all columns except for g1 where only caffeine was injected and which constituted the only experiment without the use of methanol as solvent therefore we suspect residual methanol in the feed water of the columns to be the main reason for strong variations in redox conditions in our experiments 4 conclusions the aim of our study was to investigate the long term transport behavior of five selected pharmaceuticals in different sediments discern biodegradation from abiotic processes and elucidate the effect of an antibiotic compound on an easier degradable compound when five selected compounds were injected simultaneously in the column experiments antipyrine carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole showed similar transport behavior as the conservative tracer in both sediments and under varying redox conditions during the entire duration of the experiments very low to no degradation or sorption were observed thus showing the low potential for natural attenuation and conservative transport for those compounds therefore we conclude that these compounds pose the highest contamination threat of the five compounds tested in this study atenolol and caffeine were depleted to varying extents atenolol was degraded independently of oxygen concentrations in g sediment where a clear difference in atenolol transport could be observed between the biotic and the control setting with inhibited microbial activity the removal process was therefore likely due to biodegradation rather than abiotic processes in v sediment sorption seemed to be the dominant atenolol removal process biodegradation of caffeine was found in the biotic settings of both sediments after a lag time of 120 to 420 h when enough dissolved oxygen was present when only caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were injected simultaneously sulfamethoxazole was degraded while caffeine degradation was reduced we assume that biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced when less other compounds were available the lower caffeine degradation in this experiment seemed to be influenced by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen rather than the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the effect of an antibiotic compound on the transport behavior of other pharmaceuticals remained unclear and requires further investigation intracellular atp concentrations atp itc were measured in outflow samples for estimating the amount of living cells and thus microbial activity in the columns the results suggested that entirely sterile conditions were not achieved in the abiotic control columns by adding the indicated amount of sodium azide however microbial activity was significantly reduced in the coarse sand sediment and was lowered in the sandy loam sediment this resulted in pronounced differences between biotic and control columns regarding caffeine degradation in both sediments and atenolol degradation in g sediment the correlation of caffeine degradation and enhanced atp itc concentrations further strengthened the assumption that caffeine was biologically degraded overall results of this study emphasize the effect on transport behavior of sediment

1453,pharmaceutically active compounds have increasingly been detected in groundwater worldwide despite constituting a risk for human health and ecosystems their fate in the environment has still not been exhaustively investigated this study characterizes the transport behavior of five selected pharmaceutically active compounds antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in two sediments coarse quartz sand and sandy loam using column experiments with long term injection of spiked groundwater transport parameters were estimated using an analytical reactive transport model when five selected compounds were injected simultaneously transport behavior of antipyrine carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were similar to the conservative tracer in both sediments and under varying redox conditions atenolol and caffeine were retarded significantly stronger in the sandy loam sediment than in the coarse quartz sand biodegradation of caffeine was observed in both sediments after an adaption period and depended on dissolved oxygen the identification of biodegradation processes was supported by monitoring of intracellular adenosine triphosphate atpitc as a measure for microbial activity atpitc was present in varying concentrations in all sediments and was highest when biodegradation of pharmaceuticals especially caffeine was observed when only caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were injected simultaneously sulfamethoxazole was degraded while caffeine degradation was reduced the latter seemed to be influenced by low concentrations in dissolved oxygen rather than the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole results of these experiments emphasize the impact on pharmaceutical sorption and bio degradation of sediment type and redox conditions as well as available time for microbial adaption and the combination of pharmaceuticals that are released together into groundwater keywords pharmaceuticals groundwater column experiments numerical modeling biodegradation 1 introduction newly developed organic compounds and their metabolites have been increasingly observed in the environment e g bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 Ã¶llers et al 2001 sui et al 2015 tang et al 2019 often referred to as eocs emerging organic compounds their fate in the environment remains largely unresolved kÃ¼mmerer 2009 lapworth et al 2012 an important subset of eocs are pharmaceutically active compounds scheytt et al 2004 stemming from untreated sewage effluents septic tanks hospital effluents as well as agriculture and livestock activities aus der beek et al 2016 lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 or illegitimate disposal of expired medication via toilets and waste gauthier et al 2008 ternes et al 2002 they enter aquatic systems in considerable concentrations lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 yamamoto et al 2009 potentially ending up in groundwater bexfield et al 2019 lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 sui et al 2015 considering the use of groundwater for drinking water supply its contamination with pharmaceuticals poses a risk to human health bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 bioactive effects can arise even at concentration levels of few ng l that have actually been detected in drinking water ericson et al 2002 wennmalm and gunnarsson 2005 besides immediate health risks e g elevated risk of cancer the increasing presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in groundwater is also likely to lead to a multiplication of antibiotic resistant bacteria andrade et al 2020 haack et al 2012 szekeres et al 2018 in contrast to pesticides pharmaceuticals have hardly been considered by legislators to date and they have only recently come in the focus of research understanding the fate of pharmaceuticals in aquifers allows determining their potential for natural attenuation this is of great interest in order to estimate their threat to ecosystems and human health as well as to set reasonable threshold values the potential for natural attenuation of most pharmaceutically active compounds is not sufficiently investigated greenhagen et al 2014 regnery et al 2017 for these reasons it is absolutely required to conduct environmental studies on pharmaceutical transport behavior lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 williams et al 2006 especially interactions between compounds are inadequately understood regnery et al 2017 the systematic assessment of transport processes however is difficult at complex field sites where boundary conditions cannot be controlled a proven alternative approach are laboratory investigations using flow through column experiments banzhaf and hebig 2016 they are supposed to reflect natural conditions of the saturated zone schaffer et al 2012 while conditions are easily controllable and the complexity of the domain under investigation is reduced so far column experiments have been conducted to study pharmaceutical transport under varying physico chemical conditions such as changes in ph schaffer et al 2012 redox conditions and temperature alidina et al 2015 burke et al 2014 and sediment properties greenhagen et al 2014 kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 the present study is built on research by kiecak et al 2020 who conducted laboratory column experiments with sediments from different study sites to examine transport parameters for selected pharmaceuticals at different flow rates one study site was the alluvial vistrenque aquifer in france where pharmaceutically active compounds occur in groundwater and surface water mainly stemming from waste water treatment plant effluents kiecak et al 2019 the sandy loam sediment from the vistrenque aquifer was investigated in our present study the selection of pharmaceuticals for this study was based on their occurrence at the field site in france and on their global relevance it includes the antiepileptic and antipsychotic drug carbamazepine the beta blocker atenolol the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the analgesic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug phenazone prior tradename antipyrine as well as the stimulant caffeine carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and caffeine are worldwide among the most frequently reported pharmaceutical compounds in the environment specifically in groundwater aus der beek et al 2016 bexfield et al 2019 sui et al 2015 the occurrence of atenolol and antipyrine is less frequent however both compounds have been detected in several environmental studies from countries all over the world aus der beek et al 2016 findings of kiecak et al 2020 showed that sorption processes in aquifer sediments are significant for the transport of several pharmaceutical compounds whereas flow rates turned out not to significantly influence transport behavior the type of sediment was identified to play a major role while their study provided important answers regarding the transport behavior of the listed pharmaceuticals biodegradation could not clearly be identified which raised further questions previous research has found strong indications that biodegradation plays a key role in the natural attenuation of pharmaceutically active compounds lam et al 2004 ternes et al 2002 xu et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2009 especially caffeine and atenolol are known to be degraded by microorganisms dash and gummadi 2010 godfrey et al 2007 koroÅ¡a et al 2020 a commonly applied method for the identification of biodegradation in column experiments is the use of an abiotic control in order to distinguish between biotic and abiotic processes this can be achieved for example by adding sodium azide to the feed water of the abiotic control column burke et al 2013 kiecak et al 2020 maeng et al 2011 or a combination of sodium azide and mercury chloride de wilt et al 2018 hamon et al 2014 martin et al 2018 or sodium azide and copper sulphate hillebrand et al 2013 and additionally by autoclaving of the sediment e g radke and maier 2014 however all of these methods threaten to have an undesired effect on sediment properties and experimental conditions the addition of the above mentioned biocidal compounds in too high concentrations might influence the sorption behavior of the organic compounds under investigation chefetz et al 2006 hillebrand et al 2013 martin et al 2018 vanderford et al 2011 other studies have shown that microbial activity might only be reduced instead of inhibited by application of sodium azide at a given concentration abel et al 2013 cabrol et al 2017 therefore it needs to be monitored if sodium azide in concentrations reported to not affect sorption of other compounds and as applied previously kiecak et al 2020 also is sufficient for creating abiotic conditions it further needs to be tested whether microbial communities in column experiments do in fact have enough time to adapt to the newly introduced compounds to start biodegradation when confronted with short pulse injection periods lag phases corresponding to adaption periods might be required for a change in the metabolic state of microorganisms which respond to changes in surrounding substrate conditions by activating new enzymatic pathways and repairing damaged cells especially microorganisms in nutrient poor conditions like in groundwater aquifers often suffer from cell damages when first encountering a new substrate barford et al 1982 wood et al 1995 lag phases for caffeine degradation of less than three days have been reported in several studies when degradation was actively enhanced li and mclachlan 2019 nayak et al 2012 pÃ©rez et al 2009 topp et al 2006 in column experiments of de wilt et al 2018 under aerobic to nitrate reducing conditions a lag phase of 27 days before caffeine degradation was observed for atenolol degradation li and mclachlan 2019 observed adaption periods of 15 28 days in incubation tests antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole have been found to be recalcitrant in many studies where degradation did not occur within the timeframe of the experiments benotti and brownawell 2009 li and mclachlan 2019 baumgarten et al 2011 found that the adaption period for sulfamethoxazole was not finished even after two years alidina et al 2014 on the other hand found that adaption of the microbial community did not play a significant role for the contaminant removal in their managed aquifer recharge setting overall little is still known about the role and duration of adaption periods for microbial degradation of pharmaceuticals in aquifers in this study long term laboratory column experiments with continuous injection of pharmaceuticals were carried out in order to examine the transport behavior of selected pharmaceuticals with focus on the identification and quantification of biodegradation providing more time for microorganisms to adapt to substrate conditions biological control parameters were measured in order to estimate microbial activity within the columns and to differentiate between sorption biotic and abiotic degradation redox conditions within the columns were not actively controlled instead the establishment of different redox conditions was monitored at the column outlets to get insight into interaction effects of pharmaceutical compounds an additional experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole on the biodegradation of caffeine as supposedly easier degradable compound 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up stainless steel columns were packed with sediments according to kiecak et al 2020 the two sediments selected for this study are in the following referred to as v and g sediment v sediment is a sandy loam from the vistrenque alluvial aquifer in france with 29 grain size fraction 0 063 mm cation exchange capacity of 2 48 cmolc kg a specific surface of 2 97 m2 g obtained from kiecak et al 2020 tc and toc fractions were 1 27 0 42 0 07 0 10 respectively sediment v was packed in columns va and vb g sediment is coarse technical quartz sand dorsilit nr 5f quarzsande gmbh germany with homogeneous grain size distribution of 1 2 mm cation exchange capacity of 0 07 cmolc kg and a specific surface of 0 25 m2 g obtained from kiecak et al 2020 since we expected low sorption for the technical quartzsand it was chosen as a reference to the v sediment the total carbon and total organic carbon fraction tc toc were measured with the toc 5050 shimadzu kyoto japan analyzer and are 0 07 0 10 and 0 00 0 00 respectively g sediment was packed in columns ga gb g1 and g2 after packing the columns were saturated with local groundwater hco3 ca mg water facies from neuherberg germany the used groundwater is geochemically similar to groundwater from the vistrenque aquifer from where the v sediment was sampled properties of the vistrenque groundwater from the sampling point caissargue can be found in kiecak et al 2019 local groundwater was chosen to be able to constantly provide fresh feed water for the columns in order to obtain a chemical equilibrium between substrate and feed water the sediment columns were flushed with pure groundwater for one month prior to the start of the experiments the ionic composition of the inflow and outflow after equilibration are given in the supplementary s2 during both equilibration and the experiments a peristaltic pump generated water flow from the bottom to the top of the columns at a constant flow rate although flow velocity had no impact on the transport behavior of pharmaceuticals in this sediment kiecak et al 2020 flow velocities typically found in such porous aquifers were chosen cf banzhaf and hebig 2016 with the start of each column experiment groundwater spiked with conservative tracers and pharmaceuticals as reactive tracers were continuously injected into the columns the abiotic control columns va and ga were additionally spiked with 50 mg l sodium azide according to kiecak et al 2019 and kiecak et al 2020 fraction samplers were used to obtain samples of the column outflow at defined time intervals hoses were sterile packaged before being implemented in the fraction collector the test tubes for the samples were steam sterilized before use a polystyrene construction served to protect the samples in the fraction collectors from possible effects of photolysis properties of the columns and the experimental set up are summarized in table 1 2 2 tracer solutions for long term injection stock solutions were created for the injection of pharmaceutical spiked groundwater using distilled water as solvent for antipyrine atenolol and caffeine whereas methanol was used for the less water soluble compounds carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole a detailed description of the chemicals used in the experiments can be found in kiecak et al 2019 in order to eliminate residues of methanol in the feed water the pipetted stock solution was evaporated from dry and clean 5 l schott bottles under the fume hood next groundwater was added to the bottles to create the feed water solutions fresh feed water solutions were regularly recreated to have constant supply for the long term experiments in order to establish water transport characteristics sodium chloride was added to the first injection volume for each column as a conservative tracer target concentrations were 0 18 mg l for pharmaceuticals similarly to concentrations used by banzhaf et al 2012 ensuring that concentrations in our samples can be measured directly and quantified precisely without the need for preconcentration and 80 mg l for chloride only in the first injection volume to the ga gb va and vb columns groundwater spiked with all 5 selected pharmaceuticals antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole was continuously injected where ga and va were the abiotic controls to g1 column groundwater spiked with caffeine only was injected to g2 column feed water spiked with caffeine and sulfamethoxazole was injected the total duration of the injections is given in table 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pharmaceutical concentrations uhplc ms ms measurements pharmaceutical concentrations in inflow and outflow samples were analyzed using

groundwater input solutions and samples were additionally measured employing a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a kyoto japan redox conditions within the columns were not actively controlled or manipulated in this investigation in order to study conditions closer to natural conditions 2 3 3 biological control parameter adenosine triphosphate atp atp concentrations indirectly give information about the amount of cells in the water sample intracellular atp provides information on living cells crouch et al 1993 hammes et al 2010 in order to obtain this measure extracellular atp that is suspended freely in water was centrifuged out of the suspension intracellular atp concentrations were measured using the bioluminescent reaction of atp with luciferin catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase deluca and mcelroy 1978 lundin and thore 1975 mcelroy and deluca 1983 for this study the promega bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay was applied bioluminescence was measured as relative light units rlu using the glomax luminometer promega madison usa 2 4 numerical modeling numerical modeling of tracer breakthrough curves and estimation of transport parameters was performed using the stanmod software cxtfit 2 0 deterministic equilibrium and two site non equilibrium transport models based on the convection dispersion equation cde toride et al 1999 were tested to

of changing redox conditions or occurring lag phases in order to still get an approximated estimate in these cases we temporally divided the experiment according to occurring redox conditions and

compounds do concentrations ranged between 0 00 and 1 83 mg l in vb between 0 00 and 6 30 mg l in va between 0 02 and 5 98 mg l in gb between 0 08 and 7 45 mg l in ga between 0 76 and 8 12 mg l in g1 and between 0 00 and 5 62 mg l in g2 the variations in nitrate and do concentrations over time for all columns are displayed in the supplementary details s3 sulfate was not reduced at any point in any of the experiments microbial activity in the columns was estimated via measurements of intracellular atp atp itc in the outflow samples atp itc concentrations in all samples were greater than the background concentration in pure groundwater of 3 6e 04 Î¼g l in v columns atp itc concentrations in the biotic setting were greater than in the abiotic setting range of 1 5e 02 1 5e 00 Î¼g l and mean of 2 1e 01 Î¼g l in vb vs a range of 1 4e 02 6 1e 01 and mean of 1 4e 01 Î¼g l in va but not on a statistically significant level welch two sample t test df 14 52 p 0 61 in g columns the concentrations in the biotic setting were significantly greater than in the abiotic setting welch two sample t test df 10 96 p 0 05 with a range of 1 5e 02 5 0e 01 Î¼g l and a mean concentration of 1 4e 01 Î¼g l in gb and a range of 4 1e 03 1 1e 01 Î¼g l and mean of 3 2e 02 Î¼g l in ga these results suggest that adding the indicated amount of sodium azide to the feed water was significantly but not fully inhibiting microbial activity in ga coarse sand while it was not sufficient in the more fine grained sediment in va this corresponds to findings of martin et al 2018 according to which lower concentrations 50 mg l of sodium azide are effectively biocidal in a more sandy material in our investigation however this means we cannot fully consider the control columns va and ga to be free of biodegradation processes atp itc concentrations were generally lower in g1 and g2 columns where only one or two compounds were injected respectively the range was 9 8e 03 7 8e 02 Î¼g l for g1 only caffeine injected and 1 8e 02 3 3e 01 Î¼g l for g2 caffeine and sulfamethoxazole injected 3 2 breakthrough curves and long term transport parameters of pharmaceuticals the modeling results of all experiments are given in table 2 overall tendencies of the five selected compounds and two selected sediments for retardation were atenolol caffeine carbamazepine antipyrine sulfamethoxazole retardation was overall stronger in sandy loam sediment v than in coarse quartz sand g the general tendency for degradation of the compounds was atenolol sulfamethoxazole antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine was either almost completely removed under oxic conditions or hardly degraded under anoxic conditions since pharmaceutical concentrations detected in groundwater bodies are usually significantly lower than concentrations used in this laboratory study the modeled values as presented above might not be directly transferrable to field conditions however many laboratory tests for the exploration of biodegradation and sorption of organic contaminants in water sediment systems work with concentrations at the Î¼g l to mg l level kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 we can assume that our results still provide valuable information for the comparison of the behavior of the different compounds in the environment furthermore biodegradation rates of some compounds in this study are assumed to be redox dependent a range is given for caffeine biodegradation rates in gb where the lowest value was estimated for nitrate reducing conditions and the highest value for oxic conditions estimated first order degradation rates cannot exactly reflect the biodegradation process over time and distance as we do not know the spatial heterogeneity of microbial degradation activity or the occurrence of degradation hotspots within the columns the necessary simplification made here however still gives a valid estimation for the whole system under investigation and is similar to field studies where degradation coefficients are derived from measurements in wells the so estimated first order degradation coefficients are thus useful for describing and comparing a compound s biodegradability see regnery et al 2015 the transport behavior of the individual compounds in this investigation will be further described in the following sections the breakthrough and long term concentration curves for all five pharmaceuticals are displayed together with the variations in do and atp itc concentrations in fig 1 for vb and va columns and in fig 2 for gb and ga columns 3 2 1 atenolol atenolol was subject to sorption and retardation in both sediments but stronger in the v sediment figs 1 and 2 over the entire duration of the experiments the overall lowest recovery was found for atenolol in the v sediment fig 3 this sediment has a significant amount of clay and a greater specific surface of 2 97 m2 g compared to the g sediment 0 25 m2 g ionic sorption of the cationic compound atenolol to the negatively charged surface of clay minerals was assumed by martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 besides the clay fraction the higher carbon content in the v sediment likely enhanced sorption as compared to the g sediment kiecak et al 2019 found a correlation of carbon content in sediment with atenolol sorption a generally high sorption affinity of atenolol was observed by burke et al 2013 atenolol transport behavior in the v sediment was best simulated using a two site non equilibrium model which allowed accounting for two different sorption sites this resulted in a partitioning coefficient Î² describing the partitioning of the compound between the two sorption sites as a fraction of 0 52 and 0 45 in vb and va respectively and a mass transfer coefficient Ï 0 02 in both vb and va this suggests that atenolol was adsorbed to more than one ionic sorption site in the v sediment with a minor exchange between the sorption sites besides sorption atenolol was also subject to degradation in the v sediment however results from the vb and va column experiments did not allow to clearly determine whether this was in fact a result of biodegradation or rather abiotic degradation processes atenolol removal due to biodegradation was observed in the g sediment microbial activity was significantly higher in gb than in the control column ga this presumably resulted in the higher degradation rates implying that more biotransformation was observed in gb however irreversible sorption of atenolol taking place at the same time cannot be ruled out and might to some extent also be the reason for atenolol removal here in both sediments atenolol removal seemed to be independent from do concentrations 3 2 2 caffeine caffeine was subject to retardation in both sediments comparable to atenolol it was sorbed stronger in the v sediment the breakthrough curve of caffeine in v sediment was not captured properly by measurements and consequently by the model as slowly increasing caffeine concentrations in the beginning were followed by an abrupt increase to the plateau martÃ­nez hernÃ¡ndez et al 2014 assumed predominantly irreversible ionic sorption of the cationic compound caffeine to negatively charged surfaces of clay minerals which might have occurred in in the v sediment of our study too the dynamics of this process however could not be captured adequately by transport models implemented in cxtfit 2 0 therefore two equilibrium fitting scenarios were carried out a to all available data and b with improved fit to the plateau concentrations this resulted in two different retardation coefficients 2 6 1 6 in vb 2 5 1 1 in va for scenario a b respectively possibly referring to different sorption processes fig 1 solid and dashed yellow lines respectively we presumably observed biodegradation of caffeine in all biotic settings in the biotic settings vb and gb caffeine transport behavior was in strong contrast to the control columns va and ga figs 1 and 2 dropping caffeine concentrations were coinciding with an increase in atpitc concentrations indicating biological degradation biodegradation of caffeine is strongly depending on redox conditions the first enzymatic steps in the biological conversion of caffeine are the successful removal of three methyl groups which is catalyzed by oxidative demethylase enzymes glÃ¼ck and lingens 1987 middelhoven and lommen 1984 yamaoka yano and mazzafera 1999 a full caffeine degradation pathway by the common bacteria pseudomonas putida has been presented by yamaoka yano and mazzafera 1999 dash and gummadi 2010 found the process to be driven by a variety of microorganisms including klebsiella rhodococcus and algaligenes sp using n demethylase enzymes either as hydrolysis or as described before as an oxidation process rauch williams et al 2010 wood et al 1995 alidina et al 2014 godfrey et al 2007 and topp et al 2006 all observed enhanced biodegradation of caffeine with increased oxygen supply in soil and aquatic environments in contrast de wilt et al 2018 found in their column experiments that caffeine was degraded under all tested redox conditions including nitrate and sulfate reducing conditions as displayed in figs 1 and 2 caffeine degradation in our experiments clearly coincided with the occurrence of oxic conditions however the inset of caffeine biodegradation did not occur immediately with rising do concentrations but after a lag time the duration of the lag time was estimated to be around 5 7 days in vb 8 days in gb and 17 18 days in g1 de wilt et al 2018 found that under aerobic and nitrate reducing conditions comparable to our study the lag phase for caffeine degradation lasted 27 days in contrast hebig et al 2017 observed an almost immediate removal of caffeine in their column experiments when organic carbon was present in the substrate as described in section 2 4 we divided the gb column experiment into periods of similar redox conditions presence of oxygen and or nitrate in order to capture the temporally varying caffeine biodegradation degradation coefficients were then estimated by successively fitting them for each period the range of estimated caffeine biodegradation rates in gb is given in table 2 for the g1 experiment the estimated degradation coefficient was readjusted for the period after the adaption phase in general it was a challenge to capture the temporal dynamics of caffeine sorption and biodegradation using cxtfit as a transport model other more refined modeling approaches might be recommendable for future studies taking into account variable chemical and biological boundary conditions 3 2 3 antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole transport behavior of antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole hardly differed from the conservative tracer in both sediments when five compounds were injected simultaneously retardation coefficients around 1 degradation coefficients close to 0 regardless of occurring redox conditions a low affinity to sorption of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole was confirmed by alidina et al 2014 and kodeÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al 2015 a low potential for degradation of these two compounds was found by a variety of studies amy and drewes 2007 gauthier et al 2008 lÃ¶ffler et al 2005 radke and maier 2014 regnery et al 2015 zero degradation was observed for antipyrine by pieper et al 2010 in a bioreactor experiment overall those three compounds exhibit a low potential for natural attenuation and thus an increased contamination risk 3 3 comparison of long term and pulse injection experiments experiments of kiecak et al 2020 comprised mostly the same sediments compounds and column set up as presented here instead of steady long term injection pulse injections were conducted at different flow rates with injection durations between 9 7 and 23 h g sediment and 16 to 51 3 h v sediment transport parameters obtained from both pulse and long term injection experiments are compared in fig 4 there is general agreement in the low retardation of all compounds in g sediment as well as of antipyrine carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in g and v sediment low degradation rates of antipyrine in both sediments as well as low degradation of atenolol and carbamazepine in the g sediment where found in both studies however differences were observed in caffeine degradation in g sediment with biotic conditions where degradation rates varied across a large range in the long term experiments due to the occurrence of different redox conditions from oxic to nitrate reducing under oxic conditions caffeine degradation was estimated to be stronger in the long term experiments but it was found to be equal or even smaller under nitrate reducing conditions the pulse injection experiments also suggested considerably greater degradation rates for atenolol in v sediment whereas atenolol retardation coefficients were lower than obtained from the corresponding long term experiment thus atenolol removal was estimated to be more a sorption process in the long term experiments where it had been classified as degradation process in the pulse injection experiment similarly caffeine retardation was estimated to be larger in the long term injection experiments than in the pulse injection experiments it is possible that the duration of pulse injection experiments might not be long enough to capture the plateau concentrations of compounds in a sediment where they are subject to strong retardation 3 4 interaction effects on sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in g1 where caffeine was the only injected compound it was degraded after approx 120 t t0 420 h fig 5 while redox conditions remained oxic caffeine was entirely depleted from this point on until the end of the experiment in the complementary g2 experiment where caffeine was injected simultaneously with sulfamethoxazole the latter was degraded Î¼ 0 69 d 1 this was in contrast to the gb column experiment with five compounds sulfamethoxazole degradation was thus enhanced when fewer degradable compounds were present at the same time caffeine degradation was strongly impaired in g2 we may hypothesize that caffeine degradation was affected in the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole for instance liu et al 2009 observed low toxic effects of certain antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole on soil microbial activity similarly nÃ¤slund et al 2008 found that the biodegradation of organic pollutants in marine sediments was inhibited in the presence of antibiotics in our study however results of the gb and vb column experiments suggested that sulfamethoxazole did not suppress the biodegradation of caffeine in g2 anoxic conditions established early in the experiment see fig s3 in the supplementary details which might be the cause for reduced caffeine degradation in comparison to g1 therefore we conclude that low concentrations in do rather than inhibition by the antibiotic led to the strongly reduced caffeine degradation overall from the results of this study we cannot clearly determine to what extent redox conditions required adaption time or the presence of sulfamethoxazole contributed to the reduction of caffeine degradation in g2 as compared to g1 further research would be required to shed more light on the effects of antibiotics on the degradation of groundwater pollutants 3 5 methodological notes strong variations in dissolved oxygen do and nitrate concentrations could partly be traced back to varying concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon doc monitored in the column inflow and outflow since these variations were unrelated to pharmaceutical loads they were assumed to be due to varying amounts of residual methanol which was used as solvent for 2 out of 5 compounds methanol was attempted to be evaporated from a dry and clean 5 l schott bottle within 30 min under the fume hood before adding fresh groundwater however based on a follow up test we suggest an evaporation time of 4 5 h in order to make sure that methanol concentrations are negligible in this study an absolute maximum of 0 018 vol methanol was estimated to have remained in the solution if it was not evaporated at all the metabolization of methanol bound carbon possibly caused biological depletion of dissolved oxygen and nitrate cf anthony 1986 do was temporally depleted in all columns except for g1 where only caffeine was injected and which constituted the only experiment without the use of methanol as solvent therefore we suspect residual methanol in the feed water of the columns to be the main reason for strong variations in redox conditions in our experiments 4 conclusions the aim of our study was to investigate the long term transport behavior of five selected pharmaceuticals in different sediments discern biodegradation from abiotic processes and elucidate the effect of an antibiotic compound on an easier degradable compound when five selected compounds were injected simultaneously in the column experiments antipyrine carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole showed similar transport behavior as the conservative tracer in both sediments and under varying redox conditions during the entire duration of the experiments very low to no degradation or sorption were observed thus showing the low potential for natural attenuation and conservative transport for those compounds therefore we conclude that these compounds pose the highest contamination threat of the five compounds tested in this study atenolol and caffeine were depleted to varying extents atenolol was degraded independently of oxygen concentrations in g sediment where a clear difference in atenolol transport could be observed between the biotic and the control setting with inhibited microbial activity the removal process was therefore likely due to biodegradation rather than abiotic processes in v sediment sorption seemed to be the dominant atenolol removal process biodegradation of caffeine was found in the biotic settings of both sediments after a lag time of 120 to 420 h when enough dissolved oxygen was present when only caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were injected simultaneously sulfamethoxazole was degraded while caffeine degradation was reduced we assume that biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced when less other compounds were available the lower caffeine degradation in this experiment seemed to be influenced by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen rather than the presence of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the effect of an antibiotic compound on the transport behavior of other pharmaceuticals remained unclear and requires further investigation intracellular atp concentrations atp itc were measured in outflow samples for estimating the amount of living cells and thus microbial activity in the columns the results suggested that entirely sterile conditions were not achieved in the abiotic control columns by adding the indicated amount of sodium azide however microbial activity was significantly reduced in the coarse sand sediment and was lowered in the sandy loam sediment this resulted in pronounced differences between biotic and control columns regarding caffeine degradation in both sediments and atenolol degradation in g sediment the correlation of caffeine degradation and enhanced atp itc concentrations further strengthened the assumption that caffeine was biologically degraded overall results of this study emphasize the effect on transport behavior of sediment

1454,the presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is a known problem worldwide paracetamol is widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic its high consumption implies a continuous discharge in aqueous environments through industrial and domestic wastewater that requires mitigation and remediation strategies the aim of the present study was to analyse the removal of the paracetamol from aqueous solutions using the adsorption technique for this three commercial adsorbents with different textural properties were used two activated carbons cat and carbopal and silica gel a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted at different values of ph 3 0 7 0 and 10 5 and ionic strength 0 01 0 5 and 1 m to investigate the effects on the removal of paracetamol from the aqueous solution in addition we investigated the adsorption mechanism using the density functional theory adsorption was found to be higher in the acidic ph range as varying ph showed significant influence on the surface charge of the adsorbents and degree of ionization of the paracetamol adsorption capacity of the adsorbents increased with an increase in the ionic strength of solution at 25 c ph 3 ionic strength 1 m 167 mg l 1 of adsorbent and initial concentrations of paracetamol between 25 and 150 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was 560 mg g 1 450 mg g 1 and 95 mg g 1 for cat carbopal and silica respectively the experimental kinetic data fitted well the pseudo second order model and the equilibrium isotherm data the langmuir model the functional density theory methods provided atomistic details about paracetamol adsorbed on the surface of carbon and silica through molecular modeling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords paracetamol adsorption carbon silica gel 1 introduction in recent years development of new and more sensitive methods of analysis has alerted about the presence of residues of drugs pharmaceuticals veterinary personal care food additives pesticides and other contaminants in water these emerging contaminants reach the environment through domestic and industrial wastewater waste from treatment plants hospital effluents etc elimination of this pollutants has become one of the greatest environmental concerns because of the impact they have on human health and the harmful effects they generate on nature lapworth et al 2012 emerging pollutants are generally not biodegradable and are often not eliminated using conventional primary secondary and tertiary wastewater treatments based on biological physical and chemical processes buttiglieri and knepper 2007 gogoi et al 2018 wang and wang 2016 when purification processes fail to eliminate them they reach lakes rivers and sometimes drinkable water networks paracetamol n 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide also known as acetaminophen is one of the most widely used analgesic and antipyretic worldwide due to its high stability solubility and hydrophilicity it has been detected in surface waters wastewater and drinking water throughout the world birch et al 2015 oulton et al 2010 kolpin et al 2002 main technologies and conventional treatments capable of eliminating this class of substances include aerobic degradation wu et al 2012 coagulation flocculation teh et al 2016 electrolysis chen et al 2012 ozonation gogate and pandit 2004 photo fenton process rad et al 2015 and filtration with nanomembranes bhattacharya 2006 this kind of treatments in general are not enough for the removal of these contaminants and many of them persist without any alteration after treatment in this context developing selective processes that are effective when small quantities of pollutant are present is essential adsorption is one of the most efficient promising and widely used techniques in wastewater treatment processes some of its advantages are low cost simple operation and implementation applicability at very low concentrations possibility of regeneration and reuse and the possibility of using adsorbent materials from different origins several conditions like ionic strength ph and temperature can be changed in order to make this process as efficient as possible saleh and al absi 2017 tuzen et al 2018 moreover synthesis characterization and evaluation of new adsorbents has become one of the most promising fields to expand this study efficiency and facility of removal are factors that need to be constantly improved saleh and ali 2018 saleh et al 2019 saleh 2015 abubakar sani et al 2016 spaltro et al 2018 the aim of this work is to determine experimentally the influence of ionic strength ph and adsorbent surface chemical composition on paracetamol adsorption from aqueous solution using three adsorbents which are thoroughly studied too two activated carbons with different physicochemical properties and one type of commercial silica gel were used all of them are easily eliminated by filtration the effect of ionic strength and initial ph in the adsorption capability of the compound was determined from the adsorption isotherms in addition the interactions that aromatic structural type exerts in the adsorption process on silica and carbon were studied through the analysis of electronic properties such as density of state and charge density using dft calculations 2 materials and methods paracetamol was supplied by sigma aldrich at purity analytical grade higher than 99 table 1 shows relevant physicochemical properties activated carbon were hydrogen sulfide cat ox 4 mm pellet activated carbon umi 2000 and carbopal mb 4s donau hereafter called cat and carbopal respectively silica grace davison grade 62 60 200 mesh was used the surface structure parameters were calculated from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 195 8 c carried out in an automatic volumetric apparatus asap 2020 from micromeritics the specific surface area sbet was calculated using the bet method at p p0 0 209 the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at relatively pressure of p p0 0 988 was employed to determine the total pore volume vtot the micropore surface area smic and external surface area sext as well as the micropore volume vmic were evaluated using the t plot method the mean pore diameter dp was calculated as dp 4 vtot sbet the pore size distribution was derived from the bet furthermore the samples were chemically characterized the type and amount of surface oxygen groups were determined by boehm titration as well as by temperature programmed desorption tpd basics groups were quantified by boehm s titration while the ph of point zero charge phpzc was determined by mass titration as indicated in our previous works spaltro et al 2019 delgado et al 2019 2 1 adsorption isotherms batch adsorption studies were carried out in a thermostatic bath at 25 c with orbital shaking at 250 rpm adding 5 mg of dried adsorbent material to 30 ml of aqueous solutions with different initial concentrations 25 150 mg l 1 of paracetamol the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption was investigated using nacl 0 01 0 50 and 1 m to prepare paracetamol solutions and adding a 0 1 m hcl solution until ph 3 no buffer solutions were used in order to avoid possible formation of precipitates or competition with the solute in the adsorption process the effect of solution ph on paracetamol adsorption was investigated regulating ph at 3 7 and 10 5 by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions prior to the addition of the adsorbent in all cases samples were shaken for 24 h finding that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within this time under all the tested operation conditions aliquots were taken from the system filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filter and examined using uv vis spectroscopy initial and equilibrium concentrations were determined in a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1203 at 245 nm where paracetamol has an adsorption maximum the calibration curve was adjusted using a linear regression analysis each experiment was performed by triplicate and the results were averaged to reduce experimental errors or some random error an equilibrium isotherm expresses the relationship between the amount of removed adsorbate from solution by unit of mass of adsorbent at constant temperature at equilibrium the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 was calculated according the eq 1 1 q e c o c e v w where c 0 and c e mg l 1 are the liquid phase concentrations of paracetamol at initial and equilibrium time respectively v is the solution volume in litres and w is the weight of the adsorbent in grams adsorption isotherms describe how adsorbates interact with adsorbents and so are critical in optimizing the use of adsorbents thus the correlation of equilibrium data by either theoretical or empirical equations is essential for practical design and operation of adsorption systems to establish the most appropriate correlations for experimental equilibrium data the two most common isothermal models langmuir and freundlich were tested kumar 2016 zhou et al 2020 the langmuir model is applicable to homogeneous adsorption processes where the adsorbent surface is uniform that is all adsorption sites are equivalent there is no interactions between adsorbed species and only monolayer formation is possible the linear expression of langmuir isotherm model can be illustrated as eq 2 2 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q e and q m are equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 respectively c e is the paracetamol concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 and k l is the langmuir constant l mg 1 directly related to the affinity and the force with which an adsorbate molecule is retained on the surface of the solid plotting ce q e against c e it is possible to obtain the value of the langmuir constant k l and q m freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that is not limited to the monolayer coverage but also describes the multilayer adsorption and further contemplates heterogeneous surfaces the linear form of freundlich model can be expressed by eq 3 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the equilibrium constant and n is a parameter related to the intensity of the adsorption this constant n is also related to the affinity distribution where the higher the value of n the greater the energy distribution in the case that n 1 the adsorption process follows henry s law the plots of ln q e against ln c e gives a linear graph with slope 1 n and intercept ln k f 2 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetic study was carried out with a total contact time of 24 h by adding 83 mg of the adsorbent to 500 ml of 150 mg l 1 paracetamol solution 1 m nacl adjusting the ph at 7 experiments were performed in a thermostatic bath at 25 c with orbital shaking at 250 rpm at various intervals portions of the suspensions were separated using 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filters concentrations were monitored using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 245 nm all experiments were performed in triplicate the amount of paracetamol adsorbed q t mg g 1 at time t min was calculated by eq 1 pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and elovich model were adopted to interpret the kinetic adsorption mechanism zhang et al 2019 song et al 2017 somsesta et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the linear using pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations are presented in table 2 where q e is the adsorption capacities at equilibrium mg g 1 q t is the adsorption capacities at time t mg g 1 k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 Î± is the rate of chemisorption at zero coverage mg g 1 min 1 and Î² is the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption g mg 1 2 3 computational study as the solution ph can exert a significant influence on paracetamol adsorption a computational study was also carried out to obtain more information to the adsorption process gaussian 09 software was used to perform the theoretical calculations geometry optimizations were made using the dft method with the b3lyp functional and 6 311g d p basis set frisch et al 2010 the electronic charges and the density of states for paracetamol molecule adsorbed on carbonaceous and silica materials were calculated 3 results and discussion activated carbon has a varied surface chemistry which in addition to its acid base properties can generate positive or negative surface charges depending on the ph of the solution the combined influence of all functional groups determines phpzc i e in which the net surface charge on carbon is neutral it is known that net charge on carbon surface is positive at a solution ph lower than that corresponding to phpzc of the surface due to protonation of basic groups and is negative at a solution ph higher than phpzc because of the deprotonation of functional groups therefore it is very important to know the surface charge of the material in aqueous media especially in adsorption studies since it is not only the surface area that will determine the adsorption capacity table 3 summarizes the relevant values related to textural and surface chemical properties of the adsorbents used silica surfaces are usually covered with a layer of silanols and siloxane groups no other functional groups are present so chemical characterization was not performed the low phpzc value observed for carbopal could be attributed to an increase in the amount of oxygen on the surface due to the presence of acid groups and according to boehm s titration most of these acid groups are phenolic in addition carbopal had the highest number of basic groups through the titration it was also determined cat has the largest number of carboxylic acid groups the morphological characterization of commercial carbons has been examined by scanning electron microscope sem fig 1 shown the sem images corresponding to carbonaceous materials cat and carbopal it is observed that the structure is not uniform or ordered 3 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption process is influenced by electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate therefore ph modifications may generate changes in the adsorbate structure and adsorbent physicochemical properties 3 1 1 effect of ionic strength ionic strength is an important factor in the study of aqueous phase equilibrium isotherms were obtained with three different concentrations of nacl solution 0 01 0 50 and 1 00 m figs 2 4 show adsorption isotherms of paracetamol on cat carbopal and silica at different ionic strength is the effect of the ionic strength modification is significant the greater the ionic strength the greater the amount of paracetamol adsorbed when using cat as an adsorbent the adsorption of paracetamol decreased from 550 mg g 1 to 390 mg g 1 30 with a decrease in ionic strength from 1 00 to 0 50 m when ionic strength decreased to 0 01 m adsorption decreased to 290 mg g 1 almost half with respect to that obtained for the 1 m solution when using carbopal as an adsorbent the variation in adsorption capacity by modifying the ionic strength is not so noticeable it went from 445 mg g 1 to 415 mg g 1 7 decrease as the ionic strength decreased from 1 00 to 0 50 m it was reduced to 320 mg g 1 for a 0 01 m ionic strength 28 decrease using silica gel as adsorbent values obtained for the adsorption capacity are much lower than for carbons and the effect of the ionic strength is very remarkable the adsorption capacity was reduced from 95 to 73 mg g 1 23 by changing the ionic strength from 1 m to 0 5 m and decreased to 38 mg g 1 60 less by reducing ionic strength to 0 01 m the increased adsorption of paracetamol onto these carbonaceous adsorbents with increase in ionic strength could also be due to the decrease in solubility of drug in salt solution commonly characterized as salting out effect arafat et al 1999 na and cl ions from dissociation of nacl in water are strongly solvated by water molecules forming large hydration spheres these water molecules will have restricted mobility and will be less able to interact with paracetamol molecules therefore solubility of paracetamol in the solution decreases and its diffusion towards the adsorbent surface is favoured it is often assumed that a material with a larger total surface area has more pronounced adsorptive properties and will therefore perform better however when comparing the two analyzed carbons a higher adsorption capacity was obtained for cat which has a lower sbet than carbopal table 3 this difference in adsorbent efficiency is attributed to the fact that cat has a greater number of micropores in this carbon vmicro represents 38 of vt while in carbopal vmicro represents only 3 2 of vt the structure of pores can significantly affect adsorption kinetics the three main types of interactions between paracetamol and the surface of an activated carbon are the formation of hydrogen bonds the Ï Ï dispersion interaction and the formation of the electron donor acceptor complex the Ï Ï interaction is strengthened when adsorption takes place on smaller micropores as a micropore filler this is due to the enhanced adsorption potential that occurs on neighboring graphene walls on the contrary it is postulated that donor acceptor complex formation occurs in broader micropores and mesopores lorenc grabowska 2016 therefore the pore size distribution is a determining factor in the adsorption capacity of the analyzed carbons rather than the specific surface area at ph 3 paracetamol is in its neutral form and both carbons are positively charged but the number of basic groups that can be protonated at this ph value is much higher in the case of carbopal table 3 this higher positive charge could also affect the adsorption process considering that active sites of the carbon decrease due to the protonation of basic groups pyrones chromenes graphene layers acting as lewis bases and forming electron donor acceptor complexes with h2o molecules or amino groups adsorption capacity for paracetamol on silica was found to be lower than those of activated carbons this is explained by the smaller specific surface area and the absence of a rich surface chemistry that favours the interaction with the adsorbate at ph 3 the silica is protonated and the existence of surface groups sioh2 and undissociated paracetamol favours hydrogen bond type interactions or the formation of an electron donor acceptor complex there are no electrostatic attractions that favour adsorption as in the case of activated carbons by increasing the ionic strength there was an increase of the adsorption capacity for silica due to salting out effect 3 1 2 effect of ph it is well known that ph affects the ionization state of a weak electrolyte this is the case of paracetamol with pka 9 and charges that may appear on the surface of the adsorbent figs 5 7 show the paracetamol adsorption isotherms at different ph values using 167 mg l 1 adsorbent and initial pharmaceutical concentration ranging between 25 and 150 mg l 1 in these experiments temperature was maintained at 25 c and ionic strength was kept constant by adding 1 m nacl solution fig 5 shows adsorption isotherm on cat at different ph values both activated carbons and silica have surface groups that can be protonated or deprotonated at different ph values the surface sites associated with functional groups represent a small proportion of the total surface area however small variations in the chemical nature of adsorbent may produce important changes in its adsorption capacity in general adsorption of phenolic compounds onto carbonaceous materials is much higher at low ph values than at high ones lazo cannata et al 2011 at ph phpzc carbon surface becomes positively charged favouring the adsorption of anionic species on the other hand adsorption of cationic species will be favoured at ph phpzc when the carbon is negatively charged weak electrolytes such as paracetamol can exist in both ionized and nonionized forms depending on the solution ph taking into account that the pka of paracetamol is 9 3 it follows that both at ph 3 and at ph 7 the drug will be present mainly in its non ionized form while at ph 11 the deprotonated form is the predominant one interaction between each form and the adsorbent surface may favour or disfavor the adsorption process depending on the magnitude of the attraction or repulsion forces alade et al 2019 when carbopal phpzc 4 76 is used as adsorbent in aqueous solution at ph 3 its surface is on average positively charged under these conditions paracetamol will be in its neutral undissociated form and adsorption would be carried out mainly by Ï Ï interactions between Ï electrons of the aromatic ring of the paracetamol molecules and Ï electrons of the carbon graphene layer also hydrogen bonding can take place at ph 7 the surface of carbopal is negatively charged and paracetamol is mainly undissociated so again the dominant interactions would not be electrostatic but rather those of Ï Ï dispersion between the aromatic rings at ph 10 5 the surface of carbopal is negatively charged and paracetamol is mainly in its ionized deprotonated form so that electrostatic adsorbate adsorbent interactions will be repulsive and the adsorption capacity of paracetamol by carbon decreases in the case of cat phpzc 7 46 at ph 3 it is positively charged and paracetamol is in its neutral form so the dominant interactions will be Ï Ï stacking between aromatic moieties from carbon and paracetamol and hydrogen bonding at ph 7 carbon will be almost neutral like paracetamol so the dominant interactions will not be electrostatic however at ph 10 5 both the carbon surface and the paracetamol are negatively charged so electrostatic interactions will be repulsive resulting in a lower adsorption capacity at this ph value as discussed before at ph 3 cat had a higher adsorption capacity this could be explained by considering that or carbopal has a greater number of basic groups which when protonated suppress paracetamol adsorption at these sites comparing qmax at ph 3 cat adsorbs 10 more than carbopal at ph 7 paracetamol is the lower adsorption capacity of carbopal can be explained by the negative charge that its surface shows exhibits while cat at this ph value is practically neutral phpzc 7 46 the difference in qmax at this ph is almost 9 at ph 10 5 the adsorption capacity is the same for both carbons which supports the previous explanations as neither of the two differences mentioned occurs at this ph both as carbons as paracetamol are negatively charged so the interactions will be repulsive adsorption will occur to a lesser extent than at other phs and due to non electrostatic interactions adsorption isotherms at ph 3 and 1 m ionic strength on the three adsorbents are in fig 8 as an example all of them fitted to freundlich and langmuir characteristic parameters were determined from the respective linear form and they are shown in table 4 in all cases correlation coefficient r2 shows that langmuir model is the one which best fit to experimental data in addition the theoretical q m values derived from langmuir model are more consistent with experimental adsorption amount further indicate the validity of langmuir model to describe the isotherm adsorption of paracetamol the fact that langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data very well suggests the monolayer coverage of paracetamol onto adsorbent particles 3 2 kinetics of paracetamol adsorption the evolution of the concentration of paracetamol as a function of time is shown in fig 9 in the three materials studied the adsorption was rapid during the first 200 min and then gradually decreased reaching equilibrium at approximately 800 min adsorption kinetics of paracetamol on the three adsorbents with corresponding adjustments to the three kinetic models pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and elovich model can be found in supplementary material table 5 shows the parameters obtained in adjustments with its respective correlation coefficient for pseudo first order and elovich kinetic models experimental data deviates from linearity see also supplementary material therefore the pseudo first order and elovich models are inapplicable for current systems the elovich equation is known to describe chemisorption well so the low correlation coefficient indicates little relevant chemical interaction for the three systems on the contrary correlation coefficient and q e value that were determined from the pseudo second order model are in good agreement with the experimental data this would indicate that the limiting step in the adsorption process would be the transfer of the adsorptive mass from the solution to the adsorbent surface 3 3 computational dft study optimized chemical structures of paracetamol adsorbed on activated carbon and silica are shown in fig 10 the electrostatic potential energy map shows the charge distributions in the isolated paracetamol and makes it possible to visualize the differently charged regions in the molecule a strong negative potential occurs around c o and oh groups presented in paracetamol these two areas are in opposition to the remaining slightly positive part of the molecule the adsorption of paracetamol from aqueous solution is mainly due to interactions between the functional groups in the drug structure and the groups on the solid adsorbent surface on the other hand the effect of ph on the adsorbate adsorbent interactions and charge distribution on these groups has significant effects on the adsorption capacity additional knowledge about charge distributions can be helpful to explain how molecule interacts with adsorbent surfaces possible changes in the distribution of electron density are considered to compare their electronic structures after adsorption see fig 11 and table 6 as we can see all changes are small and this agrees with a physical adsorption process on the other hand major changes are produced on atoms of amido nh c o and hydroxyl oh groups of paracetamol molecule in bold table 6 the formation of an electron acceptor donor complex is possible between groups with free electron pairs such as the carbon rings activated carbon or silanol oxygens silica and electronegative atoms nitrogen and oxygen in paracetamol molecule at low and neutral ph paracetamol molecule exists as neutral specie the neutral molecule presents low electronic density and it can be attributed mainly to the carbonyl group see fig 11 a at ph values greater than 10 the anionic form of paracetamol predominates regions with high electronic density are located on amido group and in addition on methyl group see fig 11 b the interaction of ionized and non ionized species with the solid surface may favour or disfavor the adsorption process when forces of attraction or repulsion prevail respectively i e the decrease increase in the adsorption capacity can be related to the same different sign in the interacting species charge when adsorption occurs at low neutral ph the positive neutral adsorbents may attract the highest electronic charges of the neutral paracetamol molecule located in the nh c o and c oh groups paracetamol charges may be weakly attracted to carbon rings activated carbon and silanol superficial groups silica trough physical adsorption the density of states for paracetamol molecule adsorbed on carbonaceous and silica materials can be seen in fig 12 in those graphs we can observe regions where the molecule and surface states have the possibility to overlap paracetamol adsorption energies are similar in all cases being 2 12 ev for activated carbon and 1 85 ev for silica confirming the physical nature of the molecule surface interaction the paracetamol molecule has two proton acceptor and donor groups that favour hydrogen bond formation with silica surface the shortest contacts between the oxygen atoms of paracetamol and the framework hydrogen atoms of silica oh distances are 2 44 Ã¥ and 2 81 Ã¥ respectively on the other hand the shortest contact between the nitrogen atom of paracetamol and the framework hydrogen atom of silica nh distance is 2 94 Ã¥ at higher ph interactions between the molecule and the silica are minimal due to the repulsion between the negatively charged paracetamol and the deprotonated silanols in such case physisorption is less significant in magnitude 1 26 ev as previously stated the adsorption process of paracetamol is strictly influenced by electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate therefore ph changes in the medium can change in the adsorbate structure and the adsorbent physicochemical properties in resume the different mechanisms of adsorption of paracetamol on carbonaceous materials are dispersive interactions by Ï electrons donor acceptor electron complexes and hydrogen bond formation whereas for silica gel only the last two are possible 4 conclusions a the ability to remove paracetamol in aqueous solutions was evaluated using three adsorbents resulting in the following decreasing order cat carbopal silica b the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents was strongly influenced by ph and ion strength in solution paracetamol adsorption is disfavoured for ph value that determines a simultaneous negative charge of the adsorbent ph phpzc and high ionization degree of the adsorbate ph pka hence in this study the ph of 3 is selected as the optimum ph on paracetamol adsorption furthermore it was found that high values of ionic strength favour adsorption thus at 25 c ph 3 ionic strength 1 m 167 mg l 1 of adsorbent and initial concentrations of paracetamol between 25 and 150 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was 560 mg g 1 450 mg g 1 and 95 mg g 1 for cat carbopal and silica respectively the greatest changes were observed in activated carbons due to the alteration of their surface chemistry according to the ph of the aqueous solution c dft calculations showed good correlation with experimental results providing atomistic details through molecular modeling d paracetamol charges may be weakly attracted to carbon rings activated carbon and silanol superficial groups silica trough physical adsorption e the use of kinetic models showed that paracetamol adsorption follows pseudo second order adsorption kinetics langmuir model was appropriate to describe the isotherm adsorption which illustrated the adsorption was carried out by monolayer behaviour f adsorption experiments over amorphous silica and the two carbonaceous materials showed that their adsorption capacities are adequate for the removal of this emerging contaminant present in water with silica being less effective than activated carbons the results obtained could be extended to chemically similar compounds with the subsequent potential application in the treatment of water contaminated with paracetamol

1454,the presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is a known problem worldwide paracetamol is widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic its high consumption implies a continuous discharge in aqueous environments through industrial and domestic wastewater that requires mitigation and remediation strategies the aim of the present study was to analyse the removal of the paracetamol from aqueous solutions using the adsorption technique for this three commercial adsorbents with different textural properties were used two activated carbons cat and carbopal and silica gel a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted at different values of ph 3 0 7 0 and 10 5 and ionic strength 0 01 0 5 and 1 m to investigate the effects on the removal of paracetamol from the aqueous solution in addition we investigated the adsorption mechanism using the density functional theory adsorption was found to be higher in the acidic ph range as varying ph showed significant influence on the surface charge of the adsorbents and degree of ionization of the paracetamol adsorption capacity of the adsorbents increased with an increase in the ionic strength of solution at 25 c ph 3 ionic strength 1 m 167 mg l 1 of adsorbent and initial concentrations of paracetamol between 25 and 150 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was 560 mg g 1 450 mg g 1 and 95 mg g 1 for cat carbopal and silica respectively the experimental kinetic data fitted well the pseudo second order model and the equilibrium isotherm data the langmuir model the functional density theory methods provided atomistic details about paracetamol adsorbed on the surface of carbon and silica through molecular modeling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords paracetamol adsorption carbon silica gel 1 introduction in recent years development of new and more sensitive methods of analysis has alerted about the presence of residues of drugs pharmaceuticals veterinary personal care food additives pesticides and other contaminants in water these emerging contaminants reach the environment through domestic and industrial wastewater waste from treatment plants hospital effluents etc elimination of this pollutants has become one of the greatest environmental concerns because of the impact they have on human health and the harmful effects they generate on nature lapworth et al 2012 emerging pollutants are generally not biodegradable and are often not eliminated using conventional primary secondary and tertiary wastewater treatments based on biological physical and chemical processes buttiglieri and knepper 2007 gogoi et al 2018 wang and wang 2016 when purification processes fail to eliminate them they reach lakes rivers and sometimes drinkable water networks paracetamol n 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide also known as acetaminophen is one of the most widely used analgesic and antipyretic worldwide due to its high stability solubility and hydrophilicity it has been detected in surface waters wastewater and drinking water throughout the world birch et al 2015 oulton et al 2010 kolpin et al 2002 main technologies and conventional treatments capable of eliminating this class of substances include aerobic degradation wu et al 2012 coagulation flocculation teh et al 2016 electrolysis chen et al 2012 ozonation gogate and pandit 2004 photo fenton process rad et al 2015 and filtration with nanomembranes bhattacharya 2006 this kind of treatments in general are not enough for the removal of these contaminants and many of them persist without any alteration after treatment in this context developing selective processes that are effective when small quantities of pollutant are present is essential adsorption is one of the most efficient promising and widely used techniques in wastewater treatment processes some of its advantages are low cost simple operation and implementation applicability at very low concentrations possibility of regeneration and reuse and the possibility of using adsorbent materials from different origins several conditions like ionic strength ph and temperature can be changed in order to make this process as efficient as possible saleh and al absi 2017 tuzen et al 2018 moreover synthesis characterization and evaluation of new adsorbents has become one of the most promising fields to expand this study efficiency and facility of removal are factors that need to be constantly improved saleh and ali 2018 saleh et al 2019 saleh 2015 abubakar sani et al 2016 spaltro et al 2018 the aim of this work is to determine experimentally the influence of ionic strength ph and adsorbent surface chemical composition on paracetamol adsorption from aqueous solution using three adsorbents which are thoroughly studied too two activated carbons with different physicochemical properties and one type of commercial silica gel were used all of them are easily eliminated by filtration the effect of ionic strength and initial ph in the adsorption capability of the compound was determined from the adsorption isotherms in addition the interactions that aromatic structural type exerts in the adsorption process on silica and carbon were studied through the analysis of electronic properties such as density of state and charge density using dft calculations 2 materials and methods paracetamol was supplied by sigma aldrich at purity analytical grade higher than 99 table 1 shows relevant physicochemical properties activated carbon were hydrogen sulfide cat ox 4 mm pellet activated carbon umi 2000 and carbopal mb 4s donau hereafter called cat and carbopal respectively silica grace davison grade 62 60 200 mesh was used the surface structure parameters were calculated from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 195 8 c carried out in an automatic volumetric apparatus asap 2020 from micromeritics the specific surface area sbet was calculated using the bet method at p p0 0 209 the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at relatively pressure of p p0 0 988 was employed to determine the total pore volume vtot the micropore surface area smic and external surface area sext as well as the micropore volume vmic were evaluated using the t plot method the mean pore diameter dp was calculated as dp 4 vtot sbet the pore size distribution was derived from the bet furthermore the samples were chemically characterized the type and amount of surface oxygen groups were determined by boehm titration as well as by temperature programmed desorption tpd basics groups were quantified by boehm s titration while the ph of point zero charge phpzc was determined by mass titration as indicated in our previous works spaltro et al 2019 delgado et al 2019 2 1 adsorption isotherms batch adsorption studies were carried out in a thermostatic bath at 25 c with orbital shaking at 250 rpm adding 5 mg of dried adsorbent material to 30 ml of aqueous solutions with different initial concentrations 25 150 mg l 1 of paracetamol the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption was investigated using nacl 0 01 0 50 and 1 m to prepare paracetamol solutions and adding a 0 1 m hcl solution until ph 3 no buffer solutions were used in order to avoid possible formation of precipitates or competition with the solute in the adsorption process the effect of solution ph on paracetamol adsorption was investigated regulating ph at 3 7 and 10 5 by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions prior to the addition of the adsorbent in all cases samples were shaken for 24 h finding that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within this time under all the tested operation conditions aliquots were taken from the system filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filter and examined using uv vis spectroscopy initial and equilibrium concentrations were determined in a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1203 at 245 nm where paracetamol has an adsorption maximum the calibration curve was adjusted using a linear regression analysis each experiment was performed by triplicate and the results were averaged to reduce experimental errors or some random error an equilibrium isotherm expresses the relationship between the amount of removed adsorbate from solution by unit of mass of adsorbent at constant temperature at equilibrium the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 was calculated according the eq 1 1 q e c o c e v w where c 0 and c e mg l 1 are the liquid phase concentrations of paracetamol at initial and equilibrium time respectively v is the solution volume in litres and w is the weight of the adsorbent in grams adsorption isotherms describe how adsorbates interact with adsorbents and so are critical in optimizing the use of adsorbents thus the correlation of equilibrium data by either theoretical or empirical equations is essential for practical design and operation of adsorption systems to establish the most appropriate correlations for experimental equilibrium data the two most common isothermal models langmuir and freundlich were tested kumar 2016 zhou et al 2020 the langmuir model is applicable to homogeneous adsorption processes where the adsorbent surface is uniform that is all adsorption sites are equivalent there is no interactions between adsorbed species and only monolayer formation is possible the linear expression of langmuir isotherm model can be illustrated as eq 2 2 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q e and q m are equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 respectively c e is the paracetamol concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 and k l is the langmuir constant l mg 1 directly related to the affinity and the force with which an adsorbate molecule is retained on the surface of the solid plotting ce q e against c e it is possible to obtain the value of the langmuir constant k l and q m freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that is not limited to the monolayer coverage but also describes the multilayer adsorption and further contemplates heterogeneous surfaces the linear form of freundlich model can be expressed by eq 3 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the equilibrium constant and n is a parameter related to the intensity of the adsorption this constant n is also related to the affinity distribution where the higher the value of n the greater the energy distribution in the case that n 1 the adsorption process follows henry s law the plots of ln q e against ln c e gives a linear graph with slope 1 n and intercept ln k f 2 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetic study was carried out with a total contact time of 24 h by adding 83 mg of the adsorbent to 500 ml of 150 mg l 1 paracetamol solution 1 m nacl adjusting the ph at 7 experiments were performed in a thermostatic bath at 25 c with orbital shaking at 250 rpm at various intervals portions of the suspensions were separated using 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filters concentrations were monitored using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 245 nm all experiments were performed in triplicate the amount of paracetamol adsorbed q t mg g 1 at time t min was calculated by eq 1 pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and elovich model were adopted to interpret the kinetic adsorption mechanism zhang et al 2019 song et al 2017 somsesta et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the linear using pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations are presented in table 2 where q e is the adsorption capacities at equilibrium mg g 1 q t is the adsorption capacities at time t mg g 1 k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 Î± is the rate of chemisorption at zero coverage mg g 1 min 1 and Î² is the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption g mg 1 2 3 computational study as the solution ph can exert a significant influence on paracetamol adsorption a computational study was also carried out to obtain more information to the adsorption process gaussian 09 software was used to perform the theoretical calculations geometry optimizations were made using the dft method with the b3lyp functional and 6 311g d p basis set frisch et al 2010 the electronic charges and the density of states for paracetamol molecule adsorbed on carbonaceous and silica materials were calculated 3 results and discussion activated carbon has a varied surface chemistry which in addition to its acid base properties can generate positive or negative surface charges depending on the ph of the solution the combined influence of all functional groups determines phpzc i e in which the net surface charge on carbon is neutral it is known that net charge on carbon surface is positive at a solution ph lower than that corresponding to phpzc of the surface due to protonation of basic groups and is negative at a solution ph higher than phpzc because of the deprotonation of functional groups therefore it is very important to know the surface charge of the material in aqueous media especially in adsorption studies since it is not only the surface area that will determine the adsorption capacity table 3 summarizes the relevant values related to textural and surface chemical properties of the adsorbents used silica surfaces are usually covered with a layer of silanols and siloxane groups no other functional groups are present so chemical characterization was not performed the low phpzc value observed for carbopal could be attributed to an increase in the amount of oxygen on the surface due to the presence of acid groups and according to boehm s titration most of these acid groups are phenolic in addition carbopal had the highest number of basic groups through the titration it was also determined cat has the largest number of carboxylic acid groups the morphological characterization of commercial carbons has been examined by scanning electron microscope sem fig 1 shown the sem images corresponding to carbonaceous materials cat and carbopal it is observed that the structure is not uniform or ordered 3 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption process is influenced by electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate therefore ph modifications may generate changes in the adsorbate structure and adsorbent physicochemical properties 3 1 1 effect of ionic strength ionic strength is an important factor in the study of aqueous phase equilibrium isotherms were obtained with three different concentrations of nacl solution 0 01 0 50 and 1 00 m figs 2 4 show adsorption isotherms of paracetamol on cat carbopal and silica at different ionic strength is the effect of the ionic strength modification is significant the greater the ionic strength the greater the amount of paracetamol adsorbed when using cat as an adsorbent the adsorption of paracetamol decreased from 550 mg g 1 to 390 mg g 1 30 with a decrease in ionic strength from 1 00 to 0 50 m when ionic strength decreased to 0 01 m adsorption decreased to 290 mg g 1 almost half with respect to that obtained for the 1 m solution when using carbopal as an adsorbent the variation in adsorption capacity by modifying the ionic strength is not so noticeable it went from 445 mg g 1 to 415 mg g 1 7 decrease as the ionic strength decreased from 1 00 to 0 50 m it was reduced to 320 mg g 1 for a 0 01 m ionic strength 28 decrease using silica gel as adsorbent values obtained for the adsorption capacity are much lower than for carbons and the effect of the ionic strength is very remarkable the adsorption capacity was reduced from 95 to 73 mg g 1 23 by changing the ionic strength from 1 m to 0 5 m and decreased to 38 mg g 1 60 less by reducing ionic strength to 0 01 m the increased adsorption of paracetamol onto these carbonaceous adsorbents with increase in ionic strength could also be due to the decrease in solubility of drug in salt solution commonly characterized as salting out effect arafat et al 1999 na and cl ions from dissociation of nacl in water are strongly solvated by water molecules forming large hydration spheres these water molecules will have restricted mobility and will be less able to interact with paracetamol molecules therefore solubility of paracetamol in the solution decreases and its diffusion towards the adsorbent surface is favoured it is often assumed that a material with a larger total surface area has more pronounced adsorptive properties and will therefore perform better however when comparing the two analyzed carbons a higher adsorption capacity was obtained for cat which has a lower sbet than carbopal table 3 this difference in adsorbent efficiency is attributed to the fact that cat has a greater number of micropores in this carbon vmicro represents 38 of vt while in carbopal vmicro represents only 3 2 of vt the structure of pores can significantly affect adsorption kinetics the three main types of interactions between paracetamol and the surface of an activated carbon are the formation of hydrogen bonds the Ï Ï dispersion interaction and the formation of the electron donor acceptor complex the Ï Ï interaction is strengthened when adsorption takes place on smaller micropores as a micropore filler this is due to the enhanced adsorption potential that occurs on neighboring graphene walls on the contrary it is postulated that donor acceptor complex formation occurs in broader micropores and mesopores lorenc grabowska 2016 therefore the pore size distribution is a determining factor in the adsorption capacity of the analyzed carbons rather than the specific surface area at ph 3 paracetamol is in its neutral form and both carbons are positively charged but the number of basic groups that can be protonated at this ph value is much higher in the case of carbopal table 3 this higher positive charge could also affect the adsorption process considering that active sites of the carbon decrease due to the protonation of basic groups pyrones chromenes graphene layers acting as lewis bases and forming electron donor acceptor complexes with h2o molecules or amino groups adsorption capacity for paracetamol on silica was found to be lower than those of activated carbons this is explained by the smaller specific surface area and the absence of a rich surface chemistry that favours the interaction with the adsorbate at ph 3 the silica is protonated and the existence of surface groups sioh2 and undissociated paracetamol favours hydrogen bond type interactions or the formation of an electron donor acceptor complex there are no electrostatic attractions that favour adsorption as in the case of activated carbons by increasing the ionic strength there was an increase of the adsorption capacity for silica due to salting out effect 3 1 2 effect of ph it is well known that ph affects the ionization state of a weak electrolyte this is the case of paracetamol with pka 9 and charges that may appear on the surface of the adsorbent figs 5 7 show the paracetamol adsorption isotherms at different ph values using 167 mg l 1 adsorbent and initial pharmaceutical concentration ranging between 25 and 150 mg l 1 in these experiments temperature was maintained at 25 c and ionic strength was kept constant by adding 1 m nacl solution fig 5 shows adsorption isotherm on cat at different ph values both activated carbons and silica have surface groups that can be protonated or deprotonated at different ph values the surface sites associated with functional groups represent a small proportion of the total surface area however small variations in the chemical nature of adsorbent may produce important changes in its adsorption capacity in general adsorption of phenolic compounds onto carbonaceous materials is much higher at low ph values than at high ones lazo cannata et al 2011 at ph phpzc carbon surface becomes positively charged favouring the adsorption of anionic species on the other hand adsorption of cationic species will be favoured at ph phpzc when the carbon is negatively charged weak electrolytes such as paracetamol can exist in both ionized and nonionized forms depending on the solution ph taking into account that the pka of paracetamol is 9 3 it follows that both at ph 3 and at ph 7 the drug will be present mainly in its non ionized form while at ph 11 the deprotonated form is the predominant one interaction between each form and the adsorbent surface may favour or disfavor the adsorption process depending on the magnitude of the attraction or repulsion forces alade et al 2019 when carbopal phpzc 4 76 is used as adsorbent in aqueous solution at ph 3 its surface is on average positively charged under these conditions paracetamol will be in its neutral undissociated form and adsorption would be carried out mainly by Ï Ï interactions between Ï electrons of the aromatic ring of the paracetamol molecules and Ï electrons of the carbon graphene layer also hydrogen bonding can take place at ph 7 the surface of carbopal is negatively charged and paracetamol is mainly undissociated so again the dominant interactions would not be electrostatic but rather those of Ï Ï dispersion between the aromatic rings at ph 10 5 the surface of carbopal is negatively charged and paracetamol is mainly in its ionized deprotonated form so that electrostatic adsorbate adsorbent interactions will be repulsive and the adsorption capacity of paracetamol by carbon decreases in the case of cat phpzc 7 46 at ph 3 it is positively charged and paracetamol is in its neutral form so the dominant interactions will be Ï Ï stacking between aromatic moieties from carbon and paracetamol and hydrogen bonding at ph 7 carbon will be almost neutral like paracetamol so the dominant interactions will not be electrostatic however at ph 10 5 both the carbon surface and the paracetamol are negatively charged so electrostatic interactions will be repulsive resulting in a lower adsorption capacity at this ph value as discussed before at ph 3 cat had a higher adsorption capacity this could be explained by considering that or carbopal has a greater number of basic groups which when protonated suppress paracetamol adsorption at these sites comparing qmax at ph 3 cat adsorbs 10 more than carbopal at ph 7 paracetamol is the lower adsorption capacity of carbopal can be explained by the negative charge that its surface shows exhibits while cat at this ph value is practically neutral phpzc 7 46 the difference in qmax at this ph is almost 9 at ph 10 5 the adsorption capacity is the same for both carbons which supports the previous explanations as neither of the two differences mentioned occurs at this ph both as carbons as paracetamol are negatively charged so the interactions will be repulsive adsorption will occur to a lesser extent than at other phs and due to non electrostatic interactions adsorption isotherms at ph 3 and 1 m ionic strength on the three adsorbents are in fig 8 as an example all of them fitted to freundlich and langmuir characteristic parameters were determined from the respective linear form and they are shown in table 4 in all cases correlation coefficient r2 shows that langmuir model is the one which best fit to experimental data in addition the theoretical q m values derived from langmuir model are more consistent with experimental adsorption amount further indicate the validity of langmuir model to describe the isotherm adsorption of paracetamol the fact that langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data very well suggests the monolayer coverage of paracetamol onto adsorbent particles 3 2 kinetics of paracetamol adsorption the evolution of the concentration of paracetamol as a function of time is shown in fig 9 in the three materials studied the adsorption was rapid during the first 200 min and then gradually decreased reaching equilibrium at approximately 800 min adsorption kinetics of paracetamol on the three adsorbents with corresponding adjustments to the three kinetic models pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and elovich model can be found in supplementary material table 5 shows the parameters obtained in adjustments with its respective correlation coefficient for pseudo first order and elovich kinetic models experimental data deviates from linearity see also supplementary material therefore the pseudo first order and elovich models are inapplicable for current systems the elovich equation is known to describe chemisorption well so the low correlation coefficient indicates little relevant chemical interaction for the three systems on the contrary correlation coefficient and q e value that were determined from the pseudo second order model are in good agreement with the experimental data this would indicate that the limiting step in the adsorption process would be the transfer of the adsorptive mass from the solution to the adsorbent surface 3 3 computational dft study optimized chemical structures of paracetamol adsorbed on activated carbon and silica are shown in fig 10 the electrostatic potential energy map shows the charge distributions in the isolated paracetamol and makes it possible to visualize the differently charged regions in the molecule a strong negative potential occurs around c o and oh groups presented in paracetamol these two areas are in opposition to the remaining slightly positive part of the molecule the adsorption of paracetamol from aqueous solution is mainly due to interactions between the functional groups in the drug structure and the groups on the solid adsorbent surface on the other hand the effect of ph on the adsorbate adsorbent interactions and charge distribution on these groups has significant effects on the adsorption capacity additional knowledge about charge distributions can be helpful to explain how molecule interacts with adsorbent surfaces possible changes in the distribution of electron density are considered to compare their electronic structures after adsorption see fig 11 and table 6 as we can see all changes are small and this agrees with a physical adsorption process on the other hand major changes are produced on atoms of amido nh c o and hydroxyl oh groups of paracetamol molecule in bold table 6 the formation of an electron acceptor donor complex is possible between groups with free electron pairs such as the carbon rings activated carbon or silanol oxygens silica and electronegative atoms nitrogen and oxygen in paracetamol molecule at low and neutral ph paracetamol molecule exists as neutral specie the neutral molecule presents low electronic density and it can be attributed mainly to the carbonyl group see fig 11 a at ph values greater than 10 the anionic form of paracetamol predominates regions with high electronic density are located on amido group and in addition on methyl group see fig 11 b the interaction of ionized and non ionized species with the solid surface may favour or disfavor the adsorption process when forces of attraction or repulsion prevail respectively i e the decrease increase in the adsorption capacity can be related to the same different sign in the interacting species charge when adsorption occurs at low neutral ph the positive neutral adsorbents may attract the highest electronic charges of the neutral paracetamol molecule located in the nh c o and c oh groups paracetamol charges may be weakly attracted to carbon rings activated carbon and silanol superficial groups silica trough physical adsorption the density of states for paracetamol molecule adsorbed on carbonaceous and silica materials can be seen in fig 12 in those graphs we can observe regions where the molecule and surface states have the possibility to overlap paracetamol adsorption energies are similar in all cases being 2 12 ev for activated carbon and 1 85 ev for silica confirming the physical nature of the molecule surface interaction the paracetamol molecule has two proton acceptor and donor groups that favour hydrogen bond formation with silica surface the shortest contacts between the oxygen atoms of paracetamol and the framework hydrogen atoms of silica oh distances are 2 44 Ã¥ and 2 81 Ã¥ respectively on the other hand the shortest contact between the nitrogen atom of paracetamol and the framework hydrogen atom of silica nh distance is 2 94 Ã¥ at higher ph interactions between the molecule and the silica are minimal due to the repulsion between the negatively charged paracetamol and the deprotonated silanols in such case physisorption is less significant in magnitude 1 26 ev as previously stated the adsorption process of paracetamol is strictly influenced by electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate therefore ph changes in the medium can change in the adsorbate structure and the adsorbent physicochemical properties in resume the different mechanisms of adsorption of paracetamol on carbonaceous materials are dispersive interactions by Ï electrons donor acceptor electron complexes and hydrogen bond formation whereas for silica gel only the last two are possible 4 conclusions a the ability to remove paracetamol in aqueous solutions was evaluated using three adsorbents resulting in the following decreasing order cat carbopal silica b the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents was strongly influenced by ph and ion strength in solution paracetamol adsorption is disfavoured for ph value that determines a simultaneous negative charge of the adsorbent ph phpzc and high ionization degree of the adsorbate ph pka hence in this study the ph of 3 is selected as the optimum ph on paracetamol adsorption furthermore it was found that high values of ionic strength favour adsorption thus at 25 c ph 3 ionic strength 1 m 167 mg l 1 of adsorbent and initial concentrations of paracetamol between 25 and 150 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was 560 mg g 1 450 mg g 1 and 95 mg g 1 for cat carbopal and silica respectively the greatest changes were observed in activated carbons due to the alteration of their surface chemistry according to the ph of the aqueous solution c dft calculations showed good correlation with experimental results providing atomistic details through molecular modeling d paracetamol charges may be weakly attracted to carbon rings activated carbon and silanol superficial groups silica trough physical adsorption e the use of kinetic models showed that paracetamol adsorption follows pseudo second order adsorption kinetics langmuir model was appropriate to describe the isotherm adsorption which illustrated the adsorption was carried out by monolayer behaviour f adsorption experiments over amorphous silica and the two carbonaceous materials showed that their adsorption capacities are adequate for the removal of this emerging contaminant present in water with silica being less effective than activated carbons the results obtained could be extended to chemically similar compounds with the subsequent potential application in the treatment of water contaminated with paracetamol
