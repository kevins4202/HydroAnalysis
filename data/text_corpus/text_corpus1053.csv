5265,the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater needs to be characterized for geological co2 storage or radioactive waste disposal however various origins and their interactions and complex hydrogeological conditions make it difficult to assess moreover it is challenging to interpret a large national dataset of hydrochemical variables due to wide composition ranges this study aimed to define the representative geochemical facies of deep groundwater average well depth of 624 262 m obtained from spa areas over south korea by applying both linear principal component analysis pca and non linear self organizing map som dimensionality reduction methods to a large dataset n 355 with 16 hydrochemical variables the som results combined with hierarchical cluster analysis showed that deep thermal groundwater in south korea is classified into five major geochemical groups g1 to g5 with four mixing groups m1 to m4 g1 to g5 represent high tds saline 7 of the samples acidic co2 rich 4 high ph alkaline 14 sulfate rich 9 and dilute freshwater 11 respectively more than half of the samples 56 belonged to the four mixing groups in particular the som reduced the number of samples n 355 to 104 neurons visualizing the cluster structure of samples and the relationship among hydrochemical variables in a 2d array of neurons which made it possible to distinguish the facies g4 and g5 and m1 to m4 that could not be defined by pca due to the extremely distinct geochemistry of g1 and g2 based on the compositional changes of neurons between the geochemical g1 to g5 and mixing m1 to m4 groups major reaction pathways were identified for each geochemical group the hydrochemistry of each group mainly evolves through distinct water rock interactions but is modified by varying degrees of mixing with dilute shallow groundwater during ascent this study provides a state of the art method to interpret a large and complex hydrogeochemical dataset the som is expected to be a useful alternative to pca besides the results of this study can be useful to select a site suitable for geological co2 storage or radioactive waste disposal keywords deep groundwater geochemical groups reaction pathways and mixing self organizing map som principal component analysis pca hierarchical cluster analysis hca 1 introduction deep groundwater is geologically old and highly mineralized and exhibits diverse chemical compositions due to various origins e g meteoric water connate water magmatic water and interactions e g water rock interaction mixing and complex hydrogeological conditions e g diffuse fracture or conduit flow frape et al 1984 2003 nordstrom et al 1989 thus it is difficult to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater in particular the groundwater in deep thermal reservoirs experiences hydrochemical changes through multiple geochemical processes during ascent which makes it more difficult to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater for instance the mixing with shallow groundwater results in dilution e g chae et al 2006a laaksoharju et al 2008 petitta et al 2010 and geochemical reactions such as precipitation adsorption and cation exchange occur during the flow accompanying the changes of geological conditions alt epping et al 2010 kumara and dharmagunawardhane 2017 according to kietäväinen 2017 microbial communities also play a significant role in the changes of groundwater types by biogeochemical reactions especially by contributing to the deep carbon cycle despite these difficulties an understanding of hydrogeochemical characteristics of deep groundwater is one of the primary tasks to evaluate geological repositories for high level radioactive waste larsen et al 2001 metz et al 2003 gómez et al 2006 kietäväinen 2017 and geologic co2 storage auqué et al 2009 feitz et al 2010 this is because radionuclides released from the repository may be transported to the biosphere along groundwater flow paths besides the chemical composition of groundwater affects the stability of engineered or natural barriers us epa 1998 lee et al 2016 and the solubility of the radionuclides duro et al 2010 similarly the hydrochemistry of deep groundwater is expected to affect both the transport and fate of co2 leaked from geologic sequestration sites and the hydrogeochemical reactions in cap rocks overlying the reservoir hemme and van berk 2017 in addition the hydrogeochemical characteristics of deep groundwater influence the rate of co2 mineralization which is the most risk free and permanent form of geological carbon storage choi et al 2012 zhang and depaolo 2017 moreover understanding the chemistry of groundwater and the connectivity between aquifers are essential to determine whether prospective aquifers can be used for geological repositories of radioactive waste or co2 without compromising other activities e g groundwater use for agriculture auqué et al 2009 feitz et al 2010 the dataset for the assessment of appropriate geological repositories is composed of a large number of multiple hydrogeochemical variables multivariate statistical methods have been widely applied to assess and classify the complex and high dimensional hydrogeochemical data principal component analysis pca is one of the most frequently used methods for groundwater quality data kim et al 2009 2017 güler et al 2002 gómez et al 2008 laaksoharju et al 2008 tanasković et al 2012 however if a hydrochemical dataset shows non linear relationships between variables the classical linear statistical method is unreliable and fails to visualize the relations alternatively a self organizing map som which belongs to the domain of unsupervised artificial neural network algorithms has been applied as a non linear surrogate to pca giraudel and lek 2001 yan et al 2001 astel et al 2007 lee et al 2019 the som not only reduces data dimensionality but also provides a small number of output neurons which makes the som useful to interpret a large number of data the som is often combined with clustering tools such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca to reduce the number of output neurons to an appropriate number of groups kiang 2001 choi et al 2014 in this study we assessed a large hydrochemical dataset of deep groundwater n 355 obtained from spa areas in south korea fig 1 using the som and hca to evaluate the relationships among 16 hydrochemical variables and to cluster the deep groundwater into representative geochemical facies on a national scale evolutionary processes between geochemical facies were also discussed based on successive compositional changes and local equilibrium conditions for comparison the durov diagram and pca were also applied for the dataset note that the deep wells in fig 1c were developed for spas and thus deep groundwater strictly means thermal deep groundwater in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of water samples the korean peninsula is located in the margin of the eastern eurasian continent and far from the circum pacific belt fig 1a a hydrochemical dataset obtained by chae et al 2007 from deep wells n 355 in fig 1c in the spa areas was used to characterize the thermal deep groundwater in south korea the average well depth was 624 262 m and the average in situ temperature was 32 5 c table 1 given the average geothermal gradient 27 c km of south korea lim et al 1996 the average in situ temperature represents the deep groundwater in bedrock aquifers the spa wells are optimistic for studying deep groundwater in crystalline bedrock aquifers because the facilities were well constructed for preserving the temperature and water chemistry for example the wells had been cased by concrete reaching to the top of the bedrock to protect the mixing with shallow groundwater note that chae et al 2007 used these groundwater samples to understand the fluoride geochemistry in deep subsurface environments and suggested that the high fluoride in groundwater median 4 4 mg l originates from the mineral composition of granitoids and metamorphic rocks and fluoride can be removed from water by fluorite precipitation when a high ca2 concentration is maintained the dataset consisted of 16 hydrochemical variables including four in situ measurements temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total alkalinity eight major ions ca2 mg2 na k sio2 so4 2 cl and f and four calculated parameters total dissolved solids tds co2 hco3 and co3 2 the three carbonate species in water were calculated from total alkalinity and ph by using the geochemical modeling code phreeqc v2 16 parkhurst and appelo 1999 and the llnl database delany and lundeen 1991 which were also used to calculate the saturation index s i for certain mineral phases in the aquifer details of groundwater sampling analytical methods and qa qc can be found in chae et al 2007 in addition the data of major ionic compositions of rain lee et al 2000 shallow bedrock groundwater kim et al 2015 and seawater chae et al 2012 in south korea were used for comparison specifically lee et al 2000 collected daily precipitation at nine stations in south korea from may 1996 to april 1998 and the average compositions of the rainwater n 796 were used in this study chae et al 2012 collected highly concentrated seawater from the east sea in 2005 the hydrochemical compositions of shallow bedrock groundwater were obtained in 2009 from 37 brands of bottled mineral water that were abstracted from boreholes whose depths were around 200 m kim et al 2015 2 2 geology around groundwater wells tectonically south korea consists of six geologic units which can be summarized into four rock types fig 1b relatively old rocks such as precambrian metamorphic rocks e g gneiss and schist paleozoic and mesozoic sedimentary rocks jurassic and cretaceous granites and young volcanic rocks the jurassic and cretaceous granites and the precambrian gneiss occupy the most terrain of south korea about 50 the details of geology in korea can be found in lee 1988 and chough et al 2000 in this study the lithology was categorized into five groups to specify the geology for each groundwater well granitoids gr metamorphic rocks met volcanic rocks vol sedimentary rocks sed and uncertain or complex rocks mix as a result 168 46 36 51 and 54 wells were classified in the gr met vol sed and mix group respectively we acknowledge that this categorization may oversimplify the geology around each well given the geological heterogeneity even so it can help to overall understand the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater depending on bedrock types note that the distribution of deep groundwater wells generally follows the distribution of cretaceous and jurassic granitoids fig 1 and also half the groundwater samples n 168 belonged to the granitoids gr group this is because the spa areas in south korea have a close relationship with granitoids the heat is probably derived from the radioactive decay of granitoids lee et al 2010 in korea it is difficult to find thermal water related to volcanos unlike in japan which has residual magma at a depth of 5 10 km because the depth of residual magma is about 60 km deeper than in japan the korean peninsula is distant from high potential geothermal heat energy lee et al 2010 2 3 pattern recognitions this study extracted important information from the hydrochemical dataset using both linear i e pca and non linear i e som dimensionality reduction methods both techniques provide low dimensional subspaces maps of the dataset with the minimum loss of information and visualize the dominant patterns behind the data for pca and som the hydrochemical data are standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one which eliminates the influence of different units from measurements and allows each variable to obtain equal importance when measuring the euclidean distance between sample vectors in this study pca was carried out using the statistics toolbox in matlab 7 0 mathworks 2004 while the som toolbox 2 0 in matlab vesanto et al 2000 was used to calculate and visualize the som here we briefly describe the som algorithm and pca 2 3 1 self organizing map som the som is a structure preserving map of a dataset and designed for two main tasks on a large multivariate dataset unsupervised classification and non linear dimensionality reduction kohonen 1982 2001 it deduces the cluster structure of data according to similarities and projects the structure on a low dimensional usually 2d map the som is typically organized on a 2d hexagonal grid with a set of ordered units called neurons that have connection weights w fully connected to all samples of input data x the neurons are also interconnected to adjacent neurons by a neighborhood relation dictating the cluster structure of the input data let x x i i 1 n and w w j i j 1 d i 1 n where n is the number of input samples 355 in this study and d is the total number of neurons both x i and w j i are represented by a p dimensional vector where p is the number of variables 16 in this study table 1 the proper number of neurons can be selected using a heuristic rule e g 5 n suggested by vesanto et al 2000 and validated by garcı a and gonzález 2004 and lee et al 2019 note that the number of output neurons is an important factor for som results whereas there are no precise rules for choosing the number of neurons an iterative learning procedure is introduced into the input dataset to organize neurons according to their similarities as follows 1 initializing weight vectors with small random values 2 calculating and comparing the euclidian distances between each input sample and all neurons 3 finding the best matching unit bmu that is the neuron b closest to the input sample x i 1 x i w b i min j x i w j i and 4 updating bmu and its neighboring neurons to move closer to the input sample x i the weight vector w j i at each time step t 1 is calculated as 2 w j i t 1 w j i t α t h b j t x i w j i t where α t denotes a learning rate and h b j t is a neighborhood kernel function of the neuron j for its bmu b during training both the learning rate and the size of the neighborhood decrease and at the end of training the neurons and weight vectors classify the input dataset according to their similarity on the low dimensional som after the som training the relevant patterns are graphically displayed using two maps of cell types component planes and distance matrices vesanto 1999 the component planes show the weight vector values of each neuron using color codes which can be used to detect correlations between variables unified distance matrices u matrix and median distance matrices d matrix are a standard tool for displaying the cluster structure of the som specifically the u matrix represents the euclidean distance between the weight vectors of neighboring neurons on the map in the color scale while the d matrix presents the median values of the distance in the neurons of the som neurons with low distances i e high similarities can be regarded as a cluster while neurons with high distances i e low similarities can be regarded as cluster boundaries in most som cases the number of output neurons is more than the expected number of groups kiang 2001 therefore hca is widely used on the som results to derive an appropriate number of groups and to facilitate the analysis of the som results herrero and dopazo 2002 sánchez martos et al 2002 choi et al 2014 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca a standard pca model reduces the dimensionality of input data and transforms interdependent variables into independent principal components pcs davis 1986 everitt and dunn 2001 the pcs consist of loadings and scores based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix loadings are normalized eigenvectors between 1 and 1 and considered as the subspace coordinates of data while scores are the observed sample values projected on the subspace using the eigenvectors pc scores can be obtained for supplementary data not used for the pca analysis e g rain shallow bedrock groundwater and seawater in this study by projecting the original data onto the pc coordinates the details for the supplementary data can be founded in jambu 1991 3 results table 1 summarizes the statistics of 16 hydrochemical variables from the 355 deep groundwater samples and shows the wide ranges of concentrations for instance ph ranged from acidic 5 1 to alkaline 10 2 while tds ranged from fresh 34 mg l to saline 21 255 mg l 3 1 hydrochemical types using durov diagram fig 2 shows the variation of relative compositions in dominant cations and anions with tds in the diagram the compositional changes of cations mainly occurred from ca to na while in the case of anions the groundwater samples were widely distributed from hco3 to cl and so4 these variations resulted in scattered plots on the square fields of the diagram fig 2 suggested the occurrence of four hydrochemical types na hco3 ca hco3 na cl and ca na so4 the na hco3 type was dominant while saline water 1000 mg l tds occurred as the concentrations of hco3 or cl increased and showed the ca hco3 and na cl type in addition the ca na so4 type was occasionally observed the four hydrochemical types showed a continuous change between geochemical facies reflecting the evolutionary processes through mixing among various geochemical end members ems which will be discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 4 1 1 3 2 geochemical pattern recognition geochemical pattern recognition pca and som was performed to provide a rigorous explanation of the geochemical facies of deep groundwater and to classify the groundwater geochemistry 3 2 1 geochemical groups and end members in the pc space three pcs whose eigenvalues were more than 1 were extracted as shown in table 2 and fig 3 they accounted for 77 82 of total variance table 2 which indicates that pca achieved a significant dimensionality reduction of the hydrochemical dataset table 2 lists the contributions of each variable pc loadings to the three pcs fig 3 displays the loadings and scores corresponding to the three pcs on the 3d plots and illustrates the relationships between hydrochemical variables and major patterns i e pcs behind observed groundwater samples specifically the loadings in the pc space in fig 3a show that the positively or negatively correlated hydrochemical variables except temperature are spatially grouped although some variables are weakly correlated with pcs table 2 pc1 was correlated with tds ec na k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 while pc2 was correlated with alkalinity hco3 and h2co3 pc3 was negatively correlated with co3 2 f and ph the results imply at least three processes controlling the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea it seems that the positive pc1 and pc2 explain the process for increasing salinity and dissolved inorganic carbon dic respectively whereas the negative sign of pc3 is related to the increases in ph and fluoride f concentration pc1 pc2 and pc3 correspond to the hydrochemical types 3 2 and 1 in fig 2 respectively and the ca na so4 type was not detected using pca fig 3b illustrates the scores of deep groundwater samples projected on the reduced subspace spanned by the three pcs note that most of the groundwater samples were plotted along pc3 consistent with the dominant na hco3 type in fig 2 in addition the variations of sample scores seem linear as depicted with the three red lines in fig 3b these linear features reflect not only the three groups of deep groundwater but also three geochemical evolutionary processes with mixing corresponding to the pcs laaksoharju et al 1999 we characterized the three geochemical groups as high tds na cl type pc1 low ph ca na hco3 type pc2 and high ph na hco3 type pc3 in the pc space fig 3b respectively and selected three em samples along each pathway fig 3b table 3 additionally we projected the hydrochemistry of rain n 1 an average of lee et al 2000 shallow bedrock groundwater n 37 and seawater of south korea n 1 on the pc space by using the three eigenvectors obtained from the pca analysis the seawater projected on the pc space was strongly related to pc1 fig 3b and em1 pc1 was similar to the seawater table 3 it seems that the high tds na cl type pc1 originated from an external saline source such as seawater fig 3b shows that the scores of three deep groundwater groups converged into a single zone in which rain black triangle and shallow groundwater green circles were presented this pattern indicates that the geochemistry of deep groundwater with three ems was mixed into the shallow groundwater during ascent from a different view the recharging groundwater from rain in the shallow zone evolved into the three geochemical types of deep groundwater the evolutionary process with mixing will be further discussed in section 4 2 it seems that pca effectively explained the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater using the three pcs however it was difficult to further interpret the large number n 355 of water samples in particular the high ph na hco3 type waters with decreasing pc3 scores moreover pca resulted in the loss of some information such as the geochemical facies of ca na so4 type in the durov diagram fig 2 for these reasons the hydrochemical dataset was introduced into the som 3 2 2 geochemical grouping using component planes the som algorithm trained the hydrochemical dataset n 355 with 16 variables and consequently created the 2d output grid in fig 4 which consists of eight by thirteen neurons that comprise similar input samples sharing a bmu in fig 4 each component plane shows the weight vector values of each variable in the 104 neurons and the weight vector values correspond to the standardized values of original data the geochemical compositions of each neuron correspond to the composites of weight vectors comparison of the patterns of component variable planes allows for an instant recognition of the mutual dependencies among the 16 variables fig 4 specifically there were significant relationships between ec tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 and cl the ion concentrations abruptly increased on the neurons at the bottom right corner of the maps the groundwater samples closely related to increasing tds were explained by pc1 and thus the neurons at the bottom right corner indicated the high tds na cl type group meanwhile the variables of dic i e alkalinity h2co3 and hco3 significantly increased in the bottom left corner of the maps in which the ph value gradually decreased this pattern coincides with pc2 and thus the neurons in the bottom left corner indicated the low ph ca na hco3 group in addition ph carbonate co3 2 and fluoride f revealed patterns similar to each other the highest values were observed on the neurons at the top left corner and gradually decreased along the diagonal direction on the maps these relationships correspond to the negative sign of pc3 and suggest the high ph na hco3 group in summary the component planes showed that the som preserved the geochemical characteristics explained by the three pcs moreover most of the neurons belonged to the high ph na hco3 type corresponding to pc3 which also had most of groundwater samples in fig 3b the som and pca results indicate that the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea is mainly characterized by the high ph na hco3 type which is also consistent with the results in fig 2 3 2 3 cluster structure of the hydrochemical dataset using distance matrices the cluster structure of the hydrochemical dataset can be shown in the maps of distance matrices by visualizing the distances between neurons as in fig 5 red and blue in fig 5 represent the longest and shortest distance between neurons respectively specifically in the u matrix red corresponds to a large distance and thus a big gap between values in the input space while blue signifies that the vectors are close to each other in the input space thus bluish colored areas can be thought of as clusters whereas reddish areas are cluster separators fig 5a meanwhile the d matrix projects a single value on each neuron of the som by measuring the median distances to neighbors fig 5b the matrices in fig 5 show that the distances between neighboring neurons or samples significantly increased at the bottom of the map and thus the neighboring neurons at the bottom of the map can be separated into two groups while most of the neurons in the upper and middle parts of the map were closely related to each other therefore it is clear that the cluster structure of south korean deep groundwater mainly consisted of three major groups as discussed using the results of pca the high tds na cl type and the low ph ca na hco3 type at the bottom of the map and the high ph na hco3 type in the upper and middle parts of the map in fig 5 3 2 4 clustering using hierarchical cluster analysis a detailed investigation of neurons suggested that the geochemistry of the dominant high ph na hco3 water can be subdivided for instance the so4 2 concentration increased in the top right corner of the map fig 4 revealing the presence of a geochemical facies of ca na so4 type in fig 2 therefore we classified the high ph na hco3 groundwater into subgroups based on the cluster structure on the som for this purpose hca was applied to the som by measuring the squared euclidean distance between weight vectors of neurons the groups defined by hca were depicted on the d matrix in fig 5b the number of subdivisions 9 was chosen based on the linkage distances of the hca dendrogram specially the som neurons were separated into three groups at the elevated distances of the dendrogram red lines then the neurons in the high ph na hco3 water group were classified into seven subgroups at the low linkage distances white lines as a result there were nine statistically different groups on the som according to the cluster structure fig 5b in order to characterize the geochemical properties of each group we investigated the geochemical compositions of the component planes fig 4 that can be returned from means and variances used in standardization table 4 summarizes the statistics of geochemical compositions returned components of weight vectors of the grouped neurons according to the cluster structure which will be discussed in section 4 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical grouping based on pca and som analysis as well as the durov diagram nine statistically different groups i e five geochemical groups g1 to g5 and four mixing groups m1 to m4 were suggested in fig 6 a and table 4 and distinct ems were selected from each geochemical group in table 5 hereinafter the five geochemical groups g1 to g5 are called high tds saline water acidic co2 rich water high ph alkaline water sulfate rich water and dilute freshwater respectively as in fig 6a it is noticeable that g1 and g2 corresponded to pc1 high tds na cl type and pc2 low ph ca na hco3 type respectively while the other groups were included in pc3 high ph na hco3 type before clustering into seven subdivisions 4 1 1 geochemical groups with distinct end members the five geochemical groups g1 to g5 represent the distinct geochemistry of deep groundwater in particular their inherent compositions can be recognized by choosing their em neurons em1 to em5 fig 6a and table 5 specifically the two geochemical groups on the bottom of the som were brackish 1000 mg l the high tds saline water g1 14 neurons and 25 samples and the acidic co2 rich water g2 10 neurons and 13 samples which were consistent with the na cl type and the ca hco3 type in fig 2 respectively the average tds values of both groups were 3 421 and 1 556 mg l which were contributed mainly by cl avg 43 64 mmol l and dissolved inorganic carbon dic avg 16 24 meq l alkalinity among anions respectively table 4 for g1 the neuron with the highest tds 8 285 mg l was chosen as em1 table 5 in the case of g2 the geochemical facies changed from the ca hco3 to na hco3 type i e ca na hco3 type and thus a neuron showing the highest tds 2 618 mg l and the lowest ph 6 2 was chosen as em2 within the group table 5 the upper and middle parts of the som were classified into three distinct geochemical groups g3 to g5 fig 6a among them g3 12 neurons and 49 samples represented the typical high ph alkaline water average ph 9 2 and mostly showed the na hco3 type with high f avg 0 72 mmol l table 4 in this group the neuron with the highest tds 374 mg l and ph 9 4 was selected as em3 table 5 in the upper right corner of the som the seven neurons 32 samples showed the highest values of so4 2 avg 1 20 mmol l as well as tds avg 420 mg l among the subgroups of the high ph na hco3 water fig 4 and fig 6b and thus was termed as the sulfate rich water g4 this group also showed relatively high concentrations of ca2 avg 0 64 mmol l compared to g3 and belonged to the ca na so4 or na ca so4 type fig 2 a neuron showing the highest tds 691 mg l and so4 2 2 32 mmol l was defined as em4 for this group lastly the dilute freshwater g5 consisted of nine neurons 38 samples and showed the lowest tds avg 216 mg l this group showed the geochemical facies ranging from na hco3 to ca hco3 i e na ca hco3 and included em5 representing a relatively dilute water tds 189 mg l table 5 which is very similar to the fresher groundwater observed in the shallow bedrock aquifers of south korea fig 3b the geological and spatial patterns of the five geochemical groups were revealed in the map of neuron distribution in fig 6c and d the dilute and high ph alkaline waters g5 and g3 were widely distributed in south korea while the acidic co2 rich water g2 occurred locally at four areas along the regional fault fracture zones and was spatially restricted within or near the jurassic and cretaceous granitoids fig 1b and 6d meanwhile it seems that most of the sulfate rich water g4 was located preferentially in the cretaceous sedimentary basin fig 1b and 6c while the saline water g1 mostly occurred near the coastal areas of south korea fig 6d 4 1 2 mixing groups it should be noted that the clustering partitions between adjacent groups were ambiguous and the properties of neurons gradually changed on the som in particular in the upper and middle parts of the map for example tds progressively increased or decreased within between the groups on the map fig 6b this result indicates that some neurons on the map were a mixture or a middle way between omnidirectional neighboring neurons thus the four subgroups detected by hca were defined as mixing groups which consisted of half the neurons 52 neurons and 198 samples the mixing groups showed the intermediate properties from neighboring groups rather than distinct geochemistry table 4 moreover m1 and m2 belonging to the high ph na hco3 water pc3 were linked to the other geochemical groups g1 and g2 respectively for instance the na cl type with high tds was observed in m1 it implies that for south korean deep groundwater the five geochemical groups and four mixing groups were interconnected with each other and more than half were under the mixing process 4 2 hydrogeochemical reaction pathways we investigated the hydrogeochemical changes of interlinked neurons and conceptualized reaction pathways among the five geochemical and four mixing groups in a schematic regional hydrogeological diagram fig 7 the reaction pathway for this study addresses a compositional change of the geochemical and mixing groups and informs the hydrogeochemical evolutionary processes in relation to water rock interactions and mixing without considering the groundwater flow note that the aquifer geometry was simplified in fig 7 because of the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties e g fault networks on a national scale and the limited information on deep thermal aquifers e g heat sources in south korea the main geology in fig 7 was granitoids because the neurons on fig 6c were mostly in relation with the granitic rocks gr and half of the groundwater samples n 168 belonged to the granitoids gr group see section 2 2 specifically fig 7 depicts five major reaction pathways controlling the chemistry of south korean deep groundwater we examined the compositional changes of the geochemical groups along each reaction pathway in the following subsections and suggested solute sources as well as evolutionary processes for the distinct geochemical groups of deep groundwater 4 2 1 reaction path 1 for dilute water g5 the dilute deep groundwater g5 exhibited low tds through water rock interactions during groundwater recharge from rainwater reaction path 1 in fig 7 the geochemical facies of this group was the na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 type with low tds and very similar to the shallow groundwater fig 3b on the reaction path 1 i e rain through shallow groundwater to g5 ca2 and hco3 can rapidly increase by the congruent dissolution of trace amounts in carbonates such as disseminated calcite white et al 1999 2005 moreover plagioclase feldspars are very reactive among the rock forming minerals in crystalline rocks goldich 1938 and thus ca2 and na among cations are mainly dissolved into groundwater choi et al 2014 4 2 2 reaction path 2 for high ph alkaline water g3 the dilute water g5 can evolve toward the high ph alkaline water g3 along the reaction path 2 g5 m3 g3 in fig 7 fig 8 shows the compositional changes of neurons with increasing tds on the reaction path 2 and explains the evolutionary process of the dilute deep groundwater g5 toward the high ph alkaline water g3 through the mixing group 3 m3 this path was accompanied by a variation in geochemical facies from na ca hco3 to na hco3 type based on the progressive increases in ph na and alkalinity dominantly hco3 along with tds in groundwater fig 8 since garrels and mackenzie 1967 many studies have proposed that geologic compositions mostly control the compositions of deep groundwater through water rock interactions the na hco3 type groundwater can be evolved from recharging groundwater ca hco3 type through the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspars and the precipitation of secondary clay minerals such as montmorillonite gascoyne and kamineni 1994 banks et al 1998 banks and frengstad 2006 chae et al 2006a in south korea the high ph alkaline water g3 seemed to be mainly controlled by the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspars given that crystalline rocks such as mesozoic granitoids are mostly abundant 50 over south korea fig 1b in fact the s i of albite was less than 0 fig 8 indicating its dissolution underway along the reaction path 2 in addition carbonates as well as secondary clay minerals seemed to precipitate as fracture filling minerals in the high ph alkaline water g3 based on the fact that ca2 and mg2 not shown in fig 8 decreased abruptly with increasing tds and the s i of calcite was oversaturated for most groundwater on the reaction path 2 in contrast to na increasing with tds fig 8 the calcite precipitation controls ca2 depletion and na accumulation during the plagioclase weathering as 3 2 nacaal 3 si 5 o 16 4 co 2 7 h 2 o 2 caco 3 2 na 2 hco 3 4 sio 2 3 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 which has been found in many areas of crystalline rocks nordstrom et al 1989 banks et al 1998 bowser and jones 2002 the process can also be accompanied with cation exchange reactions between fracture filling minerals and groundwater gascoyne and kamineni 1994 chae et al 2006a besides halogen compounds such as cl and f gradually increased with tds on this reaction path 2 fig 8 this result also suggests the significant influences of water rock interactions on the alkaline groundwater because the halogens are generally incorporated into their sources in crystalline rocks such as mineral lattices and fluid inclusions stober and bucher 1999 frape et al 2003 it has been suggested that many hydroxyl bearing minerals such as biotite crystallized in highly saline solutions include the considerable level of cl in the oh lattice site kamineni 1987 as for f hwang 2002 reported that the high f concentration is related to the distribution of cretaceous granitoids in south korea a batch experiment with mesozoic granite and biotite suggested that the dissolution of f bearing biotite might be the primary source of high fluoride concentrations in groundwater chae et al 2006b in addition chae et al 2007 suggested that the high f in groundwater originates from geological sources i e granitic rocks based on the same dataset used in the study the water rock interactions generally raise the so4 2 concentrations in groundwater from a number of sources e g pyrite in crystalline bedrock aquifers such as the hydrothermal origin fritz et al 1994 however so4 2 decreased with increasing tds in the alkaline water fig 8 although parameters related to redox potential were not involved in this study it can be expected that the bacterial reduction influences so4 2 depletion along the reaction path 2 which is commonly reported in brackish groundwater with increasing depth pedersen 1993 fritz et al 1994 kim et al 2014 4 2 3 reaction path 3 for sulfate rich water g4 the neurons with enriched so4 2 and tds were defined as sulfate rich water g4 this group was associated with cretaceous sedimentary basins consisting of clastic sedimentary and volcanic rocks fig 1b and 6c similarly choi et al 2012 reported sulfate rich waters in some formations of non marine sandstone and shale and suggested that their geochemistry is controlled by dedolomitization via evaporite e g gypsum dissolutions in this study this distinct evolutionary process was depicted on the reaction path 3 g3 m4 g4 in fig 7 fig 9 shows the primary compositional changes and equilibrium states i e s i values of calcite dolomite and gypsum in relation to dedolomitization in fig 9 ca2 and mg2 increased while alkalinity i e hco3 decreased with increasing so4 2 this suggests that the geochemistry is controlled by gypsum dissolution and carbonate precipitation in fact this water group g4 was significantly oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite while undersaturated with respect to gypsum such conditions can explain the increasing ca2 and mg2 with the so4 2 as appelo and postma 1999 4 1 8 caso 4 0 8 camg co 3 2 1 6 caco 3 ca 2 0 8 mg 2 1 8 so 4 2 gypsum dissolution may cause dolomite dissolution with calcite precipitation in aquifers and give a constant mg2 ca2 molar ratio average 0 07 in g4 despite the increasing so4 2 concentrations in groundwater in summary this study suggests that the evolutionary process controlling the sulfate rich water is dedolomitization driven by gypsum dissolution in carbonate saturated waters which has been observed by many authors including plummer et al 1990 appelo and postma 1999 moral et al 2008 and choi et al 2012 4 2 4 reaction path 4 for acidic co2 rich water g2 acidic co2 rich water g2 can be evolved along the reaction path 3 g3 m2 g2 which conceptually illustrates the alkaline water g3 affected by co2 gas ascending from deep sources during groundwater circulation in the deep subsurface fig 7 the co2 gas can originate from various sources metamorphic devolatilization magmatic degassing oxidation of organic matter and interaction of water with sedimentary carbonates schoell 1983 chivas et al 1987 harris et al 1997 cartwright et al 2002 rissmann et al 2015 however many authors have suggested that the large amounts of dissolved co2 gas in the co2 rich waters of south korea are derived from deep seated mantle sources based on the carbon isotopic analyses and noble gases in groundwater choi et al 2005 jeong et al 2005 cheong et al 2008 koh et al 2008 for instance cheong et al 2008 reported that a sample of co2 rich water in the jurassic granitoid of the osaek area showed a 3he 4he ratio of 3 3 10 6 which is 2 4 times higher than that of the atmosphere and provides a helium source accompanying co2 gas from the deep mantle fig 10 illustrates the compositional changes of neurons on the reaction path 4 with increasing co2 i e h2co3 and reflects co2 gas affecting the deep groundwater while ph decreased with increasing co2 by dissolving co2 gas tds increased with many inorganic compositions i e sio2 k na ca and mg this reflects how the co2 gas increases the inorganic compositions of groundwater by enhancing water rock interactions i e dissolutions of silicate minerals such as plagioclase feldspars in crystalline rocks in the acid buffering process meanwhile the s i of calcite and albite abruptly decreased in the co2 rich water which implies that the enhanced water rock interactions are facilitated by lowering ph resulting from co2 dissolution in water fig 10 among the major ions cl was not correlated with the other major ions derived from water rock interactions probably because such a soluble salt originates heterogeneously from mineral lattices or fluid inclusions the neurons of co2 rich water were shown to be na hco3 and ca hco3 types the geochemical differences were discussed in various ways in previous studies such as the mixing extent with freshwater choi et al 2005 the solubility difference between albite and anorthite depending on temperature koh et al 2008 and the mineralogical compositions of host rocks jeong et al 2005 additionally the s i for calcite shows that the neurons of co2 rich water were undersaturated or saturated fig 10 and thus the carbonate dissolution precipitation may control the ca na ratio in the co2 rich water depending on temperature and ph during mixing with alkaline water 4 2 5 reaction path 5 for high tds saline groundwater g1 the high tds saline brackish water g1 showed a concentrated na cl type and the highest tds of 8 285 mg l among the five major geochemical groups table 4 the neurons in this group mainly occurred near the coastal areas of south korea regardless of their geological properties fig 6c and 6d thus seawater intrusions likely affected the deep groundwater along the reaction path 5 g5 m1 g1 in fig 7 in fact it has been widely accepted that the high salinity in deep fluids can originate from modern or paleo seawater as an allochthonous source as well as water rock interactions frape et al 2003 kharaka and hanor 2003 in order to explain the evolutionary process for g1 the compositional changes of neurons in this group were illustrated as a function of cl fig 11 in which the theoretical mixing line indicates the conservative mixing process between seawater chae et al 2012 and em5 table 5 non conservative processes during mixing can deviate observed concentrations from the line kim et al 2017 in fig 11 the theoretical mixing line fits the compositional changes of tds na k and so4 2 against the cl concentration which indicates that the concentrated seawater mainly affected g1 by mixing with dilute deep groundwater g5 however the other components such as ca2 mg2 hco3 and sio2 were enriched or depleted from the mixing solution fig 11 in particular ca2 abruptly increased up at em1 and then successively decreased with freshening the excess ca2 can be explained by the reverse cation exchange as 5 2 na ca x 2 2 na x ca 2 which is a typical process during freshening at a seawater groundwater interface langmuir 1997 appelo and postma 1999 kim et al 2017 ca2 is released from the clays x in eq 5 on bedrock surfaces by replacing the prevalent cations such as na in seawater however the na concentration was not balanced with the excess of ca2 concentrations in fig 11 the most likely explanation for the imbalance is that the silicate dissolution such as eq 3 compensates the loss of na due to the exchange reaction this assumption can be demonstrated by the excesses of hco3 and sio2 concentrations which are common products of silicate hydrolysis over the mixing line fig 11 it should be noted that mg2 was depleted in g1 at the initial mixing regardless of the reverse exchange reaction such a deficit of mg2 can be explained by the equilibrium state for carbonates that were highly oversaturated from the initial mixing of seawater s i of calcite and dolomite 0 moreover hco3 showed negative correlations with ca2 and mg2 in g1 and thus carbonate precipitations seemed to be predominant when seawater largely affected the deep groundwater we acknowledge that in general a dolomitization process explains the preferential removal of mg2 in groundwater at a seawater groundwater interface as a function of salinity pco2 and temperature warren 2000 pulido leboeuf 2004 however the dolomitization process needs an undersaturated condition for calcite s i 0 unlike in g1 dolomitization may occur with a more saline em than em1 causing an excess of ca2 and deficit of mg2 during the mixing process therefore the geochemical changes on the reaction path 5 suggest that the high tds saline water g1 is controlled by seawater intrusion accompanied by reverse cation exchange silicate hydrolysis carbonate dissolution precipitation and possibly dolomitization with calcite dissolution 5 summary this study was conducted to characterize the geochemical facies of deep groundwater and to understand their evolutionary processes with water rock interactions and mixing processes under a regional geological setting for these purposes a large hydrochemical dataset with 16 variables was collected from deep groundwater wells n 355 average depth of around 600 m in the spa areas of south korea in particular this study relied on pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis pca and the self organizing map som to quantitatively evaluate the hydrochemical dataset the major geochemical groups were successfully classified and the relationships among the hydrochemical variables were evaluated by visualizing the linear and non linear patterns of the dataset in particular this study showed the advantage of the use of a smaller number of output neurons n 104 displayed in 2d in the som for data interpretation compared to the large number of observed samples n 355 visualized in 3d in pca specifically the pca results suggested three geochemical groups i e high tds na cl type pc1 corresponding to g1 low ph ca na hco3 type pc2 corresponding to g2 high ph na hco3 type pc3 including g3 and three end member em samples and proposed three evolution pathways with mixing to form the three groups the three geochemical characteristics defined using pca were confirmed by the component planes of som the high ph na hco3 water pc3 including 77 of the neuron and 89 of the samples seemed to be a dominant geochemical type of deep groundwater in south korea however the ca na so4 type observed in the durov diagram was missing moreover a distinct characteristic between variables e g so4 was observed within the high ph na hco3 water on the som thus the 80 neurons in the high ph na hco3 water were further clustered on the som by hierarchical cluster analysis hca which distinguished sulfate rich water g4 and dilute freshwater g5 as well as four mixing groups m1 to m4 from the high ph alkaline water g3 as a result the som and pca results with a combination of hca indicated that the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea was characterized by five geochemical groups g1 to g5 including 50 of neurons and 44 of samples and four mixing groups m1 to m4 including 50 neurons and 56 samples on the other hand when using pca only g3 to g5 and m1 to m4 were included into the high ph na hco3 group due to the two extremely distinct geochemical groups g1 and g2 and moreover the large number of data in pc3 made it difficult to distinguish them in addition based on the hydrochemical compositions of grouped neurons evolutionary processes between the five geochemical groups through mixing were discussed the results indicated that south korean deep groundwater has mainly evolved from rain or shallow groundwater through dilute groundwater g5 to high ph alkaline waters g3 in mesozoic granitoids at a regional scale moreover the main geochemical pathway could be locally affected or mixed by other three evolutionary processes related to the formation of g1 g2 and g4 because the grouped neurons are interconnected with each other the recognized hydrogeochemical pattern for deep groundwater in this study will be useful to evaluate deep geologic environments for site selection of high level radioactive waste disposal and geologic co2 storage as well as for sustainable groundwater exploitation in south korea and elsewhere besides the results of this study show that som is a state of the art tool for interpreting a large and complex hydrogeochemical dataset mainly to classify or visualize high dimensional data the som not only reduces the data dimensionality but also provides a small number of output neurons representing a large number of data which is advantageous over pca for data interpretation credit authorship contribution

5265,the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater needs to be characterized for geological co2 storage or radioactive waste disposal however various origins and their interactions and complex hydrogeological conditions make it difficult to assess moreover it is challenging to interpret a large national dataset of hydrochemical variables due to wide composition ranges this study aimed to define the representative geochemical facies of deep groundwater average well depth of 624 262 m obtained from spa areas over south korea by applying both linear principal component analysis pca and non linear self organizing map som dimensionality reduction methods to a large dataset n 355 with 16 hydrochemical variables the som results combined with hierarchical cluster analysis showed that deep thermal groundwater in south korea is classified into five major geochemical groups g1 to g5 with four mixing groups m1 to m4 g1 to g5 represent high tds saline 7 of the samples acidic co2 rich 4 high ph alkaline 14 sulfate rich 9 and dilute freshwater 11 respectively more than half of the samples 56 belonged to the four mixing groups in particular the som reduced the number of samples n 355 to 104 neurons visualizing the cluster structure of samples and the relationship among hydrochemical variables in a 2d array of neurons which made it possible to distinguish the facies g4 and g5 and m1 to m4 that could not be defined by pca due to the extremely distinct geochemistry of g1 and g2 based on the compositional changes of neurons between the geochemical g1 to g5 and mixing m1 to m4 groups major reaction pathways were identified for each geochemical group the hydrochemistry of each group mainly evolves through distinct water rock interactions but is modified by varying degrees of mixing with dilute shallow groundwater during ascent this study provides a state of the art method to interpret a large and complex hydrogeochemical dataset the som is expected to be a useful alternative to pca besides the results of this study can be useful to select a site suitable for geological co2 storage or radioactive waste disposal keywords deep groundwater geochemical groups reaction pathways and mixing self organizing map som principal component analysis pca hierarchical cluster analysis hca 1 introduction deep groundwater is geologically old and highly mineralized and exhibits diverse chemical compositions due to various origins e g meteoric water connate water magmatic water and interactions e g water rock interaction mixing and complex hydrogeological conditions e g diffuse fracture or conduit flow frape et al 1984 2003 nordstrom et al 1989 thus it is difficult to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater in particular the groundwater in deep thermal reservoirs experiences hydrochemical changes through multiple geochemical processes during ascent which makes it more difficult to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater for instance the mixing with shallow groundwater results in dilution e g chae et al 2006a laaksoharju et al 2008 petitta et al 2010 and geochemical reactions such as precipitation adsorption and cation exchange occur during the flow accompanying the changes of geological conditions alt epping et al 2010 kumara and dharmagunawardhane 2017 according to kietäväinen 2017 microbial communities also play a significant role in the changes of groundwater types by biogeochemical reactions especially by contributing to the deep carbon cycle despite these difficulties an understanding of hydrogeochemical characteristics of deep groundwater is one of the primary tasks to evaluate geological repositories for high level radioactive waste larsen et al 2001 metz et al 2003 gómez et al 2006 kietäväinen 2017 and geologic co2 storage auqué et al 2009 feitz et al 2010 this is because radionuclides released from the repository may be transported to the biosphere along groundwater flow paths besides the chemical composition of groundwater affects the stability of engineered or natural barriers us epa 1998 lee et al 2016 and the solubility of the radionuclides duro et al 2010 similarly the hydrochemistry of deep groundwater is expected to affect both the transport and fate of co2 leaked from geologic sequestration sites and the hydrogeochemical reactions in cap rocks overlying the reservoir hemme and van berk 2017 in addition the hydrogeochemical characteristics of deep groundwater influence the rate of co2 mineralization which is the most risk free and permanent form of geological carbon storage choi et al 2012 zhang and depaolo 2017 moreover understanding the chemistry of groundwater and the connectivity between aquifers are essential to determine whether prospective aquifers can be used for geological repositories of radioactive waste or co2 without compromising other activities e g groundwater use for agriculture auqué et al 2009 feitz et al 2010 the dataset for the assessment of appropriate geological repositories is composed of a large number of multiple hydrogeochemical variables multivariate statistical methods have been widely applied to assess and classify the complex and high dimensional hydrogeochemical data principal component analysis pca is one of the most frequently used methods for groundwater quality data kim et al 2009 2017 güler et al 2002 gómez et al 2008 laaksoharju et al 2008 tanasković et al 2012 however if a hydrochemical dataset shows non linear relationships between variables the classical linear statistical method is unreliable and fails to visualize the relations alternatively a self organizing map som which belongs to the domain of unsupervised artificial neural network algorithms has been applied as a non linear surrogate to pca giraudel and lek 2001 yan et al 2001 astel et al 2007 lee et al 2019 the som not only reduces data dimensionality but also provides a small number of output neurons which makes the som useful to interpret a large number of data the som is often combined with clustering tools such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca to reduce the number of output neurons to an appropriate number of groups kiang 2001 choi et al 2014 in this study we assessed a large hydrochemical dataset of deep groundwater n 355 obtained from spa areas in south korea fig 1 using the som and hca to evaluate the relationships among 16 hydrochemical variables and to cluster the deep groundwater into representative geochemical facies on a national scale evolutionary processes between geochemical facies were also discussed based on successive compositional changes and local equilibrium conditions for comparison the durov diagram and pca were also applied for the dataset note that the deep wells in fig 1c were developed for spas and thus deep groundwater strictly means thermal deep groundwater in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of water samples the korean peninsula is located in the margin of the eastern eurasian continent and far from the circum pacific belt fig 1a a hydrochemical dataset obtained by chae et al 2007 from deep wells n 355 in fig 1c in the spa areas was used to characterize the thermal deep groundwater in south korea the average well depth was 624 262 m and the average in situ temperature was 32 5 c table 1 given the average geothermal gradient 27 c km of south korea lim et al 1996 the average in situ temperature represents the deep groundwater in bedrock aquifers the spa wells are optimistic for studying deep groundwater in crystalline bedrock aquifers because the facilities were well constructed for preserving the temperature and water chemistry for example the wells had been cased by concrete reaching to the top of the bedrock to protect the mixing with shallow groundwater note that chae et al 2007 used these groundwater samples to understand the fluoride geochemistry in deep subsurface environments and suggested that the high fluoride in groundwater median 4 4 mg l originates from the mineral composition of granitoids and metamorphic rocks and fluoride can be removed from water by fluorite precipitation when a high ca2 concentration is maintained the dataset consisted of 16 hydrochemical variables including four in situ measurements temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total alkalinity eight major ions ca2 mg2 na k sio2 so4 2 cl and f and four calculated parameters total dissolved solids tds co2 hco3 and co3 2 the three carbonate species in water were calculated from total alkalinity and ph by using the geochemical modeling code phreeqc v2 16 parkhurst and appelo 1999 and the llnl database delany and lundeen 1991 which were also used to calculate the saturation index s i for certain mineral phases in the aquifer details of groundwater sampling analytical methods and qa qc can be found in chae et al 2007 in addition the data of major ionic compositions of rain lee et al 2000 shallow bedrock groundwater kim et al 2015 and seawater chae et al 2012 in south korea were used for comparison specifically lee et al 2000 collected daily precipitation at nine stations in south korea from may 1996 to april 1998 and the average compositions of the rainwater n 796 were used in this study chae et al 2012 collected highly concentrated seawater from the east sea in 2005 the hydrochemical compositions of shallow bedrock groundwater were obtained in 2009 from 37 brands of bottled mineral water that were abstracted from boreholes whose depths were around 200 m kim et al 2015 2 2 geology around groundwater wells tectonically south korea consists of six geologic units which can be summarized into four rock types fig 1b relatively old rocks such as precambrian metamorphic rocks e g gneiss and schist paleozoic and mesozoic sedimentary rocks jurassic and cretaceous granites and young volcanic rocks the jurassic and cretaceous granites and the precambrian gneiss occupy the most terrain of south korea about 50 the details of geology in korea can be found in lee 1988 and chough et al 2000 in this study the lithology was categorized into five groups to specify the geology for each groundwater well granitoids gr metamorphic rocks met volcanic rocks vol sedimentary rocks sed and uncertain or complex rocks mix as a result 168 46 36 51 and 54 wells were classified in the gr met vol sed and mix group respectively we acknowledge that this categorization may oversimplify the geology around each well given the geological heterogeneity even so it can help to overall understand the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater depending on bedrock types note that the distribution of deep groundwater wells generally follows the distribution of cretaceous and jurassic granitoids fig 1 and also half the groundwater samples n 168 belonged to the granitoids gr group this is because the spa areas in south korea have a close relationship with granitoids the heat is probably derived from the radioactive decay of granitoids lee et al 2010 in korea it is difficult to find thermal water related to volcanos unlike in japan which has residual magma at a depth of 5 10 km because the depth of residual magma is about 60 km deeper than in japan the korean peninsula is distant from high potential geothermal heat energy lee et al 2010 2 3 pattern recognitions this study extracted important information from the hydrochemical dataset using both linear i e pca and non linear i e som dimensionality reduction methods both techniques provide low dimensional subspaces maps of the dataset with the minimum loss of information and visualize the dominant patterns behind the data for pca and som the hydrochemical data are standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one which eliminates the influence of different units from measurements and allows each variable to obtain equal importance when measuring the euclidean distance between sample vectors in this study pca was carried out using the statistics toolbox in matlab 7 0 mathworks 2004 while the som toolbox 2 0 in matlab vesanto et al 2000 was used to calculate and visualize the som here we briefly describe the som algorithm and pca 2 3 1 self organizing map som the som is a structure preserving map of a dataset and designed for two main tasks on a large multivariate dataset unsupervised classification and non linear dimensionality reduction kohonen 1982 2001 it deduces the cluster structure of data according to similarities and projects the structure on a low dimensional usually 2d map the som is typically organized on a 2d hexagonal grid with a set of ordered units called neurons that have connection weights w fully connected to all samples of input data x the neurons are also interconnected to adjacent neurons by a neighborhood relation dictating the cluster structure of the input data let x x i i 1 n and w w j i j 1 d i 1 n where n is the number of input samples 355 in this study and d is the total number of neurons both x i and w j i are represented by a p dimensional vector where p is the number of variables 16 in this study table 1 the proper number of neurons can be selected using a heuristic rule e g 5 n suggested by vesanto et al 2000 and validated by garcı a and gonzález 2004 and lee et al 2019 note that the number of output neurons is an important factor for som results whereas there are no precise rules for choosing the number of neurons an iterative learning procedure is introduced into the input dataset to organize neurons according to their similarities as follows 1 initializing weight vectors with small random values 2 calculating and comparing the euclidian distances between each input sample and all neurons 3 finding the best matching unit bmu that is the neuron b closest to the input sample x i 1 x i w b i min j x i w j i and 4 updating bmu and its neighboring neurons to move closer to the input sample x i the weight vector w j i at each time step t 1 is calculated as 2 w j i t 1 w j i t α t h b j t x i w j i t where α t denotes a learning rate and h b j t is a neighborhood kernel function of the neuron j for its bmu b during training both the learning rate and the size of the neighborhood decrease and at the end of training the neurons and weight vectors classify the input dataset according to their similarity on the low dimensional som after the som training the relevant patterns are graphically displayed using two maps of cell types component planes and distance matrices vesanto 1999 the component planes show the weight vector values of each neuron using color codes which can be used to detect correlations between variables unified distance matrices u matrix and median distance matrices d matrix are a standard tool for displaying the cluster structure of the som specifically the u matrix represents the euclidean distance between the weight vectors of neighboring neurons on the map in the color scale while the d matrix presents the median values of the distance in the neurons of the som neurons with low distances i e high similarities can be regarded as a cluster while neurons with high distances i e low similarities can be regarded as cluster boundaries in most som cases the number of output neurons is more than the expected number of groups kiang 2001 therefore hca is widely used on the som results to derive an appropriate number of groups and to facilitate the analysis of the som results herrero and dopazo 2002 sánchez martos et al 2002 choi et al 2014 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca a standard pca model reduces the dimensionality of input data and transforms interdependent variables into independent principal components pcs davis 1986 everitt and dunn 2001 the pcs consist of loadings and scores based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix loadings are normalized eigenvectors between 1 and 1 and considered as the subspace coordinates of data while scores are the observed sample values projected on the subspace using the eigenvectors pc scores can be obtained for supplementary data not used for the pca analysis e g rain shallow bedrock groundwater and seawater in this study by projecting the original data onto the pc coordinates the details for the supplementary data can be founded in jambu 1991 3 results table 1 summarizes the statistics of 16 hydrochemical variables from the 355 deep groundwater samples and shows the wide ranges of concentrations for instance ph ranged from acidic 5 1 to alkaline 10 2 while tds ranged from fresh 34 mg l to saline 21 255 mg l 3 1 hydrochemical types using durov diagram fig 2 shows the variation of relative compositions in dominant cations and anions with tds in the diagram the compositional changes of cations mainly occurred from ca to na while in the case of anions the groundwater samples were widely distributed from hco3 to cl and so4 these variations resulted in scattered plots on the square fields of the diagram fig 2 suggested the occurrence of four hydrochemical types na hco3 ca hco3 na cl and ca na so4 the na hco3 type was dominant while saline water 1000 mg l tds occurred as the concentrations of hco3 or cl increased and showed the ca hco3 and na cl type in addition the ca na so4 type was occasionally observed the four hydrochemical types showed a continuous change between geochemical facies reflecting the evolutionary processes through mixing among various geochemical end members ems which will be discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 4 1 1 3 2 geochemical pattern recognition geochemical pattern recognition pca and som was performed to provide a rigorous explanation of the geochemical facies of deep groundwater and to classify the groundwater geochemistry 3 2 1 geochemical groups and end members in the pc space three pcs whose eigenvalues were more than 1 were extracted as shown in table 2 and fig 3 they accounted for 77 82 of total variance table 2 which indicates that pca achieved a significant dimensionality reduction of the hydrochemical dataset table 2 lists the contributions of each variable pc loadings to the three pcs fig 3 displays the loadings and scores corresponding to the three pcs on the 3d plots and illustrates the relationships between hydrochemical variables and major patterns i e pcs behind observed groundwater samples specifically the loadings in the pc space in fig 3a show that the positively or negatively correlated hydrochemical variables except temperature are spatially grouped although some variables are weakly correlated with pcs table 2 pc1 was correlated with tds ec na k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 while pc2 was correlated with alkalinity hco3 and h2co3 pc3 was negatively correlated with co3 2 f and ph the results imply at least three processes controlling the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea it seems that the positive pc1 and pc2 explain the process for increasing salinity and dissolved inorganic carbon dic respectively whereas the negative sign of pc3 is related to the increases in ph and fluoride f concentration pc1 pc2 and pc3 correspond to the hydrochemical types 3 2 and 1 in fig 2 respectively and the ca na so4 type was not detected using pca fig 3b illustrates the scores of deep groundwater samples projected on the reduced subspace spanned by the three pcs note that most of the groundwater samples were plotted along pc3 consistent with the dominant na hco3 type in fig 2 in addition the variations of sample scores seem linear as depicted with the three red lines in fig 3b these linear features reflect not only the three groups of deep groundwater but also three geochemical evolutionary processes with mixing corresponding to the pcs laaksoharju et al 1999 we characterized the three geochemical groups as high tds na cl type pc1 low ph ca na hco3 type pc2 and high ph na hco3 type pc3 in the pc space fig 3b respectively and selected three em samples along each pathway fig 3b table 3 additionally we projected the hydrochemistry of rain n 1 an average of lee et al 2000 shallow bedrock groundwater n 37 and seawater of south korea n 1 on the pc space by using the three eigenvectors obtained from the pca analysis the seawater projected on the pc space was strongly related to pc1 fig 3b and em1 pc1 was similar to the seawater table 3 it seems that the high tds na cl type pc1 originated from an external saline source such as seawater fig 3b shows that the scores of three deep groundwater groups converged into a single zone in which rain black triangle and shallow groundwater green circles were presented this pattern indicates that the geochemistry of deep groundwater with three ems was mixed into the shallow groundwater during ascent from a different view the recharging groundwater from rain in the shallow zone evolved into the three geochemical types of deep groundwater the evolutionary process with mixing will be further discussed in section 4 2 it seems that pca effectively explained the hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater using the three pcs however it was difficult to further interpret the large number n 355 of water samples in particular the high ph na hco3 type waters with decreasing pc3 scores moreover pca resulted in the loss of some information such as the geochemical facies of ca na so4 type in the durov diagram fig 2 for these reasons the hydrochemical dataset was introduced into the som 3 2 2 geochemical grouping using component planes the som algorithm trained the hydrochemical dataset n 355 with 16 variables and consequently created the 2d output grid in fig 4 which consists of eight by thirteen neurons that comprise similar input samples sharing a bmu in fig 4 each component plane shows the weight vector values of each variable in the 104 neurons and the weight vector values correspond to the standardized values of original data the geochemical compositions of each neuron correspond to the composites of weight vectors comparison of the patterns of component variable planes allows for an instant recognition of the mutual dependencies among the 16 variables fig 4 specifically there were significant relationships between ec tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 and cl the ion concentrations abruptly increased on the neurons at the bottom right corner of the maps the groundwater samples closely related to increasing tds were explained by pc1 and thus the neurons at the bottom right corner indicated the high tds na cl type group meanwhile the variables of dic i e alkalinity h2co3 and hco3 significantly increased in the bottom left corner of the maps in which the ph value gradually decreased this pattern coincides with pc2 and thus the neurons in the bottom left corner indicated the low ph ca na hco3 group in addition ph carbonate co3 2 and fluoride f revealed patterns similar to each other the highest values were observed on the neurons at the top left corner and gradually decreased along the diagonal direction on the maps these relationships correspond to the negative sign of pc3 and suggest the high ph na hco3 group in summary the component planes showed that the som preserved the geochemical characteristics explained by the three pcs moreover most of the neurons belonged to the high ph na hco3 type corresponding to pc3 which also had most of groundwater samples in fig 3b the som and pca results indicate that the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea is mainly characterized by the high ph na hco3 type which is also consistent with the results in fig 2 3 2 3 cluster structure of the hydrochemical dataset using distance matrices the cluster structure of the hydrochemical dataset can be shown in the maps of distance matrices by visualizing the distances between neurons as in fig 5 red and blue in fig 5 represent the longest and shortest distance between neurons respectively specifically in the u matrix red corresponds to a large distance and thus a big gap between values in the input space while blue signifies that the vectors are close to each other in the input space thus bluish colored areas can be thought of as clusters whereas reddish areas are cluster separators fig 5a meanwhile the d matrix projects a single value on each neuron of the som by measuring the median distances to neighbors fig 5b the matrices in fig 5 show that the distances between neighboring neurons or samples significantly increased at the bottom of the map and thus the neighboring neurons at the bottom of the map can be separated into two groups while most of the neurons in the upper and middle parts of the map were closely related to each other therefore it is clear that the cluster structure of south korean deep groundwater mainly consisted of three major groups as discussed using the results of pca the high tds na cl type and the low ph ca na hco3 type at the bottom of the map and the high ph na hco3 type in the upper and middle parts of the map in fig 5 3 2 4 clustering using hierarchical cluster analysis a detailed investigation of neurons suggested that the geochemistry of the dominant high ph na hco3 water can be subdivided for instance the so4 2 concentration increased in the top right corner of the map fig 4 revealing the presence of a geochemical facies of ca na so4 type in fig 2 therefore we classified the high ph na hco3 groundwater into subgroups based on the cluster structure on the som for this purpose hca was applied to the som by measuring the squared euclidean distance between weight vectors of neurons the groups defined by hca were depicted on the d matrix in fig 5b the number of subdivisions 9 was chosen based on the linkage distances of the hca dendrogram specially the som neurons were separated into three groups at the elevated distances of the dendrogram red lines then the neurons in the high ph na hco3 water group were classified into seven subgroups at the low linkage distances white lines as a result there were nine statistically different groups on the som according to the cluster structure fig 5b in order to characterize the geochemical properties of each group we investigated the geochemical compositions of the component planes fig 4 that can be returned from means and variances used in standardization table 4 summarizes the statistics of geochemical compositions returned components of weight vectors of the grouped neurons according to the cluster structure which will be discussed in section 4 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical grouping based on pca and som analysis as well as the durov diagram nine statistically different groups i e five geochemical groups g1 to g5 and four mixing groups m1 to m4 were suggested in fig 6 a and table 4 and distinct ems were selected from each geochemical group in table 5 hereinafter the five geochemical groups g1 to g5 are called high tds saline water acidic co2 rich water high ph alkaline water sulfate rich water and dilute freshwater respectively as in fig 6a it is noticeable that g1 and g2 corresponded to pc1 high tds na cl type and pc2 low ph ca na hco3 type respectively while the other groups were included in pc3 high ph na hco3 type before clustering into seven subdivisions 4 1 1 geochemical groups with distinct end members the five geochemical groups g1 to g5 represent the distinct geochemistry of deep groundwater in particular their inherent compositions can be recognized by choosing their em neurons em1 to em5 fig 6a and table 5 specifically the two geochemical groups on the bottom of the som were brackish 1000 mg l the high tds saline water g1 14 neurons and 25 samples and the acidic co2 rich water g2 10 neurons and 13 samples which were consistent with the na cl type and the ca hco3 type in fig 2 respectively the average tds values of both groups were 3 421 and 1 556 mg l which were contributed mainly by cl avg 43 64 mmol l and dissolved inorganic carbon dic avg 16 24 meq l alkalinity among anions respectively table 4 for g1 the neuron with the highest tds 8 285 mg l was chosen as em1 table 5 in the case of g2 the geochemical facies changed from the ca hco3 to na hco3 type i e ca na hco3 type and thus a neuron showing the highest tds 2 618 mg l and the lowest ph 6 2 was chosen as em2 within the group table 5 the upper and middle parts of the som were classified into three distinct geochemical groups g3 to g5 fig 6a among them g3 12 neurons and 49 samples represented the typical high ph alkaline water average ph 9 2 and mostly showed the na hco3 type with high f avg 0 72 mmol l table 4 in this group the neuron with the highest tds 374 mg l and ph 9 4 was selected as em3 table 5 in the upper right corner of the som the seven neurons 32 samples showed the highest values of so4 2 avg 1 20 mmol l as well as tds avg 420 mg l among the subgroups of the high ph na hco3 water fig 4 and fig 6b and thus was termed as the sulfate rich water g4 this group also showed relatively high concentrations of ca2 avg 0 64 mmol l compared to g3 and belonged to the ca na so4 or na ca so4 type fig 2 a neuron showing the highest tds 691 mg l and so4 2 2 32 mmol l was defined as em4 for this group lastly the dilute freshwater g5 consisted of nine neurons 38 samples and showed the lowest tds avg 216 mg l this group showed the geochemical facies ranging from na hco3 to ca hco3 i e na ca hco3 and included em5 representing a relatively dilute water tds 189 mg l table 5 which is very similar to the fresher groundwater observed in the shallow bedrock aquifers of south korea fig 3b the geological and spatial patterns of the five geochemical groups were revealed in the map of neuron distribution in fig 6c and d the dilute and high ph alkaline waters g5 and g3 were widely distributed in south korea while the acidic co2 rich water g2 occurred locally at four areas along the regional fault fracture zones and was spatially restricted within or near the jurassic and cretaceous granitoids fig 1b and 6d meanwhile it seems that most of the sulfate rich water g4 was located preferentially in the cretaceous sedimentary basin fig 1b and 6c while the saline water g1 mostly occurred near the coastal areas of south korea fig 6d 4 1 2 mixing groups it should be noted that the clustering partitions between adjacent groups were ambiguous and the properties of neurons gradually changed on the som in particular in the upper and middle parts of the map for example tds progressively increased or decreased within between the groups on the map fig 6b this result indicates that some neurons on the map were a mixture or a middle way between omnidirectional neighboring neurons thus the four subgroups detected by hca were defined as mixing groups which consisted of half the neurons 52 neurons and 198 samples the mixing groups showed the intermediate properties from neighboring groups rather than distinct geochemistry table 4 moreover m1 and m2 belonging to the high ph na hco3 water pc3 were linked to the other geochemical groups g1 and g2 respectively for instance the na cl type with high tds was observed in m1 it implies that for south korean deep groundwater the five geochemical groups and four mixing groups were interconnected with each other and more than half were under the mixing process 4 2 hydrogeochemical reaction pathways we investigated the hydrogeochemical changes of interlinked neurons and conceptualized reaction pathways among the five geochemical and four mixing groups in a schematic regional hydrogeological diagram fig 7 the reaction pathway for this study addresses a compositional change of the geochemical and mixing groups and informs the hydrogeochemical evolutionary processes in relation to water rock interactions and mixing without considering the groundwater flow note that the aquifer geometry was simplified in fig 7 because of the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties e g fault networks on a national scale and the limited information on deep thermal aquifers e g heat sources in south korea the main geology in fig 7 was granitoids because the neurons on fig 6c were mostly in relation with the granitic rocks gr and half of the groundwater samples n 168 belonged to the granitoids gr group see section 2 2 specifically fig 7 depicts five major reaction pathways controlling the chemistry of south korean deep groundwater we examined the compositional changes of the geochemical groups along each reaction pathway in the following subsections and suggested solute sources as well as evolutionary processes for the distinct geochemical groups of deep groundwater 4 2 1 reaction path 1 for dilute water g5 the dilute deep groundwater g5 exhibited low tds through water rock interactions during groundwater recharge from rainwater reaction path 1 in fig 7 the geochemical facies of this group was the na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 type with low tds and very similar to the shallow groundwater fig 3b on the reaction path 1 i e rain through shallow groundwater to g5 ca2 and hco3 can rapidly increase by the congruent dissolution of trace amounts in carbonates such as disseminated calcite white et al 1999 2005 moreover plagioclase feldspars are very reactive among the rock forming minerals in crystalline rocks goldich 1938 and thus ca2 and na among cations are mainly dissolved into groundwater choi et al 2014 4 2 2 reaction path 2 for high ph alkaline water g3 the dilute water g5 can evolve toward the high ph alkaline water g3 along the reaction path 2 g5 m3 g3 in fig 7 fig 8 shows the compositional changes of neurons with increasing tds on the reaction path 2 and explains the evolutionary process of the dilute deep groundwater g5 toward the high ph alkaline water g3 through the mixing group 3 m3 this path was accompanied by a variation in geochemical facies from na ca hco3 to na hco3 type based on the progressive increases in ph na and alkalinity dominantly hco3 along with tds in groundwater fig 8 since garrels and mackenzie 1967 many studies have proposed that geologic compositions mostly control the compositions of deep groundwater through water rock interactions the na hco3 type groundwater can be evolved from recharging groundwater ca hco3 type through the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspars and the precipitation of secondary clay minerals such as montmorillonite gascoyne and kamineni 1994 banks et al 1998 banks and frengstad 2006 chae et al 2006a in south korea the high ph alkaline water g3 seemed to be mainly controlled by the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspars given that crystalline rocks such as mesozoic granitoids are mostly abundant 50 over south korea fig 1b in fact the s i of albite was less than 0 fig 8 indicating its dissolution underway along the reaction path 2 in addition carbonates as well as secondary clay minerals seemed to precipitate as fracture filling minerals in the high ph alkaline water g3 based on the fact that ca2 and mg2 not shown in fig 8 decreased abruptly with increasing tds and the s i of calcite was oversaturated for most groundwater on the reaction path 2 in contrast to na increasing with tds fig 8 the calcite precipitation controls ca2 depletion and na accumulation during the plagioclase weathering as 3 2 nacaal 3 si 5 o 16 4 co 2 7 h 2 o 2 caco 3 2 na 2 hco 3 4 sio 2 3 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 which has been found in many areas of crystalline rocks nordstrom et al 1989 banks et al 1998 bowser and jones 2002 the process can also be accompanied with cation exchange reactions between fracture filling minerals and groundwater gascoyne and kamineni 1994 chae et al 2006a besides halogen compounds such as cl and f gradually increased with tds on this reaction path 2 fig 8 this result also suggests the significant influences of water rock interactions on the alkaline groundwater because the halogens are generally incorporated into their sources in crystalline rocks such as mineral lattices and fluid inclusions stober and bucher 1999 frape et al 2003 it has been suggested that many hydroxyl bearing minerals such as biotite crystallized in highly saline solutions include the considerable level of cl in the oh lattice site kamineni 1987 as for f hwang 2002 reported that the high f concentration is related to the distribution of cretaceous granitoids in south korea a batch experiment with mesozoic granite and biotite suggested that the dissolution of f bearing biotite might be the primary source of high fluoride concentrations in groundwater chae et al 2006b in addition chae et al 2007 suggested that the high f in groundwater originates from geological sources i e granitic rocks based on the same dataset used in the study the water rock interactions generally raise the so4 2 concentrations in groundwater from a number of sources e g pyrite in crystalline bedrock aquifers such as the hydrothermal origin fritz et al 1994 however so4 2 decreased with increasing tds in the alkaline water fig 8 although parameters related to redox potential were not involved in this study it can be expected that the bacterial reduction influences so4 2 depletion along the reaction path 2 which is commonly reported in brackish groundwater with increasing depth pedersen 1993 fritz et al 1994 kim et al 2014 4 2 3 reaction path 3 for sulfate rich water g4 the neurons with enriched so4 2 and tds were defined as sulfate rich water g4 this group was associated with cretaceous sedimentary basins consisting of clastic sedimentary and volcanic rocks fig 1b and 6c similarly choi et al 2012 reported sulfate rich waters in some formations of non marine sandstone and shale and suggested that their geochemistry is controlled by dedolomitization via evaporite e g gypsum dissolutions in this study this distinct evolutionary process was depicted on the reaction path 3 g3 m4 g4 in fig 7 fig 9 shows the primary compositional changes and equilibrium states i e s i values of calcite dolomite and gypsum in relation to dedolomitization in fig 9 ca2 and mg2 increased while alkalinity i e hco3 decreased with increasing so4 2 this suggests that the geochemistry is controlled by gypsum dissolution and carbonate precipitation in fact this water group g4 was significantly oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite while undersaturated with respect to gypsum such conditions can explain the increasing ca2 and mg2 with the so4 2 as appelo and postma 1999 4 1 8 caso 4 0 8 camg co 3 2 1 6 caco 3 ca 2 0 8 mg 2 1 8 so 4 2 gypsum dissolution may cause dolomite dissolution with calcite precipitation in aquifers and give a constant mg2 ca2 molar ratio average 0 07 in g4 despite the increasing so4 2 concentrations in groundwater in summary this study suggests that the evolutionary process controlling the sulfate rich water is dedolomitization driven by gypsum dissolution in carbonate saturated waters which has been observed by many authors including plummer et al 1990 appelo and postma 1999 moral et al 2008 and choi et al 2012 4 2 4 reaction path 4 for acidic co2 rich water g2 acidic co2 rich water g2 can be evolved along the reaction path 3 g3 m2 g2 which conceptually illustrates the alkaline water g3 affected by co2 gas ascending from deep sources during groundwater circulation in the deep subsurface fig 7 the co2 gas can originate from various sources metamorphic devolatilization magmatic degassing oxidation of organic matter and interaction of water with sedimentary carbonates schoell 1983 chivas et al 1987 harris et al 1997 cartwright et al 2002 rissmann et al 2015 however many authors have suggested that the large amounts of dissolved co2 gas in the co2 rich waters of south korea are derived from deep seated mantle sources based on the carbon isotopic analyses and noble gases in groundwater choi et al 2005 jeong et al 2005 cheong et al 2008 koh et al 2008 for instance cheong et al 2008 reported that a sample of co2 rich water in the jurassic granitoid of the osaek area showed a 3he 4he ratio of 3 3 10 6 which is 2 4 times higher than that of the atmosphere and provides a helium source accompanying co2 gas from the deep mantle fig 10 illustrates the compositional changes of neurons on the reaction path 4 with increasing co2 i e h2co3 and reflects co2 gas affecting the deep groundwater while ph decreased with increasing co2 by dissolving co2 gas tds increased with many inorganic compositions i e sio2 k na ca and mg this reflects how the co2 gas increases the inorganic compositions of groundwater by enhancing water rock interactions i e dissolutions of silicate minerals such as plagioclase feldspars in crystalline rocks in the acid buffering process meanwhile the s i of calcite and albite abruptly decreased in the co2 rich water which implies that the enhanced water rock interactions are facilitated by lowering ph resulting from co2 dissolution in water fig 10 among the major ions cl was not correlated with the other major ions derived from water rock interactions probably because such a soluble salt originates heterogeneously from mineral lattices or fluid inclusions the neurons of co2 rich water were shown to be na hco3 and ca hco3 types the geochemical differences were discussed in various ways in previous studies such as the mixing extent with freshwater choi et al 2005 the solubility difference between albite and anorthite depending on temperature koh et al 2008 and the mineralogical compositions of host rocks jeong et al 2005 additionally the s i for calcite shows that the neurons of co2 rich water were undersaturated or saturated fig 10 and thus the carbonate dissolution precipitation may control the ca na ratio in the co2 rich water depending on temperature and ph during mixing with alkaline water 4 2 5 reaction path 5 for high tds saline groundwater g1 the high tds saline brackish water g1 showed a concentrated na cl type and the highest tds of 8 285 mg l among the five major geochemical groups table 4 the neurons in this group mainly occurred near the coastal areas of south korea regardless of their geological properties fig 6c and 6d thus seawater intrusions likely affected the deep groundwater along the reaction path 5 g5 m1 g1 in fig 7 in fact it has been widely accepted that the high salinity in deep fluids can originate from modern or paleo seawater as an allochthonous source as well as water rock interactions frape et al 2003 kharaka and hanor 2003 in order to explain the evolutionary process for g1 the compositional changes of neurons in this group were illustrated as a function of cl fig 11 in which the theoretical mixing line indicates the conservative mixing process between seawater chae et al 2012 and em5 table 5 non conservative processes during mixing can deviate observed concentrations from the line kim et al 2017 in fig 11 the theoretical mixing line fits the compositional changes of tds na k and so4 2 against the cl concentration which indicates that the concentrated seawater mainly affected g1 by mixing with dilute deep groundwater g5 however the other components such as ca2 mg2 hco3 and sio2 were enriched or depleted from the mixing solution fig 11 in particular ca2 abruptly increased up at em1 and then successively decreased with freshening the excess ca2 can be explained by the reverse cation exchange as 5 2 na ca x 2 2 na x ca 2 which is a typical process during freshening at a seawater groundwater interface langmuir 1997 appelo and postma 1999 kim et al 2017 ca2 is released from the clays x in eq 5 on bedrock surfaces by replacing the prevalent cations such as na in seawater however the na concentration was not balanced with the excess of ca2 concentrations in fig 11 the most likely explanation for the imbalance is that the silicate dissolution such as eq 3 compensates the loss of na due to the exchange reaction this assumption can be demonstrated by the excesses of hco3 and sio2 concentrations which are common products of silicate hydrolysis over the mixing line fig 11 it should be noted that mg2 was depleted in g1 at the initial mixing regardless of the reverse exchange reaction such a deficit of mg2 can be explained by the equilibrium state for carbonates that were highly oversaturated from the initial mixing of seawater s i of calcite and dolomite 0 moreover hco3 showed negative correlations with ca2 and mg2 in g1 and thus carbonate precipitations seemed to be predominant when seawater largely affected the deep groundwater we acknowledge that in general a dolomitization process explains the preferential removal of mg2 in groundwater at a seawater groundwater interface as a function of salinity pco2 and temperature warren 2000 pulido leboeuf 2004 however the dolomitization process needs an undersaturated condition for calcite s i 0 unlike in g1 dolomitization may occur with a more saline em than em1 causing an excess of ca2 and deficit of mg2 during the mixing process therefore the geochemical changes on the reaction path 5 suggest that the high tds saline water g1 is controlled by seawater intrusion accompanied by reverse cation exchange silicate hydrolysis carbonate dissolution precipitation and possibly dolomitization with calcite dissolution 5 summary this study was conducted to characterize the geochemical facies of deep groundwater and to understand their evolutionary processes with water rock interactions and mixing processes under a regional geological setting for these purposes a large hydrochemical dataset with 16 variables was collected from deep groundwater wells n 355 average depth of around 600 m in the spa areas of south korea in particular this study relied on pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis pca and the self organizing map som to quantitatively evaluate the hydrochemical dataset the major geochemical groups were successfully classified and the relationships among the hydrochemical variables were evaluated by visualizing the linear and non linear patterns of the dataset in particular this study showed the advantage of the use of a smaller number of output neurons n 104 displayed in 2d in the som for data interpretation compared to the large number of observed samples n 355 visualized in 3d in pca specifically the pca results suggested three geochemical groups i e high tds na cl type pc1 corresponding to g1 low ph ca na hco3 type pc2 corresponding to g2 high ph na hco3 type pc3 including g3 and three end member em samples and proposed three evolution pathways with mixing to form the three groups the three geochemical characteristics defined using pca were confirmed by the component planes of som the high ph na hco3 water pc3 including 77 of the neuron and 89 of the samples seemed to be a dominant geochemical type of deep groundwater in south korea however the ca na so4 type observed in the durov diagram was missing moreover a distinct characteristic between variables e g so4 was observed within the high ph na hco3 water on the som thus the 80 neurons in the high ph na hco3 water were further clustered on the som by hierarchical cluster analysis hca which distinguished sulfate rich water g4 and dilute freshwater g5 as well as four mixing groups m1 to m4 from the high ph alkaline water g3 as a result the som and pca results with a combination of hca indicated that the geochemistry of deep groundwater in south korea was characterized by five geochemical groups g1 to g5 including 50 of neurons and 44 of samples and four mixing groups m1 to m4 including 50 neurons and 56 samples on the other hand when using pca only g3 to g5 and m1 to m4 were included into the high ph na hco3 group due to the two extremely distinct geochemical groups g1 and g2 and moreover the large number of data in pc3 made it difficult to distinguish them in addition based on the hydrochemical compositions of grouped neurons evolutionary processes between the five geochemical groups through mixing were discussed the results indicated that south korean deep groundwater has mainly evolved from rain or shallow groundwater through dilute groundwater g5 to high ph alkaline waters g3 in mesozoic granitoids at a regional scale moreover the main geochemical pathway could be locally affected or mixed by other three evolutionary processes related to the formation of g1 g2 and g4 because the grouped neurons are interconnected with each other the recognized hydrogeochemical pattern for deep groundwater in this study will be useful to evaluate deep geologic environments for site selection of high level radioactive waste disposal and geologic co2 storage as well as for sustainable groundwater exploitation in south korea and elsewhere besides the results of this study show that som is a state of the art tool for interpreting a large and complex hydrogeochemical dataset mainly to classify or visualize high dimensional data the som not only reduces the data dimensionality but also provides a small number of output neurons representing a large number of data which is advantageous over pca for data interpretation credit authorship contribution

5266,soil moisture sm and near surface temperature variations are known to be linked through land atmosphere interactions while previous investigators have examined the association between temperature extremes and large scale atmospheric circulation variability the role of land atmosphere coupling on temperature extremes over the monsoon dominated region of india is not well understood this study presents an analysis of hydro meteorological datasets for the 67 year period 1948 2014 to assess the impact of long term soil moisture changes on temperature extremes over the indian region firstly our findings show that the hot spot of land atmosphere coupling located across north central india nci is a region where sm variations can significantly influence temperature extremes we further note that the nci region experienced a significant declining trend in sm about 1 1 mm decade during 1948 2014 in association with the decreasing trend of monsoon precipitation our findings suggest that the long term decrease of sm over the nci has favored increased incidence of temperature extremes through strengthening weakening of sensible latent heat fluxes while the loss of soil moisture memory has additionally promoted increased variability of temperature extremes the frequency duration and variability of extreme temperatures are found to increase significantly by 1 2 occurrences 5 6 days and 43 respectively in association with a decrease of 10 mm sm over nci the generalized extreme value gev distributions are fitted to extreme temperature duration extd using sm as a covariate to quantify the role of sm on temperature extremes over nci gev analysis reveals that drier sm conditions 10th percentile lead to an increase in the 67 year return value of extd by 9 10 days relative to wet sm conditions 90th percentile over nci furthermore it is interesting to note that the rise in temperature extremes over nci in the recent three decades has been more prominent during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons as compared to the pre monsoon months keywords temperature extremes soil moisture memory soil moisture temperature coupling north central india generalized extreme value distribution surface energy partitioning 1 introduction the linkage between global warming and long term changes in the frequency severity and duration of extreme temperature events has been a topic of great scientific interest and societal importance baldwin et al 2019 patz et al 2005 fischer and schär 2010 im et al 2017 ipcc special report 2018 shiva et al 2019 anthropogenic climate change is recognized as the dominant cause for the increasing trend of global mean temperature since the 19th century however variations in extreme temperatures over different areas of the globe can be influenced by interactions involving atmospheric dynamics land atmosphere feedbacks water vapour and cloud feedbacks with radiation and other processes see ipcc 2014 perkins kirkpatrick et al 2016 perkins 2015 the enhancement of hot extremes under climate change assumes greater significance particularly over densely inhabited regions such as south asia which are highly vulnerable to extreme temperature conditions sheikh et al 2015 heat waves over india are a distinctive type of weather event which is defined by the india meteorological department imd as a continuous spell of abnormally hot weather heat waves over the indian region occur during the pre monsoon months from march to june ratnam et al 2016 and sometimes even during july as well raghavan 1966 severe heat waves in the region are known to exert adverse physiological sociological and agricultural impacts im et al 2017 patz et al 2005 there is considerable spatial variability in the maximum number of heat wave occurrences across different parts of india de et al 2005 kothawale et al 2010 pai et al 2013 soil moisture sm variations are known to influence the persistence and amplification of surface temperature extremes through land atmosphere coupling processes ferranti and viterbo 2006 numerical experiments using atmospheric general circulation models gcm indicate that the persistence of the near surface temperature and precipitation response to sm variations depends on the memory characteristics of the sm anomalies delworth and manabe 1988 manabe and delworth 1990 rahman and lu 2015 seneviratne et al 2006a basically soil moisture memory smm is a measure of the remembrance time scale of soil moisture anomalies govern by atmospheric forcing delworth and manabe 1988 rahman and lu 2015 along with other quantities of the climate system the persistence time scale of sm is a crucial element for understanding land atmosphere coupling seneviratne et al 2006b and improve their representation in climate models dirmeyer 2000 koster et al 2010 earlier studies have examined the influence of local scale processes and remotely forced atmospheric circulation anomalies on temperature extremes over the indian region ghatak et al 2017 murari et al 2016 rohini et al 2016 ratnam et al 2016 de and mukhopadhyay 1998 atmospheric teleconnection patterns during the evolution of el niño southern oscillation events are known to induce subsidence and clear sky conditions over the arabian sea so as to weaken the south westerly flow thereby leading to persist the extreme temperature conditions over the indian landmass murari et al 2016 de and mukhopadhyay 1998 on the other hand ratnam et al 2016 identified two distinct physical mechanisms for heat waves over north central and east coastal indian regions respectively their results suggest that heat waves over north central india are linked to atmospheric blocking events over the north atlantic whereas heat waves over east coastal and south eastern parts of india have linkages to anomalous cooling in the tropical west pacific while taking note of the aforementioned studies the role of sm changes on the variability of extreme temperatures over the monsoon dominated indian landmass is not well understood based on high resolution climate model simulations ramarao et al 2016 pointed to the role soil moisture temperature coupling on the persistence of warmer than normal surface air temperature anomalies associated with a weakening trend of the indian summer monsoon krishnan et al 2016 given that land atmosphere coupling over the indian region extends beyond the summer monsoon rainy season this study aims to understand the role of soil moisture variations on the evolution of temperature extremes over india this paper organised as follows section 2 provides datasets and methodology used in this study for analysis results and discussion of present study which highlights the changes in extreme temperature characteristics and its linkage with sm over the strongly coupled regions of india are described in section 3 finally section 4 covers the summary and conclusions 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the global land data assimilation system

administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep gldas data generated by incorporating satellite as well as ground based observational product in the land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques gldas is the best high resolution data available at various global and climate scale from 1948 to present moreover general features like sm and rainfall rf variations in gldas outputs are well in agreement with the observations over the indian region sathyanadh et al 2016 currently gldas drives four land surface models lsms noah the community land model clm the

product is extended using the method by dong and crow 2018 over nci region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling as discussed in the section 2 2 1 and cosmos iitm pune for this validation purpose three different satellite observational datasets such as advance microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 owe et al 2008 soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos fernandez moran et al 2017 were used along with datasets mention above our study also uses high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rf mean temperature datasets prepared by imd rao et al 2009 pai et al 2015 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 soil moisture temperature coupling metric sm interacts with near surface air temperature through its effect on sensible heat flux shf and latent heat flux lhf such interaction between sm and temperature generally termed as soil moisture temperature coupling seneviratne et al 2010 previous experimental studies of soil moisture temperature coupling based on the model and statistical methods mainly restricted to summer month fischer et al 2007 miralles et al 2012 however the influence of sm on temperature extremes extends beyond the summer season therefore it is also essential to carefully consider the interactions between sm and surface air temperature throughout all the seasons soil moisture temperature coupling in the present study is estimated using two different methods proposed by miralles et al 2012 method 1 and dong and crow 2018 method 2 over india on entire annual cycle the second method by dong and crow 2018 is mainly applied to cross validate the coupling strength of gldas dataset using satellite and in situ observations over the indian domain these methods are described in detail below a method 1 the method based on miralles et al 2012 uses actual evaporation or latent heat flux λe where λ is called latent heat of vaporisation potential evaporation e p net radiation r n and 2 meter air temperature t2m to evaluate soil moisture temperature coupling strength soil moisture temperature coupling metric π is given below 1 π ρ h t 2 m ρ h p t 2 m where ρ is the pearson s correlation coefficient h r n λ e and h p r n λ e p higher values of π indicate the region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling thus hotspots π highlights the regions where the sm can have a significant influence on the surface energy partitioning and near surface temperature variability additionally lower or zero values of π indicates regions of weaker soil moisture temperature coupling for a shorter time scale daily soil moisture temperature coupling for day i can be defined as 2 π i t i t σ t h i h σ h h p i h p σ h p where t h h p are mean of time series of t h h p respectively more detail description of π can be found in miralles et al 2012 a method 2 the second approach to estimate and cross validate gldas soil moisture temperature coupling strength over the north central nci and cosmos iitm area pune is based on the dong and crow 2018 process in this process soil moisture temperature coupling strength was computed as an absolute value of the zero lag rank correlation coefficient of daily soil moisture sm and 2 m daily mean air temperature t2m anomalies at each grid cell eq 3 since our main interest is to quantify the role of drier sm conditions 10th percentile in extreme temperature incidences beyond the summer season only negative sm anomalies are considered in each grid cell for all months anomalies of sm and t2m determined by eliminating the 31 day running annual mean of two variables over the multiple years chen et al 2018 dong and crow 2018 following this method the absolute value of the area averaged soil moisture temperature correlations was considered for the determination of the coupling strength by removing the positive values for each grid cell the true absolute rank correlation r true of the sm anomaly θ and 2 m air temperature anomaly t time series are computed as follows 3 r true c θ t c θ θ c tt where c denotes covariance of corresponding subscripts for example c θ t represents the covariance between sm anomaly and 2 m air temperature anomaly for more effective computation of soil moisture temperature coupling strength from the satellite observation datasets coupling metric needs to consider observational error in θ and t dong and crow

correlation based on satellite observations c e θ e t error covariance between sm and t2m c e t e t and c vv error variance of t2m and non orthogonal components of sm respectively and β is positive constant comprehensive information about covariance of temperature error covariance of sm error and effect of non orthogonal sm error in the various satellite observations can be found at dong and crow 2018 2 2 2 extreme temperature index this section provides a detail description of the extreme temperature index used in the study the extreme temperature index can be defined using several criterion over various parts of the world based on regional climate nairn and fawcett 2013 the most commonly used criteria of temperature extreme in the united states of america is based on the persistence of daily maximum temperature exceeding 32 2 c for at least three consecutive days the heat wave over australia is generally identified if the daily maximum temperature exceeds 35 c for at least five consecutive days or 40 c for at least three consecutive days the criteria of heat wave described by imd are based on maximum temperature over the indian stations the details can be found in pai et al 2013 in the present study we have used daily mean t2m from gldas for defining the extreme temperature index extreme temperature event defined if daily mean t2m anomalies at each grid point are greater than or equal to 3 c and persist at least for three consecutive days daily t2m anomalies derived from daily climatology at each grid point for the reference period 1948 to 2014 further these temperature extremes indices over the strong soil moisture temperature coupling zone north central india are characterised on entire annual cycle by describing extreme temperature duration extd and extreme temperature frequency extf per year for the calculation of area averaged trends see fig 4 2 2 3 generalized extreme value gev distribution the present study evaluates the quantitative relationship between extreme temperature and sm using extreme value theory whan et al 2015 in this study our main aim is to consider the potential effects of soil moisture on temperature extremes beyond the summer season over the strong land atmosphere coupling region characteristic of extreme temperature i e extd extreme temperature days is used for fitting the generalized extreme value gev distributions for the period 1948 2014 with and without an index of surface soil moisture as a covariate analysis of gev distribution is carried out with the help of r statistical computing software using the exremes package r core team 2016 gilleland and katz 2016 gev distribution analysis has been performed in two different steps in the first step the stationary gev model is fitted to the total number of extreme temperature duration of each year with no covariate eq 5 the gev distribution has three crucial parameters location parameter μ scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ the μ explains the mean of the fitted distribution variability of the data represented in terms of σ and information regarding the type of distribution fits of the data is stored in ξ i e g u m b e l ξ 0 f r e c h e t ξ 0 w e i b u l l ξ 0 in the second step the non stationary gev model is fitted total number of extreme temperature duration of each year with index of standardize annual mean soil moisture as a covariate eq 6 it is to be noted that present study performs gev analysis on area averaged value of soil moisture and extreme temperature duration over the north central india nci which is a region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling detailed description can be found at section 3 2 5 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 6 μ y β 0 β 1 y where y is standardized value of annual mean soil moisture and β 0 and β 1 fitting constants of the location parameter the value of estimated shape parameter is positive which indicates extd follows frechet distribution table 1 the likelihood ratio test lrt is performed to examine the stationary and non stationary gev model performance zhang et al 2010 lrt indicates that extd good fit the gev distribution and inclusion of standardize soil moisture as covariate resulted in significant improvement in model fit tables 1 and 2 further the effect of sm on temperature extremes over the nci is quantified by comparing the 67 year return values of extd with dry 10th percentile and wet 90th percentile soil moisture conditions in the non stationary model 2 2 4 soil moisture memory smm soil can remember wet or dry conditions for a long time caused by the atmosphere and land surface processes such property of long term persistence of wet or dry conditions termed as smm in the present study smm estimated using e folding time considering exponential decay of sm autocorrelation function irrespective of seasons delworth and manabe 1988 wang et al 2010 smm can also be defined as time scale lag at which autocorrelation function reduces 1 e of its value given in eq 7 30 day lag autocorrelation values based on sm anomalies were used in the study to determine e folding time at each grid fig 9a 7 r τ e τ λ where r τ is autocorrelation function τ is the lag and λ is called decay time scale on average smm evaluated using gldas data set is consistent with previous studies indicating high smm in higher latitudes as compared to lower latitudes delworth and manabe 1988 wang et al 2010 our study also used different statistical methods such as trend analysis vincent et al 2012 statistical significance test wilks 2011 regression analysis mujumdar et al 2012 and probability density function watterson 2008 to explain the sm association with temperature extremes it is to be noted that all the datasets are reform to the same grids with method of bilinear interpolation gribbon and bailey 2004 to maintain the uniformity 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatological features of annual mean rainfall rf soil moisture sm and 2 meter air temperature t2m over india description of annual mean climatological features of the hydro metrological variables such as rf sm and t2m are provided in the present section the analysis of climatological features of annual mean rf sm and t2m can provide elegant mean features and also helpful to get insight into the relationship between sm and temperature extremes over india fig 1 shows the climatology of annual mean rf sm and t2m over the indian region for the reference period 1948 2014 rf over indian region is mainly associated with the south west and north east monsoon circulations most of the indian regions receive rf from the south west monsoon except south eastern parts which has a dominant contribution from the north east monsoon fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of annual mean rf based on imd gridded data high values of annual mean rf is mostly concentrated over the western ghats and north east india exceeding 8 mm day fig 1a north west and interior parts of maharashtra and karnataka also called a rain shadow area receive very less rf 0 to 2 mm day the high rf over the western ghats mainly attributed to the orographic lifting grossman and durran 1984 whereas north east regions receive higher rf due to convective processes induced by complex topography and relatively weaker low level circulation goswami et al 2010 the central indian region receives moderate rf 2 to 6 mm day which is mostly influenced by synoptic systems with stratified convection singh and nakamura 2010 spatial characteristic of sm over the indian regions primarily influenced by the amount of rf received over the land sathyanadh et al 2016 varikoden and revadekar 2018 in general wet sm conditions sm 0 37 m 3 m 3 observed over the western ghats and north east regions whereas drier sm conditions sm 0 05 m 3 m 3 persist over north west india fig 1b north central and some parts of south east india indicating moderate sm in the range of 0 1 to 0 3 m 3 m 3 overall the spatial pattern of sm is showing consistent but non linear relation with the rf over india as described in the previous study by douville et al 2001 model uncertainty is one of the factors for the non linear relationship between sm and rf this uncertainty can be minimized using various mathematical methods gruber et al 2016 fig 1c shows the spatial distribution of long term annual mean t2m climatology over india fig 1c indicates that north west and large parts of peninsular india comparatively warmer t2m 26 c than north east and north indian regions t2m 10 c by and large spatial distribution of t2m attributed to latitudinal variation found to be lower over higher latitudes of the indian landmass and eventually increases towards the equator the spatial distribution of these three hydro metrological variables clearly illustrates that variations of rf and sm are more consistent than that of temperature variation over the plains of central india past studies have answered the reason behind the spatial inconsistency between sm and t2m mainly through the land atmosphere interaction miralles et al 2012 seneviratne et al 2010 furthermore it is intriguing to explore complex and non linear feedback among these three variables through land surface processes 3 2 soil moisture temperature coupling several previous studies based on observations miralles et al 2012 and model experiments berg et al 2014 koster et al 2006 attempted to understand the complexity of land atmosphere interaction these studies mostly confined to the summer season and highlighted that the land atmosphere interaction strongly contributes to surface temperature variability it may be noted that surface temperature variability significantly differs from space and time therefore t2m variability can be better understood suppositionally through the soil moisture temperature coupling on entire annual cycle using the daily data of all the seasons consequently it is essential to explore the regions of strong coupling playing a vital role in the evolution of temperature extremes in order to examine the regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling over india we used the diagnostic method suggested by miralles et al 2012 fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the coupling strength π as described in eq 2 daily data sets for the period 1948 2014 were used to evaluate the coupling strength of sm and t2m on entire annual cycle relatively higher values of π observed over the regions of north central india nci grid box 16 n 26 n 75 e 87 e land only these higher values of π over the nci highlight the dominant role of sm on temperature variability by limiting evaporation and contributing more for the modulation of surface energy fluxes regions of the nci also include hotspots of strong soil moisture temperature coupling identified by previous studies by hirschi et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2006a b and miralles et al 2012 the result from fig 2a is verified using the various observational datasets fig 2b shows the correspondence between gridded gldas product and point evaluation at cosmos iitm site of π during the period april 2018 to may 2019 the gldas dataset is prepared over grid box 18 5 n 18 75 n 73 75 e 74 e coinciding with the location of cosmos iitm site at pune additionally coupling strength over nci and cosmos iitm pune site is also verified with satellite observational products using dong and crow 2018 fig 2c shows the comparison of soil moisture temperature coupling strength of gldas dataset with the satellite and in situ observations for gldas model and satellite observation product area averaged values of soil moisture temperature coupling strength over nci and pune were selected in the study it is found from both the investigation that soil moisture temperature coupling strength in the gldas product is overestimated over nci and pune the overestimation of coupling in the gldas product is mainly due to differences in variability captured by model and observational datasets regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling across nci reasonably coincide with the moderate sm conditions and relatively higher values of t2m see figs 1c and 2a thus the result specifies that intermediate sm regions are more sensitive to near surface temperature variability than wet and dry regimes on entire annual cycle the areas such as the western ghats and north east india with wet sm conditions are mainly energy control evaporation regime in contrast a region like north west india with dry sm conditions mostly have weak evaporation variability lower soil moisture temperature coupling found over the extreme wet and dry sm regime indicates the more uncertain impact of sm on temperature variability on the other hand moderate sm regions having sm controlled evaporation depicts substantial evaporation variability the process in turn induces large control on surface energy fluxes and exerts a larger impact on temperature variability shown in subsequent sections furthermore association between sm and temperature extremes over the nci have been illustrated in following sections by analysing long term variability of hydro meteorological variables and relations among them and finally describing the mechanism of linkage between sm and temperature extremes 3 3 analysis of hydro meteorological variables over the north central india nci the long term variability and trend in the annual mean rf sm and t2m over the study region nci obtained by constructing the area averaged time series using gldas and imd datasets for the period 1948 to 2014 fig 3 time series of rf fig 3a depicts maximum interannual variability around 11 84 with mean rf of 3 mm day whereas second highest variability 4 33 is observed in sm time series fig 3b with a mean value of 0 23 m 3 m 3 day t2m time series fig 3c is having a least interannual variability of 1 31 with a mean value around 26 17 c day compare to rf and sm moreover trend analysis of the time series shows that the rf and sm significantly decreasing at the rate of 0 02 mm decade at 67 confidence level and 0 0011 m 3 m 3 decade about 1 1 mm decade at 95 confidence level respectively it is found that area averaged rf and sm over the nci are decreased by 4 83 and 3 10 respectively for the study period thus it can be speculated that though rf is declining relatively faster decreased by 4 83 sm possesses the most important and unique characteristic of memory which allow it to remember wet or dry conditions for a long time a similar analysis using the long term annual mean time series of t2m fig 3c shows significant warming of 0 1 c decade at 95 confidence level over the nci for the reference period of 1948 to 2014 results from this time series analysis agreed well with past regional as well as global studies kothawale et al 2010 sheffield and wood 2007 srivastava et al 2017 although time series analysis of these three hydro meteorological variables clearly reveals that the interannual variability of sm dominantly controlled by rf and decreasing sm coincides with the increasing t2m conditions over the nci fig 3 and supplementary fig s2 it may be worth exploring interrelationship among rf sm and t2m the supportive analysis is performed to substantiate the interrelationship among hydro meteorological variables over regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling supplementary fig s2 a b shows scatter plots for annual mean sm anomaly versus annual mean rf anomaly and t2m averaged over the nci it can be noted that annual mean t2m time series constructed for the study period by removing the global mean t2m from each year to retain only natural variability the relationship between rf and sm shows that these two variables are highly correlated r 0 72 p 0 05 here the strong positive correlation is indicative of the dominant role of rf on sm changes sathyanadh et al 2016 on the other hand detrended sm values are relatively lower in magnitude as compared to rf having a significant negative correlation r 0 40 with p 0 05 with detrended values of t2m this analysis implies that land surface conditions may also have an important role in modulating the near surface temperature variability miralles et al 2012 having found the significant negative correlation of sm with t2m it is intriguing to explore the linkage of temperature extremes with decreasing sm over the strongly coupled region 3 4 long term trend analyses of temperature extremes and its association with soil moisture sm over nci in order to understand the temporal trend of extreme temperature characteristics extf and extd over the nci we used criteria of extreme temperature as described in section 2 2 2 fig 4 a b shows the area averaged time series for extd and extf over the nci on an average at least one extreme temperature event occurs per year over the nci with three days of persistence moreover spatial patterns are showing a significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level in extd and extf over most parts of nci figure not presented the area averaged time series of extd and extf over nci are also indicating the significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level overall we found an increase of 0 28 event and 1 24 days per 2 decades in the frequency and duration of extreme temperature respectively over the study domain the present analysis is also validated using imd data set figure not presented and agrees well with spatial and temporal patterns of extremes as reported by pai et al 2013 extreme temperature defined in this study by considering the effect of sm conditions have broadly agreed with previous studies carried out over north west and south east india with a focus on pre monsoon season march to may see supplementary fig s1 ratnam et al 2016 rohini et al 2016 our study prominently brings out that temperature extremes over the nci regions during monsoon and post monsoon increased faster than the pre monsoon season during post 1970s the frequency of extreme temperature is found to be enhanced by 4 and 8 events during monsoon and post monsoon respectively since post 1970s fig 5 a whereas the total duration of extreme temperature during monsoon and post monsoon almost increased by 15 and 26 days respectively fig 5b nonetheless in the pre monsoon season both frequency and duration of extreme temperature increased by 0 3 events and 2 days respectively to provide a complete picture of the relationship between sm and temperature extremes we further performed the regression analysis of area averaged extd over the nci on the time series of sm anomalies regression analysis is also supported by generalized extreme value gev distribution and probability density estimate to quantify the association of drier sm conditions with an increase in extreme temperature the regression analysis has been carried out spatially using the standardised time series of extd and sm anomalies only one characteristic of extreme temperature i e extd is evaluated considering the similar interannual variability among extd and extf we found a negative correspondence between sm and extd almost everywhere over the study domain and the probability of temperature extremes increases with drier sm conditions see fig 6 a supplementary s3 typically the maximum probability of extd over nci is one to four days but if sm anomalies are less than one standard deviation then the probability of extd for four to seven days and above seven days will increase by 90 and 74 respectively additionally generalized extreme value gev distribution depicts best fit for extd stationary gev model over nci table 1 statistically significant at 95 confidence level extending gev distribution with sm as a covariate non stationary gev model significantly at 95 confidence level improves the model fit table 2 quantitative findings from the non stationary gev model fit well with opposite relationship between soil moisture and temperature extremes tables 1 and 2 fig 6 it is intriguing to note that drier sm conditions 10th percentile over nci results in a 9 10 days increase in 67 year return values of temperature as opposed to wet sm conditions 90th percentile fig 6c the present analysis also cross validated using pearson correlation coefficient method and we found significant anti correlation r 0 32 at 95 confidence level between extd and sm supplementary fig s4 the negative correspondence of sm with extd fig 6 and strong soil moisture temperature coupling fig 2a over the nci reveals the crucial role of sm on temperature variability as well as on temperature extremes over the nci this dominant role of sm on temperature extremes can be better explained through the surface processes using lhf shf evapotranspiration et and nevertheless smm 3 5 linkage between sm and temperature extremes the linkage of sm with temperature extremes is explained in this section by analysing sm et extd smm and surface energy fluxes over the study domain it is clearly observed from fig 3b that sm is significantly decreasing at the rate of 0 0011 m 3 m 3 decade about 1 1 mm decade at 95 confidence level over north central india nci the reduction in sm has a primary influence on et rate since sm availability at the surface largely influence et till atmosphere demands water in the present study we have evaluated influence of sm on et using regression method fig 7 shows the temporal regression of et on the area averaged sm time series over nci it is observed from fig 7 that both sm and et time series are in phase and showing a similar temporal pattern thus the regression analysis depicts that the reduction in sm prominently alters the et rate over the nci the analysis has been cross validated by evaluating long term variability and trend in area averaged time series of et over the nci by and large et has significantly decreased medium confidence at the rate of 0 02 mm decade over the nci supplementary fig s5 this significant change in et will have a strong impact on modulating the surface energy partitioning seneviratne et al 2010 and consecutively on extreme temperature conditions thus the anomalous weakening of et rate associated with the decreased sm conditions seems to induce frequent and long lasting temperature extremes over the nci through modulation of surface energy partitioning the quantitative assessments of temperature extremes through weakening of surface energy partitioning are carried out by performing the temporal regression of area averaged extd anomalies onto the lhf and shf anomalies fig 8 a b the regression analysis depicts the negative correspondence between lhf and extd whereas positive correspondence observed among shf and extd time series over the large parts of the study region combinedly opposite correspondence of shf and lhf anomalies with the extd is indicative of anomalous intensification of sensible heating process and abridgement of latent cooling process associated with the anomalous amplification of extd regression analysis also suggests that the strong soil moisture temperature coupling regions experienced the significant weakening of surface energy partitioning in order to understand weakening process of surface energy partitioning over nci we have analysed area averaged time series of bowen ratio edgar and benjamin 1996 long term analysis depicts a significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level in the bowen ratio fig 8c which indeed explains increase in surface sensible heating process and reduction in latent cooling process we obtained similar results using empirical orthogonal function eof analyses of shf and lhf figure not presented relation of surface fluxes with hydro meteorological variable and extreme temperature indices were revalidated using the pearson correlation coefficient method figure not presented the present study also examined smm characteristics over the indian region to get insight into the mechanism of the effect of long term sm variability on temperature extremes memory is one of the important characteristics of sm which can have an impact on the persisting temperature extremes lorenz et al 2010 earlier studies have shown the pronounced effect of persistent soil moisture wetness smm on near surface temperature over the tropical regions shukla and mintz 1982 therefore india being a tropical county long term changes in smm need to be explored along with the temperature extremes we have used the e folding time scale to estimate the smm taking into account the exponential decay of sm anomalies applying autocorrelation function as described in section 2 2 4 highest sm persistent time scale smm can be found over wet regions of the western ghats north east and northern parts of india sm persistence time scale over these wet regions is found to be exceeding 60 days fig 9 a however north west drier regions and some parts of interior india are showing negligible sm persistent time scale ranges from zero to ten days interestingly moderate sm persistent time scale ten to forty days observed over the regions of nci which is hotspot of soil moisture temperature coupling aim of analysing smm is to examine whether the regions of nci have experienced a significant change in persistent characteristics in recent few decades overall we found a substantial decrease of smm by 7 to 20 over nci fig 9b during the recent period from 1981 to 2014 shorter the sm persistence time scale greater the possible evaporative flux and faster the evaporative damping of sm anomalies 1 λ consequently affect the persistence of atmospheric variability delworth and manabe 1993 thus the declining sm wetness increase in potential evaporative flux figure not presented and reduced sm persistent time scale prominently enhance drier sm conditions and alter the et rate drier sm conditions with a smaller magnitude of et rate leads to decline moisture contents in the atmosphere and simultaneously weakens modulates the surface energy partitioning weakening of surface energy partitioning associated with drier sm conditions and decreased et rate subsequently reduces the latent heating process thereby transforms more energy for the sensible heating process increase in shf regulates to entrainment of maximum energy into the atmosphere and in turn increases the atmospheric temperature eventually the increase in the atmospheric temperature can contribute to amplifying the extreme temperature characteristics over the nci thus a drier sm condition ultimately favours the extreme temperature variability 4 summary and conclusion the present study describes the role of long term sm variability on the evolution of extreme temperature conditions over the indian region this study is based on analysis of various hydro meteorological data sets from gldas and imd for the period 1948 to 2014 the influence of sm is highlighted by defining the extreme temperature event based on daily mean temperature the main objective of the study is achieved by analysing regions where the soil moisture temperature coupling is stronger and subsequently describing the evolution of extreme temperature over the regions through land surface processes the quantitative assessment of sm influence on temperature extremes is explored by using the generalized extreme value gev distribution with and without sm as a covariate it is worth noting that present study has been carried out on entire annual cycle i e without restricting to any particular season relatively higher values of soil moisture temperature coupling π are found over the regions of north central india nci the higher values of coupling over the nci indicates significant role of sm on t2m variability by limiting evaporation and modulating the surface energy fluxes additionally moderate sm conditions and relatively warmer t2m are found over regions of nci the soil moisture temperature coupling strength is cross validated using satellite and in situ observations by incorporating value addition technique of dong and crow 2018 by considering the substantial impact of sm on temperature variability long term changes in temperature extremes and its association with the land surface process were examined over the nci overall a positive trend is observed in both frequency and duration of temperature extremes across the broad area of nci averaged frequency and duration of temperature extremes over nci increased by 0 28 events and 1 24 days per 2 decades respectively during the study period in other words the extf and extd are almost doubled during the post 1970s over the study region a strong agreement of extreme temperature spatio temporal trends with imd datasets and pai et al 2013 findings shows the robustness of the gldas analysis the inter relationship between sm and temperature extremes reveals opposite correspondence between them the significant drying of sm is associated with an increased probability of extd by about 3 4 times in other words a decrease of 10 mm sm over nci is associated with a 5 6 day rise in extd and a 1 2 time rise in extf furthermore relative increase in the 67 year return value of extd by 9 10 days is detected using gev distribution during dry sm conditions 10th percentile this diagnosis confirms that drier sm conditions 10th percentile favours the enhancement of extreme temperature conditions extf and extd in contrary to wetter sm 90th percentile the influence of sm on temperature extremes was substantiated by various statistical diagnostic analyses to get insight into the mechanism of soil moisture temperature interaction it is worth stating that a deficit sm condition not only reduces annual mean et but also alters its long term memory over the nci the average persistence time scale memory of sm over the study domain is found to be 10 to 40 days which generally ranges from 0 to 60 days in the tropical zone manabe and delworth 1990 in addition smm over nci was found to decrease about 7 to 20 during post 1970s the coherent decrease in smm along with evapotranspiration rate modulates the surface energy partitioning and tends to reduce atmospheric moisture content modulation of surface energy partitioning induced by drier sm decrease smm and decreased et rate leads to enhance the sensible heating process consequently the enhancement of the sensible heating process can raise the surface air temperature through entrainment of more energy into the atmosphere and induces more frequent and intense temperature extremes withal the increase in warmer temperature conditions tends to further enhance potential evapotranspiration and atmospheric water demand which can subsequently feedback to sm and creates drier conditions seneviratne et al 2010 this confirms the significant modulation of temperature extreme variability by the persistence of drier sm conditions furthermore the accessibility of high temporal and spatial resolution data products such as gldas imd and satellite observations etc is crucial to get detail insight into sm variability soil moisture temperature

5266,soil moisture sm and near surface temperature variations are known to be linked through land atmosphere interactions while previous investigators have examined the association between temperature extremes and large scale atmospheric circulation variability the role of land atmosphere coupling on temperature extremes over the monsoon dominated region of india is not well understood this study presents an analysis of hydro meteorological datasets for the 67 year period 1948 2014 to assess the impact of long term soil moisture changes on temperature extremes over the indian region firstly our findings show that the hot spot of land atmosphere coupling located across north central india nci is a region where sm variations can significantly influence temperature extremes we further note that the nci region experienced a significant declining trend in sm about 1 1 mm decade during 1948 2014 in association with the decreasing trend of monsoon precipitation our findings suggest that the long term decrease of sm over the nci has favored increased incidence of temperature extremes through strengthening weakening of sensible latent heat fluxes while the loss of soil moisture memory has additionally promoted increased variability of temperature extremes the frequency duration and variability of extreme temperatures are found to increase significantly by 1 2 occurrences 5 6 days and 43 respectively in association with a decrease of 10 mm sm over nci the generalized extreme value gev distributions are fitted to extreme temperature duration extd using sm as a covariate to quantify the role of sm on temperature extremes over nci gev analysis reveals that drier sm conditions 10th percentile lead to an increase in the 67 year return value of extd by 9 10 days relative to wet sm conditions 90th percentile over nci furthermore it is interesting to note that the rise in temperature extremes over nci in the recent three decades has been more prominent during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons as compared to the pre monsoon months keywords temperature extremes soil moisture memory soil moisture temperature coupling north central india generalized extreme value distribution surface energy partitioning 1 introduction the linkage between global warming and long term changes in the frequency severity and duration of extreme temperature events has been a topic of great

as the dominant cause for the increasing trend of global mean temperature since the 19th century however variations in extreme temperatures over different areas of the globe can be influenced by interactions involving atmospheric dynamics land atmosphere feedbacks water vapour and cloud feedbacks with radiation and other processes see ipcc 2014 perkins kirkpatrick et al 2016 perkins 2015 the

land atmosphere coupling processes ferranti and viterbo 2006 numerical experiments using atmospheric general circulation models gcm indicate that the persistence of the near surface temperature and

al 2016 de and mukhopadhyay 1998 on the other hand ratnam et al 2016 identified two distinct physical mechanisms for heat waves over north central and east coastal indian regions respectively their results suggest that heat waves over north central india are linked to atmospheric blocking events over the north atlantic whereas heat waves over east coastal and south eastern parts of india have linkages to anomalous cooling in the tropical west pacific while taking note of the aforementioned studies the role of sm changes on the variability of extreme temperatures over the monsoon dominated indian landmass is not well understood based on high resolution climate model simulations ramarao et al 2016 pointed to the role soil moisture temperature coupling on the persistence of warmer than normal surface air temperature anomalies associated with a weakening trend of the indian summer monsoon krishnan et al 2016 given that land atmosphere coupling over the indian region extends beyond the summer monsoon rainy season this study aims to understand the role of soil moisture variations on the evolution of temperature extremes over india this paper organised as follows section 2 provides datasets and methodology used in this study for analysis results and discussion of present study which highlights the changes in extreme temperature characteristics and its linkage with sm over the strongly coupled regions of india are described in section 3 finally section 4 covers the summary and conclusions 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 daily data at 0 25 0 25 resolution used in this study to examine soil moisture sm 2 meter air temperature t2m pressure pr evaporation e evapotranspiration et and surface energy fluxes over the indian region gldas data combinedly prepared by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep gldas data generated by incorporating satellite as well as ground based observational product in the land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques gldas is the best high resolution data available at various global and climate scale from 1948 to present moreover general features like sm and rainfall rf variations in gldas outputs are well in agreement with the observations over the indian region sathyanadh et al 2016 currently gldas drives four land surface models lsms noah the community land model clm the variable infiltration capacity model vic and mosaic out of these four land surface models driven by gldas we used the noah land surface model version 3 3 noah lsm 3 3 forced by the global meteorological forcing data set sheffield et al 2006 out of availability at four different depths and various time scales the present study uses daily sm of the top layer 0 10 cm from noah lsm outputs for all of the analysis meteorological measurements from eddy covariance system liu et al 2013 and four component net radiometer nr01 model hukseflux thermal sensors b v netherlands are used to in situ comparison of daily soil moisture temperature coupling metric π described in section 2 2 1 at the cosmos cosmic ray soil moisture observing system site located in iitm campus pune 18 53 n 73 85 e data from eddy covariance system and nr01 is available from the april 2018 to may 2019 for validation of metric π from gldas model outputs validation of soil moisture temperature coupling of gldas product is extended using the method by dong and crow 2018 over nci region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling as discussed in the section 2 2 1 and cosmos iitm pune for this validation purpose three different satellite observational datasets such as advance microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 owe et al 2008 soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos fernandez moran et al 2017 were used along with datasets mention above our study also uses high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rf mean temperature datasets prepared by imd rao et al 2009 pai et al 2015 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 soil moisture temperature coupling metric sm interacts with near surface air temperature through its effect on sensible heat flux shf and latent heat flux lhf such interaction between sm and temperature generally termed as soil moisture temperature coupling seneviratne et al 2010 previous experimental studies of soil moisture temperature coupling based on the model and statistical methods mainly restricted to summer month fischer et al 2007 miralles et al 2012 however the influence of sm on temperature extremes extends beyond the summer season therefore it is also essential to carefully consider the interactions between sm and surface air temperature throughout all the seasons soil moisture temperature coupling in the present study is estimated using two different methods proposed by miralles et al 2012 method 1 and dong and crow 2018 method 2 over india on entire annual cycle the second method by dong and crow 2018 is mainly applied to cross validate the coupling strength of gldas dataset using satellite and in situ observations over the indian domain these methods are described in detail below a method 1 the method based on miralles et al 2012 uses actual evaporation or latent heat flux λe where λ is called latent heat of vaporisation potential evaporation e p net radiation r n and 2 meter air temperature t2m to evaluate soil moisture temperature coupling strength soil moisture temperature coupling metric π is given below 1 π ρ h t 2 m ρ h p t 2 m where ρ is the pearson s correlation coefficient h r n λ e and h p r n λ e p higher values of π indicate the region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling thus hotspots π highlights the regions where the sm can have a significant influence on the surface energy partitioning and near surface temperature variability additionally lower or zero values of π indicates regions of weaker soil moisture temperature coupling for a shorter time scale daily soil moisture temperature coupling for day i can be defined as 2 π i t i t σ t h i h σ h h p i h p σ h p where t h h p are mean of time series of t h h p respectively more detail description of π can be found in miralles et al 2012 a method 2 the second approach to estimate and cross validate gldas soil moisture temperature coupling strength over the north central nci and cosmos iitm area pune is based on the dong and crow 2018 process in this process soil moisture temperature coupling strength was computed as an absolute value of the zero lag rank correlation coefficient of daily soil moisture sm and 2 m daily mean air temperature t2m anomalies at each grid cell eq 3 since our main interest is to quantify the role of drier sm conditions 10th percentile in extreme temperature incidences beyond the summer season only negative sm anomalies are considered in each grid cell for all months anomalies of sm and t2m determined by eliminating the 31 day running annual mean of two variables over the multiple years chen et al 2018 dong and crow 2018 following this method the absolute value of the area averaged soil moisture temperature correlations was considered for the determination of the coupling strength by removing the positive values for each grid cell the true absolute rank correlation r true of the sm anomaly θ and 2 m air temperature anomaly t time series are computed as follows 3 r true c θ t c θ θ c tt where c denotes covariance of corresponding subscripts for example c θ t represents the covariance between sm anomaly and 2 m air temperature anomaly for more effective computation of soil moisture temperature coupling strength from the satellite observation datasets coupling metric needs to consider observational error in θ and t dong and crow 2018 a revised edition of eq 3 written as follows after consideration of additive errors 4 r obs c θ t c e θ e t c θ θ β c vv c tt c e t e t where r obs is the soil moisture temperature rank correlation based on satellite observations c e θ e t error covariance between sm and t2m c e t e t and c vv error variance of t2m and non orthogonal components of sm respectively and β is positive constant comprehensive information about covariance of temperature error covariance of sm error and effect of non orthogonal sm error in the various satellite observations can be found at dong and crow 2018 2 2 2 extreme temperature index this section provides a detail description of the extreme temperature index used in the study the extreme temperature index can be defined using several criterion over various parts of the world based on regional climate nairn and fawcett 2013 the most commonly used criteria of temperature extreme in the united states of america is based on the persistence of daily maximum temperature exceeding 32 2 c for at least three consecutive days the heat wave over australia is generally identified if the daily maximum temperature exceeds 35 c for at least five consecutive days or 40 c for at least three consecutive days the criteria of heat wave described by imd are based on maximum temperature over the indian stations the details can be found in pai et al 2013 in the present study we have used daily mean t2m from gldas for defining the extreme temperature index extreme temperature event defined if daily mean t2m anomalies at each grid point are greater than or equal to 3 c and persist at least for three consecutive days daily t2m anomalies derived from daily climatology at each grid point for the reference period 1948 to 2014 further these temperature extremes indices over the strong soil moisture temperature coupling zone north central india are characterised on entire annual cycle by describing extreme temperature duration extd and extreme temperature frequency extf per year for the calculation of area averaged trends see fig 4 2 2 3 generalized extreme value gev distribution the present study evaluates the quantitative relationship between extreme temperature and sm using extreme value theory whan et al 2015 in this study our main aim is to consider the potential effects of soil moisture on temperature extremes beyond the summer season over the strong land atmosphere coupling region characteristic of extreme temperature i e extd extreme temperature days is used for fitting the generalized extreme value gev distributions for the period 1948 2014 with and without an index of surface soil moisture as a covariate analysis of gev distribution is carried out with the help of r statistical computing software using the exremes package r core team 2016 gilleland and katz 2016 gev distribution analysis has been performed in two different steps in the first step the stationary gev model is fitted to the total number of extreme temperature duration of each year with no covariate eq 5 the gev distribution has three crucial parameters location parameter μ scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ the μ explains the mean of the fitted distribution variability of the data represented in terms of σ and information regarding the type of distribution fits of the data is stored in ξ i e g u m b e l ξ 0 f r e c h e t ξ 0 w e i b u l l ξ 0 in the second step the non stationary gev model is fitted total number of extreme temperature duration of each year with index of standardize annual mean soil moisture as a covariate eq 6 it is to be noted that present study performs gev analysis on area averaged value of soil moisture and extreme temperature duration over the north central india nci which is a region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling detailed description can be found at section 3 2 5 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 6 μ y β 0 β 1 y where y is standardized value of annual mean soil moisture and β 0 and β 1 fitting constants of the location parameter the value of estimated shape parameter is positive which indicates extd follows frechet distribution table 1 the likelihood ratio test lrt is performed to examine the stationary and non stationary gev model performance zhang et al 2010 lrt indicates that extd good fit the gev distribution and inclusion of standardize soil moisture as covariate resulted in significant improvement in model fit tables 1 and 2 further the effect of sm on temperature extremes over the nci is quantified by comparing the 67 year return values of extd with dry 10th percentile and wet 90th percentile soil moisture conditions in the non stationary model 2 2 4 soil moisture memory smm soil can remember wet or dry conditions for a long time caused by the atmosphere and land surface processes such property of long term persistence of wet or dry conditions termed as smm in the present study smm estimated using e folding time considering exponential decay of sm autocorrelation function irrespective of seasons delworth and manabe 1988 wang et al 2010 smm can also be defined as time scale lag at which autocorrelation function reduces 1 e of its value given in eq 7 30 day lag autocorrelation values based on sm anomalies were used in the study to determine e folding time at each grid fig 9a 7 r τ e τ λ where r τ is autocorrelation function τ is the lag and λ is called decay time scale on average smm evaluated using gldas data set is consistent with previous studies indicating high smm in higher latitudes as compared to lower latitudes delworth and manabe 1988 wang et al 2010 our study also used different statistical methods such as trend analysis vincent et al 2012 statistical significance test wilks 2011 regression analysis mujumdar et al 2012 and probability density function watterson 2008 to explain the sm association with temperature extremes it is to be noted that all the datasets are reform to the same grids with method of bilinear interpolation gribbon and bailey 2004 to maintain the uniformity 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatological features of annual mean rainfall rf soil moisture sm and 2 meter air temperature t2m over india description of annual mean climatological features of the hydro metrological variables such as rf sm and t2m are provided in the present section the analysis of climatological features of annual mean rf sm and t2m can provide elegant mean features and also helpful to get insight into the relationship between sm and temperature extremes over india fig 1 shows the climatology of annual mean rf sm and t2m over the indian region for the reference period 1948 2014 rf over indian region is mainly associated with the south west and north east monsoon circulations most of the indian regions receive rf from the south west monsoon except south eastern parts which has a dominant contribution from the north east monsoon fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of annual mean rf based on imd gridded data high values of annual mean rf is mostly concentrated over the western ghats and north east india exceeding 8 mm day fig 1a north west and interior parts of maharashtra and karnataka also called a rain shadow area receive very less rf 0 to 2 mm day the high rf over the western ghats mainly attributed to the orographic lifting grossman and durran 1984 whereas north east regions receive higher rf due to convective processes induced by complex topography and relatively weaker low level circulation goswami et al 2010 the central indian region receives moderate rf 2 to 6 mm day which is mostly influenced by synoptic systems with stratified convection singh and nakamura 2010 spatial characteristic of sm over the indian regions primarily influenced by the amount of rf received over the land sathyanadh et al 2016 varikoden and revadekar 2018 in general wet sm conditions sm 0 37 m 3 m 3 observed over the western ghats and north east regions whereas drier sm conditions sm 0 05 m 3 m 3 persist over north west india fig 1b north central and some parts of south east india indicating moderate sm in the range of 0 1 to 0 3 m 3 m 3 overall the spatial pattern of sm is showing consistent but non linear relation with the rf over india as described in the previous study by douville et al 2001 model uncertainty is one of the factors for the non linear relationship between sm and rf this uncertainty can be minimized using various mathematical methods gruber et al 2016 fig 1c shows the spatial distribution of long term annual mean t2m climatology over india fig 1c indicates that north west and large parts of peninsular india comparatively warmer t2m 26 c than north east and north indian regions t2m 10 c by and large spatial distribution of t2m attributed to latitudinal variation found to be lower over higher latitudes of the indian landmass and eventually increases towards the equator the spatial distribution of these three hydro metrological variables clearly illustrates that variations of rf and sm are more consistent than that of temperature variation over the plains of central india past studies have answered the reason behind the spatial inconsistency between sm and t2m mainly through the land atmosphere interaction miralles et al 2012 seneviratne et al 2010 furthermore it is intriguing to explore complex and non linear feedback among these three variables through land surface processes 3 2 soil moisture temperature coupling several previous studies based on observations miralles et al 2012 and model experiments berg et al 2014 koster et al 2006 attempted to understand the complexity of land atmosphere interaction these studies mostly confined to the summer season and highlighted that the land atmosphere interaction strongly contributes to surface temperature variability it may be noted that surface temperature variability significantly differs from space and time therefore t2m variability can be better understood suppositionally through the soil moisture temperature coupling on entire annual cycle using the daily data of all the seasons consequently it is essential to explore the regions of strong coupling playing a vital role in the evolution of temperature extremes in order to examine the regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling over india we used the diagnostic method suggested by miralles et al 2012 fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the coupling strength π as described in eq 2 daily data sets for the period 1948 2014 were used to evaluate the coupling strength of sm and t2m on entire annual cycle relatively higher values of π observed over the regions of north central india nci grid box 16 n 26 n 75 e 87 e land only these higher values of π over the nci highlight the dominant role of sm on temperature variability by limiting evaporation and contributing more for the modulation of surface energy fluxes regions of the nci also include hotspots of strong soil moisture temperature coupling identified by previous studies by hirschi et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2006a b and miralles et al 2012 the result from fig 2a is verified using the various observational datasets fig 2b shows the correspondence between gridded gldas product and point evaluation at cosmos iitm site of π during the period april 2018 to may 2019 the gldas dataset is prepared over grid box 18 5 n 18 75 n 73 75 e 74 e coinciding with the location of cosmos iitm site at pune additionally coupling strength over nci and cosmos iitm pune site is also verified with satellite observational products using dong and crow 2018 fig 2c shows the comparison of soil moisture temperature coupling strength of gldas dataset with the satellite and in situ observations for gldas model and satellite observation product area averaged values of soil moisture temperature coupling strength over nci and pune were selected in the study it is found from both the investigation that soil moisture temperature coupling strength in the gldas product is overestimated over nci and pune the overestimation of coupling in the gldas product is mainly due to differences in variability captured by model and observational datasets regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling across nci reasonably coincide with the moderate sm conditions and relatively higher values of t2m see figs 1c and 2a thus the result specifies that intermediate sm regions are more sensitive to near surface temperature variability than wet and dry regimes on entire annual cycle the areas such as the western ghats and north east india with wet sm conditions are mainly energy control evaporation regime in contrast a region like north west india with dry sm conditions mostly have weak evaporation variability lower soil moisture temperature coupling found over the extreme wet and dry sm regime indicates the more uncertain impact of sm on temperature variability on the other hand moderate sm regions having sm controlled evaporation depicts substantial evaporation variability the process in turn induces large control on surface energy fluxes and exerts a larger impact on temperature variability shown in subsequent sections furthermore association between sm and temperature extremes over the nci have been illustrated in following sections by analysing long term variability of hydro meteorological variables and relations among them and finally describing the mechanism of linkage between sm and temperature extremes 3 3 analysis of hydro meteorological variables over the north central india nci the long term variability and trend in the annual mean rf sm and t2m over the study region nci obtained by constructing the area averaged time series using gldas and imd datasets for the period 1948 to 2014 fig 3 time series of rf fig 3a depicts maximum interannual variability around 11 84 with mean rf of 3 mm day whereas second highest variability 4 33 is observed in sm time series fig 3b with a mean value of 0 23 m 3 m 3 day t2m time series fig 3c is having a least interannual variability of 1 31 with a mean value around 26 17 c day compare to rf and sm moreover trend analysis of the time series shows that the rf and sm significantly decreasing at the rate of 0 02 mm decade at 67 confidence level and 0 0011 m 3 m 3 decade about 1 1 mm decade at 95 confidence level respectively it is found that area averaged rf and sm over the nci are decreased by 4 83 and 3 10 respectively for the study period thus it can be speculated that though rf is declining relatively faster decreased by 4 83 sm possesses the most important and unique characteristic of memory which allow it to remember wet or dry conditions for a long time a similar analysis using the long term annual mean time series of t2m fig 3c shows significant warming of 0 1 c decade at 95 confidence level over the nci for the reference period of 1948 to 2014 results from this time series analysis agreed well with past regional as well as global studies kothawale et al 2010 sheffield and wood 2007 srivastava et al 2017 although time series analysis of these three hydro meteorological variables clearly reveals that the interannual variability of sm dominantly controlled by rf and decreasing sm coincides with the increasing t2m conditions over the nci fig 3 and supplementary fig s2 it may be worth exploring interrelationship among rf sm and t2m the supportive analysis is performed to substantiate the interrelationship among hydro meteorological variables over regions of strong soil moisture temperature coupling supplementary fig s2 a b shows scatter plots for annual mean sm anomaly versus annual mean rf anomaly and t2m averaged over the nci it can be noted that annual mean t2m time series constructed for the study period by removing the global mean t2m from each year to retain only natural variability the relationship between rf and sm shows that these two variables are highly correlated r 0 72 p 0 05 here the strong positive correlation is indicative of the dominant role of rf on sm changes sathyanadh et al 2016 on the other hand detrended sm values are relatively lower in magnitude as compared to rf having a significant negative correlation r 0 40 with p 0 05 with detrended values of t2m this analysis implies that land surface conditions may also have an important role in modulating the near surface temperature variability miralles et al 2012 having found the significant negative correlation of sm with t2m it is intriguing to explore the linkage of temperature extremes with decreasing sm over the strongly coupled region 3 4 long term trend analyses of temperature extremes and its association with soil moisture sm over nci in order to understand the temporal trend of extreme temperature characteristics extf and extd over the nci we used criteria of extreme temperature as described in section 2 2 2 fig 4 a b shows the area averaged time series for extd and extf over the nci on an average at least one extreme temperature event occurs per year over the nci with three days of persistence moreover spatial patterns are showing a significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level in extd and extf over most parts of nci figure not presented the area averaged time series of extd and extf over nci are also indicating the significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level overall we found an increase of 0 28 event and 1 24 days per 2 decades in the frequency and duration of extreme temperature respectively over the study domain the present analysis is also validated using imd data set figure not presented and agrees well with spatial and temporal patterns of extremes as reported by pai et al 2013 extreme temperature defined in this study by considering the effect of sm conditions have broadly agreed with previous studies carried out over north west and south east india with a focus on pre monsoon season march to may see supplementary fig s1 ratnam et al 2016 rohini et al 2016 our study prominently brings out that temperature extremes over the nci regions during monsoon and post monsoon increased faster than the pre monsoon season during post 1970s the frequency of extreme temperature is found to be enhanced by 4 and 8 events during monsoon and post monsoon respectively since post 1970s fig 5 a whereas the total duration of extreme temperature during monsoon and post monsoon almost increased by 15 and 26 days respectively fig 5b nonetheless in the pre monsoon season both frequency and duration of extreme temperature increased by 0 3 events and 2 days respectively to provide a complete picture of the relationship between sm and temperature extremes we further performed the regression analysis of area averaged extd over the nci on the time series of sm anomalies regression analysis is also supported by generalized extreme value gev distribution and probability density estimate to quantify the association of drier sm conditions with an increase in extreme temperature the regression analysis has been carried out spatially using the standardised time series of extd and sm anomalies only one characteristic of extreme temperature i e extd is evaluated considering the similar interannual variability among extd and extf we found a negative correspondence between sm and extd almost everywhere over the study domain and the probability of temperature extremes increases with drier sm conditions see fig 6 a supplementary s3 typically the maximum probability of extd over nci is one to four days but if sm anomalies are less than one standard deviation then the probability of extd for four to seven days and above seven days will increase by 90 and 74 respectively additionally generalized extreme value gev distribution depicts best fit for extd stationary gev model over nci table 1 statistically significant at 95 confidence level extending gev distribution with sm as a covariate non stationary gev model significantly at 95 confidence level improves the model fit table 2 quantitative findings from the non stationary gev model fit well with opposite relationship between soil moisture and temperature extremes tables 1 and 2 fig 6 it is intriguing to note that drier sm conditions 10th percentile over nci results in a 9 10 days increase in 67 year return values of temperature as opposed to wet sm conditions 90th percentile fig 6c the present analysis also cross validated using pearson correlation coefficient method and we found significant anti correlation r 0 32 at 95 confidence level between extd and sm supplementary fig s4 the negative correspondence of sm with extd fig 6 and strong soil moisture temperature coupling fig 2a over the nci reveals the crucial role of sm on temperature variability as well as on temperature extremes over the nci this dominant role of sm on temperature extremes can be better explained through the surface processes using lhf shf evapotranspiration et and nevertheless smm 3 5 linkage between sm and temperature extremes the linkage of sm with temperature extremes is explained in this section by analysing sm et extd smm and surface energy fluxes over the study domain it is clearly observed from fig 3b that sm is significantly decreasing at the rate of 0 0011 m 3 m 3 decade about 1 1 mm decade at 95 confidence level over north central india nci the reduction in sm has a primary influence on et rate since sm availability at the surface largely influence et till atmosphere demands water in the present study we have evaluated influence of sm on et using regression method fig 7 shows the temporal regression of et on the area averaged sm time series over nci it is observed from fig 7 that both sm and et time series are in phase and showing a similar temporal pattern thus the regression analysis depicts that the reduction in sm prominently alters the et rate over the nci the analysis has been cross validated by evaluating long term variability and trend in area averaged time series of et over the nci by and large et has significantly decreased medium confidence at the rate of 0 02 mm decade over the nci supplementary fig s5 this significant change in et will have a strong impact on modulating the surface energy partitioning seneviratne et al 2010 and consecutively on extreme temperature conditions thus the anomalous weakening of et rate associated with the decreased sm conditions seems to induce frequent and long lasting temperature extremes over the nci through modulation of surface energy partitioning the quantitative assessments of temperature extremes through weakening of surface energy partitioning are carried out by performing the temporal regression of area averaged extd anomalies onto the lhf and shf anomalies fig 8 a b the regression analysis depicts the negative correspondence between lhf and extd whereas positive correspondence observed among shf and extd time series over the large parts of the study region combinedly opposite correspondence of shf and lhf anomalies with the extd is indicative of anomalous intensification of sensible heating process and abridgement of latent cooling process associated with the anomalous amplification of extd regression analysis also suggests that the strong soil moisture temperature coupling regions experienced the significant weakening of surface energy partitioning in order to understand weakening process of surface energy partitioning over nci we have analysed area averaged time series of bowen ratio edgar and benjamin 1996 long term analysis depicts a significant increasing trend at 95 confidence level in the bowen ratio fig 8c which indeed explains increase in surface sensible heating process and reduction in latent cooling process we obtained similar results using empirical orthogonal function eof analyses of shf and lhf figure not presented relation of surface fluxes with hydro meteorological variable and extreme temperature indices were revalidated using the pearson correlation coefficient method figure not presented the present study also examined smm characteristics over the indian region to get insight into the mechanism of the effect of long term sm variability on temperature extremes memory is one of the important characteristics of sm which can have an impact on the persisting temperature extremes lorenz et al 2010 earlier studies have shown the pronounced effect of persistent soil moisture wetness smm on near surface temperature over the tropical regions shukla and mintz 1982 therefore india being a tropical county long term changes in smm need to be explored along with the temperature extremes we have used the e folding time scale to estimate the smm taking into account the exponential decay of sm anomalies applying autocorrelation function as described in section 2 2 4 highest sm persistent time scale smm can be found over wet regions of the western ghats north east and northern parts of india sm persistence time scale over these wet regions is found to be exceeding 60 days fig 9 a however north west drier regions and some parts of interior india are showing negligible sm persistent time scale ranges from zero to ten days interestingly moderate sm persistent time scale ten to forty days observed over the regions of nci which is hotspot of soil moisture temperature coupling aim of analysing smm is to examine whether the regions of nci have experienced a significant change in persistent characteristics in recent few decades overall we found a substantial decrease of smm by 7 to 20 over nci fig 9b during the recent period from 1981 to 2014 shorter the sm persistence time scale greater the possible evaporative flux and faster the evaporative damping of sm anomalies 1 λ consequently affect the persistence of atmospheric variability delworth and manabe 1993 thus the declining sm wetness increase in potential evaporative flux figure not presented and reduced sm persistent time scale prominently enhance drier sm conditions and alter the et rate drier sm conditions with a smaller magnitude of et rate leads to decline moisture contents in the atmosphere and simultaneously weakens modulates the surface energy partitioning weakening of surface energy partitioning associated with drier sm conditions and decreased et rate subsequently reduces the latent heating process thereby transforms more energy for the sensible heating process increase in shf regulates to entrainment of maximum energy into the atmosphere and in turn increases the atmospheric temperature eventually the increase in the atmospheric temperature can contribute to amplifying the extreme temperature characteristics over the nci thus a drier sm condition ultimately favours the extreme temperature variability 4 summary and conclusion the present study describes the role of long term sm variability on the evolution of extreme temperature conditions over the indian region this study is based on analysis of various hydro meteorological data sets from gldas and imd for the period 1948 to 2014 the influence of sm is highlighted by defining the extreme temperature event based on daily mean temperature the main objective of the study is achieved by analysing regions where the soil moisture temperature coupling is stronger and subsequently describing the evolution of extreme temperature over the regions through land surface processes the quantitative assessment of sm influence on temperature extremes is explored by using the generalized extreme value gev distribution with and without sm as a covariate it is worth noting that present study has been carried out on entire annual cycle i e without restricting to any particular season relatively higher values of soil moisture temperature coupling π are found over the regions of north central india nci the higher values of coupling over the nci indicates significant role of sm on t2m variability by limiting evaporation and modulating the surface energy fluxes additionally moderate sm conditions and relatively warmer t2m are found over regions of nci the soil moisture temperature coupling strength is cross validated using satellite and in situ observations by incorporating value addition technique of dong and crow 2018 by considering the substantial impact of sm on temperature variability long term changes in temperature extremes and its association with the land surface process were examined over the nci overall a positive trend is observed in both frequency and duration of temperature extremes across the broad area of nci averaged frequency and duration of temperature extremes over nci increased by 0 28 events and 1 24 days per 2 decades respectively during the study period in other words the extf and extd are almost doubled during the post 1970s over the study region a strong agreement of extreme temperature spatio temporal trends with imd datasets and pai et al 2013 findings shows the robustness of the gldas analysis the inter relationship between sm and temperature extremes reveals opposite correspondence between them the significant drying of sm is associated with an increased probability of extd by about 3 4 times in other words a decrease of 10 mm sm over nci is associated with a 5 6 day rise in extd and a 1 2 time rise in extf furthermore relative increase in the 67 year return value of extd by 9 10 days is detected using gev distribution during dry sm conditions 10th percentile this diagnosis confirms that drier sm conditions 10th percentile favours the enhancement of extreme temperature conditions extf and extd in contrary to wetter sm 90th percentile the influence of sm on temperature extremes was substantiated by various statistical diagnostic analyses to get insight into the mechanism of soil moisture temperature interaction it is worth stating that a deficit sm condition not only reduces annual mean et but also alters its long term memory over the nci the average persistence time scale memory of sm over the study domain is found to be 10 to 40 days which generally ranges from 0 to 60 days in the tropical zone manabe and delworth 1990 in addition smm over nci was found to decrease about 7 to 20 during post 1970s the coherent decrease in smm along with evapotranspiration rate modulates the surface energy partitioning and tends to reduce atmospheric moisture content modulation of surface energy partitioning induced by drier sm decrease smm and decreased et rate leads to enhance the sensible heating process consequently the enhancement of the sensible heating process can raise the surface air temperature through entrainment of more energy into the atmosphere and induces more frequent and intense temperature extremes withal the increase in warmer temperature conditions tends to further enhance potential evapotranspiration and atmospheric water demand which can subsequently feedback to sm and creates drier conditions seneviratne et al 2010 this confirms the significant modulation of temperature extreme variability by the persistence of drier sm conditions furthermore the accessibility of high temporal and spatial resolution data products such as gldas imd and satellite observations etc is crucial to get detail insight into sm variability soil moisture temperature

5267,regional scale hydrological investigations that involve vegetation change usually neglect root induced modification rim of soil hydraulic properties shp however there is evidence that root distributions may impart major control over shp a critical barrier to incorporating rim of shp in catchment hydrology models is the high uncertainty of root effect parameterization in response to this the current article reviews available literature to summarize the key processes measurement prediction and implications of rim of shp previous studies found contrasting root effects on shp depending on which processes are dominant including root growth or decay and the density and diameter of roots based on data from laboratory experiments and field testing rim of shp can be summarized as 1 fine roots root diameter 1 mm at low density tend to block soil pores leading to reduced saturated water content θs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and higher air entry potential aep 2 fine roots at high density tend to eliminate macro pores while increasing pore volume leading to increased θs and aep and reduced ks 3 coarse roots root diameter 2 mm tend to cause small scale compaction particle re orientation and macro pore development leading to increased θs and ks and decreased aep root growth also tends to enhance soil moisture retention hysteresis root decay is expected to have the opposite effects to root growth due to the creation of continuous macro pores which may lead to ks increases of up to two orders of magnitude in general the enhancement of ks due to plant roots can be expected in fine textured soils whereas plants roots are known to reduce ks and θs and increase soil water retention capacity in coarse textured soils an important aspect of rim of shp is the temporal variability that arises from seasonality and or agricultural cycles while neglecting rim of shp in hydrologic simulation may lead to high uncertainties there remain significant knowledge gaps that impede the development of quantitative guidance on rim of shp at the catchment scale at which variability in environmental conditions and human activities precludes the application of simple root effect equations keywords vegetation change soil hydraulic properties macro pore development root induced modification catchment hydrology 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties shp play a major role in the hydrological and ecological functioning of watersheds garcia gonzalez et al 2012 livneh et al 2015 reliable shp are required for the development of hydrological models over a wide range of scales and natural resource problems kishné et al 2017 however shp are challenging to characterize given the heterogeneous nature of soils and the large areas over which hydrological processes are often studied sobieraj et al 2004 mcdonnell et al 2007 koch et al 2016 libohova et al 2018 approaches to simulating temporal changes of shp are relatively rare and at an early stage of development mainly because measurement is costly and time consuming and there is a lack of guidance on the parameterization of transient soil structure vereecken et al 2010 the focus of hydrological studies that require shp inputs is generally the spatial variability and uncertainties of shp jin et al 2015 vrugt et al 2008 a number of factors are reported that may modify shp over time including seasonal wetting drying cycles pires et al 2005 gadi et al 2017 agricultural management e g tillage fertilization plantation and crop rotation schwen et al 2011 chandrasekhar et al 2018 and changes in vegetation and their root distributions leung et al 2015b gould et al 2016 wu et al 2016 as vegetation within a catchment may experience significant temporal variations e g long term changes such as broad scale clearing and reforestation and seasonal variations accompanying agricultural practices root distributions and their influence on subsurface behavior may also exhibit considerable temporal variability hu et al 2009 ghestem et al 2011 bodner et al 2013 despite this quantitative guidance on root induced modification rim of shp is currently lacking especially for hydrologists tasked with evaluating soil groundwater and watershed behavior at field and ecosystem scales this has led to a lack of catchment studies that incorporate rim of shp nevertheless there is a large body of literature on root effects on shp e g carminati et al 2011 moradi et al 2011 scholl et al 2014 leung et al 2015a yu et al 2016 the current review attempts to draw together existing knowledge of root shp relationships to benefit hydrology practitioners particularly modelers who may be considering the hydrological behavior of a catchment in which roots play a major role in soil moisture dynamics and rainfall runoff behavior this study aims to integrate and build on a significant body of previous research e g gadi et al 2016 stirzaker et al 1996 bengough 2012 logsdon 2013 to identify the state of current knowledge persistent research gaps and available guidance on root shp relationships and the associated hydro biophysical processes particularly those that are relevant to field scale hydrological investigation 2 soil hydraulic properties shp shp include relationships between the soil water content and a the soil pressure head and b the soil hydraulic conductivity see equations below the relationship between the soil water content and pressure head is termed the soil water retention curve swrc which describes the variation in soil water storage with water pressure popular expressions for the swrc include those of brooks and corey 1964 kosugi 1996 and van genuchten 1980 the latter is arguably the most widely used van genuchten s 1980 functions describing the swrc and the soil hydraulic conductivity are 1 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 2 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where se is the effective saturation θs is the saturated water content typically presumed to be soil porosity θr is the residual water content and ψ is the soil pressure head l being negative for suction α l 1 is a scaling parameter n is a fitting parameter m 1 1 n n 1 l is a tortuosity parameter and k and ks are unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivities l t 1 respectively the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 for the swrc and k is also commonly applied and is given by 4 s e ψ ψ ψ b b ψ ψ b 1 ψ ψ b 5 k s e k s s e 3 2 b here ψb is the air entry or bubbling potential aep l and b is an empirical pore size distribution index while the parameters α m and n of the van genuchten 1980 model are empirical brooks and corey 1964 considered ψb to be physically based and assouline 2005 was able to relate b to the soil pore size distribution psd by comparing swrcs to b for some 20 different soils thereby reducing the empirical nature of b the soil parameters of the van genuchten 1980 and brooks and corey 1964 equations are often approximated from soil properties e g textural properties bulk density and organic matter that are easily measurable in the field using empirical functions of correlation i e pedo transfer functions ptfs the accuracy of van genuchten 1980 parameters obtained from ptfs is typically less than that attainable from fitting models to moisture retention data however there are significant efficiency gains from applying ptfs due to the wide availability of field measurements that are common inputs to ptfs vereecken et al 2010 for example tomasella et al 2000 derived a ptf for tropical soils to predict van genuchten 1980 parameters using data i e texture soil organic carbon moisture equivalent and bulk density from 500 brazilian soil horizons popular databases containing ptfs for a variety of soil types include rosetta and unsoda and these have widespread application in investigations of soil hydrological research scharnagl et al 2011 botula et al 2012 koestel et al 2018 3 factors affecting root growth root distribution patterns reflect the adaptation of plant species to prevailing environmental conditions yang et al 2016 root growth and decay is also linked to vegetation health which is a function of numerous factors including solar radiation water availability nutrient levels and pests diseases fao 1985 thus these factors may affect root distributions and thereby lead to modified shp additionally vegetation may be removed or perish as part of agricultural cycles or due to overgrazing or land clearing leaving behind bare soils seubert et al 1977 mattsson et al 2000 mekuria et al 2007 revegetation to stabilize slopes for phytoremediation measures and for other beneficial means huat et al 2006 gadi et al 2016 introduces roots to previously unvegetated soils thereby changing soil structure i e the arrangement of the solid parts and pore spaces of the soil where the roots of removed vegetation remain root death is generally expected to reverse the effects on shp of root growth for example whereas under certain conditions root growth might be expected to clog soil pores and reduce ks root decay may lead to the formation of preferential pathways that enhance the bulk soil ks li and ghodrati 1994 mitchell et al 1995 ghestem et al 2011 plant growth and root distributions also depend on seasonal and or longer term climatic cycles hatfield and prueger 2015 eissenstat et al 2005 investigated the relationship between the timing of root growth and plant stage for apple trees and grape vines and concluded that root production mainly occurred in the summer but the specific timing varied widely between bloom and harvest from year to year tryon and chapin 1983 found that the seasonal pattern of tree growth in the forests of interior alaska was highly correlated to soil temperature which peaks in july they also observed greater depths of root penetration for the tree species in warmer sites integrated plant root soil modeling by van wijk 2011 predicted rooting patterns in water limited environments and also demonstrated that plants may shift the zone of maximum root activity downwards in the profile when suffering drought stress schenk and jackson 2002 established a database of 1300 records of root systems for individual plants from a wide range of climatic settings they found that root systems tended to be shallower and wider in relatively dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates however schenk and jackson 2002 found that plants of a given above ground size tend to have smaller root systems in warm conditions high potential evapotranspiration than in cold conditions soil texture i e the size distribution of soil particles also plays a critical role in determining rooting patterns stirzaker et al 1996 shallow soils overlying largely impenetrable rock may limit vegetation assemblages to grasses and annual weeds hewitt 2004 thicker shorter and less vigorous roots are expected where plants grow in hard soils jin et al 2015 rebetzke et al 2014 vertical discontinuities in soil density due to layering in the degree of soil compaction may also limit root growth jin et al 2017 root development is also influenced by soil salinity bernstein and kafkafi 2002 soil salinity affects plants through the reduced osmotic potential of the soil solution and the toxicity of specific ions hillel 2004 in regions of significant salt stress vegetation will be limited to salt tolerant species while extreme levels of salinization may lead to barren land ghassemi et al 1995 ijaz et al 2019 undertook salinization experiments on salt tolerant rice species and found reduced root length and surface area with salt accumulation even after only three days of elevated salinities some plant species can adjust root distributions in accordance with spatial variability in soil salinity thereby mitigating the harmful effects of localized elevated salinities sonneveld and de kreij 1999 bazihizina et al 2012 a multitude of human activities modify plant species and rooting patterns agricultural practices and urbanization are the primary causal factors of such impacts seubert et al 1977 mckinney 2002 increasing demand for timber products and agricultural land has resulted in drastic land cover change including the conversion of forests to cropland or pastures ghuman et al 1991 murty et al 2002 zimmermann et al 2006 the clearing of forests for agriculture alters the depth and distribution of plant roots jackson et al 2000 murty et al 2002 reviewed the effects of a change from forest to cropland and found that agricultural soils had on average 13 higher bulk density than the original forest soils agriculture often removes above ground vegetation but roots remain in the ground to die for example harvesting of crops causes partial die back of the root system at the expense of consuming the soil carbon pool by root exudates i e biologically active root secretions that influence the rhizosphere and surrounding organisms to the benefit of the plant and the turnover of fine root biomass smith et al 2005 other factors modifying root distributions include biological activity e g soil borne diseases and harmful organisms like root knot nematodes etc soil fertility changes e g due to agricultural practices and episodic events e g fire storms etc for example bushfire may affect plant species distribution and root distribution by consuming or altering organic matter snyman and bredenkamp 2005 ebel 2012 alcaniz et al 2018 4 processes causing root induced modification of soil hydraulic properties roots may affect the psd and pore connectivity of soils by creating exploiting and occupying the soil pore space hayashi et al 2006 bodner et al 2014 scholl et al 2014 bacq labreuil et al 2018 plant roots physically chemically and biologically interact with soil through various mechanisms including mechanical stabilization enmeshing enlarging soil aggregates soil compaction and the release of exudates clark et al 2003 bronick and lal 2005 burri et al 2009 the dominant physical processes associated with root influences on soils include soil particle rearrangement pore clogging cracking of macro aggregates 250 μm amalgamation of micro aggregates 2 250 μm and generation of macro pores 30 μm as shown schematically in fig 1 in the pore scale realignment of soil particles fig 1a coarser roots may have higher strength and capacity to shift soil particles particle realignment accompanying root expansion may also lead to the binding and local compression of soil particles conversely the growth of finer roots tends to leave soil particles in their original orientation because finer roots are expected to buckle under soil mechanical stresses bengough et al 2011 as shown in fig 1b thus fine roots tend to grow along the tortuous pathways between soil particles leading eventually to pore clogging bruand et al 1996 maggi and porporato 2007 koebernick et al 2017 the amalgamation of soil particles into soil aggregates is expected to influence shp by increasing macro pore volumes whereas disaggregation is expected to have the opposite effect as shown in fig 1c 1d that is the mean size of soil aggregates decreases when roots penetrate macro aggregates but aggregate sizes may be increased through amalgamation by roots when aggregates are initially small logsdon 2013 whalley et al 2005 cracking of macro aggregates leading to the formation of inter aggregate pores may arise from spatial variability and transience in root water uptake giving rise to dynamic tensile stresses that lead to aggregate breakdown into micro aggregates materechera et al 1992 where roots penetrate small pores and subsequently increase in their diameter and overall biomass flow pathways may be created through the breaking apart of macro aggregates therefore the formation of root channels may play an important role in acting as preferential flow channels as illustrated in fig 1e in addition shrinkage or decay of coarse roots is likely to contribute to the formation of macro pores ghestem et al 2011 ni et al 2019a thereby providing a greater capacity for infiltration fig 1f conversely micro aggregates may be amalgamated into macro aggregates through the action of plant roots and residues plus the hyphae of mutualistic fungi which together act to enmesh micro aggregates to create macro aggregates tisdall et al 2010 the processes leading to rim of soils have interrelated spatial scales and temporal dimensions particularly in relation to the timing and degree of change to soil aggregates tisdall et al 2010 processes of soil particle re orientation and pore clogging mainly occur at the rhizosphere scale fig 1a 1b resulting from transient changes in the mucilage exuded by roots roberson and firestone 1991 and the growth of fungal hyphae koebernick et al 2017 at the aggregate scale root penetration and shrinkage influence aggregates due to root growth and decay typically on a seasonal scale fig 1e 1f longer timeframes are required to reach a balance between plant root distributions and the stability of soil aggregates which are controlled by macro aggregate cracking and micro aggregate amalgamation fig 1c 1d roberson et al 1995 ball et al 2005 at the field scale root channels and other macro pores may play dominant roles in affecting runoff generation and surface infiltration for example a minor increase in macro porosity i e pores with radii 30 μm presumed to drain at pressures of 0 to 100 hpa luxmoore 1981 arising from root penetration and shrinkage fig 1e 1f can increase ks by more than an order of magnitude beven and germann 1982 scholl et al 2014 5 quantifying root induced modification of soil hydraulic properties 5 1 summary of previous quantitative studies a summary of the main findings from our review of the current body of knowledge regarding rim of shp is provided in table 1 methods of analysis are based on soil column and soil core studies undertaken under both controlled laboratory conditions and natural outdoor settings and through both in situ and ex situ testing previous studies of rim of shps cover wide ranging conditions soil types plant species and climatic conditions and experimental designs the findings from these studies have not previously been summarized and nor have conclusions been drawn to assist regional scale hydrological studies where rim of shp including swrcs may have an important effect the primary method for assessing root effects on swrc e g study ids 1 22 k and ks e g study ids 23 38 among the references summarized in table 1 is laboratory soil column testing study ids 1 2 4 6 7 9 13 15 23 26 table 1 whereby individual plant species are grown under controlled conditions and shps are determined during various stages of growth in most cases involving the measurement of swrcs both soil pressure and water content were measured simultaneously using sensors e g study ids 10 14 alternatively soil pressure was continuously monitored by tensiometers and soil samples were weighed regularly study ids 3 4 6 7 8 other column experiments used specified pressure heads at the column lower boundary although this method only applies to rather coarse materials study ids 2 9 15 because soil pressure heads are limited to less than 1 m using this approach some studies study ids 2 5 12 17 used inverse analysis to determine transient profiles of water content pressure head and outflow whereby unsaturated flow was solved using a model and considering measured initial and boundary conditions field experiments of rim of shp typically involve the extraction of relatively shallow soil cores within which the root density is high relative to deeper soils study ids 17 22 27 38 soil cores were evaluated using centrifugation study id 19 and with pressure plate methods study ids 5 16 20 21 22 for assessing swrcs in situ infiltration tests were the preferred approach for almost all presented articles that focused on the estimation of ks study ids 27 38 both field and laboratory analyses of rooting effects were mainly conducted on single plant species such as individual crops study ids 2 3 8 9 12 15 18 24 25 grasses study ids 4 6 10 14 21 23 and shrubs and trees study ids 1 3 7 10 11 13 21 23 26 most of these studies explored the rim of shp in the context of crops and agricultural practices studies using undisturbed soil columns have the advantages of retaining soil layering and laboratory control study ids 12 25 however extracted soil columns did not appear to allow the same roots and crack development that are likely to occur in the field song et al 2017 since root length density rld total length of roots per unit volume of soil cm cm 3 is related to the stabilization of soil aggregates and thus soil structure the soil loosening effect induced by roots may also be restrained in soil column experiments yunusa and newton 2003 bodner et al 2014 in contrast field studies have the ability to reflect both the depth variability of vegetated soil with fully developed roots and the cracks typically found within large soil volumes under field conditions other environmental and management effects can mask the distinct influence exerted by plant roots bodner et al 2013 scholl et al 2014 alternatively soil column extraction is often preferred to undisturbed field samples to observe root induced changes under controlled conditions e g study id 14 however extracted soil columns may not properly capture the field scale heterogeneity that is the soil and root effect heterogeneity within a field site may be substantial as shown in randomized block design i e treatments are randomly allocated to the experimental units inside each block to minimize the effects of systematic error study ids 17 19 20 30 32 35 38 and as replicated in plot experiments study ids 21 22 27 28 29 31 33 34 36 37 almost all laboratory studies in table 1 were conducted within root growth stages of 4 months except for the study ids 6 10 26 which prolonged the root growth stage to 8 months to investigate root decay processes fig 1f therefore the results of these studies reflect the rim of shp mainly related to soil structure responses to sprouting plants and the accompanying root growth as shown in fig 1a b c and e in contrast field experiments especially for ks in natural vegetation communities study ids 22 27 29 were conducted on long time scales years to decades these allowed for observations of root induced changes to soil carbon involved in macro aggregate stabilization fig 1d and the effects of microbial communities especially in coarse textured soils e g study ids 19 21 a summary of the results from the 38 investigations of rim of shp described in table 1 is presented in supplementary table s1 the results show that root effects on shp include changes mainly to the soil porosity aep and the psd these parameters may or may not allow for direct determination of swrcs depending on the swrc model see equations 1 to 5 and or inform the soil properties of catchment models it follows that quantification of rim of swrcs would need to be inferred from typical field measured soil properties described above e g using ptfs this was the approach adopted in study id 19 in which the ptf method retc program was used to evaluate the swrc of bare soil for a comparison with direct measurements of swrc parameters for the root permeated soil several studies have shown that roots play an important role in increasing soil water holding capacity which is the amount of water held in soil at the field capacity the field capacity is the value of θ that remains after 2 3 days of gravity drainage from initially saturated conditions often estimated to be θ at ψ of 100 or 330 hpa nachabe 1998 increased water holding capacity is indicated by larger aep and higher soil water content at a given pressure head as observed in study ids 2 3 6 7 21 however roots may increase study ids 3 7 8 12 15 21 or decrease study ids 5 16 the soil porosity it appears from these results that rim of shp is complex and multifaceted and is the result of manifold interactions between soil fauna microbes vegetation type and other factors six et al 2004 making it challenge to attribute shp changes to vegetation type or simple representations of root distributions and behavior 5 2 effects of plant type on swrc the effects of plant types on the rim of swrc shows complex interplays between other parameters for instance study id 6 found that vetiver grass roots increased substantially the aep in silt soil whereas only a slight variation in aep was observed in clayey sandy soil gonzalez sosa et al 2010 undertook testing of sandy loam soils supporting different vegetation species within a small french catchment and found that the rim of soil porosity differed with vegetation type such that the average porosities for bare soil forest grass and crop species were 0 41 0 1 0 74 0 05 0 62 0 07 and 0 48 0 1 respectively the results of gonzalez sosa et al 2010 indicate that soil texture used in most ptfs is not sufficient to map shp variability and rather vegetation type and other land use aspects should be considered in estimating in situ shp distributions data from the references listed in tables 1 and s1 were used to summarize variations in swrc parameters induced by roots as they relate to categories of soil texture and vegetation type here according to the guidance from the unified soil classification system astm 2011 soil textures containing a high proportion of finer particles generally sand fraction 50 such as silt and clay are classified as fine textured soils while soil textures comprising high proportions of sand 50 such as sand loamy sand and sandy loam are classified as coarse textured soils following the land cover classification system developed by fao di gregorio 2005 vegetation types are classified as crop grass and tree shrub in this paper different from the fao classification fodder grass and legumes were classified as grass the results shown in fig 2 are intended to seek general relationships regarding rim of swrc given the limited quantification of swrc parameters in root effect studies ptfs from the rosetta database schaap et al 2001 were used to relate soil physical properties e g soil textural composition and bulk density to swrc parameters bruand et al 1996 found this approach to be valid when compared to measurements of porosity reduction of 22 24 in wheat planted soil due to the effects of roots which was consistent with the decrease in θs 26 calculated using the rosetta approach the results of fig 2 offer initial insight into the rim of swrc parameters although there are insufficient data as indicated by data points for some of the vegetation soil type categories to draw generalized conclusions nevertheless some general observations can be drawn from fig 2 including 1 θs appears more likely to increase with the addition of vegetation 2 α appears more likely to decrease with the addition of vegetation 3 mixed trends or insufficient data are apparent for n and ψb more detailed evaluation of these findings is offered in the next sub section 5 3 effects of plant type on θs α n and ψ b fig 2a shows that plants exert substantial effects on θs with variations due to the addition of vegetation ranging from 18 to 34 the study by bormann et al 2007 helps to illustrate the summary of experimental results in fig 2a they summarized from 8 existing studies the variation of bulk density for land cover change and concluded that when vegetation changed from forest to grassland from grassland to crop and from forest to crop the bulk density increased and therefore the porosity presumably decreased by up to 27 21 and 17 2 respectively their results are generally reflected by the coarse textured soil trends in fig 2a that is the roots from vegetation types tree shrub grass and crop tend to increase θs by 19 16 and 15 in coarse textured soil respectively the increase in coarse textured soil θs arising from the addition of vegetation is most likely caused by the penetration of coarser roots contributing to the formation of macro pores leading to higher macro porosity and substantial increases in θs the rim of θs in fine textured soils b1 b3 fig 2a appears to differ to that of coarse textured soils a1 a3 fig 2 that is the rim increase in θs in fine textured soils is 13 on average whereas in coarse textured soils θs increased by 17 on average further fig 2a shows that there is significant evidence of roots leading to reduced θs in fine textured soils while roots caused reduced θs in only five of the 17 cases of coarse textured soils however there is considerable variability of rim effects on θs arising from differences in vegetation type even within the above mentioned categories for example whalley et al 2005 study id 16 showed using a pressure plate apparatus that the porosity of soil aggregates within silty clay loam decreased by 3 and 18 and increased by 35 compared to bare soil when used to grow maize wheat and barley respectively these results lead to the wide range of rim of θs for b3 in fig 2a the parameters α and ψb both reflect the soil water holding capacity and therefore they are expected to show some correlation morel seytoux et al 1996 in order to summarize quantitatively their relationship the effects of plant type from a total of 20 case studies were plotted in fig 2b it is shown that the parameter α generally decreases with the addition of vegetation roots with a maximum decrease of 60 5 for b1 only one among the 12 cases show an increase in α with a maximum increase of 83 for b2 in contrast the parameter ψb generally increases with the addition of vegetation roots with a maximum increase of 200 for a1 therefore inverse proportionality between α and ψb is generally evidenced except one case study id 4 in a2 which showed a decrease of ψb associated with fissures created between roots and soil interfaces the parameter n demonstrates a more complex pattern that appears to be dependent on the different combinations of plant and soil types based on 16 study cases fig 2c a decrease in n with the addition of roots of up to 11 is present for a2 while a maximum root induced increase of 33 is shown for b1 considering the physical processes that influence n assists in interpreting observations of the influence of roots on n normally a low value of n is indicative of soils with broad psd and higher n indicates more uniform distributions lenhard et al 1989 this was exemplified in hallet et al 2009 where they found more heterogeneous pores from planted soils tomato than those in the unplanted soils the increased pore heterogeneity caused by root growth could explain the decreased n for a1 a2 and b2 study ids 7 10 19 in contrast root induced pore clogging may contribute to the homogenization of psd and an increased n for a3 b1 and b3 study ids 3 7 13 it should be acknowledged that the data sample used in fig 2 may not be large enough to draw a generalized conclusion nevertheless an initial guide of rim of swrc parameters can still be obtained 5 4 effects of plant type on saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 5 4 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is a key parameter of soils particularly as it represents the infiltration rate of saturated soils under gravity drainage and is widely used in hydrological modeling data from tables 1 and s1 were used to summarize variations in ks induced by roots fig 3 these results contained therein show that plant roots exert substantial effects on ks ranging from 143 to 1085 the presented articles i e see table s1 also showed that 21 among the 33 cases show an increase in ks with formation of marco pores or preferential flow induced by roots fig 1a c and f the largest change in ks due to the addition of roots occurred in coarse textured soil containing tree shrub vegetation i e a1 however plant roots also reduced ks in coarse textured soils as indicated in 11 among 12 cases in coarse textured soils with showed root induced pore clogging a1 a2 a3 the rim of the relative changes in ks in fine textured soils for grass and crop 283 and 414 on average for b2 and b3 appears to be greater than those in coarse textured soils 85 and 24 on average for a2 and a3 generally it is concluded that the largest relative change of ks occurred due to the addition of tree shrub vegetation to soils followed by grass and crop study ids 22 27 31 33 however the effects are not only dependent on the type of the plant but also on the stage of plant growth leung et al 2017 study id 23 reported the ks values for different rlds and included various growth periods of grass and willow their data showed that compared to bare soil ks was nearly linearly proportional to rld for example ks was larger by 183 to 511 for rld of 0 82 to 7 14 cm cm 3 grass and 133 to 1085 for rld of 0 075 to 0 552 cm cm 3 willow fig 4 a and b however reported data also show that ks may decrease when roots develop beyond a certain level of maturity so that a physical obstacle to the soil water flow is formed due to the particular architecture of the roots study ids 6 26 fig 4c and d another observation is that ks appears to decrease with root growth and then increase when the rld reaches a threshold fig 4e and f study ids 25 36 this might be due to the occupancy of soil pore space by young plants followed by the formation of the macro pores generated by mature or degraded plants e g study id 25 other studies study id 38 conducted field experiments for twelve agriculture crops and found that ks due to the addition of roots is proportional to the change of root diameter fig 4g but no clear relationship with rld was obtained fig 4h 5 4 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k is also important for characterizing soil hydrology in general the addition of plant roots results in a higher k compared to that of bare soil for the same soil pressure head ψ study ids 3 6 10 14 37 but the effects seem to be dependent on the value of ψ for example a relatively higher k induced by plant roots is present in near saturation within 0 100 hpa study ids 3 6 or in the range of 0 30 cm pressure head study id 25 however the effects were found to be present for a broader matric potential of more than 1000 hpa for clay soil and grass study id 14 similar to ks root induced increase or decrease in k also depends on root characteristics and plant growth stage for instance lichner et al 2011 study id 34 found that infilling of voids by organic matter and mucilages generated by roots would reduce k substantially song et al 2017 study id 14 found that bermuda grass with fibrous root system might block the soil pore space causing a reduced k while vetiver grass with tap root system was likely to enlarge k due to the generation of preferential flow paths at field scales wahren et al 2009 study id 22 found that k at 250 hpa of the forest sites were 2 4 times larger than that of the cropland sites 6 prediction of rim of shp currently relatively simple regression relationships between root density and ks were used to predict shp however these approaches have certain limitations involving assumption of an instantaneous increase when vegetation is present scanlan 2009 to gain an improved understanding of the physical processes affecting shp it is necessary to parameterize root changes into shp up to now unfortunately very few efforts have been undertaken to incorporate root variables into soil function prediction can be conducted using conceptual models that allow to capture the reduction in soil pore size through idealizing soil pore throats voids are usually surrounded by narrower connections and the voids and connections are then referred to as pores and throats respectively scanlan 2009 the conceptual model considered that the presence of a root reduces the effective diameter of a pore throat and this in turn increases capillary rise and enhances aep moreover ng et al 2016 developed a water retention model for root permeated soils by incorporating the root effects via the parameter of root volume ratio the total volume of roots per unit volume of soil ni et al 2019a further improved this model by introducing additional consideration of root decay ratio defined as the fraction of the return of soil pore space in volume due to root shrinkage upon decay maggi and porporato 2007 used a similar theory to scanlan 2009 in their analysis of the swrc see equation 4 however their method considers the changes in fractal dimensions i e a key parameter in fractal theory to describe ubiquitous irregularities in nature psd and aep to achieve the dynamic prediction of swrc the above methods of predicting swrc mainly focus on root occupying the soil pore space while it is noteworthy that root indcued macro pore genearation may contribute to the ks variation therefore prediction has also been established that ks was proportional to the square of rm the median of pore radius based on the field observations hayashi et al 2006 it can be expected that root diameter was strongly related to rm and the coarse rooting type of legume species may result in a higher rm magnified the psd by shifting pore volume towards the macro pore range bodner et al 2014 this allows the prediction of root effects on shp via the linkage between root soil ks moreover several researchers developed a pore network model e g pore core combining the pore size and connectivity parameters using soil water distribution images by advanced x ray tomography which enabled the calculation of the ks delerue et al 2003 holtham et al 2007 matthews et al 2010 employing ptfs some pioneer studies have established the statistical relationship between vegetation properties e g leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and shp to explore the root effect on hydrological processes sharma et al 2006 jana and mohanty 2011 though they cannot establish a direct relationship with root characteristics e g maximum rooting depth root density and plant type the results of which provides a novel insight for identifying the root effect at a large spatial scale while methods were reviewed for making generalizations regarding the prediction of shp the examples used highlight this as a quantitative tool of assessing the likely impact of roots on shp that requires further exploration 7 knowledge gaps and future research opportunity the current review finds that there are several major limitations in the quantification of root effects on shp since available data are not sufficient to develop a generalized quantification of rim of shp moreover the fitted swrc equation for evaluating the rim of swrc are various such as van genuchten brooks corey kosugi s lognormal psd model kosugi 1996 the vast majority of knowledge about swrc in general and on the influence of plant roots on swrc is derived from experiments and observations using agriculturally important plants while many of these observations will also be transferable to natural ecosystems as general principles it is important to realize that effects on soil structure can perhaps not always be separated from management practices like tillage and fertilization associated with agricultural cultivation angers and caron 1998 chandrasekhar et al 2018 significant further experiments are definitely warranted to validate the conflicting response mechanisms e g soil compaction induced by pore clogging soil loosening induced by macro pore and psd heterogeneity furthermore according to the investigation by jotisankasa and sirirattanachat 2017 the presence of coarse and fine roots could possibly alter the k function from unimodal to bimodal whereas the underlying mechanism of this evolution is unclear and needs further investigation except for the limited data volume the major challenges of quantification of rim of shp may also originate from the multiple interactions between microbial activities roots and soil structure the different spatio temporal scales on which root induced processes operate and the natural heterogeneity of the soil porous system six et al 2004 possible solutions could include treating shp as dynamic characteristics instead of static and the employment of advanced techniques to capture the complex 3d water distribution and pore structure six et al 2004 for example x ray tomography and neutron imaging were used to show the water distribution young 1998 carminati et al 2010 holtham et al 2007 presented the 3d soil void structure induced by clover roots with the pore cor network model however it remains unclear how to up scale the dynamic pore evolution models into the continuum scale dual porosity models in the form of effective parameters particularly for the preferential flow domain alaoui et al 2011 additionally relationships between root properties and shp are typically not linear thus requiring reviewing a very large amount of studies on different soil types and management practices to span the whole range of these properties and to draw reliable conclusions in summary there is a large room ahead to establish a comprehensive root effects that considers the combined influence of soil properties plant types climate conditions and micro fauna activities using hydrological models to predict water balance changes in response to human activities is a common practice a number of studies indicated that model s accuracy and reliability would be improved when considering the temporal dynamics of roots induced by land cover change and seasonal variations in shp mahe et al 2005 bormann et al 2007 šípek et al 2019 however most catchment models do not consider the hydrological effects of roots changes associated with land vegetation variations the difficulties encountered would be that the current data are for small field scales or column tests under the condition of homogeneous soil and uniform plant species thus these data may not be applicable to a larger catchment scale where mixed types of plants and layered soils usually present it is highlighted that substantial work is needed to develop a generalized roots parameterization at catchment scales including in situ measurements of roots effects at a relatively large scale with mixed plants at different plant diversity consideration of soil shallow groundwater systems to account for the interactions between soil moisture soil property and groundwater table moreover root architecture analysis should be considered because it facilitates the upscaling of processes that occur at the individual plant root scale to processes that occur at the catchment scale new soil databases and ptfs that include root properties under catchment land use and crop managements van looy et al 2017 chandrasekhar et al 2018 are also encouraging to support models of plant soil water coupling in addition to the hydrological application the contribution of plant root systems to slope stability soil erosion control reubens et al 2007 ni et al 2018 and biofiltration systems applied to urban runoff le coustumer et al 2012 deserve further research attention 8 conclusions the review of the published literatures indicates that plant roots play an important role in changing the shp which occurs primarily because of the re orientation of the soil particles pore clogging macro aggregate cracking micro aggregate amalgamation root penetration and expansion as well as the root shrinkage and or decay forming macro pores the present studies focused on site specific conditions micro scales and individual plant species insights were obtained from reviewing previous studies on rim of shp for the broader hydrological community particularly those engaged in catchment simulations plan roots have a major role in determining shp at scales ranging from the rhizosphere of individual roots through the development of macro pore structures in soil to the drainage of whole catchments we summarized three different shp variation responses the mature trees characterized by coarse roots or decay root tend to generate macro pore in soil with ks increasing by one to two orders of magnitude grass roots or tree roots at young stage characterized by fine root at high density would generate additional micro pore and enhance the heterogeneity of psd leading to a decrease in ks as well as increased θs fine roots at low density also tend to block soil pores with homogenizing psd leading to reduced θs ks and higher aep generally an increase in rld corresponds to an increase in ks and θs the changes in shp have consequences for the soil water budget components however there has been very few efforts to include time variant shp in hydrological models a major challenge to the hydrological community is to use the current understanding of rim of shp at a range of scales to better simulate the hydrological processes moreover there remains significant knowledge gaps that impede the development of quantitative guidance on rim of shp at the catchment scale it should be acknowledged that there are some physical and chemical interactions between soil and roots that might not be able to be well captured by the pre defined mathematical forms how to fully define these interactions and to parameterize remains a big challenge in soil hydrology further work would include performing experiments at a larger scale that reflect the effects of mixed plants and the heterogeneity of soils and where possible the interaction of the shallow groundwater table these datasets are valuable in roots effects parameterization and the development of soil characteristics curve which is fundamental in soil science and catchment hydrology to advance the quantification of rim on shp we advocate the development of comprehensive databases of shp to facilitate the formulation of dynamic shp and ptfs incorporating root effects we believe that this review provides useful information of the current status and future directions of roots hydrological effects it has been identified that there existed general trends of global greening or browning de jong et al 2012 pan et al 2018 which implies that it is necessary to assess the impacts of the changes of land plants on the water balance at various scales and hence an improved understanding of the role of plant roots in controlling water flow partitioning would be vital and urgent

5267,regional scale hydrological investigations that involve vegetation change usually neglect root induced modification rim of soil hydraulic properties shp however there is evidence that root distributions may impart major control over shp a critical barrier to incorporating rim of shp in catchment hydrology models is the high uncertainty of root effect parameterization in response to this the current article reviews available literature to summarize the key processes measurement prediction and implications of rim of shp previous studies found contrasting root effects on shp depending on which processes are dominant including root growth or decay and the density and diameter of roots based on data from laboratory experiments and field testing rim of shp can be summarized as 1 fine roots root diameter 1 mm at low density tend to block soil pores leading to reduced saturated water content θs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and higher air entry potential aep 2 fine roots at high density tend to eliminate macro pores while increasing pore volume leading to increased θs and aep and reduced ks 3 coarse roots root diameter 2 mm tend to cause small scale compaction particle re orientation and macro pore development leading to increased θs and ks and decreased aep root growth also tends to enhance soil moisture retention hysteresis root decay is expected to have the opposite effects to root growth due to the creation of continuous macro pores which may lead to ks increases of up to two orders of magnitude in general the enhancement of ks due to plant roots can be expected in fine textured soils whereas plants roots are known to reduce ks and θs and increase soil water retention capacity in coarse textured soils an important aspect of rim of shp is the temporal variability that arises from seasonality and or agricultural cycles while neglecting rim of shp in hydrologic simulation may lead to high uncertainties there remain significant knowledge gaps that impede the development of quantitative guidance on rim of shp at the catchment scale at which variability in environmental conditions and human activities precludes the application of simple root effect equations keywords vegetation change soil hydraulic properties macro pore development root induced modification catchment hydrology 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties shp play a major role in the hydrological and ecological functioning of watersheds garcia gonzalez et al 2012 livneh et al 2015 reliable shp are required for the development of hydrological models over a wide range of scales and natural resource problems kishné et al 2017 however shp are challenging to characterize given the heterogeneous nature of soils and the large areas over which hydrological processes are often studied sobieraj et al 2004 mcdonnell et al 2007 koch et al 2016 libohova et al 2018 approaches to simulating temporal changes of shp are relatively rare and at an early stage of development mainly because measurement is costly and time consuming and there is a lack of guidance on the parameterization of transient soil structure vereecken et al 2010 the focus of hydrological studies that require shp inputs is generally the spatial variability and uncertainties of shp jin et al 2015 vrugt et al 2008 a number of factors are reported that may modify shp over time including seasonal wetting drying cycles pires et al 2005 gadi et al 2017 agricultural management e g tillage fertilization plantation and crop rotation schwen et al 2011 chandrasekhar et al 2018 and changes in vegetation and their root distributions leung et al 2015b gould et al 2016 wu et al 2016 as vegetation within a catchment may experience significant temporal variations e g long term changes such as broad scale clearing and reforestation and seasonal variations accompanying agricultural practices root distributions and their influence on subsurface behavior may also exhibit considerable temporal variability hu et al 2009 ghestem et al 2011 bodner et al 2013 despite this quantitative guidance on root induced modification rim of shp is currently lacking especially for hydrologists tasked with evaluating soil groundwater and watershed behavior at field and ecosystem scales this has led to a lack of catchment studies that incorporate rim of shp nevertheless there is a large body of literature on root effects on shp e g carminati et al 2011 moradi et al 2011 scholl et al 2014 leung et al 2015a yu et al 2016 the current review attempts to draw together existing knowledge of root shp relationships to benefit hydrology practitioners particularly modelers who may be considering the hydrological behavior of a catchment in which roots play a major role in soil moisture dynamics and rainfall runoff behavior this study aims to integrate and build on a significant body of previous research e g gadi et al 2016 stirzaker et al 1996 bengough 2012 logsdon 2013 to identify the state of current knowledge persistent research gaps and available guidance on root shp relationships and the associated hydro biophysical processes particularly those that are relevant to field scale hydrological investigation 2 soil hydraulic properties shp shp include relationships between the soil water content and a the soil pressure head and b the soil hydraulic conductivity see equations below the relationship between the soil water content and pressure head is termed the soil water retention curve swrc which describes the variation in soil water storage with water pressure popular expressions for the swrc include those of brooks and corey 1964 kosugi 1996 and van genuchten 1980 the latter is arguably the most widely used van genuchten s 1980 functions describing the swrc and the soil hydraulic conductivity are 1 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 2 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where se is the effective saturation θs is the saturated water content typically presumed to be soil porosity θr is the residual water content and ψ is the soil pressure head l being negative for suction α l 1 is a scaling parameter n is a fitting parameter m 1 1 n n 1 l is a tortuosity parameter and k and ks are unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivities l t 1 respectively the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 for the swrc and k is also commonly applied and is given by 4 s e ψ ψ ψ b b ψ ψ b 1 ψ ψ b 5 k s e k s s e 3 2 b here ψb is the air entry or bubbling potential aep l and b is an empirical pore size distribution index while the parameters α m and n of the van genuchten 1980 model are empirical brooks and corey 1964 considered ψb to be physically based and assouline 2005 was able to relate b to the soil pore size distribution psd by comparing swrcs to b for some 20 different soils thereby reducing the empirical nature of b the soil parameters of the van genuchten 1980 and brooks and corey 1964 equations are often approximated from soil properties e g textural properties bulk density and organic matter that are easily measurable in the field using empirical functions of correlation i e pedo transfer functions ptfs the accuracy of van genuchten 1980 parameters obtained from ptfs is typically less than that attainable from fitting models to moisture retention data however there are significant efficiency gains from applying ptfs due to the wide availability of field measurements that are common inputs to ptfs vereecken et al 2010 for example tomasella et al 2000 derived a ptf for tropical soils to predict van genuchten 1980 parameters using data i e texture soil organic carbon moisture equivalent and bulk density from 500 brazilian soil horizons popular databases containing ptfs for a variety of soil types include rosetta and unsoda and these have widespread application in investigations of soil hydrological research scharnagl et al 2011 botula et al 2012 koestel et al 2018 3 factors affecting root growth root distribution patterns reflect the adaptation of plant species to prevailing environmental conditions yang et al 2016 root growth and decay is also linked to vegetation health which is a function of numerous factors including solar radiation water availability nutrient levels and pests diseases fao 1985 thus these factors may affect root distributions and thereby lead to modified shp additionally vegetation may be removed or perish as part of agricultural cycles or due to overgrazing or land clearing leaving behind bare soils seubert et al 1977 mattsson et al 2000 mekuria et al 2007 revegetation to stabilize slopes for phytoremediation measures and for other beneficial means huat et al 2006 gadi et al 2016 introduces roots to previously unvegetated soils thereby changing soil structure i e the arrangement of the solid parts and pore spaces of the soil where the roots of removed vegetation remain root death is generally expected to reverse the effects on shp of root growth for example whereas under certain conditions root growth might be expected to clog soil pores and reduce ks root decay may lead to the formation of preferential pathways that enhance the bulk soil ks li and ghodrati 1994 mitchell et al 1995 ghestem et al 2011 plant growth and root distributions also depend on seasonal and or longer term climatic cycles hatfield and prueger 2015 eissenstat et al 2005 investigated the relationship between the timing of root growth and plant stage for apple trees and grape vines and concluded that root production mainly occurred in the summer but the specific timing varied widely between bloom and harvest from year to year tryon and chapin 1983 found that the seasonal pattern of tree growth in the forests of interior alaska was highly correlated to soil temperature which peaks in july they also observed greater depths of root penetration for the tree species in warmer sites integrated plant root soil modeling by van wijk 2011 predicted rooting patterns in water limited environments and also demonstrated that plants may shift the zone of maximum root activity downwards in the profile when suffering drought stress schenk and jackson 2002 established a database of 1300 records of root systems for individual plants from a wide range of climatic settings they found that root systems tended to be shallower and wider in relatively dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates however schenk and jackson 2002 found that plants of a given above ground size tend to have smaller root systems in warm conditions high potential evapotranspiration than in cold conditions soil texture i e the size distribution of soil particles also plays a critical role in determining rooting patterns stirzaker et al 1996 shallow soils overlying largely impenetrable rock may limit vegetation assemblages to grasses and annual weeds hewitt 2004 thicker shorter and less vigorous roots are expected where plants grow in hard soils jin et al 2015 rebetzke et al 2014 vertical discontinuities in soil density due to layering in the degree of soil compaction may also limit root growth jin et al 2017 root development is also influenced by soil salinity bernstein and kafkafi 2002 soil salinity affects plants through the reduced osmotic potential of the soil solution and the toxicity of specific ions hillel 2004 in regions of significant salt stress vegetation will be limited to salt tolerant species while extreme levels of salinization may lead to barren land ghassemi et al 1995 ijaz et al 2019 undertook salinization experiments on salt tolerant rice species and found reduced root length and surface area with salt accumulation even after only three days of elevated salinities some plant species can adjust root distributions in accordance with spatial variability in soil salinity thereby mitigating the harmful effects of localized elevated salinities sonneveld and de kreij 1999 bazihizina et al 2012 a multitude of human activities modify plant species and rooting patterns agricultural practices and urbanization are the primary causal factors of such impacts seubert et al 1977 mckinney 2002 increasing demand for timber products and agricultural land has resulted in drastic land cover change including the conversion of forests to cropland or pastures ghuman et al 1991 murty et al 2002 zimmermann et al 2006 the clearing of forests for agriculture alters the depth and distribution of plant roots jackson et al 2000 murty et al 2002 reviewed the effects of a change from forest to cropland and found that agricultural soils had on average 13 higher bulk density than the original forest soils agriculture often removes above ground vegetation but roots remain in the ground to die for example harvesting of crops causes partial die back of the root system at the expense of consuming the soil carbon pool by root exudates i e biologically active root secretions that influence the rhizosphere and surrounding organisms to the benefit of the plant and the turnover of fine root biomass smith et al 2005 other factors modifying root distributions include biological activity e g soil borne diseases and harmful organisms like root knot nematodes etc soil fertility changes e g due to agricultural practices and episodic events e g fire storms etc for example bushfire may affect plant species distribution and root distribution by consuming or altering organic matter snyman and bredenkamp 2005 ebel 2012 alcaniz et al 2018 4 processes causing root induced modification of soil hydraulic properties roots may affect the psd and pore connectivity of soils by creating exploiting and occupying the soil pore space hayashi et al 2006 bodner et al 2014 scholl et al 2014 bacq labreuil et al 2018 plant roots physically chemically and biologically interact with soil through various mechanisms including mechanical stabilization enmeshing enlarging soil aggregates soil compaction and the release of exudates clark et al 2003 bronick and lal 2005 burri et al 2009 the dominant physical processes associated with root influences on soils include soil particle rearrangement pore clogging cracking of macro aggregates 250 μm amalgamation of micro aggregates 2 250 μm and generation of macro pores 30 μm as shown schematically in fig 1 in the pore scale realignment of soil particles fig 1a coarser roots may have higher strength and capacity to shift soil particles particle realignment accompanying root expansion may also lead to the binding and local compression of soil particles conversely the growth of finer roots tends to leave soil particles in their original orientation because finer roots are expected to buckle under soil mechanical stresses bengough et al 2011 as shown in fig 1b thus fine roots tend to grow along the tortuous pathways between soil particles leading eventually to pore clogging bruand et al 1996 maggi and porporato 2007 koebernick et al 2017 the amalgamation of soil particles into soil aggregates is expected to influence shp by increasing macro pore volumes whereas disaggregation is expected to have the opposite effect as shown in fig 1c 1d that is the mean size of soil aggregates decreases when roots penetrate macro aggregates but aggregate sizes may be increased through amalgamation by roots when aggregates are initially small logsdon 2013 whalley et al 2005 cracking of macro aggregates leading to the formation of inter aggregate pores may arise from spatial variability and transience in root water uptake giving rise to dynamic tensile stresses that lead to aggregate breakdown into micro aggregates materechera et al 1992 where roots penetrate small pores and subsequently increase in their diameter and overall biomass flow pathways may be created through the breaking apart of macro aggregates therefore the formation of root channels may play an important role in acting as preferential flow channels as illustrated in fig 1e in addition shrinkage or decay of coarse roots is likely to contribute to the formation of macro pores ghestem et al 2011 ni et al 2019a thereby providing a greater capacity for infiltration fig 1f conversely micro aggregates may be amalgamated into macro aggregates through the action of plant roots and residues plus the hyphae of mutualistic fungi which together act to enmesh micro aggregates to create macro aggregates tisdall et al 2010 the processes leading to rim of soils have interrelated spatial scales and temporal dimensions particularly in relation to the timing and degree of change to soil aggregates tisdall et al 2010 processes of soil particle re orientation and pore clogging mainly occur at the rhizosphere scale fig 1a 1b resulting from transient changes in the mucilage exuded by roots roberson and firestone 1991 and the growth of fungal hyphae koebernick et al 2017 at the aggregate scale root penetration and shrinkage influence aggregates due to root growth and decay typically on a seasonal scale fig 1e 1f longer timeframes are required to reach a balance between plant root distributions and the stability of soil aggregates which are controlled by macro aggregate cracking and micro aggregate amalgamation fig 1c 1d roberson et al 1995 ball et al 2005 at the field scale root channels and other macro pores may play dominant roles in affecting runoff generation and surface infiltration for example a minor increase in macro porosity i e pores with radii 30 μm presumed to drain at pressures of 0 to 100 hpa luxmoore 1981 arising from root penetration and shrinkage fig 1e 1f can increase ks by more than an order of magnitude beven and germann 1982 scholl et al 2014 5 quantifying root induced modification of soil hydraulic properties 5 1 summary of previous quantitative studies a summary of the main findings from our review of the current body of knowledge regarding rim of shp is provided in table 1 methods of analysis are based on soil column and soil core studies undertaken under both controlled laboratory conditions and natural outdoor settings and through both in situ and ex situ testing previous studies of rim of shps cover wide ranging conditions soil types plant species and climatic conditions and experimental designs the findings from these studies have not previously been summarized and nor have conclusions been drawn to assist regional scale hydrological studies where rim of shp including swrcs may have an important effect the primary method for assessing root effects on swrc e g study ids 1 22 k and ks e g study ids 23 38 among the references summarized in table 1 is laboratory soil column testing study ids 1 2 4 6 7 9 13 15 23 26 table 1 whereby individual plant species are grown under controlled conditions and shps are determined during various stages of growth in most cases involving the measurement of swrcs both soil pressure and water content were measured simultaneously using sensors e g study ids 10 14 alternatively soil pressure was continuously monitored by tensiometers and soil samples were weighed regularly study ids 3 4 6 7 8 other column experiments used specified pressure heads at the column lower boundary although this method only applies to rather coarse materials study ids 2 9 15 because soil pressure heads are limited to less than 1 m using this approach some studies study ids 2 5 12 17 used inverse analysis to determine transient profiles of water content pressure head and outflow whereby unsaturated flow was solved using a model and considering measured initial and boundary conditions field experiments of rim of shp typically involve the extraction of relatively shallow soil cores within which the root density is high relative to deeper soils study ids 17 22 27 38 soil cores were evaluated using centrifugation study id 19 and with pressure plate methods study ids 5 16 20 21 22 for assessing swrcs in situ infiltration tests were the preferred approach for almost all presented articles that focused on the estimation of ks study ids 27 38 both field and laboratory analyses of rooting effects were mainly conducted on single plant species such as individual crops study ids 2 3 8 9 12 15 18 24 25 grasses study ids 4 6 10 14 21 23 and shrubs and trees study ids 1 3 7 10 11 13 21 23 26 most of these studies explored the rim of shp in the context of crops and agricultural practices studies using undisturbed soil columns have the advantages of retaining soil layering and laboratory control study ids 12 25 however extracted soil columns did not appear to allow the same roots and crack development that are likely to occur in the field song et al 2017 since root length density rld total length of roots per unit volume of soil cm cm 3 is related to the stabilization of soil aggregates and thus soil structure the soil loosening effect induced by roots may also be restrained in soil column experiments yunusa and newton 2003 bodner et al 2014 in contrast field studies have the ability to reflect both the depth variability of vegetated soil with fully developed roots and the cracks typically found within large soil volumes under field conditions other environmental and management effects can mask the distinct influence exerted by plant roots bodner et al 2013 scholl et al 2014 alternatively soil column extraction is often preferred to undisturbed field samples to observe root induced changes under controlled conditions e g study id 14 however extracted soil columns may not properly capture the field scale heterogeneity that is the soil and root effect heterogeneity within a field site may be substantial as shown in randomized block design i e treatments are randomly allocated to the experimental units inside each block to minimize the effects of systematic error study ids 17 19 20 30 32 35 38 and as replicated in plot experiments study ids 21 22 27 28 29 31 33 34 36 37 almost all laboratory studies in table 1 were conducted within root growth stages of 4 months except for the study ids 6 10 26 which prolonged the root growth stage to 8 months to investigate root decay processes fig 1f therefore the results of these studies reflect the rim of shp mainly related to soil structure responses to sprouting plants and the accompanying root growth as shown in fig 1a b c and e in contrast field experiments especially for ks in natural vegetation communities study ids 22 27 29 were conducted on long time scales years to decades these allowed for observations of root induced changes to soil carbon involved in macro aggregate stabilization fig 1d and the effects of microbial communities especially in coarse textured soils e g study ids 19 21 a summary of the results from the 38 investigations of rim of shp described in table 1 is presented in supplementary table s1 the results show that root effects on shp include changes mainly to the soil porosity aep and the psd these parameters may or may not allow for direct determination of swrcs depending on the swrc model see equations 1 to 5 and or inform the soil properties of catchment models it follows that quantification of rim of swrcs would need to be inferred from typical field measured soil properties described above e g using ptfs this was the approach adopted in study id 19 in which the ptf method retc program was used to evaluate the swrc of bare soil for a comparison with direct measurements of swrc parameters for the root permeated soil several studies have shown that roots play an important role in increasing soil water holding capacity which is the amount of water held in soil at the field capacity the field capacity is the value of θ that remains after 2 3 days of gravity drainage from initially saturated conditions often estimated to be θ at ψ of 100 or 330 hpa nachabe 1998 increased water holding capacity is indicated by larger aep and higher soil water content at a given pressure head as observed in study ids 2 3 6 7 21 however roots may increase study ids 3 7 8 12 15 21 or decrease study ids 5 16 the soil porosity it appears from these results that rim of shp is complex and multifaceted and is the result of manifold interactions between soil fauna microbes vegetation type and other factors six et al 2004 making it challenge to attribute shp changes to vegetation type or simple representations of root distributions and behavior 5 2 effects of plant type on swrc the effects of plant types on the rim of swrc shows complex interplays between other parameters for instance study id 6 found that vetiver grass roots increased substantially the aep in silt soil whereas only a slight variation in aep was observed in clayey sandy soil gonzalez sosa et al 2010 undertook testing of sandy loam soils supporting different vegetation species within a small french catchment and found that the rim of soil porosity differed with vegetation type such that the average porosities for bare soil forest grass and crop species were 0 41 0 1 0 74 0 05 0 62 0 07 and 0 48 0 1 respectively the results of gonzalez sosa et al 2010 indicate that soil texture used in most ptfs is not sufficient to map shp variability and rather vegetation type and other land use aspects should be considered in estimating in situ shp distributions data from the references listed in tables 1 and s1 were used to summarize variations in swrc parameters induced by roots as they relate to categories of soil texture and vegetation type here according to the guidance from the unified soil classification system astm 2011 soil textures containing a high proportion of finer particles generally sand fraction 50 such as silt and clay are classified as fine textured soils while soil textures comprising high proportions of sand 50 such as sand loamy sand and sandy loam are classified as coarse textured soils following the land cover classification system developed by fao di gregorio 2005 vegetation types are classified as crop grass and tree shrub in this paper different from the fao classification fodder grass and legumes were classified as grass the results shown in fig 2 are intended to seek general relationships regarding rim of swrc given the limited quantification of swrc parameters in root effect studies ptfs from the rosetta database schaap et al 2001 were used to relate soil physical properties e g soil textural composition and bulk density to swrc parameters bruand et al 1996 found this approach to be valid when compared to measurements of porosity reduction of 22 24 in wheat planted soil due to the effects of roots which was consistent with the decrease in θs 26 calculated using the rosetta approach the results of fig 2 offer initial insight into the rim of swrc parameters although there are insufficient data as indicated by data points for some of the vegetation soil type categories to draw generalized conclusions nevertheless some general observations can be drawn from fig 2 including 1 θs appears more likely to increase with the addition of vegetation 2 α appears more likely to decrease with the addition of vegetation 3 mixed trends or insufficient data are apparent for n and ψb more detailed evaluation of these findings is offered in the next sub section 5 3 effects of plant type on θs α n and ψ b fig 2a shows that plants exert substantial effects on θs with variations due to the addition of vegetation ranging from 18 to 34 the study by bormann et al 2007 helps to illustrate the summary of experimental results in fig 2a they summarized from 8 existing studies the variation of bulk density for land cover change and concluded that when vegetation changed from forest to grassland from grassland to crop and from forest to crop the bulk density increased and therefore the porosity presumably decreased by up to 27 21 and 17 2 respectively their results are generally reflected by the coarse textured soil trends in fig 2a that is the roots from vegetation types tree shrub grass and crop tend to increase θs by 19 16 and 15 in coarse textured soil respectively the increase in coarse textured soil θs arising from the addition of vegetation is most likely caused by the penetration of coarser roots contributing to the formation of macro pores leading to higher macro porosity and substantial increases in θs the rim of θs in fine textured soils b1 b3 fig 2a appears to differ to that of coarse textured soils a1 a3 fig 2 that is the rim increase in θs in fine textured soils is 13 on average whereas in coarse textured soils θs increased by 17 on average further fig 2a shows that there is significant evidence of roots leading to reduced θs in fine textured soils while roots caused reduced θs in only five of the 17 cases of coarse textured soils however there is considerable variability of rim effects on θs arising from differences in vegetation type even within the above mentioned categories for example whalley et al 2005 study id 16 showed using a pressure plate apparatus that the porosity of soil aggregates within silty clay loam decreased by 3 and 18 and increased by 35 compared to bare soil when used to grow maize wheat and barley respectively these results lead to the wide range of rim of θs for b3 in fig 2a the parameters α and ψb both reflect the soil water holding capacity and therefore they are expected to show some correlation morel seytoux et al 1996 in order to summarize quantitatively their relationship the effects of plant type from a total of 20 case studies were plotted in fig 2b it is shown that the parameter α generally decreases with the addition of vegetation roots with a maximum decrease of 60 5 for b1 only one among the 12 cases show an increase in α with a maximum increase of 83 for b2 in contrast the parameter ψb generally increases with the addition of vegetation roots with a maximum increase of 200 for a1 therefore inverse proportionality between α and ψb is generally evidenced except one case study id 4 in a2 which showed a decrease of ψb associated with fissures created between roots and soil interfaces the parameter n demonstrates a more complex pattern that appears to be dependent on the different combinations of plant and soil types based on 16 study cases fig 2c a decrease in n with the addition of roots of up to 11 is present for a2 while a maximum root induced increase of 33 is shown for b1 considering the physical processes that influence n assists in interpreting observations of the influence of roots on n normally a low value of n is indicative of soils with broad psd and higher n indicates more uniform distributions lenhard et al 1989 this was exemplified in hallet et al 2009 where they found more heterogeneous pores from planted soils tomato than those in the unplanted soils the increased pore heterogeneity caused by root growth could explain the decreased n for a1 a2 and b2 study ids 7 10 19 in contrast root induced pore clogging may contribute to the homogenization of psd and an increased n for a3 b1 and b3 study ids 3 7 13 it should be acknowledged that the data sample used in fig 2 may not be large enough to draw a generalized conclusion nevertheless an initial guide of rim of swrc parameters can still be obtained 5 4 effects of plant type on saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 5 4 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is a key parameter of soils particularly as it represents the infiltration rate of saturated soils under gravity drainage and is widely used in hydrological modeling data from tables 1 and s1 were used to summarize variations in ks induced by roots fig 3 these results contained therein show that plant roots exert substantial effects on ks ranging from 143 to 1085 the presented articles i e see table s1 also showed that 21 among the 33 cases show an increase in ks with formation of marco pores or preferential flow induced by roots fig 1a c and f the largest change in ks due to the addition of roots occurred in coarse textured soil containing tree shrub vegetation i e a1 however plant roots also reduced ks in coarse textured soils as indicated in 11 among 12 cases in coarse textured soils with showed root induced pore clogging a1 a2 a3 the rim of the relative changes in ks in fine textured soils for grass and crop 283 and 414 on average for b2 and b3 appears to be greater than those in coarse textured soils 85 and 24 on average for a2 and a3 generally it is concluded that the largest relative change of ks occurred due to the addition of tree shrub vegetation to soils followed by grass and crop study ids 22 27 31 33 however the effects are not only dependent on the type of the plant but also on the stage of plant growth leung et al 2017 study id 23 reported the ks values for different rlds and included various growth periods of grass and willow their data showed that compared to bare soil ks was nearly linearly proportional to rld for example ks was larger by 183 to 511 for rld of 0 82 to 7 14 cm cm 3 grass and 133 to 1085 for rld of 0 075 to 0 552 cm cm 3 willow fig 4 a and b however reported data also show that ks may decrease when roots develop beyond a certain level of maturity so that a physical obstacle to the soil water flow is formed due to the particular architecture of the roots study ids 6 26 fig 4c and d another observation is that ks appears to decrease with root growth and then increase when the rld reaches a threshold fig 4e and f study ids 25 36 this might be due to the occupancy of soil pore space by young plants followed by the formation of the macro pores generated by mature or degraded plants e g study id 25 other studies study id 38 conducted field experiments for twelve agriculture crops and found that ks due to the addition of roots is proportional to the change of root diameter fig 4g but no clear relationship with rld was obtained fig 4h 5 4 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k is also important for characterizing soil hydrology in general the addition of plant roots results in a higher k compared to that of bare soil for the same soil pressure head ψ study ids 3 6 10 14 37 but the effects seem to be dependent on the value of ψ for example a relatively higher k induced by plant roots is present in near saturation within 0 100 hpa study ids 3 6 or in the range of 0 30 cm pressure head study id 25 however the effects were found to be present for a broader matric potential of more than 1000 hpa for clay soil and grass study id 14 similar to ks root induced increase or decrease in k also depends on root characteristics and plant growth stage for instance lichner et al 2011 study id 34 found that infilling of voids by organic matter and mucilages generated by roots would reduce k substantially song et al 2017 study id 14 found that bermuda grass with fibrous root system might block the soil pore space causing a reduced k while vetiver grass with tap root system was likely to enlarge k due to the generation of preferential flow paths at field scales wahren et al 2009 study id 22 found that k at 250 hpa of the forest sites were 2 4 times larger than that of the cropland sites 6 prediction of rim of shp currently relatively simple regression relationships between root density and ks were used to predict shp however these approaches have certain limitations involving assumption of an instantaneous increase when vegetation is present scanlan 2009 to gain an improved understanding of the physical processes affecting shp it is necessary to parameterize root changes into shp up to now unfortunately very few efforts have been undertaken to incorporate root variables into soil function prediction can be conducted using conceptual models that allow to capture the reduction in soil pore size through idealizing soil pore throats voids are usually surrounded by narrower connections and the voids and connections are then referred to as pores and throats respectively scanlan 2009 the conceptual model considered that the presence of a root reduces the effective diameter of a pore throat and this in turn increases capillary rise and enhances aep moreover ng et al 2016 developed a water retention model for root permeated soils by incorporating the root effects via the parameter of root volume ratio the total volume of roots per unit volume of soil ni et al 2019a further improved this model by introducing additional consideration of root decay ratio defined as the fraction of the return of soil pore space in volume due to root shrinkage upon decay maggi and porporato 2007 used a similar theory to scanlan 2009 in their analysis of the swrc see equation 4 however their method considers the changes in fractal dimensions i e a key parameter in fractal theory to describe ubiquitous irregularities in nature psd and aep to achieve the dynamic prediction of swrc the above methods of predicting swrc mainly focus on root occupying the soil pore space while it is noteworthy that root indcued macro pore genearation may contribute to the ks variation therefore prediction has also been established that ks was proportional to the square of rm the median of pore radius based on the field observations hayashi et al 2006 it can be expected that root diameter was strongly related to rm and the coarse rooting type of legume species may result in a higher rm magnified the psd by shifting pore volume towards the macro pore range bodner et al 2014 this allows the prediction of root effects on shp via the linkage between root soil ks moreover several researchers developed a pore network model e g pore core combining the pore size and connectivity parameters using soil water distribution images by advanced x ray tomography which enabled the calculation of the ks delerue et al 2003 holtham et al 2007 matthews et al 2010 employing ptfs some pioneer studies have established the statistical relationship between vegetation properties e g leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and shp to explore the root effect on hydrological processes sharma et al 2006 jana and mohanty 2011 though they cannot establish a direct relationship with root characteristics e g maximum rooting depth root density and plant type the results of which provides a novel insight for identifying the root effect at a large spatial scale while methods were reviewed for making generalizations regarding the prediction of shp the examples used highlight this as a quantitative tool of assessing the likely impact of roots on shp that requires further exploration 7 knowledge gaps and future research opportunity the current review finds that there are several major limitations in the quantification of root effects on shp since available data are not sufficient to develop a generalized quantification of rim of shp moreover the fitted swrc equation for evaluating the rim of swrc are various such as van genuchten brooks corey kosugi s lognormal psd model kosugi 1996 the vast majority of knowledge about swrc in general and on the influence of plant roots on swrc is derived from experiments and observations using agriculturally important plants while many of these observations will also be transferable to natural ecosystems as general principles it is important to realize that effects on soil structure can perhaps not always be separated from management practices like tillage and fertilization associated with agricultural cultivation angers and caron 1998 chandrasekhar et al 2018 significant further experiments are definitely warranted to validate the conflicting response mechanisms e g soil compaction induced by pore clogging soil loosening induced by macro pore and psd heterogeneity furthermore according to the investigation by jotisankasa and sirirattanachat 2017 the presence of coarse and fine roots could possibly alter the k function from unimodal to bimodal whereas the underlying mechanism of this evolution is unclear and needs further investigation except for the limited data volume the major challenges of quantification of rim of shp may also originate from the multiple interactions between microbial activities roots and soil structure the different spatio temporal scales on which root induced processes operate and the natural heterogeneity of the soil porous system six et al 2004 possible solutions could include treating shp as dynamic characteristics instead of static and the employment of advanced techniques to capture the complex 3d water distribution and pore structure six et al 2004 for example x ray tomography and neutron imaging were used to show the water distribution young 1998 carminati et al 2010 holtham et al 2007 presented the 3d soil void structure induced by clover roots with the pore cor network model however it remains unclear how to up scale the dynamic pore evolution models into the continuum scale dual porosity models in the form of effective parameters particularly for the preferential flow domain alaoui et al 2011 additionally relationships between root properties and shp are typically not linear thus requiring reviewing a very large amount of studies on different soil types and management practices to span the whole range of these properties and to draw reliable conclusions in summary there is a large room ahead to establish a comprehensive root effects that considers the combined influence of soil properties plant types climate conditions and micro fauna activities using hydrological models to predict water balance changes in response to human activities is a common practice a number of studies indicated that model s accuracy and reliability would be improved when considering the temporal dynamics of roots induced by land cover change and seasonal variations in shp mahe et al 2005 bormann et al 2007 šípek et al 2019 however most catchment models do not consider the hydrological effects of roots changes associated with land vegetation variations the difficulties encountered would be that the current data are for small field scales or column tests under the condition of homogeneous soil and uniform plant species thus these data may not be applicable to a larger catchment scale where mixed types of plants and layered soils usually present it is highlighted that substantial work is needed to develop a generalized roots parameterization at catchment scales including in situ measurements of roots effects at a relatively large scale with mixed plants at different plant diversity consideration of soil shallow groundwater systems to account for the interactions between soil moisture soil property and groundwater table moreover root architecture analysis should be considered because it facilitates the upscaling of processes that occur at the individual plant root scale to processes that occur at the catchment scale new soil databases and ptfs that include root properties under catchment land use and crop managements van looy et al 2017 chandrasekhar et al 2018 are also encouraging to support models of plant soil water coupling in addition to the hydrological application the contribution of plant root systems to slope stability soil erosion control reubens et al 2007 ni et al 2018 and biofiltration systems applied to urban runoff le coustumer et al 2012 deserve further research attention 8 conclusions the review of the published literatures indicates that plant roots play an important role in changing the shp which occurs primarily because of the re orientation of the soil particles pore clogging macro aggregate cracking micro aggregate amalgamation root penetration and expansion as well as the root shrinkage and or decay forming macro pores the present studies focused on site specific conditions micro scales and individual plant species insights were obtained from reviewing previous studies on rim of shp for the broader hydrological community particularly those engaged in catchment simulations plan roots have a major role in determining shp at scales ranging from the rhizosphere of individual roots through the development of macro pore structures in soil to the drainage of whole catchments we summarized three different shp variation responses the mature trees characterized by coarse roots or decay root tend to generate macro pore in soil with ks increasing by one to two orders of magnitude grass roots or tree roots at young stage characterized by fine root at high density would generate additional micro pore and enhance the heterogeneity of psd leading to a decrease in ks as well as increased θs fine roots at low density also tend to block soil pores with homogenizing psd leading to reduced θs ks and higher aep generally an increase in rld corresponds to an increase in ks and θs the changes in shp have consequences for the soil water budget components however there has been very few efforts to include time variant shp in hydrological models a major challenge to the hydrological community is to use the current understanding of rim of shp at a range of scales to better simulate the hydrological processes moreover there remains significant knowledge gaps that impede the development of quantitative guidance on rim of shp at the catchment scale it should be acknowledged that there are some physical and chemical interactions between soil and roots that might not be able to be well captured by the pre defined mathematical forms how to fully define these interactions and to parameterize remains a big challenge in soil hydrology further work would include performing experiments at a larger scale that reflect the effects of mixed plants and the heterogeneity of soils and where possible the interaction of the shallow groundwater table these datasets are valuable in roots effects parameterization and the development of soil characteristics curve which is fundamental in soil science and catchment hydrology to advance the quantification of rim on shp we advocate the development of comprehensive databases of shp to facilitate the formulation of dynamic shp and ptfs incorporating root effects we believe that this review provides useful information of the current status and future directions of roots hydrological effects it has been identified that there existed general trends of global greening or browning de jong et al 2012 pan et al 2018 which implies that it is necessary to assess the impacts of the changes of land plants on the water balance at various scales and hence an improved understanding of the role of plant roots in controlling water flow partitioning would be vital and urgent

5268,water flow in the unsaturated zone is an important component of the water cycle accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters ensures precise simulations of water flow in the unsaturated zone in this study a gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman filter method gpienkf is proposed and applied for estimating soil hydraulic parameters for two dimensional soil water flow the method involves a surrogate model for two dimensional soil water flow that is based on the gaussian process method the accuracy and efficiency of the gpienkf method are validated using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation the impact of the layout of observation points as well as the number of training base points and observation points on the estimation of parameters are also analyzed the results show that the surrogate model can accurately predict pressure heads at observation points the layout of observation points that precisely describes infiltration water movement allows the surrogate model to better emulate the original model thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimation the number of training base points is found to have only a small influence on parameter estimation the accuracy of parameter estimation and pressure head predictions can be further improved by increasing the number of observation points however the accuracy of predictions is affected by the uncertainty of boundary conditions and the soil spatial heterogeneity the gpienkf method can effectively estimate multiple parameters characterizing water flow in layered soils as compared with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter the gpienkf method can greatly improve computational efficiency while obtaining comparable results the gpienkf method is an efficient tool for parameter estimation of multi dimensional soil water flow keywords data assimilation gaussian process ensemble kalman filter surrogate model 1 introduction water flow in the unsaturated zone is an important component of the water cycle from a hydrological point of view soil moisture determines the separation of precipitation into runoff evaporation and infiltration and the division of net radiation into latent sensible and geothermal heat fluxes pauwels et al 2007 as concern regarding the protection of the environment and the quality of groundwater rises the importance of an accurate soil physical description of porous systems within the unsaturated zone is increasingly recognized in environmental engineering and groundwater hydrology hopmans and šimůnek 1999 the quantification of water flux exchanges between the land surface the unsaturated zone and groundwater requires an accurate parameterization of soil hydraulic properties zhang et al 2018 many inverse methods such as the levenberg marquardt algorithm kool et al 1985 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 and the amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 have been used for estimating soil hydraulic parameters šimůnek et al 1998 abbasi et al 2003 vrugt et al 2003 durner et al 2008 wöhling et al 2008 the main problem with respect to these methods is that the uncertainty is attributed to model parameters ignoring the additional uncertainty of inputs outputs and model structures vrugt et al 2008 in the process of model construction there are many errors both in the model structure due to the simplification of physical processes and in observation data due to the limitation of observation methods it is incorrect to attribute the uncertainty only to model parameters data assimilation methods provide a strong framework for dealing with the uncertainty problem due to its superiority in solving high dimensional and nonlinear problems the ensemble kalman filter method enkf evensen 1994 has been a preferred method for assimilating state variables and for estimating parameters of unsaturated zone de lannoy et al 2007 li and ren 2011 pasetto et al 2012 medina et al 2014 song et al 2014 shi et al 2015 brandhorst et al 2017 however applying the enkf method to unsaturated zone problems may encounter an inconsistency problem after being updated simultaneously using a linear update function the state variables and parameters may not follow the nonlinear richards equation song et al 2014 since variance minimizing analyses rather than physical principles are used to update state variables and parameters these may violate certain constraints such as the water balance or nonnegativity of parameters and states pan and wood 2006 to resolve the inconsistency problem several improved enkf algorithms have been proposed in the literature for example wang et al 2009 proposed the naive method the projection method and the accept reject method to incorporate the constraints into the enkf method moradkhani et al 2005 proposed the dual enkf method in which two parallel enkf structures are used to update state variables and parameters song et al 2014 proposed a modified restart enkf method and evaluated three iterative enkf algorithms the results show that the restart enkf and its modification are better than the original enkf method while iterative methods are an effective way to resolve the inconsistency problem they are computationally expensive which limits their applications in complicated cases so far most applications of the enkf in the unsaturated zone have considered only one dimensional water flow problems when water flow is two or three dimensional the computational cost increases dramatically therefore it is necessary to propose a more efficient data assimilation method for high dimensional water flow in the unsaturated zone surrogate models have been extensively used in hydrological modeling to improve computational efficiency an excellent review of the use of surrogate modeling in water resources research was presented by razavi et al 2012 there are two types of surrogate modeling techniques namely response surface surrogates and lower fidelity surrogates the response surface is the relationship between the model inputs and the model outputs the response surface surrogate model is a kind of data driven technique for approximating the response surface of the original model based on a limited number of original model evaluations a lower fidelity surrogate is an alternative model of the original model with a lower level of accuracy razavi et al 2012 when a problem is low dimensional so that the response surface can be characterized using few parameters the response surface surrogate is preferred since a limited number of original model evaluations is required brunetti et al 2017 in recent years many scholars have combined response surface surrogate models with data assimilation methods to improve assimilation efficiency for example chang et al 2017 developed a surrogate model based on an iterative ensemble smoother algorithm in which the polynomial chaos expansion method and the interpolation method were used li and xiu 2009 proposed a generalized polynomial chaos method based on the enkf algorithm zeng et al 2011 developed a probabilistic collocation based kalman filter to achieve an efficient quantification of uncertainty ju et al 2018 proposed an adaptive gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman smoother compared with other surrogate methods the gaussian process method gp which can provide output uncertainty of a surrogate model has attracted much attention in hydrological modeling another advantage of the gp surrogate is that it is an exact emulator i e the gp surrogate can precisely predict values at all design sites used in training of the surrogate while an inexact emulator may introduce bias at design sites brunetti et al 2017 however to our knowledge there are no studies that combine the gp surrogate with the enkf method for parameter estimation therefore in this study we propose a gp based iterative enkf method and apply it for the estimation of hydraulic parameters for two dimensional unsaturated flow problems the paper is organized as follows the methodology is introduced in section 2 the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are presented using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation in section 3 and finally conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 governing equation two dimensional water flow in the unsaturated zone can be described using the richards equation 1 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ is the volumetric moisture content h is the pressure head l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 k ij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a xi and xj are the spatial coordinates l and s is the sink term t 1 accounting for root water uptake the highly nonlinear relationships between the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties and the pressure head can be described by the using the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 4 m 1 1 n where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 se is the effective water saturation θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents respectively α is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 and n is the pore size distribution index in this study unsaturated water flow was simulated using the chain 2d code šimůnek et al 2008 i e an open source version of hydrus 2d 2 2 parameter estimation based on the iterative enkf framework the iterative enkf framework for parameter estimation consists of a model operator an observation operator and an iterative ensemble kalman filter algorithm the model operator is used to pass the state vector to the next time level which can be expressed as follows 5 x i 1 m x i η where x i and x i 1 are the state vectors at the current and next time levels respectively i and i 1 denote time indicators m is the model operator and η is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the model operator which is drawn from a multinormal distribution with a zero mean and a specified covariance q in this study the soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated constitute the state vector it is assumed that the true values of these parameters will not change during the simulation period and their estimates will eventually converge to the true values during the assimilation process therefore the m operator is the unit matrix i the observation operator constructs the mapping between the state vector and the observation vector which can be written as 6 y i 1 h x i 1 ε in which y i 1 is the observation vector h is the observation operator and ε is the observation error vector which is also assumed to be independent white noise drawn from a multinormal distribution with a zero mean and specified covariance o the two dimensional soil water flow model establishes the relationship between the soil hydraulic parameters and the observation vector e g pressure heads and thus the two dimensional richards equation is the observation operator in this study the richards equation errors were included in the observation errors which are assumed to be independent white noise grooms et al 2015 and berardi et al 2016 provided alternative methods to deal with the model errors in ensemble kalman filters unlike previous studies of assimilating state variables and parameters of unsaturated zone li and ren 2011 shi et al 2015 brandhorst et al 2017 the richards equation was used as the nonlinear observation operator rather than the model operator the enkf framework is used to deal with the nonlinear observation operator similarly lei et al 2019 also used the enkf to deal with the nonlinear observation operator i e the one dimensional hydrodynamic model in their study the enkf method is a monte carlo method in which an initial ensemble member can be generated by adding a random disturbance to initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters and is expressed as follows 7 x j 0 x 0 ξ where j indicates the jth member in the parameter ensemble and ξ is independent white noise which follows a multi normal distribution with a zero mean and a specified covariance r the calculation of the iterative enkf method is similar to the enkf method the major difference between the enkf and iterative enkf methods is the starting time level of rerunning the forward model instead of rerunning the forward model from the previous time level the iterative enkf method reruns it from time zero initial time here we briefly introduce the enkf method more details can be found in evensen 2003 in the implementation of the enkf two steps namely forecast and analysis steps are included first the forecast state vector at the i 1 time level is generated using the model operator and the analysis state vector at the i th time level 8 x j i 1 f i x j i a in which x f is the forecast state vector and x a is the analysis state vector when there are observation data the analysis state vector is updated using the analysis equation as follows 9 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h x j i 1 f where k i 1 is the kalman gain which is defined as 10 k i 1 p i 1 h t h p i 1 h t o i 1 1 where p i 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix which can be expressed as follows 11 p i 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j i 1 f x i 1 f x j i 1 f x i 1 f in which x i 1 f is the mean of x j i 1 f the damping factor hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 was used to reduce the inbreeding problem hence the eq 9 is revised as 12 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f β k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h x j i 1 f where β is the damping factor with values between 0 and 1 in this study a series of values e g 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 for β were considered and tested it was found that β with a value of 0 1 is reasonable the same value of β was also used by brandhorst et al 2017 for parameter estimation of one dimensional case 2 3 gaussian process surrogate in this section we briefly introduce the gp method and then propose a gp based iterative enkf method the gp surrogate model approximates the output of the original model f m using a gaussian stochastic process the surrogate model g m is specified using a mean function μ m and a covariance function k m m 13 g m n μ m k m m suppose we have n training base points of input parameters b m b 1 m b n and the outputs of the original model f b f m b 1 f m b n where mb are the soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated then an approximate of the original model can be obtained by conditioning g m on these base points for an arbitrary parameter point m the output of the surrogate model is represented by the mean and the uncertainty of the output is expressed by the variance 14 μ b m μ m k m b k b b 1 f b μ b and 15 σ b 2 m k m m k m b k b b 1 k b m the performance of the gp surrogate is influenced by choice of mean and covariance functions defined in eq 13 in this study the gaussian process from a machine learning gpml toolbox developed by rasmussen and nickisch 2010 is adopted a sum of a constant and a linear mean function is used as the mean function and a diagonal squared exponential covariance function is used as the covariance function of the gp surrogate 16 μ m a i 1 n b i m i 17 k m m σ f 2 e x p 1 2 λ 2 m m t m m in which a and bi are hyperparameters of the mean function and σ f and λ are hyperparameters of the covariance function the hyperparameters of gp surrogate model are inferred by minimizing the negative log marginal likelihood using the exact inference method more details about this method can be found in gpml help files of matlab toolbox rasmussen and nickisch 2010 to improve the efficiency of assimilation we propose a gp based iterative enkf method gpienkf the flow chart of the calculation procedure of the gpienkf method is shown in fig 1 the steps are described as follows 1 first the parameter ensemble m k e is generated randomly using the latin hypercube method for a given mean and standard deviation 2 at each assimilation time tk the training base point parameter m k b is obtained by being randomly drawn from m k e 3 pressure heads at observation points h b are simulated by running the water flow model from the initial time to the current time tk using the training base point parameter m k b 4 the gp surrogate is established using m k b as input and h b as output 5 pressure heads at observation points h e are predicted by the gp surrogate using the parameter ensemble m k e 6 the parameter ensemble m k e is updated using eq 12 in which the error term ε n 1 ε o ε gp accounts for the observation error and the gp surrogate error to avoid an over confident estimation result zhang et al 2016 7 steps 2 to 6 are repeated until the simulation time reaches the maximum assimilation time t 3 case studies in this section the performance of the gpienkf method for estimating soil hydraulic parameters is evaluated using two synthetic case studies 3 1 case 1 infiltration into a homogeneous soil in case 1 infiltration into a homogeneous soil under a linear infiltration source was considered the computational domain is 50 cm 50 cm and was discretized into 200 finite elements a constant pressure head with a value of 2 cm was considered as the upper boundary condition in the central 20 cm of transport domain while free drainage was considered as the bottom boundary condition see fig 2 no flow was considered on all other boundaries the initial condition is a uniformly distributed pressure head with a value of 100 cm in this study the initial and boundary conditions were assumed to be known without uncertainty this is a common assumption in parameter estimation studies using the enkf li and ren 2011 chen and zhang 2006 song et al 2014 a loamy soil was considered with soil hydraulic parameters according to carsel and parrish 1988 i e ks 0 0173 cm min α 0 036 cm 1 n 1 56 θs 0 43 and θr 0 078 the total simulation time is 400 min and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 20 min the parameters to be estimated are ks and α which are the most variable parameters carsel and parrish 1988 the other soil hydraulic parameters were assumed to be known estimated parameters were log transformed because their probability distributions are known to approximate lognormal distributions carsel and parrish 1988 to test the accuracy of the gpienkf method for parameter estimation the initial estimates of ks and α are larger than their true values i e ks 0 1 5ks α 0 1 5α the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α the number of training base points was set to 30 to examine the effect of ensemble size on estimation accuracy different ensemble sizes i e 50 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 were considered the mean values of the parameter ensembles at the maximum assimilation time were the final parameter estimations as shown in fig 3 the relative error of the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases significantly as the ensemble size increases from 50 to 300 and then it declines only slightly with a further increasing ensemble size therefore the ensemble size of 300 the same as also used by li and ren 2011 was used in the following simulations the measurements were obtained using the following steps pressure heads at observation points were first simulated using the true values of soil hydraulic parameters the measurements were then obtained by adding observation errors to the simulated pressure heads the standard deviation of the observation error was 0 01 the influence of a layout scheme of observation points the number of training base points and the number of observation points on parameter estimation were analyzed the relative error re was used as an indicator to evaluate the accuracy of parameter estimation the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate the accuracy of pressure head predictions 3 1 1 influence of the layout scheme of observation points two types of layout schemes of observation points namely vertical and horizontal layout schemes were considered for the horizontal layout the observation points were located in upper soil whereas for vertical layout the observation points were located at various depths the locations of observation points are shown in fig 4 fig 5 presents the evolutions of the mean of the parameter ensemble for different observation point layout schemes fig 5 shows that the optimized parameters converged to their true values for both vertical and horizontal layout schemes as the number of assimilations increased the standard deviation of the optimized parameters decreases gradually as the number of assimilations increases indicating that the uncertainty of parameters decreases the accuracy of estimated parameters for the horizontal layout scheme is slightly higher for the vertical layout scheme the relative errors re is less than 1 0 96 and 0 87 for the horizontal and vertical layout schemes are 0 96 and 0 87 respectively which meets the accuracy requirements the results indicate that the soil hydraulic parameters can be well estimated by the proposed method fig 6 shows pressure heads at observation points measured and predicted by the gp surrogate for the horizontal and vertical layout schemes the figure demonstrates that pressure heads predicted by the gp surrogate are in good agreement with the measurements as the number of assimilations increases this is because the estimated parameters converge to their true values during the data assimilation thereby resulting in good pressure head predictions by the gp surrogate since the measurements were generated by the original model using the true parameters the results indicate that the gp surrogate can predict the state variables of the original model well we compared the prediction accuracy at observation point 3 for different layout schemes as the location of this point was the same in both the horizontal and vertical layout schemes pressure heads predicted using the vertical layout scheme are slightly more precise than those predicted using the horizontal layout scheme with the rmse values of 6 56 cm and 6 59 cm respectively 3 1 2 influence of the number of training base points to examine the influence of the number of training base points nb on predicted results different numbers of training base points i e nb 10 20 30 100 were tested fig 7 shows that parameter evolutions for different nbs are similar fig 8 presents the re for different nbs for the vertical layout scheme the smallest re 0 13 was obtained for nb 40 and the largest re 0 96 for nb 30 for the horizontal layout scheme the smallest re 0 36 was obtained for nb 40 and the largest re 2 07 for nb 100 the results show that increasing the number of training base points does not improve the accuracy of parameter estimation this may be due to the homogeneity of the soil profile in this case study in which a small number of base points can produce an accurate prediction of pressure heads at observation points in contrast ju et al 2018 reported that a larger number of base points was required to obtain accurate simulations when a strongly heterogeneous field was considered the comparison of gp surrogate predictions with original model simulations for different nb is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that pressure heads predicted by the gp surrogate match those simulated by the original model reasonably well however the prediction accuracy of the gp surrogate is not improved by increasing nb the rmse values for nb 30 60 and 100 are 2 65 2 69 and 2 86 cm respectively this may be due to the difference in the initial parameter ensemble and training base points for different nbs since the initial parameter ensemble was randomly generated even though the same mean and standard deviation were used there is no guarantee that every element of the parameter ensemble is identical for different nbs apart from nb 30 the parameter estimation accuracy of the vertical layout scheme is higher than that of the horizontal layout scheme see fig 8 this is likely because water movement during the infiltration process is better described using the vertical layout scheme of observation points resulting in better emulation of the original model by the gp surrogate the results are consistent with montzka et al 2011 who reported that assimilation effects are limited when only soil surface observations were used these results indicate that the layout scheme of observation points has a greater influence on parameter estimation than the number of training base points increasing the number of training base points leads to longer training time of the surrogate model the cpu time increased from 49 s to 168 s when nb was increased from 10 to 100 since the re for nb 30 is less than 1 which meets the accuracy requirement in the subsequent experiments nb was set to 30 3 1 3 influence of the number of observation points to analyze the influence of the number of observation points no a different number of observation points i e no 8 12 and 16 were tested the locations of observation points are shown in fig 10 fig 11 presents parameter evolutions for different nos the estimation accuracy can be improved for a higher no with the re decreasing from 0 87 to 0 56 for the same observation points the rmse of predicted pressure heads decreases from 5 95 to 5 82 cm the results are consistent with those of brandhorst et al 2017 who reported that using a higher number of observation points can improve the accuracy of parameter estimation this is because the assimilation system can utilize more observation information which allows the gp surrogate to better emulate the original model thereby resulting in more accurate parameter estimations and pressure head predictions a higher no does not require significantly longer calculation time since the number of original model evaluations is the same for different nos the training time of the surrogate model does not grow much as no increases hence the total calculation time for different nos is almost the same 3 2 case 2 infiltration into a layered soil in case 2 water infiltration from a single ring infiltrometer into a layered soil was considered the soil profile consists of two layers 40 cm thick a horizon and an underlying b c horizon the hydraulic parameters of the two layered soil are shown in table 1 cislerova 1987 hopmans and stricker 1989 the axisymmetric computational domain is shown in fig 12 a the computational domain is 125 cm 130 cm and was discretized into 684 finite elements all sides of the computational domain are impervious except for a small portion around the origin at the soil surface where a constant pressure head was imposed as well as the lower right corner where the groundwater level was kept constant the initial pressure head profile and locations of observation points are shown in fig 12b the ensemble size was set to 300 and the number of training base points was set to 30 the total simulation time was 10 days and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 2 h the measurements were obtained by adding an observation error to the pressure heads simulated using the true parameters the standard deviation of the observation error is 0 01 more hydraulic parameters were estimated in this case i e ks α and n of each soil layer similarly as in case 1 the initial estimates of parameters deviate from their true values i e ks 0 1 5ks α 0 1 5α and n 0 1 2n the standard deviation of the initial parameters ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α and 0 01 for n to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method the results of the gpienkf method were compared with those of the original iterative ensemble kalman filter method ienkf fig 13 presents the parameter evolutions of the gpienkf and ienkf methods it can be seen that ks and α estimated by the gpienkf method are closer to their true values at the beginning of the simulation in comparison with the ienkf method this may be caused by the difference in pressure heads predicted by the surrogate and original models the final values of estimated parameters by the ienkf methods are more accurate than those by the gpienkf method with the re value of 3 8 and 4 4 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively for n the parameters estimated by the ienkf converge to their true values more quickly this is because the simulation of water movement is more sensitive to ks and α than to n in this case the ks and α values estimated by the gpienkf are more accurate at the beginning of the simulation even when the n value deviates from its true value the simulated pressure heads can match the measurements at the beginning of the simulation the final estimates of n by the ienkf are more accurate the re value for the first soil layer is 1 9 and 2 3 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively whereas the re value for the second soil layer is 4 5 and 4 8 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively the parameters estimated using ienkf and gpienkf did not completely converge to their true values this can be attributed to two factors first different combinations of parameters may lead to similar simulation results second the errors of the numerical solution for richards equation may affect the results of parameter estimation however the re values were less than 5 the results indicate that the gpienkf method can obtain a comparable accuracy of parameter estimations as the ienkf method fig 14 shows the measured and predicted pressure heads at two observation points the pressure heads predicted by the gpienkf and ienkf methods are in good agreement with the measurements the prediction accuracy of the ienkf method is slightly higher than that of the gpienkf method with the rmse value of 0 66 and 1 00 cm for both the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively this is because parameters estimated by the ienkf method are more accurate than those estimated by the gpienkf method it should be pointed out that the two most time consuming steps of assimilation with the ienkf method are original model evaluations and matrix calculations in this study the updated state vector includes soil hydraulic parameters and is thus low dimensional requiring less time for matrix calculations since the time needed for training of the surrogate model and its predictions is almost negligible most computational time is consumed in original model evaluations the computational efficiency of the gpienkf and ienkf methods can be evaluated by comparing the number of original model evaluations in this case the ensemble size was set to 300 and the number of training base points for the gp surrogate was set to 30 therefore the computational cost of the gpienkf method is approximately 1 10th of that of the ienkf method compared with the ienkf method the gpienkf method has much higher calculation efficiency with almost no loss of accuracy simulated pressure heads vary smoothly without abnormal fluctuations see fig 14 which indicates that the iterative method is an effective way to avoid the inconsistency problem the results show that the gp surrogate can accurately predict pressure heads at observation points similarly to the original model hence for high dimensional soil water flow problems when only state variables at critical locations need to be predicted the gp surrogate provides an efficient forecasting tool though the properties of the two soils used in the numerical simulation did not show big differences the gpienkf method with hydrus 2d could also be used to estimate hydraulic parameters for layered soils with significantly different properties this is because similar methods have been effectively used to assimilate the hydraulic parameters for example li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 used the enkf method with one dimensional hydrus to assimilate soil hydraulic parameters of layered soils of which the hydraulic conductivities differed by one order of magnitude in addition ju et al 2018 used the gp surrogate model to approximate the soil hydrodynamic model i e hydrus 2d and demonstrated that the gp surrogate model based method can improve the assimilation efficiency of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field 3 3 case 3 a real case involving a field experiment with drip irrigation a field experiment involving drip irrigation of processing tomato was conducted at the upper reaches of the yellow river basin china latitude 40 41 n and longitude 107 18 e 1041 m altitude the soil profile down to a depth of 0 60 cm can be divided into three layers physical properties of these soil layers are given in table 2 meteorological data measured by an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration eto using the modified penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 daily eto and precipitation are shown in fig 15 soil water contents at two horizontal locations and three depths fig 16 were monitored using hydraprobe sensors soil water contents were simulated for a computational domain 40 cm wide and 60 cm deep during the growing season 6 2 2015 9 1 2015 a total of 104 days the computational domain applied boundary conditions bc and the position of observation points are shown in fig 16 the computational domain was discretized into 2 527 finite elements a time variable flux boundary condition determined from irrigation rates was specified on the bc boundary fig 16 while a no flux boundary condition was specified on the cd boundary which was covered by a plastic mulch an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the de boundary since the groundwater table is relatively deep the lower boundary was treated as a free drainage boundary due to symmetry of flow a no flux boundary condition was specified on both vertical sides water uptake was simulated using the model of feddes et al 1978 with default values of parameters of the stress response function the initial water content was 0 4 cm3 cm3 0 42 cm3 cm3 and 0 43 cm3 cm3 in depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm respectively an ensemble size of 300 a number of training base points of 30 and a 2 day interval were used in the following assimilation unlike in the previous two synthetic cases soil water contents rather than pressure heads were used as observation data a value of 0 01 was used as the standard deviation for the soil water content observation error shi et al 2015 the initial values of soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated θ r θ s ks α and n for each soil layer see table 3 were obtained using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 with the bulk density and the percentage of sand silt and clay as input the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble was 0 3 for log10 ks and log10 α and 0 01 for θ r θ s and n brandhorst et al 2017 the initial condition error was also considered by adding a disturbance σh 0 005 m brandhorst et al 2017 to the initial pressure head which was calculated from the initial soil water content the results of the parameter estimation are shown in fig 17 deviations can be found between the initial parameter values and their estimated values especially for the most variable parameters ks and α carsel and parrish 1988 since the true values of parameters were not known the results of the gpienkf method were compared with those of the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm l m moré 1978 which are shown in table 4 it can be seen that the values of the parameters ks and n estimated using the gpienkf method see table 5 are close to those obtained using the l m method contrary to those of other parameters which showed large deviations this may be attributed to the fact that the l m method estimates parameters by minimizing the objective function i e the sum of squared deviations between simulated and observed soil water contents while the gpienkf method obtains parameters using the variance minimizing analysis evensen 2003 fig 18 shows a comparison between the simulated and observed soil water contents simulated soil water contents agree reasonably well with measurements at soil depths of 20 60 cm rmses for the gpienkf method are 0 012 cm3 cm3 for the 20 40 cm soil depth and 0 031 cm3 cm3 for the 40 60 cm depth while for the l m method they are 0 007 cm3 cm3 for the 20 40 cm depth and 0 016 cm3 cm3 for the 40 60 cm depth however simulated soil water contents for the 0 20 cm soil depth show large deviations from measurements with rmses of 0 049 cm3 cm3 for the gpienkf method and 0 035 cm3 cm3 for the l m method larger deviations between the simulated and observed soil water contents may be attributable to the following reasons first there is uncertainty in the upper boundary condition which can not be quite well characterized due to frequent changes between evaporation and infiltration associated with multiple irrigation and precipitation events second the simulations are affected by an inherent soil spatial heterogeneity the classification of the soil profile into multiple homogeneous layers in numerical simulations is a significant simplification of the complex reality finally the assumption that parameter values are constant in time may be unreasonable soil structure is continuously changing during the growing season due to irrigations crop growth and other factors which may lead to time variable soil hydraulic parameters especially ks and α more accurate simulations can be obtained using parameters estimated by the gpienkf method compared to those estimated by rosetta initial parameter values fig 18 this further indicates that the assimilation algorithm can improve prediction accuracy similar results were reported by li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 for the real experimental case the cpu time for the gpienkf method about 15 h is about 10 times shorter than that for the standard iterative enkf this further indicates that the gpienkf method can improve the computational efficiency especially for cases with which the original model simulations are time consuming the initial and boundary conditions are very important to the simulation of soil water dynamics however their uncertainties were not considered in the surrogate model of the present study due to that their uncertainties mainly depend on the accuracy of observations in general the initial and boundary conditions are assumed to be deterministic and known in the parameter estimation using assimilation method li and ren 2011 song et al 2014 shi et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the influence of initial and boundary conditions on parameter estimation with the surrogate method is worth to be investigated in the follow up studies for example the uncertainties of initial and boundary conditions might be integrated in surrogate method with considering them as the input variables of the constructed model in addition the present study focused on parameter estimation of layered soils the capability of gpienkf for the parameter estimation of multi dimensional cases with high heterogeneities needs further investigation 4 conclusions we propose a gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman filter method for parameter estimation the proposed method combines the advantage of the high computational efficiency of the gp surrogate with the advantage of dealing with the uncertainty problem by the enkf method since the number of original model evaluations is equal to the number of training base points which is much smaller than the ensemble size the calculation time of the gpienkf method can be greatly reduced in comparison with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter method we verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation for a homogeneous soil profile the results show that the number of training base points has little effect on parameter estimation soil water movement needs to be described well by the layout scheme of observation points so that the surrogate model can correctly emulate the original model thereby leading to more accurate parameter estimation and pressure head predictions increasing the number of observation points provides more observation information for the assimilation system and improves the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model thereby resulting in more accurate parameter estimation for the layered soils the gpienkf method can obtain accurate results for multi parameter conditions however the accuracy of predictions is affected by the uncertainty of the boundary conditions and the soil spatial heterogeneity in comparison with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter method the gpienkf method can obtain comparably accurate results with a greatly reduced computational cost the proposed method is an effective tool for parameter estimation for high dimensional soil water flow problems in this study we only considered unsaturated flow model but the proposed method can also be easily adapted for other hydrologic models the parameters were assumed to be constant over time in this study however due to climatic variations and human activities this assumption may result in large simulation errors as a sequential assimilation method the gpienkf method can update the state variables and parameters in real time according to observed data in future research we will explore the potential of the gpienkf method for estimating time varying parameters credit authorship contribution statement kun liu conceptualization methodology writing original draft software guanhua huang supervision writing review editing zheng

5268,water flow in the unsaturated zone is an important component of the water cycle accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters ensures precise simulations of water flow in the unsaturated zone in this study a gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman filter method gpienkf is proposed and applied for estimating soil hydraulic parameters for two dimensional soil water flow the method involves a surrogate model for two dimensional soil water flow that is based on the gaussian process method the accuracy and efficiency of the gpienkf method are validated using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation the impact of the layout of observation points as well as the number of training base points and observation points on the estimation of parameters are also analyzed the results show that the surrogate model can accurately predict pressure heads at observation points the layout of observation points that precisely describes infiltration water movement allows the surrogate model to better emulate the original model thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimation the number of training base points is found to have only a small influence on parameter estimation the accuracy of parameter estimation and pressure head predictions can be further improved by increasing the number of observation points however the accuracy of predictions is affected by the uncertainty of boundary conditions and the soil spatial heterogeneity the gpienkf method can effectively estimate multiple parameters characterizing water flow in layered soils as compared with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter the gpienkf method can greatly improve computational efficiency while obtaining comparable results the gpienkf method is an efficient tool for parameter estimation of multi dimensional soil water flow keywords data assimilation gaussian process ensemble kalman filter surrogate model 1 introduction water flow in the unsaturated zone is an important component of the water cycle from a hydrological point of view soil moisture determines the separation of precipitation into runoff evaporation and infiltration and the division of net radiation into latent sensible and geothermal heat fluxes pauwels et al 2007 as concern regarding the protection of the environment and the quality of groundwater rises the importance of an accurate soil physical description of porous systems within the unsaturated zone is increasingly recognized in environmental engineering and groundwater hydrology hopmans and šimůnek 1999 the quantification of water flux exchanges between the land surface the unsaturated zone and groundwater requires an accurate parameterization of soil hydraulic properties zhang et al 2018 many inverse methods such as the levenberg marquardt algorithm kool et al 1985 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 and the amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 have been used for estimating soil hydraulic parameters šimůnek et al 1998 abbasi et al 2003 vrugt et al 2003 durner et al 2008 wöhling et al 2008 the main problem with respect to these methods is that the uncertainty is attributed to model parameters ignoring the additional uncertainty of inputs outputs and model structures vrugt et al 2008 in the process of model construction there are many errors both in the model structure due to the simplification of physical processes and in observation data due to the limitation of observation methods it is incorrect to attribute the uncertainty only to model parameters data assimilation methods provide a strong framework for dealing with the uncertainty problem due to its superiority in solving high dimensional and nonlinear problems the ensemble kalman filter method enkf evensen 1994 has been a preferred method for assimilating state variables and for estimating parameters of unsaturated zone de lannoy et al 2007 li and ren 2011 pasetto et al 2012 medina et al 2014 song et al 2014 shi et al 2015 brandhorst et al 2017 however applying the enkf method to unsaturated zone problems may encounter an inconsistency problem after being updated simultaneously using a linear update function the state variables and parameters may not follow the nonlinear richards equation song et al 2014 since variance minimizing analyses rather than physical principles are used to update state variables and parameters these may violate certain constraints such as the water balance or nonnegativity of parameters and states pan and wood 2006 to resolve the inconsistency problem several improved enkf algorithms have been proposed in the literature for example wang et al 2009 proposed the naive method the projection method and the accept reject method to incorporate the constraints into the enkf method moradkhani et al 2005 proposed the dual enkf method in which two parallel enkf structures are used to update state variables and parameters song et al 2014 proposed a modified restart enkf method and evaluated three iterative enkf algorithms the results show that the restart enkf and its modification are better than the original enkf method while iterative methods are an effective way to resolve the inconsistency problem they are computationally expensive which limits their applications in complicated cases so far most applications of the enkf in the unsaturated zone have considered only one dimensional water flow problems when water flow is two or three dimensional the computational cost increases dramatically therefore it is necessary to propose a more efficient data assimilation method for high dimensional water flow in the unsaturated zone surrogate models have been extensively used in hydrological modeling to improve computational efficiency an excellent review of the use of surrogate modeling in water resources research was presented by razavi et al 2012 there are two types of surrogate modeling techniques namely response surface surrogates and lower fidelity surrogates the response surface is the relationship between the model inputs and the model outputs the response surface surrogate model is a kind of data driven technique for approximating the response surface of the original model based on a limited number of original model evaluations a lower fidelity surrogate is an alternative model of the original model with a lower level of accuracy razavi et al 2012 when a problem is low dimensional so that the response surface can be characterized using few parameters the response surface surrogate is preferred since a limited number of original model evaluations is required brunetti et al 2017 in recent years many scholars have combined response surface surrogate models with data assimilation methods to improve assimilation efficiency for example chang et al 2017 developed a surrogate model based on an iterative ensemble smoother algorithm in which the polynomial chaos expansion method and the interpolation method were used li and xiu 2009 proposed a generalized polynomial chaos method based on the enkf algorithm zeng et al 2011 developed a probabilistic collocation based kalman filter to achieve an efficient quantification of uncertainty ju et al 2018 proposed an adaptive gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman smoother compared with other surrogate methods the gaussian process method gp which can provide output uncertainty of a surrogate model has attracted much attention in hydrological modeling another advantage of the gp surrogate is that it is an exact emulator i e the gp surrogate can precisely predict values at all design sites used in training of the surrogate while an inexact emulator may introduce bias at design sites brunetti et al 2017 however to our knowledge there are no studies that combine the gp surrogate with the enkf method for parameter estimation therefore in this study we propose a gp based iterative enkf method and apply it for the estimation of hydraulic parameters for two dimensional unsaturated flow problems the paper is organized as follows the methodology is introduced in section 2 the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are presented using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation in section 3 and finally conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 governing equation two dimensional water flow in the unsaturated zone can be described using the richards equation 1 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ is the volumetric moisture content h is the pressure head l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 k ij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a xi and xj are the spatial coordinates l and s is the sink term t 1 accounting for root water uptake the highly nonlinear relationships between the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties and the pressure head can be described by the using the van

effective water saturation θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents respectively α is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 and n is the pore size distribution index in this study unsaturated water flow was simulated using the chain 2d code šimůnek et al 2008 i e an open source version of hydrus 2d 2 2 parameter estimation based on the iterative enkf framework the iterative enkf framework for parameter estimation consists of a model operator an observation operator and an iterative ensemble kalman filter algorithm the model operator is used to pass the state vector to the next time level which can be expressed as follows 5 x i 1 m x i η where x i and x i 1 are the state vectors at the current and next time levels respectively i and i 1 denote time indicators m is the model operator and η is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the model operator which is drawn from a multinormal distribution with a zero mean and a specified covariance q in this study the soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated constitute the state vector it is assumed that the true values of these parameters will not change during the simulation period and their estimates will eventually converge to the true values during the assimilation process therefore the m operator is the unit matrix i the observation operator constructs the mapping between the state vector and the observation vector which can be written as 6 y i 1 h x i 1 ε in which y i 1 is the observation vector h is the observation operator and ε is the observation error vector which is also assumed to be independent white noise drawn from a multinormal distribution with a zero mean and specified covariance o the two dimensional soil water flow model establishes the relationship between the soil hydraulic parameters and the observation vector e g pressure heads and thus the two dimensional richards equation is the observation operator in this study the richards equation errors were included in the observation errors which are assumed to be independent white noise grooms et al 2015 and berardi et al 2016 provided alternative methods to deal with the model errors in ensemble kalman filters unlike previous studies of assimilating state variables and parameters of unsaturated zone li and ren 2011 shi et al 2015 brandhorst et al 2017 the richards equation was used as the nonlinear observation operator rather than the model operator the enkf framework is used to deal with the nonlinear observation operator similarly lei et al 2019 also used the enkf to deal with the nonlinear observation operator i e the one dimensional hydrodynamic model in their study the enkf method is a monte carlo method in which an initial ensemble member can be generated by adding a random disturbance to initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters and is expressed as follows 7 x j 0 x 0 ξ where j indicates the jth member in the parameter ensemble and ξ is independent white noise which follows a multi normal distribution with a zero mean and a specified covariance r the calculation of the iterative enkf method is similar to the enkf method the major difference between the enkf and iterative enkf methods is the starting time level of rerunning the forward model instead of rerunning the forward model from the previous time level the iterative enkf method reruns it from time zero initial time here we briefly introduce the enkf method more details can be found in evensen 2003 in the implementation of the enkf two steps namely forecast and analysis steps are included first the forecast state vector at the i 1 time level is generated using the model operator and the analysis state vector at the i th time level 8 x j i 1 f i x j i a in which x f is the forecast state vector and x a is the analysis state vector when there are observation data the analysis state vector is updated using the analysis equation as follows 9 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h x j i 1 f where k i 1 is the kalman gain which is defined as 10 k i 1 p i 1 h t h p i 1 h t o i 1 1 where p i 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix which can be expressed as follows 11 p i 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j i 1 f x i 1 f x j i 1 f x i 1 f in which x i 1 f is the mean of x j i 1 f the damping factor hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 was used to reduce the inbreeding problem hence the eq 9 is revised as 12 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f β k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h x j i 1 f where β is the damping factor with values between 0 and 1 in this study a series of values e g 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 for β were considered and tested it was found that β with a value of 0 1 is reasonable the same value of β was also used by brandhorst et al 2017 for parameter estimation of one dimensional case 2 3 gaussian process surrogate in this section we briefly introduce the gp method and then propose a gp based iterative enkf method the gp surrogate model approximates the output of the original model f m using a gaussian stochastic process the surrogate model g m is specified using a mean function μ m and a covariance function k m m 13 g m n μ m k m m suppose we have n training base points of input parameters b m b 1 m b n and the outputs of the original model f b f m b 1 f m b n where mb are the soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated then an approximate of the original model can be obtained by conditioning g m on these base points for an arbitrary parameter point m the output of the surrogate model is represented by the mean and the uncertainty of the output is expressed by the variance 14 μ b m μ m k m b k b b 1 f b μ b and 15 σ b 2 m k m m k m b k b b 1 k b m the performance of the gp surrogate is influenced by choice of mean and covariance functions defined in eq 13 in this study the gaussian process from a machine learning gpml toolbox developed by rasmussen and nickisch 2010 is adopted a sum of a constant and a linear mean function is used as the mean function and a diagonal squared exponential covariance function is used as the covariance function of the gp surrogate 16 μ m a i 1 n b i m i 17 k m m σ f 2 e x p 1 2 λ 2 m m t m m in which a and bi are hyperparameters of the mean function and σ f and λ are hyperparameters of the covariance function the hyperparameters of gp surrogate model are inferred by minimizing the negative log marginal likelihood using the exact inference method more details about this method can be found in gpml help files of matlab toolbox rasmussen and nickisch 2010 to improve the efficiency of assimilation we propose a gp based iterative enkf method gpienkf the flow chart of the calculation procedure of the gpienkf method is shown in fig 1 the steps are described as follows 1 first the parameter ensemble m k e is generated randomly using the latin hypercube method for a given mean and standard deviation 2 at each assimilation time tk the training base point parameter m k b is obtained by being randomly drawn from m k e 3 pressure heads at observation points h b are simulated by running the water flow model from the initial time to the current time tk using the training base point parameter m k b 4 the gp surrogate is established using m k b as input and h b as output 5 pressure heads at observation points h e are predicted by the gp surrogate using the parameter ensemble m k e 6 the parameter ensemble m k e is updated using eq 12 in which the error term ε n 1 ε o ε gp accounts for the observation error and the gp surrogate error to avoid an over confident estimation result zhang et al 2016 7 steps 2 to 6 are repeated until the simulation time reaches the maximum assimilation time t 3 case studies in this section the performance of the gpienkf method for estimating soil hydraulic parameters is evaluated using two synthetic case studies 3 1 case 1 infiltration into a homogeneous soil in case 1 infiltration into a homogeneous soil under a linear infiltration source was considered the computational domain is 50 cm 50 cm and was discretized into 200 finite elements a constant pressure head with a value of 2 cm was considered as the upper boundary condition in the central 20 cm of transport domain while free drainage was considered as the bottom boundary condition see fig 2 no flow was considered on all other boundaries the initial condition is a uniformly distributed pressure head with a value of 100 cm in this study the initial and boundary conditions were assumed to be known without uncertainty this is a common assumption in parameter estimation studies using the enkf li and ren 2011 chen and zhang 2006 song et al 2014 a loamy soil was considered with soil hydraulic parameters according to carsel and parrish 1988 i e ks 0 0173 cm min α 0 036 cm 1 n 1 56 θs 0 43 and θr 0 078 the total simulation time is 400 min and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 20 min the parameters to be estimated are ks and α which are the most variable parameters carsel and parrish 1988 the other soil hydraulic parameters were assumed to be known estimated parameters were log transformed because their probability distributions are known to approximate lognormal distributions carsel and parrish 1988 to test the accuracy of the gpienkf method for parameter estimation the initial estimates of ks and α are larger than their true values i e ks 0 1 5ks α 0 1 5α the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α the number of training base points was set to 30 to examine the effect of ensemble size on estimation accuracy different ensemble sizes i e 50 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 were considered the mean values of the parameter ensembles at the maximum assimilation time were the final parameter estimations as shown in fig 3 the relative error of the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases significantly as the ensemble size increases from 50 to 300 and then it declines only slightly with a further increasing ensemble size therefore the ensemble size of 300 the same as also used by li and ren 2011 was used in the following simulations the measurements were obtained using the following steps pressure heads at observation points were first simulated using the true values of soil hydraulic parameters the measurements were then obtained by adding observation errors to the simulated pressure heads the standard deviation of the observation error was 0 01 the influence of a layout scheme of observation points the number of training base points and the number of observation points on parameter estimation were analyzed the relative error re was used as an indicator to evaluate the accuracy of parameter estimation the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate the accuracy of pressure head predictions 3 1 1 influence of the layout scheme of observation points two types of layout schemes of observation points namely vertical and horizontal layout schemes were considered for the horizontal layout the observation points were located in upper soil whereas for vertical layout the observation points were located at various depths the locations of observation points are shown in fig 4 fig 5 presents the evolutions of the mean of the parameter ensemble for different observation point layout schemes fig 5 shows that the optimized parameters converged to their true values for both vertical and horizontal layout schemes as the number of assimilations increased the standard deviation of the optimized parameters decreases gradually as the number of assimilations increases indicating that the uncertainty of parameters decreases the accuracy of estimated parameters for the horizontal layout scheme is slightly higher for the vertical layout scheme the relative errors re is less than 1 0 96 and 0 87 for the horizontal and vertical layout schemes are 0 96 and 0 87 respectively which meets the accuracy requirements the results indicate that the soil hydraulic parameters can be well estimated by the proposed method fig 6 shows pressure heads at observation points measured and predicted by the gp surrogate for the horizontal and vertical layout schemes the figure demonstrates that pressure heads predicted by the gp surrogate are in good agreement with the measurements as the number of assimilations increases this is because the estimated parameters converge to their true values during the data assimilation thereby resulting in good pressure head predictions by the gp surrogate since the measurements were generated by the original model using the true parameters the results indicate that the gp surrogate can predict the state variables of the original model well we compared the prediction accuracy at observation point 3 for different layout schemes as the location of this point was the same in both the horizontal and vertical layout schemes pressure heads predicted using the vertical layout scheme are slightly more precise than those predicted using the horizontal layout scheme with the rmse values of 6 56 cm and 6 59 cm respectively 3 1 2 influence of the number of training base points to examine the influence of the number of training base points nb on predicted results different numbers of training base points i e nb 10 20 30 100 were tested fig 7 shows that parameter evolutions for different nbs are similar fig 8 presents the re for different nbs for the vertical layout scheme the smallest re 0 13 was obtained for nb 40 and the largest re 0 96 for nb 30 for the horizontal layout scheme the smallest re 0 36 was obtained for nb 40 and the largest re 2 07 for nb 100 the results show that increasing the number of training base points does not improve the accuracy of parameter estimation this may be due to the homogeneity of the soil profile in this case study in which a small number of base points can produce an accurate prediction of pressure heads at observation points in contrast ju et al 2018 reported that a larger number of base points was required to obtain accurate simulations when a strongly heterogeneous field was considered the comparison of gp surrogate predictions with original model simulations for different nb is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that pressure heads predicted by the gp surrogate match those simulated by the original model reasonably well however the prediction accuracy of the gp surrogate is not improved by increasing nb the rmse values for nb 30 60 and 100 are 2 65 2 69 and 2 86 cm respectively this may be due to the difference in the initial parameter ensemble and training base points for different nbs since the initial parameter ensemble was randomly generated even though the same mean and standard deviation were used there is no guarantee that every element of the parameter ensemble is identical for different nbs apart from nb 30 the parameter estimation accuracy of the vertical layout scheme is higher than that of the horizontal layout scheme see fig 8 this is likely because water movement during the infiltration process is better described using the vertical layout scheme of observation points resulting in better emulation of the original model by the gp surrogate the results are consistent with montzka et al 2011 who reported that assimilation effects are limited when only soil surface observations were used these results indicate that the layout scheme of observation points has a greater influence on parameter estimation than the number of training base points increasing the number of training base points leads to longer training time of the surrogate model the cpu time increased from 49 s to 168 s when nb was increased from 10 to 100 since the re for nb 30 is less than 1 which meets the accuracy requirement in the subsequent experiments nb was set to 30 3 1 3 influence of the number of observation points to analyze the influence of the number of observation points no a different number of observation points i e no 8 12 and 16 were tested the locations of observation points are shown in fig 10 fig 11 presents parameter evolutions for different nos the estimation accuracy can be improved for a higher no with the re decreasing from 0 87 to 0 56 for the same observation points the rmse of predicted pressure heads decreases from 5 95 to 5 82 cm the results are consistent with those of brandhorst et al 2017 who reported that using a higher number of observation points can improve the accuracy of parameter estimation this is because the assimilation system can utilize more observation information which allows the gp surrogate to better emulate the original model thereby resulting in more accurate parameter estimations and pressure head predictions a higher no does not require significantly longer calculation time since the number of original model evaluations is the same for different nos the training time of the surrogate model does not grow much as no increases hence the total calculation time for different nos is almost the same 3 2 case 2 infiltration into a layered soil in case 2 water infiltration from a single ring infiltrometer into a layered soil was considered the soil profile consists of two layers 40 cm thick a horizon and an underlying b c horizon the hydraulic parameters of the two layered soil are shown in table 1 cislerova 1987 hopmans and stricker 1989 the axisymmetric computational domain is shown in fig 12 a the computational domain is 125 cm 130 cm and was discretized into 684 finite elements all sides of the computational domain are impervious except for a small portion around the origin at the soil surface where a constant pressure head was imposed as well as the lower right corner where the groundwater level was kept constant the initial pressure head profile and locations of observation points are shown in fig 12b the ensemble size was set to 300 and the number of training base points was set to 30 the total simulation time was 10 days and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 2 h the measurements were obtained by adding an observation error to the pressure heads simulated using the true parameters the standard deviation of the observation error is 0 01 more hydraulic parameters were estimated in this case i e ks α and n of each soil layer similarly as in case 1 the initial estimates of parameters deviate from their true values i e ks 0 1 5ks α 0 1 5α and n 0 1 2n the standard deviation of the initial parameters ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α and 0 01 for n to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method the results of the gpienkf method were compared with those of the original iterative ensemble kalman filter method ienkf fig 13 presents the parameter evolutions of the gpienkf and ienkf methods it can be seen that ks and α estimated by the gpienkf method are closer to their true values at the beginning of the simulation in comparison with the ienkf method this may be caused by the difference in pressure heads predicted by the surrogate and original models the final values of estimated parameters by the ienkf methods are more accurate than those by the gpienkf method with the re value of 3 8 and 4 4 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively for n the parameters estimated by the ienkf converge to their true values more quickly this is because the simulation of water movement is more sensitive to ks and α than to n in this case the ks and α values estimated by the gpienkf are more accurate at the beginning of the simulation even when the n value deviates from its true value the simulated pressure heads can match the measurements at the beginning of the simulation the final estimates of n by the ienkf are more accurate the re value for the first soil layer is 1 9 and 2 3 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively whereas the re value for the second soil layer is 4 5 and 4 8 for the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively the parameters estimated using ienkf and gpienkf did not completely converge to their true values this can be attributed to two factors first different combinations of parameters may lead to similar simulation results second the errors of the numerical solution for richards equation may affect the results of parameter estimation however the re values were less than 5 the results indicate that the gpienkf method can obtain a comparable accuracy of parameter estimations as the ienkf method fig 14 shows the measured and predicted pressure heads at two observation points the pressure heads predicted by the gpienkf and ienkf methods are in good agreement with the measurements the prediction accuracy of the ienkf method is slightly higher than that of the gpienkf method with the rmse value of 0 66 and 1 00 cm for both the ienkf and gpienkf methods respectively this is because parameters estimated by the ienkf method are more accurate than those estimated by the gpienkf method it should be pointed out that the two most time consuming steps of assimilation with the ienkf method are original model evaluations and matrix calculations in this study the updated state vector includes soil hydraulic parameters and is thus low dimensional requiring less time for matrix calculations since the time needed for training of the surrogate model and its predictions is almost negligible most computational time is consumed in original model evaluations the computational efficiency of the gpienkf and ienkf methods can be evaluated by comparing the number of original model evaluations in this case the ensemble size was set to 300 and the number of training base points for the gp surrogate was set to 30 therefore the computational cost of the gpienkf method is approximately 1 10th of that of the ienkf method compared with the ienkf method the gpienkf method has much higher calculation efficiency with almost no loss of accuracy simulated pressure heads vary smoothly without abnormal fluctuations see fig 14 which indicates that the iterative method is an effective way to avoid the inconsistency problem the results show that the gp surrogate can accurately predict pressure heads at observation points similarly to the original model hence for high dimensional soil water flow problems when only state variables at critical locations need to be predicted the gp surrogate provides an efficient forecasting tool though the properties of the two soils used in the numerical simulation did not show big differences the gpienkf method with hydrus 2d could also be used to estimate hydraulic parameters for layered soils with significantly different properties this is because similar methods have been effectively used to assimilate the hydraulic parameters for example li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 used the enkf method with one dimensional hydrus to assimilate soil hydraulic parameters of layered soils of which the hydraulic conductivities differed by one order of magnitude in addition ju et al 2018 used the gp surrogate model to approximate the soil hydrodynamic model i e hydrus 2d and demonstrated that the gp surrogate model based method can improve the assimilation efficiency of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field 3 3 case 3 a real case involving a field experiment with drip irrigation a field experiment involving drip irrigation of processing tomato was conducted at the upper reaches of the yellow river basin china latitude 40 41 n and longitude 107 18 e 1041 m altitude the soil profile down to a depth of 0 60 cm can be divided into three layers physical properties of these soil layers are given in table 2 meteorological data measured by an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration eto using the modified penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 daily eto and precipitation are shown in fig 15 soil water contents at two horizontal locations and three depths fig 16 were monitored using hydraprobe sensors soil water contents were simulated for a computational domain 40 cm wide and 60 cm deep during the growing season 6 2 2015 9 1 2015 a total of 104 days the computational domain applied boundary conditions bc and the position of observation points are shown in fig 16 the computational domain was discretized into 2 527 finite elements a time variable flux boundary condition determined from irrigation rates was specified on the bc boundary fig 16 while a no flux boundary condition was specified on the cd boundary which was covered by a plastic mulch an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the de boundary since the groundwater table is relatively deep the lower boundary was treated as a free drainage boundary due to symmetry of flow a no flux boundary condition was specified on both vertical sides water uptake was simulated using the model of feddes et al 1978 with default values of parameters of the stress response function the initial water content was 0 4 cm3 cm3 0 42 cm3 cm3 and 0 43 cm3 cm3 in depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm respectively an ensemble size of 300 a number of training base points of 30 and a 2 day interval were used in the following assimilation unlike in the previous two synthetic cases soil water contents rather than pressure heads were used as observation data a value of 0 01 was used as the standard deviation for the soil water content observation error shi et al 2015 the initial values of soil hydraulic parameters to be estimated θ r θ s ks α and n for each soil layer see table 3 were obtained using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 with the bulk density and the percentage of sand silt and clay as input the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble was 0 3 for log10 ks and log10 α and 0 01 for θ r θ s and n brandhorst et al 2017 the initial condition error was also considered by adding a disturbance σh 0 005 m brandhorst et al 2017 to the initial pressure head which was calculated from the initial soil water content the results of the parameter estimation are shown in fig 17 deviations can be found between the initial parameter values and their estimated values especially for the most variable parameters ks and α carsel and parrish 1988 since the true values of parameters were not known the results of the gpienkf method were compared with those of the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm l m moré 1978 which are shown in table 4 it can be seen that the values of the parameters ks and n estimated using the gpienkf method see table 5 are close to those obtained using the l m method contrary to those of other parameters which showed large deviations this may be attributed to the fact that the l m method estimates parameters by minimizing the objective function i e the sum of squared deviations between simulated and observed soil water contents while the gpienkf method obtains parameters using the variance minimizing analysis evensen 2003 fig 18 shows a comparison between the simulated and observed soil water contents simulated soil water contents agree reasonably well with measurements at soil depths of 20 60 cm rmses for the gpienkf method are 0 012 cm3 cm3 for the 20 40 cm soil depth and 0 031 cm3 cm3 for the 40 60 cm depth while for the l m method they are 0 007 cm3 cm3 for the 20 40 cm depth and 0 016 cm3 cm3 for the 40 60 cm depth however simulated soil water contents for the 0 20 cm soil depth show large deviations from measurements with rmses of 0 049 cm3 cm3 for the gpienkf method and 0 035 cm3 cm3 for the l m method larger deviations between the simulated and observed soil water contents may be attributable to the following reasons first there is uncertainty in the upper boundary condition which can not be quite well characterized due to frequent changes between evaporation and infiltration associated with multiple irrigation and precipitation events second the simulations are affected by an inherent soil spatial heterogeneity the classification of the soil profile into multiple homogeneous layers in numerical simulations is a significant simplification of the complex reality finally the assumption that parameter values are constant in time may be unreasonable soil structure is continuously changing during the growing season due to irrigations crop growth and other factors which may lead to time variable soil hydraulic parameters especially ks and α more accurate simulations can be obtained using parameters estimated by the gpienkf method compared to those estimated by rosetta initial parameter values fig 18 this further indicates that the assimilation algorithm can improve prediction accuracy similar results were reported by li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 for the real experimental case the cpu time for the gpienkf method about 15 h is about 10 times shorter than that for the standard iterative enkf this further indicates that the gpienkf method can improve the computational efficiency especially for cases with which the original model simulations are time consuming the initial and boundary conditions are very important to the simulation of soil water dynamics however their uncertainties were not considered in the surrogate model of the present study due to that their uncertainties mainly depend on the accuracy of observations in general the initial and boundary conditions are assumed to be deterministic and known in the parameter estimation using assimilation method li and ren 2011 song et al 2014 shi et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the influence of initial and boundary conditions on parameter estimation with the surrogate method is worth to be investigated in the follow up studies for example the uncertainties of initial and boundary conditions might be integrated in surrogate method with considering them as the input variables of the constructed model in addition the present study focused on parameter estimation of layered soils the capability of gpienkf for the parameter estimation of multi dimensional cases with high heterogeneities needs further investigation 4 conclusions we propose a gaussian process based iterative ensemble kalman filter method for parameter estimation the proposed method combines the advantage of the high computational efficiency of the gp surrogate with the advantage of dealing with the uncertainty problem by the enkf method since the number of original model evaluations is equal to the number of training base points which is much smaller than the ensemble size the calculation time of the gpienkf method can be greatly reduced in comparison with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter method we verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method using two synthetic cases and a real dataset involving a field experiment with drip irrigation for a homogeneous soil profile the results show that the number of training base points has little effect on parameter estimation soil water movement needs to be described well by the layout scheme of observation points so that the surrogate model can correctly emulate the original model thereby leading to more accurate parameter estimation and pressure head predictions increasing the number of observation points provides more observation information for the assimilation system and improves the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model thereby resulting in more accurate parameter estimation for the layered soils the gpienkf method can obtain accurate results for multi parameter conditions however the accuracy of predictions is affected by the uncertainty of the boundary conditions and the soil spatial heterogeneity in comparison with the standard iterative ensemble kalman filter method the gpienkf method can obtain comparably accurate results with a greatly reduced computational cost the proposed method is an effective tool for parameter estimation for high dimensional soil water flow problems in this study we only considered unsaturated flow model but the proposed method can also be easily adapted for other hydrologic models the parameters were assumed to be constant over time in this study however due to climatic variations and human activities this assumption may result in large simulation errors as a sequential assimilation method the gpienkf method can update the state variables and parameters in real time according to observed data in future research we will explore the potential of the gpienkf method for estimating time varying parameters credit authorship contribution statement kun liu conceptualization methodology writing original draft software guanhua huang supervision writing review editing zheng

5269,previous studies on dry and wet combinations had focused on their evolution characteristics in a single season i e spring or summer while the dynamics and driving forces between the adjacent seasons remain unsolved which is important for water resources planning and management in a changing environment to this end the dry and wet events in adjacent seasons in the yellow river basin yrb were evaluated based on the standardized precipitation index spi and the joint return periods of various combinations of dry and wet conditions under two scenarios moderate and severe were calculated using a copula function the mann kendall test was used to explore the joint return period dynamics with a 31 year sliding window the copula based likelihood ratio method and cross wavelet transform were adopted to explore the driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics the results indicate that 1 spring summer and summer autumn are prone to continuous dry wet events while the probabilities of the combinations of dry and wet conditions occurring in autumn winter and winter spring are almost the same 2 continuous wet events frequently occur above longyang gorge and below huayuankou while the inner flow area is prone to continuous dry events 3 the risk of dry and wet combinations with high frequency decreases whereas the risk of compound events with low frequency increases 4 the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons show the strongest correlation with the el niño southern oscillation enso followed by the arctic oscillation and sunspot activities implying that the enso has a dominant control on the dry and wet combination dynamics in the yrb this study brings new insights into dry and wet combination dynamics and driving forces in a changing environment and provides a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization of water resources in the yrb keywords adjacent seasons dry and wet combinations copula function joint return periods dynamics 1 introduction as a consequence of a changing environment the rate of water circulation has accelerated teegavarapu 2013 liu et al 2013 pendergrass et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and the area frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events drought flood have increased jin et al 2012 li et al 2019 threatening the economic development and the safety of life and property evans and geerken 2004 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 li et al 2018 yeh and hsu 2019 china has a typical monsoon climate with the uneven distribution of precipitation within a year and between years leading to frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods the frequency of flooding events in china is higher than the world average zou et al 2008 in 2003 direct economic losses of anhui and jiangsu province caused by the huaihe river flood reached 33 billion yuan liu et al 2019 compared with the single hazard events the alternations between dry and wet seasons often lead to more serious agricultural disasters resulting in severe damage to grain production and significant socioeconomic loss ma 2007 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2019a de luca et al 2019 from the winter of 2010 to the early spring of 2011 the severe drought in southern china destroyed 989 000 km2 of crops and made access to drinking water extremely difficult for people and livestock sun and yang 2012 from 2012 to 2014 california experienced the worst sustained drought in its history which led to a sharp reduction in surface water supply and limited the use of water resources griffin and anchukaitis 2014 consequently more attention has been paid to the multi dimensional and multi layered combinations of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons which increase severity of disasters and require more precautionary measures in the abrupt transition from drought to flood extreme rainfall amounts cause the floods to converge quickly ma et al 2018 if flood discharge is not timely water levels in reservoirs may rise quickly and destroy dams moreover for farmland with weak resistance to flood and drought events alternation of wet and dry conditions will lead to a substantial decline in the grain yield dickin and wright 2008 hence it is important for the management of water and food security to comprehensively investigate the alternation of wet and dry conditions and their dynamics the combinations of dry and wet conditions have been widely studied based on the daily precipitation data in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin during the past half century shan et al 2018 analysed the characteristics of the abrupt alternation of dry and wet events in summer may august using a modified dryness wetness abrupt alternation index shi et al 2015 exported the main characteristics and linkages of the abrupt turn of droughts and floods in spring in northern qinghai province a severe and persistent drought in winter spring in southern china 2011 was studied by sun and yang 2012 generally these studies investigate the combination of promote to dry and wet conditions using various indices but they are limited to a single season and ignore the multi hazard events between adjacent seasons with larger socio economic impacts to fill this research gap wu et al 2017 revealed the abrupt alternation rules of droughts and floods between seasons in the huai river basin 1956 2012 using the index of dryness wetness abrupt alternation and mann kendall m k trend test li and ye 2015 analysed the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of dry wet abrupt alternation events and the intraannual and interannual variations in the poyang lake basin in the past half century de et al 2019 quantified the spatio temporal interactions characterising the dry and wet co existence on a global scale and a grid point scale although these studies investigate the combinations of dry and wet conditions in adjacent seasons they assessed the multi hazard risk in a static manner and paid less attention to its dynamics fang et al 2019a analysed the dynamic risks of the dry and wet alternations between adjacent seasons in the pearl river basin using the m k test method and a sliding window however the potential driving forces behind the dry and wet combination dynamics have not been clearly revealed which would help better understand the formation mechanism of the dry and wet combination dynamics to bridge this knowledge gap in this study the copula based likelihood ratio clr method and cross wavelet method were employed to explore the linkages between the dependency structure dynamics of standardized precipitation index spi series between adjacent seasons and teleconnection factors such as the el niño southern oscillation enso arctic oscillation ao and sunspot activities were used to reveal driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics the major objectives of this study are 1 to determine the risk patterns of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons in the yellow river basin 2 to explore the dynamics of the combinations of dry and wet conditions 3 to fully reveal the driving forces of the dynamics of the dry and wet alternation the results are expected to objectively reflect the formation and dynamics of dry and wet alternations they provide a scientific basis for water resources management to predict future dry and wet alternations and establish effective mitigation strategies 2 research area and data 2 1 overview of the research area the yellow river basin 35 n 40 n 90 e 120 e being the second longest river in china was selected to analyse the combinations of dry and wet conditions the yellow river basin yrb originates from the tibetan plateau with the mainstream length of 5464 km and basin area of 752 443 km2 the yrb with a large water drop passes through nine provinces autonomous regions from west to east and eventually empties into the bohai sea the upstream is dominated by mountainous areas with greater evaporation and less precipitation the middle stream is the main source of sediment and floods in the yrb the downstream is 785 6 km long with an area of 2 3 km2 accounting for 3 of the total basin area the middle and lower reaches are dominated by plains and hills the yrb directly supports a population of 107 million people that account for 8 6 of the country s total population arable land accounts for 13 3 of the country s total area about 126 billion km2 most of the yrb is located at the boundary between arid and semi arid areas in western china and humid and semi humid areas in eastern china the average annual precipitation is 446 mm the interannual variations of the water resources in the basin are large and the spatial distribution is uneven since ancient times droughts and floods have been common in the yrb zhang et al 2013 lou et al 2018 fang et al 2019b guo et al 2020 therefore frequent disasters directly restrict the stable socioeconomic development and the improvement of the ecological environment thus it is particularly important to study the combinations of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons in the yrb as shown in fig 1 the yrb is divided into eight regions according to the boundary of the second level basin gu et al 2019 in this study the above the longyang gorge alyg and regions located in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb which include the inner flow area ifa sanmenxia to huayuankou sth and below huayuankou bhyk were selected for the analysis 2 2 data the monthly precipitation dataset for 1952 2012 covering the area of alyg ifa sth and bhyk in the yrb was obtained from the national climatic center ncc of the china meteorological administration cma http cdc cma gov cn the corresponding arctic oscillation ao enso niño3 4 index and sunspot data were acquired from http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list and http sidc oma be silso dayssnplot zhao et al 2020 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index different drought indicators are used to explore the impact of dry wet events on agricultural production the most common indicators include standardized precipitation index spi precipitation anomaly percentage relative humidity index z index and palmer drought severity index pdsi since spi can characterize droughts at multiple time scales such as month season and year it is easy to calculate and compare wet and dry alternations in different climatic regions he et al 2015 wu and chen 2019 dai et al 2020 the seasonal spi was used to characterize agricultural drought hayes et al 1999 in this study the spi equation is reported in wang et al 2015 and huang et al 2015 the classification standard of the dry grade is presented in table 1 shah et al 2015 3 2 copula function copula function which was first proposed by sklar in 1959 is defined as a multivariate joint distribution function evenly distributed in 0 1 using a copula function it is possible to link the marginal distribution of multiple random variables and obtain their joint distribution hu and zhang 2017 nejc et al 2018 pan et al 2019 assuming that f x y is a bivariate joint cumulative distribution function and f x and f y are continuous cumulative distribution functions of the corresponding variables a two dimensional copula function c is formulated as follows 1 f x y c f x f y copula function can be independent of the marginal distribution of random variables to reflect the correlation among variables guo et al 2019 therefore it can transform the joint distribution of random variables into two independent marginal distributions for processing in addition the selection of marginal distribution is not restricted thus any marginal distribution function through the copula function can construct a joint distribution function 3 2 1 marginal distribution common marginal distribution functions include exponential distribution exp gamma distribution normal distribution generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized extreme value gev distribution since the exp gamma distribution and gpd all require that the value of the random variable is larger than zero only normal and gev distributions which have both positive and negative properties fit the spi series maximum likelihood estimation is adopted to calculate the parameters of normal and gev distributions since the error of the marginal distribution may be amplified in the joint distribution the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse are used to select the marginal distribution function with a better goodness of fit of the spi series the evaluation criterion is that rmse is the smallest tu et al 2019 which is expressed as follows 2 mse 1 n m i 1 n x i p 0 i 2 3 rmse mse where x denotes the theoretical probability of the two dimensional marginal distribution p 0 denotes the empirical value of the two dimensional marginal distribution m denotes the number of parameter estimates for marginal distribution and n denotes the number of samples 3 2 2 joint distribution there are many families of copula functions which are generally divided into four categories archimedean copula elliptic copula extreme copula and other mixture families of copulas as a member of the archimedes copula class the gumbel copula function is applicable to two dimensional asymmetric random variables of the upper tail correlation and the lower tail independence the clayton function is contrary to the applicability of gumbel function gaussian and frank copula functions are applicable to the tail independent and symmetrical two dimensional random variables student s t copula is applicable to the tail dependent and symmetrical two dimensional random variables thus these copula functions are widely applied in meteorology and hydrology to more accurately describe the dependent structure of the spi series between adjacent seasons the goodness of fit of the copulas is tested by the square euclidean distance sed whose basic principle is that the sed has the minimum 4 l cuv c 2 where l denotes the sed cuv denotes the empirical value of the two dimensional copula and c denotes theoretical value of the copula function 3 2 3 joint return period assuming that random variables x and y represent the spi series of the successive seasons the corresponding marginal distributions are f x and f y and the joint distribution is f x y this study defines four joint return periods eqs 5 8 as shown in table 2 two alternating scenarios were defined according to the classification standard of dryness and wetness grades 5 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f xy x y 6 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 1 f x x f y y f xy x y 7 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f x x f xy x y 8 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f y y f xy x y 3 3 mann kendall tend test the mann kendall m k trend test is a nonparametric test based on a rank that can analyse the linear or nonlinear trends without a requirement to follow a certain distribution sang et al 2014 huang et al 2020 in the m k significance test the null hypothesis h0 is that time series x 1 x 2 x n has n independent random variables with the same distribution the alternative hypothesis h1 is the bilateral test the correlation between the trend statistic s and the m k statistic is constructed to calculate the z value see fang et al 2019a for the bilateral test when z is greater than z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is rejected and the time series variable shows a significant downward or upward trend at the significance level z 0 illustrates a downward trend and z 0 an upward trend 3 4 copula based likelihood ratio test given a copula type the copula based likelihood ratio test clr method detects the variations in the dependent structural strength of multivariate hydrological series by measuring the changes in the given copula parameters xiong et al 2015 zhao and huang 2019 the clr test assumes that the joint distribution of an n dimensional hydrometeorological series x 1 x 2 x n can be constituted by the copula function 9 h x i c u i θ i where i 1 2 n u i denotes the marginal probability vector of xi c denotes a copula function θ i denotes the copula parameter vector assuming that the copula type is constant the null hypothesis h0 is that there is no change point in the dependence structure of hydrometeorological series xi i 1 2 n i e θ 1 θ 2 θ n η 0 the alternative hypothesis h1 is that there exist λ and 1 λ n 1 so that θ 1 θ λ η 1 θ λ 1 θ n η 2 and η 1 η 2 the statistics is constructed using the clr as follows 10 λ λ l n η λ 0 l λ η λ 1 l n λ η λ 2 1 i n c u i η λ 0 1 i λ c u i η λ 1 λ 1 i n c u i η λ 2 where l n denotes the likelihood function of the entire hydrological series l λ and l n λ denote the likelihood function of the series up to and after the change point λ c denotes the probability density function of the copula η 0 λ η 1 λ and η 2 λ denote the maximum likelihood estimates for η 0 η 1 and η 2 the likelihood ratio is expressed as follows 11 2 ln λ λ 2 ln l λ η λ 1 ln l n λ η λ 2 ln l n η λ 0 12 q 2 ln λ λ where q denotes the bivariate dynamic dependence structure therefore q is used to reflect the dynamic structure of the spi series between adjacent seasons the driving forces behind the dry and wet combination dynamics are further revealed by exploring the correlation coefficient between q series and related factors 3 5 cross wavelet method cross wavelet transform is employed to analyse the relationship between two time series in the time frequency domain yu et al 2015 the wavelet cross spectrum w xy a τ between time series x t and y t is defined as follows 13 w xy a τ c x a τ c y a τ where c x a τ denotes the wavelet coefficient of x t c y a τ denotes the conjugate of the coefficient of y t the cross wavelet transform reflects the common high energy region and phase changes between the two time series the cross wavelet transform equation is reported in grinsted et al 2014 and labat 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variations in dry and wet events between adjacent seasons the seasons are conventionally divided into spring summer march august summer autumn june november autumn winter september february and winter spring december may the dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons in the selected regions of the yrb during 1952 2012 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 table 3 shows that four types of dry and wet combinations occurred in alyg ifa sth and bhyk during 1952 2012 the most frequent combination in these four regions is continuous wetness followed by the wet dry dry wet and continuous dryness with the respective frequencies of 25 21 and 18 spatially summer autumn in alyg and winter spring in bhyk are prone to continuous wetness the frequency of the prolonged wetness event in spring summer and winter spring is the highest frequency of 8 4 2 joint return period of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two scenarios 4 2 1 optimization of marginal distribution considering the value range of each seasonal spi series normal and gev distributions were selected for marginal distribution fitting and their goodness of fit values were evaluated using the k s test and rmse when the return h value of the k s test is larger than zero and p 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5 significance level the goodness of fit test results are shown in table 4 since h 0 both normal and gev distributions of seasonal spi values in four subregions pass the k s test then the rmse was adopted to optimize the marginal distribution that passed the k s test the distributions with the minimum rmse are regarded as the optimal marginal distribution and shown in bold in table 4 4 2 2 determination of optimized joint distribution after the selection of appropriate marginal distributions for each seasonal spi series the joint distributions were fitted by copulas namely clayton frank gumbel gaussian and student s t to reduce the loss of information caused by the copula function in the probabilistic joint process eq 4 was used to calculate the sed of the five copula functions the copula function with good applicability and fit was determined based on the sed the results of the goodness of fit are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the fitting effect of the clayton copula function is the best in spring summer in ifa and bhyk the frank copula function has the best applicability in spring summer and summer autumn in alyg spring summer of ifa and autumn winter of bhyk gumbel copula has the best fitting degree in autumn winter in alyg and winter spring in sth and bhyk the fitting effect of gaussian copula is the best in ifa in autumn winter and winter spring the student s t copula function is applicable to winter spring in alyg 4 2 3 joint return period under two scenarios in a static manner the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two different scenarios were calculated using eqs 5 8 table 6 the joint return periods in different regions of the yrb show differences under the same scenario table 6 the smaller joint return period has a higher probability of dry and wet combination events in scenario 1 the smallest joint return periods of the abrupt transitions from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet events in spring summer in four zones are 40 3 40 5 30 2 and 24 6a respectively indicating that the probability of continuous wet conditions in spring summer in bhyk is the largest in summer autumn the minimum joint return periods of alternation from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet events in four zones are 39 5 40 21 8 and 28 3a respectively with the highest probability of continuous drought in summer autumn in ifa in the autumn winter the smallest joint return periods of the combinations of dry and wet conditions in four regions are 39 1 38 4 33 8 and 32 8a respectively the probabilities of both wet and dry conditions in autumn winter in bhyk are relatively large in winter spring the minimum joint return periods are 38 1 37 1 30 8 and 23 5a respectively implying that winter spring can be prone to continuous wet conditions in scenario 2 the probability of continuous dry events is higher than continuous wet events in autumn winter from 1960 to 2014 northwest china experienced wet conditions in spring and winter and dry conditions in summer and autumn hu et al 2018 overall in spring summer and summer autumn continuous dry wet events have shorter joint return periods than abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions in all study areas except sth indicating that these regions are mainly characterised by high frequency prolonged dry wet conditions which pose a severe impact on agricultural production therefore decision makers should take effective measures in advance to relieve the loss caused by droughts and floods in autumn winter and winter spring the joint return period of the alternation from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet conditions in four zones are almost the same in all regions except bhyk spatially in alyg the probability of prolonged wet events is higher under the dry and wet combinations of scenario 1 in summer autumn with a joint return period of 28 3a however in scenario 2 winter spring has a trend toward wetness in ifa the probability of continuous dry events in summer autumn is larger ifa has a temperate continental arid climate where precipitation is scarce and evaporation is substantial pan et al 2018 leading to frequent dryness in sth the probability of four combinations is almost the same the moderate continuous wetting event in winter spring and severe prolonged wetting event in spring summer occur in bhyk gu et al 2019 showed that above lanzhou and bhyk regions of the yrb are rich in terms of water resources the probability of continuous dry events is larger in ifa whereas bhyk is prone to moderate prolonged wetness in winter spring the middle and lower reaches of the yrb are important agricultural areas in china thus this study aims to provide a basis to develop strategies for improved management of water resources and the security of food and ecological environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 4 3 dynamics of joint return period of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two scenarios to further explore the risk evolution of the dry and wet combinations in the yrb in a changing environment the 31 year sliding window villalba et al 2019 was utilized in each seasonal spi series to determine explore the time series trends of joint return periods in this section the autumn winter season in ifa was taken as an example the time series of the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations is shown in fig 2 note that the increasing decreasing trends of the joint return periods represent the reduced intensified risk of the dry and wet combinations under two scenarios fig 2 the risk of transition from wet to dry and continuous wet conditions decreased significantly in autumn winter but increased gradually after 1993 meanwhile the risk of transition from dry to wet conditions and prolonged dry events also increased furthermore in four regions based on the m k nonparametric trend test results temporal variations in the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations in time series were analysed the results are shown in table 7 note that if z 0 the joint return periods show an increasing trend and vice versa table 7 shows that the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations with high probability obtained using the copula functions in section 4 4 increase in a changing environment the joint return periods of wetness in spring summer and autumn winter and dryness in summer autumn exhibited increasing trends while the period of prolonged wetness showed a declining trend in winter spring indicating the intensification of the risk of winter spring wetness similar to the results presented in table 3 the frequency of summer autumn dryness and autumn winter wetness was relatively low while the frequency of continuous wetness in winter spring was high in alyg the risks of moderate summer autumn wetness and severe winter spring wetness significantly decreased moreover the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations including prolonged dry and alternation from dry to wet conditions in spring summer decreased indicating the reduction of their risks in ifa the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations showed significantly increasing trends the trends of winter spring dry events increased significantly and the risk of moderate transitions from autumn dryness to winter wetness also intensified in sth the risk of prolonged dry events increased furthermore the joint return period of the abrupt transition from autumn dryness to winter wetness decreased significantly implying that the risk of compound events increased wang 2009 showed that since the 1950 s the precipitation amounts in sth have decreased significantly however since the 1980 s there have been large precipitation events in winter as reported by li 2007 based on the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation in sth in bhyk the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations which include the transition from wet to dry in autumn winter and winter spring wetness decreased significantly indicating that wetness trends intensified in spring and winter in general the past half century has witnessed intensified risks of winter spring wet events with high frequency in a changing environment moreover the risks of combined events with lower frequency have significantly increased for instance the risks of abrupt transition from spring dryness to summer wetness in alyg and prolonged dryness in sth have increased the results of this study can be used by the relevant departments to detect the risks of dry and wet combinations induced by the changing environment 4 4 driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics after defining the dynamics of the dry and wet combinations in selected zones it is necessary to explore the influencing factors of their occurrence therefore this section explores the influence of the teleconnection factors such as the ao sunspots and enso on dry and wet combinations based on the optimal copula function presented in the sections 4 2 and 4 3 the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons q index was calculated using the eqs 11 and 12 the influence degree of the factors on dry and wet combinations was determined by analysing the correlation between the q index and each factor there is a time lag between the q index and the ao enso sunspots series hence the correlation coefficients between them in the simultaneous period spring summer and summer autumn etc one month ahead of q index february july and may october etc and two months ahead of the q index january june and april september etc were calculated the results show that the simultaneous period ao series and the enso and sunspot series of two months ahead of the q index have the highest connection with the q index hu et al 2012 found that the ao is significantly correlated with precipitation area and intensity of strong convection during the same period zhou et al 2015 showed that the enso generally is 1 2 months ahead of the dry events on monthly and seasonal scales spurious correlation is avoided using the significance tests the highest correlation and classification of the correlation intensity wu and yuan 2009 are shown in tables 8 and 9 respectively based on the classification of the correlation intensity the enso has the strongest correlation with the q index followed by the ao and the sunspot has the weakest correlation with the q index the correlation reflects the influence of teleconnection factors on the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between the adjacent seasons in alyg ifa sth and bhyk overall the q index between adjacent seasons is negatively correlated with the ao and enso while positively correlated with the sunspots the q index of spring summer summer autumn and winter spring is strongly correlated with the ao and the absolute value of the winter spring correlation coefficient is equal to 0 68 table 6 shows that the probability of winter spring wetness is higher gong and wang 2013 showed that the ao changes significantly in winter when the ao index is higher the temperature in many areas of china is warmer and there is more precipitation the ao has a moderate correlation with the q index in autumn winter sunspots are weakly correlated with the q index in spring summer and autumn winter and moderately correlated in summer autumn and winter spring the enso has a moderate correlation with the q index in spring summer and autumn winter and a strongly correlation in summer autumn with the correlation coefficient as high as 0 7 the correlation between the enso events and autumn precipitation in the yrb is significant as reported in chang et al 2013 furthermore the enso has a high correlation with the q index in winter spring spatially the ao is strongly correlated with the q index in alyg ifa and sth and moderately correlated in bhyk the sunspot shows moderate correlation with the q index in alyg ifa and sth table 6 shows that the risks of four combinations are the same in sth which is located in the middle reaches of the yrb wang and zhang 1983 found that the trends in the dry and wet conditions in the yrb are not significantly related to the solar activity in the same period the differences in the probability of dry and wet events in the central zone are small which is inconsistent with the intensity and weakness of solar activity however the enso shows a high correlation with the q index in alyg moderate correlation in ifa and strong correlation in sth and bhyk overall the q index in alyg sth and bhyk has a higher correlation with the enso whereas that in ifa has a higher correlation with the ao therefore based on cross the wavelet analysis results the relationship between the spi series of the four regions and the enso ao series reveals the influence of teleconnection factors on the dry and wet combinations fig 3 fig 3a shows that during 1960 1972 and 1982 1998 the spi series in alyg showed a significant negative correlation with enso for four years from 1960 to 1967 and from 1976 to 1988 the spi in sth showed a significant negative correlation with enso for 2 5 5 years respectively and a positive correlation for 5 7 years from 1995 to 2011 fig 3c fig 3d exhibits that in bhyk the spi series was negatively correlated with enso in 1961 1966 and 1978 1986 with periods of 1 3 and 5 5 years respectively similarly they had a significant positive relationship in 1983 1988 and 1994 2011 with periods of 1 4 and 5 7 years respectively in ifa positive correlations were observed between the ao and spi series in 1956 1966 1978 1986 and 1978 1991 with periods of 3 7 and 16 years respectively fig 3b the results show that the spi series of four regions have correlations with the enso ao series in different time frequency domains these results suggest that the teleconnection factors are closely related to the combinations of dry and wet conditions 5 conclusion the dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons which result in larger socio economic losses and require more preventative measures than single hazard events should be paid more attention to understand the nature of the multi disaster events which is important for water resources planning and management in china this study considers the dry and wet combinations between successive seasons under two scenarios moderate and severe according to the monthly precipitation data in alyg ifa sth and bhyk of the yrb during 1952 2012 the spi was applied to classify the dry wet levels and characterize the dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons then the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations were calculated using copula functions furthermore the joint return period dynamics were explored using the m k test using the clr the pearson correlation coefficient and cross wavelet methods the potential driving forces of dry and wet combinations were revealed the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 on the seasonal scale spring summer and summer autumn are mainly characterised by prolonged dry wet events which have serious impacts on agricultural production thus the authorities should take effective measures in advance to mitigate possible losses the probabilities of four combined events are almost the same in autumn winter and winter spring 2 on the spatial scale in alyg moderate summer autumn and severe winter spring wetness show large probability and the joint return period of summer autumn wetness is 28 3 year ifa is prone to summer autumn dry events the probability of moderate winter spring and severe spring summer wetness in bhyk is high 3 the past half century has generally witnessed the reduced risk of dry and wet combinations with high frequency whereas the risks of continuous wetness have intensified in winter spring in contrast the risks of combined events with lower frequency have significantly intensified 4 in alyg ifa sth and bhyk the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons which is characterized by the q index have the strongest correlation with the enso followed by the ao and the weakest correlation with the sunspots implying that the enso has a dominant control on the dry and wet combination dynamics meanwhile the spi series of the four regions has significant linkages with the teleconnection factors in different time frequency domains this study provides important insights into the dry and wet combination dynamics and potential driving forces which were helpful for establishing effective mitigation strategies to manage the intensifying dry and wet combinations

5269,previous studies on dry and wet combinations had focused on their evolution characteristics in a single season i e spring or summer while the dynamics and driving forces between the adjacent seasons remain unsolved which is important for water resources planning and management in a changing environment to this end the dry and wet events in adjacent seasons in the yellow river basin yrb were evaluated based on the standardized precipitation index spi and the joint return periods of various combinations of dry and wet conditions under two scenarios moderate and severe were calculated using a copula function the mann kendall test was used to explore the joint return period dynamics with a 31 year sliding window the copula based likelihood ratio method and cross wavelet transform were adopted to explore the driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics the results indicate that 1 spring summer and summer autumn are prone to continuous dry wet events while the probabilities of the combinations of dry and wet conditions occurring in autumn winter and winter spring are almost the same 2 continuous wet events frequently occur above longyang gorge and below huayuankou while the inner flow area is prone to continuous dry events 3 the risk of dry and wet combinations with high frequency decreases whereas the risk of compound events with low frequency increases 4 the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons show the strongest correlation with the el niño southern oscillation enso followed by the arctic oscillation and sunspot activities implying that the enso has a dominant control on the dry and wet combination dynamics in the yrb this study brings new insights into dry and wet combination dynamics and driving forces in a changing environment and provides a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization of water resources in the yrb keywords adjacent seasons dry and wet combinations copula function joint return periods dynamics 1 introduction as a consequence of a changing environment the rate of water circulation has accelerated teegavarapu 2013 liu et al 2013 pendergrass et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and the area frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events drought flood have increased jin et al 2012 li et al 2019 threatening the economic development and the safety of life and property evans and geerken 2004 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 li et al 2018 yeh and hsu 2019 china has a typical monsoon climate with the uneven distribution of precipitation within a year and between years leading to frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods the frequency of flooding events in china is higher than the world average zou et al 2008 in 2003 direct economic losses of anhui and jiangsu province caused by the huaihe river flood reached 33 billion yuan liu et al 2019 compared with the single hazard events the alternations between dry and wet seasons often lead to more serious agricultural disasters resulting in severe damage to grain production and significant socioeconomic loss ma 2007 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2019a de luca et al 2019 from the winter of 2010 to the early spring of 2011 the severe drought in southern china destroyed 989 000 km2 of crops and made access to drinking water extremely difficult for people and livestock sun and yang 2012 from 2012 to 2014 california experienced the worst sustained drought in its history which led to a sharp reduction in surface water supply and limited the use of water resources griffin and anchukaitis 2014 consequently more attention has been paid to the multi dimensional and multi layered combinations of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons which increase severity of disasters and require more precautionary measures in the abrupt transition from drought to flood extreme rainfall amounts cause the floods to converge quickly ma et al 2018 if flood discharge is not timely water levels in reservoirs may rise quickly and destroy dams moreover for farmland with weak resistance to flood and drought events alternation of wet and dry conditions will lead to a substantial decline in the grain yield dickin and wright 2008 hence it is important for the management of water and food security to comprehensively investigate the alternation of wet and dry conditions and their dynamics the combinations of dry and wet conditions have been widely studied based on the daily precipitation data in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin during the past half century shan et al 2018 analysed the characteristics of the abrupt alternation of dry and wet events in summer may august using a modified dryness wetness abrupt alternation index shi et al 2015 exported the main characteristics and linkages of the abrupt turn of droughts and floods in spring in northern qinghai province a severe and persistent drought in winter spring in southern china 2011 was studied by sun and yang 2012 generally these studies investigate the combination of promote to dry and wet conditions using various indices but they are limited to a single season and ignore the multi hazard events between adjacent seasons with larger socio economic impacts to fill this research gap wu et al 2017 revealed the abrupt alternation rules of droughts and floods between seasons in the huai river basin 1956 2012 using the index of dryness wetness abrupt alternation and mann kendall m k trend test li and ye 2015 analysed the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of dry wet abrupt alternation events and the intraannual and interannual variations in the poyang lake basin in the past half century de et al 2019 quantified the spatio temporal interactions characterising the dry and wet co existence on a global scale and a grid point scale although these studies investigate the combinations of dry and wet conditions in adjacent seasons they assessed the multi hazard risk in a static manner and paid less attention to its dynamics fang et al 2019a analysed the dynamic risks of the dry and wet alternations between adjacent seasons in the pearl river basin using the m k test method and a sliding window however the potential driving forces behind the dry and wet combination dynamics have not been clearly revealed which would help better understand the formation mechanism of the dry and wet combination dynamics to bridge this knowledge gap in this study the copula based likelihood ratio clr method and cross wavelet method were employed to explore the linkages between the dependency structure dynamics of standardized precipitation index spi series between adjacent seasons and teleconnection factors such as the el niño southern oscillation enso arctic oscillation ao and sunspot activities were used to reveal driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics the major objectives of this study are 1 to determine the risk patterns of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons in the yellow river basin 2 to explore the dynamics of the combinations of dry and wet conditions 3 to fully reveal the driving forces of the dynamics of the dry and wet alternation the results are expected to objectively reflect the formation and dynamics of dry and wet alternations they provide a scientific basis for water resources management to predict future dry and wet alternations and establish effective mitigation strategies 2 research area and data 2 1 overview of the research area the yellow river basin 35 n 40 n 90 e 120 e being the second longest river in china was selected to analyse the combinations of dry and wet conditions the yellow river basin yrb originates from the tibetan plateau with the mainstream length of 5464 km and basin area of 752 443 km2 the yrb with a large water drop passes through nine provinces autonomous regions from west to east and eventually empties into the bohai sea the upstream is dominated by mountainous areas with greater evaporation and less precipitation the middle stream is the main source of sediment and floods in the yrb the downstream is 785 6 km long with an area of 2 3 km2 accounting for 3 of the total basin area the middle and lower reaches are dominated by plains and hills the yrb directly supports a population of 107 million people that account for 8 6 of the country s total population arable land accounts for 13 3 of the country s total area about 126 billion km2 most of the yrb is located at the boundary between arid and semi arid areas in western china and humid and semi humid areas in eastern china the average annual precipitation is 446 mm the interannual variations of the water resources in the basin are large and the spatial distribution is uneven since ancient times droughts and floods have been common in the yrb zhang et al 2013 lou et al 2018 fang et al 2019b guo et al 2020 therefore frequent disasters directly restrict the stable socioeconomic development and the improvement of the ecological environment thus it is particularly important to study the combinations of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons in the yrb as shown in fig 1 the yrb is divided into eight regions according to the boundary of the second level basin gu et al 2019 in this study the above the longyang gorge alyg and regions located in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb which include the inner flow area ifa sanmenxia to huayuankou sth and below huayuankou bhyk were selected for the analysis 2 2 data the monthly precipitation dataset for 1952 2012 covering the area of alyg ifa sth and bhyk in the yrb was obtained from the national climatic center ncc of the china meteorological administration cma http cdc cma gov cn the corresponding arctic oscillation ao enso niño3 4 index and sunspot data were acquired from http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list and http sidc oma be silso dayssnplot zhao et al 2020 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index different drought indicators are used to explore the impact of dry wet events on agricultural production the most common indicators include standardized precipitation index spi precipitation anomaly percentage relative humidity index z index and palmer drought severity index pdsi since spi can characterize droughts at multiple time scales such as month season and year it is easy to calculate and compare wet and dry alternations in different climatic regions he et al 2015 wu and chen 2019 dai et al 2020 the seasonal spi was used to characterize agricultural drought hayes et al 1999 in this study the spi equation is reported in wang et al 2015 and huang et al 2015 the classification standard of the dry grade is presented in table 1 shah et al 2015 3 2 copula function copula function which was first proposed by sklar in 1959 is defined as a multivariate joint distribution function evenly distributed in 0 1 using a copula function it is possible to link the marginal distribution of multiple random variables and obtain their joint distribution hu and zhang 2017 nejc et al 2018 pan et al 2019 assuming that f x y is a bivariate joint cumulative distribution function and f x and f y are continuous cumulative distribution functions of the corresponding variables a two dimensional copula function c is formulated as follows 1 f x y c f x f y copula function can be independent of the marginal distribution of random variables to reflect the correlation among variables guo et al 2019 therefore it can transform the joint distribution of random variables into two independent marginal distributions for processing in addition the selection of marginal distribution is not restricted thus any marginal distribution function through the copula function can construct a joint distribution function 3 2 1 marginal distribution common marginal distribution functions include exponential distribution exp gamma distribution normal distribution generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized extreme value gev distribution since the exp gamma distribution and gpd all require that the value of the random variable is larger than zero only normal and gev distributions which have both positive and negative properties fit the spi series maximum likelihood estimation is adopted to calculate the parameters of normal and gev distributions since the error of the marginal distribution may be amplified in the joint distribution the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse are used to select the marginal distribution function with a better goodness of fit of the spi series the evaluation criterion is that rmse is the smallest tu et al 2019 which is expressed as follows 2 mse 1 n m i 1 n x i p 0 i 2 3 rmse mse where x denotes the theoretical probability of the two dimensional marginal distribution p 0 denotes the empirical value of the two dimensional marginal distribution m denotes the number of parameter estimates for marginal distribution and n denotes the number of samples 3 2 2 joint distribution there are many families of copula functions which are generally divided into four categories archimedean copula elliptic copula extreme copula and other mixture families of copulas as a member of the archimedes copula class the gumbel copula function is applicable to two dimensional asymmetric random variables of the upper tail correlation and the lower tail independence the clayton function is contrary to the applicability of gumbel function gaussian and frank copula functions are applicable to the tail independent and symmetrical two dimensional random variables student s t copula is applicable to the tail dependent and symmetrical two dimensional random variables thus these copula functions are widely applied in meteorology and hydrology to more accurately describe the dependent structure of the spi series between adjacent seasons the goodness of fit of the copulas is tested by the square euclidean distance sed whose basic principle is that the sed has the minimum 4 l cuv c 2 where l denotes the sed cuv denotes the empirical value of the two dimensional copula and c denotes theoretical value of the copula function 3 2 3 joint return period assuming that random variables x and y represent the spi series of the successive seasons the corresponding marginal distributions are f x and f y and the joint distribution is f x y this study defines four joint return periods eqs 5 8 as shown in table 2 two alternating scenarios were defined according to the classification standard of dryness and wetness grades 5 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f xy x y 6 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 1 f x x f y y f xy x y 7 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f x x f xy x y 8 t x x y y 1 p x x y y 1 f y y f xy x y 3 3 mann kendall tend test the mann kendall m k trend test is a nonparametric test based on a rank that can analyse the linear or nonlinear trends without a requirement to follow a certain distribution sang et al 2014 huang et al 2020 in the m k significance test the null hypothesis h0 is that time series x 1 x 2 x n has n independent random variables with the same distribution the alternative hypothesis h1 is the bilateral test the correlation between the trend statistic s and the m k statistic is constructed to calculate the z value see fang et al 2019a for the bilateral test when z is greater than z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is rejected and the time series variable shows a significant downward or upward trend at the significance level z 0 illustrates a downward trend and z 0 an upward trend 3 4 copula based likelihood ratio test given a copula type the copula based likelihood ratio test clr method detects the variations in the dependent structural strength of multivariate hydrological series by measuring the changes in the given copula parameters xiong et al 2015 zhao and huang 2019 the clr test assumes that the joint distribution of an n dimensional hydrometeorological series x 1 x 2 x n can be constituted by the copula function 9 h x i c u i θ i where i 1 2 n u i denotes the marginal probability vector of xi c denotes a copula function θ i denotes the copula parameter vector assuming that the copula type is constant the null hypothesis h0 is that there is no change point in the dependence structure of hydrometeorological series xi i 1 2 n i e θ 1 θ 2 θ n η 0 the alternative hypothesis h1 is that there exist λ and 1 λ n 1 so that θ 1 θ λ η 1 θ λ 1 θ n η 2 and η 1 η 2 the statistics is constructed using the clr as follows 10 λ λ l n η λ 0 l λ η λ 1 l n λ η λ 2 1 i n c u i η λ 0 1 i λ c u i η λ 1 λ 1 i n c u i η λ 2 where l n denotes the likelihood function of the entire hydrological series l λ and l n λ denote the likelihood function of the series up to and after the change point λ c denotes the probability density function of the copula η 0 λ η 1 λ and η 2 λ denote the maximum likelihood estimates for η 0 η 1 and η 2 the likelihood ratio is expressed as follows 11 2 ln λ λ 2 ln l λ η λ 1 ln l n λ η λ 2 ln l n η λ 0 12 q 2 ln λ λ where q denotes the bivariate dynamic dependence structure therefore q is used to reflect the dynamic structure of the spi series between adjacent seasons the driving forces behind the dry and wet combination dynamics are further revealed by exploring the correlation coefficient between q series and related factors 3 5 cross wavelet method cross wavelet transform is employed to analyse the relationship between two time series in the time frequency domain yu et al 2015 the wavelet cross spectrum w xy a τ between time series x t and y t is defined as follows 13 w xy a τ c x a τ c y a τ where c x a τ denotes the wavelet coefficient of x t c y a τ denotes the conjugate of the coefficient of y t the cross wavelet transform reflects the common high energy region and phase changes between the two time series the cross wavelet transform equation is reported in grinsted et al 2014 and labat 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variations in dry and wet events between adjacent seasons the seasons are conventionally divided into spring summer march august summer autumn june november autumn winter september february and winter spring december may the dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons in the selected regions of the yrb during 1952 2012 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 table 3 shows that four types of dry and wet combinations occurred in alyg ifa sth and bhyk during 1952 2012 the most frequent combination in these four regions is continuous wetness followed by the wet dry dry wet and continuous dryness with the respective frequencies of 25 21 and 18 spatially summer autumn in alyg and winter spring in bhyk are prone to continuous wetness the frequency of the prolonged wetness event in spring summer and winter spring is the highest frequency of 8 4 2 joint return period of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two scenarios 4 2 1 optimization of marginal distribution considering the value range of each seasonal spi series normal and gev distributions were selected for marginal distribution fitting and their goodness of fit values were evaluated using the k s test and rmse when the return h value of the k s test is larger than zero and p 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5 significance level the goodness of fit test results are shown in table 4 since h 0 both normal and gev distributions of seasonal spi values in four subregions pass the k s test then the rmse was adopted to optimize the marginal distribution that passed the k s test the distributions with the minimum rmse are regarded as the optimal marginal distribution and shown in bold in table 4 4 2 2 determination of optimized joint distribution after the selection of appropriate marginal distributions for each seasonal spi series the joint distributions were fitted by copulas namely clayton frank gumbel gaussian and student s t to reduce the loss of information caused by the copula function in the probabilistic joint process eq 4 was used to calculate the sed of the five copula functions the copula function with good applicability and fit was determined based on the sed the results of the goodness of fit are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the fitting effect of the clayton copula function is the best in spring summer in ifa and bhyk the frank copula function has the best applicability in spring summer and summer autumn in alyg spring summer of ifa and autumn winter of bhyk gumbel copula has the best fitting degree in autumn winter in alyg and winter spring in sth and bhyk the fitting effect of gaussian copula is the best in ifa in autumn winter and winter spring the student s t copula function is applicable to winter spring in alyg 4 2 3 joint return period under two scenarios in a static manner the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two different scenarios were calculated using eqs 5 8 table 6 the joint return periods in different regions of the yrb show differences under the same scenario table 6 the smaller joint return period has a higher probability of dry and wet combination events in scenario 1 the smallest joint return periods of the abrupt transitions from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet events in spring summer in four zones are 40 3 40 5 30 2 and 24 6a respectively indicating that the probability of continuous wet conditions in spring summer in bhyk is the largest in summer autumn the minimum joint return periods of alternation from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet events in four zones are 39 5 40 21 8 and 28 3a respectively with the highest probability of continuous drought in summer autumn in ifa in the autumn winter the smallest joint return periods of the combinations of dry and wet conditions in four regions are 39 1 38 4 33 8 and 32 8a respectively the probabilities of both wet and dry conditions in autumn winter in bhyk are relatively large in winter spring the minimum joint return periods are 38 1 37 1 30 8 and 23 5a respectively implying that winter spring can be prone to continuous wet conditions in scenario 2 the probability of continuous dry events is higher than continuous wet events in autumn winter from 1960 to 2014 northwest china experienced wet conditions in spring and winter and dry conditions in summer and autumn hu et al 2018 overall in spring summer and summer autumn continuous dry wet events have shorter joint return periods than abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions in all study areas except sth indicating that these regions are mainly characterised by high frequency prolonged dry wet conditions which pose a severe impact on agricultural production therefore decision makers should take effective measures in advance to relieve the loss caused by droughts and floods in autumn winter and winter spring the joint return period of the alternation from dry to wet wet to dry continuous dry and prolonged wet conditions in four zones are almost the same in all regions except bhyk spatially in alyg the probability of prolonged wet events is higher under the dry and wet combinations of scenario 1 in summer autumn with a joint return period of 28 3a however in scenario 2 winter spring has a trend toward wetness in ifa the probability of continuous dry events in summer autumn is larger ifa has a temperate continental arid climate where precipitation is scarce and evaporation is substantial pan et al 2018 leading to frequent dryness in sth the probability of four combinations is almost the same the moderate continuous wetting event in winter spring and severe prolonged wetting event in spring summer occur in bhyk gu et al 2019 showed that above lanzhou and bhyk regions of the yrb are rich in terms of water resources the probability of continuous dry events is larger in ifa whereas bhyk is prone to moderate prolonged wetness in winter spring the middle and lower reaches of the yrb are important agricultural areas in china thus this study aims to provide a basis to develop strategies for improved management of water resources and the security of food and ecological environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 4 3 dynamics of joint return period of dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons under two scenarios to further explore the risk evolution of the dry and wet combinations in the yrb in a changing environment the 31 year sliding window villalba et al 2019 was utilized in each seasonal spi series to determine explore the time series trends of joint return periods in this section the autumn winter season in ifa was taken as an example the time series of the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations is shown in fig 2 note that the increasing decreasing trends of the joint return periods represent the reduced intensified risk of the dry and wet combinations under two scenarios fig 2 the risk of transition from wet to dry and continuous wet conditions decreased significantly in autumn winter but increased gradually after 1993 meanwhile the risk of transition from dry to wet conditions and prolonged dry events also increased furthermore in four regions based on the m k nonparametric trend test results temporal variations in the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations in time series were analysed the results are shown in table 7 note that if z 0 the joint return periods show an increasing trend and vice versa table 7 shows that the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations with high probability obtained using the copula functions in section 4 4 increase in a changing environment the joint return periods of wetness in spring summer and autumn winter and dryness in summer autumn exhibited increasing trends while the period of prolonged wetness showed a declining trend in winter spring indicating the intensification of the risk of winter spring wetness similar to the results presented in table 3 the frequency of summer autumn dryness and autumn winter wetness was relatively low while the frequency of continuous wetness in winter spring was high in alyg the risks of moderate summer autumn wetness and severe winter spring wetness significantly decreased moreover the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations including prolonged dry and alternation from dry to wet conditions in spring summer decreased indicating the reduction of their risks in ifa the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations showed significantly increasing trends the trends of winter spring dry events increased significantly and the risk of moderate transitions from autumn dryness to winter wetness also intensified in sth the risk of prolonged dry events increased furthermore the joint return period of the abrupt transition from autumn dryness to winter wetness decreased significantly implying that the risk of compound events increased wang 2009 showed that since the 1950 s the precipitation amounts in sth have decreased significantly however since the 1980 s there have been large precipitation events in winter as reported by li 2007 based on the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation in sth in bhyk the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations which include the transition from wet to dry in autumn winter and winter spring wetness decreased significantly indicating that wetness trends intensified in spring and winter in general the past half century has witnessed intensified risks of winter spring wet events with high frequency in a changing environment moreover the risks of combined events with lower frequency have significantly increased for instance the risks of abrupt transition from spring dryness to summer wetness in alyg and prolonged dryness in sth have increased the results of this study can be used by the relevant departments to detect the risks of dry and wet combinations induced by the changing environment 4 4 driving forces of dry and wet combination dynamics after defining the dynamics of the dry and wet combinations in selected zones it is necessary to explore the influencing factors of their occurrence therefore this section explores the influence of the teleconnection factors such as the ao sunspots and enso on dry and wet combinations based on the optimal copula function presented in the sections 4 2 and 4 3 the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons q index was calculated using the eqs 11 and 12 the influence degree of the factors on dry and wet combinations was determined by analysing the correlation between the q index and each factor there is a time lag between the q index and the ao enso sunspots series hence the correlation coefficients between them in the simultaneous period spring summer and summer autumn etc one month ahead of q index february july and may october etc and two months ahead of the q index january june and april september etc were calculated the results show that the simultaneous period ao series and the enso and sunspot series of two months ahead of the q index have the highest connection with the q index hu et al 2012 found that the ao is significantly correlated with precipitation area and intensity of strong convection during the same period zhou et al 2015 showed that the enso generally is 1 2 months ahead of the dry events on monthly and seasonal scales spurious correlation is avoided using the significance tests the highest correlation and classification of the correlation intensity wu and yuan 2009 are shown in tables 8 and 9 respectively based on the classification of the correlation intensity the enso has the strongest correlation with the q index followed by the ao and the sunspot has the weakest correlation with the q index the correlation reflects the influence of teleconnection factors on the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between the adjacent seasons in alyg ifa sth and bhyk overall the q index between adjacent seasons is negatively correlated with the ao and enso while positively correlated with the sunspots the q index of spring summer summer autumn and winter spring is strongly correlated with the ao and the absolute value of the winter spring correlation coefficient is equal to 0 68 table 6 shows that the probability of winter spring wetness is higher gong and wang 2013 showed that the ao changes significantly in winter when the ao index is higher the temperature in many areas of china is warmer and there is more precipitation the ao has a moderate correlation with the q index in autumn winter sunspots are weakly correlated with the q index in spring summer and autumn winter and moderately correlated in summer autumn and winter spring the enso has a moderate correlation with the q index in spring summer and autumn winter and a strongly correlation in summer autumn with the correlation coefficient as high as 0 7 the correlation between the enso events and autumn precipitation in the yrb is significant as reported in chang et al 2013 furthermore the enso has a high correlation with the q index in winter spring spatially the ao is strongly correlated with the q index in alyg ifa and sth and moderately correlated in bhyk the sunspot shows moderate correlation with the q index in alyg ifa and sth table 6 shows that the risks of four combinations are the same in sth which is located in the middle reaches of the yrb wang and zhang 1983 found that the trends in the dry and wet conditions in the yrb are not significantly related to the solar activity in the same period the differences in the probability of dry and wet events in the central zone are small which is inconsistent with the intensity and weakness of solar activity however the enso shows a high correlation with the q index in alyg moderate correlation in ifa and strong correlation in sth and bhyk overall the q index in alyg sth and bhyk has a higher correlation with the enso whereas that in ifa has a higher correlation with the ao therefore based on cross the wavelet analysis results the relationship between the spi series of the four regions and the enso ao series reveals the influence of teleconnection factors on the dry and wet combinations fig 3 fig 3a shows that during 1960 1972 and 1982 1998 the spi series in alyg showed a significant negative correlation with enso for four years from 1960 to 1967 and from 1976 to 1988 the spi in sth showed a significant negative correlation with enso for 2 5 5 years respectively and a positive correlation for 5 7 years from 1995 to 2011 fig 3c fig 3d exhibits that in bhyk the spi series was negatively correlated with enso in 1961 1966 and 1978 1986 with periods of 1 3 and 5 5 years respectively similarly they had a significant positive relationship in 1983 1988 and 1994 2011 with periods of 1 4 and 5 7 years respectively in ifa positive correlations were observed between the ao and spi series in 1956 1966 1978 1986 and 1978 1991 with periods of 3 7 and 16 years respectively fig 3b the results show that the spi series of four regions have correlations with the enso ao series in different time frequency domains these results suggest that the teleconnection factors are closely related to the combinations of dry and wet conditions 5 conclusion the dry and wet combinations between adjacent seasons which result in larger socio economic losses and require more preventative measures than single hazard events should be paid more attention to understand the nature of the multi disaster events which is important for water resources planning and management in china this study considers the dry and wet combinations between successive seasons under two scenarios moderate and severe according to the monthly precipitation data in alyg ifa sth and bhyk of the yrb during 1952 2012 the spi was applied to classify the dry wet levels and characterize the dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons then the joint return periods of dry and wet combinations were calculated using copula functions furthermore the joint return period dynamics were explored using the m k test using the clr the pearson correlation coefficient and cross wavelet methods the potential driving forces of dry and wet combinations were revealed the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 on the seasonal scale spring summer and summer autumn are mainly characterised by prolonged dry wet events which have serious impacts on agricultural production thus the authorities should take effective measures in advance to mitigate possible losses the probabilities of four combined events are almost the same in autumn winter and winter spring 2 on the spatial scale in alyg moderate summer autumn and severe winter spring wetness show large probability and the joint return period of summer autumn wetness is 28 3 year ifa is prone to summer autumn dry events the probability of moderate winter spring and severe spring summer wetness in bhyk is high 3 the past half century has generally witnessed the reduced risk of dry and wet combinations with high frequency whereas the risks of continuous wetness have intensified in winter spring in contrast the risks of combined events with lower frequency have significantly intensified 4 in alyg ifa sth and bhyk the dependency structure dynamics of the spi series between adjacent seasons which is characterized by the q index have the strongest correlation with the enso followed by the ao and the weakest correlation with the sunspots implying that the enso has a dominant control on the dry and wet combination dynamics meanwhile the spi series of the four regions has significant linkages with the teleconnection factors in different time frequency domains this study provides important insights into the dry and wet combination dynamics and potential driving forces which were helpful for establishing effective mitigation strategies to manage the intensifying dry and wet combinations
