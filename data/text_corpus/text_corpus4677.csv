23385,this article proposes a novel methodology for the detection of mooring line breakage in thruster assisted position mooring pm systems when no measurements of the tensions on the mooring lines are available for dynamic positioning dp of marine vessels moored to the seabed via a turret based spread mooring system thrusters provide only complementary assistance to the mooring system which is responsible for generating a large part of the forces and moments required for station keeping however in extreme weather conditions thruster assistance is essential to avoid mooring line failure once a mooring line is parted the remaining lines must withstand an increase in the tension forces required to compensate for the lost tension in the ruptured line this in turn may lead to a cascade breakage of the mooring lines hence it is of paramount importance to detect any line breakage as soon as it occurs to compensate for the lost tension by proper use of dp thruster assistance as a contribution to solving this problem in this paper we propose a methodology that builds on dynamic hypothesis testing dht whereby a set of hypotheses are assessed at each sampling time using the measured inputs and outputs of the thruster assisted position mooring system while the first hypothesis corresponds to the assumption that all mooring lines are intact the remaining hypotheses are built assuming that a single or multiple line breakage events have taken place at each sampling time the inputs and outputs to the system are used to generate the conditional probability of each hypothesis being true the conditional probabilities are then used to evaluate which hypothesis is more probable to be compatible with the collected measurements in addition we find conditions for any pair of hypothesis to be distinguishable numerical simulations carried out using a high fidelity nonlinear pm simulator illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology keywords mooring line breakage fault detection dynamic positioning position mooring dynamic hypothesis testing 1 introduction rising world oil demand with only limited easy to access oil fields is steadily pushing offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation activities to increasingly remote deeper areas under extreme environmental conditions the latter expose offshore vessels and structures used for drilling and production of oil and gas to challenging operational conditions characterized by high winds reaching hurricane force and temperatures dropping below zero in such severe conditions the reliability of offshore vessels and their equipments as well as the efficacy of the corresponding monitoring and control systems are fundamental to the safety and success of the operations some of the commercially attractive alternatives to permanent platforms for offshore oil and gas exploitation are dynamic positioning dp and position mooring pm systems the research and development of thruster assisted position mooring systems follows the rich and by now mature applications of dp systems dp systems have been commercially available since the late 1960s for offshore drilling applications early dp systems were built around pid controllers driven by output measurements that were filtered using a cascade of notch and low pass filters aimed at suppressing thruster wear and tear caused by wave induced motions however since notch filters introduce some phase lag around the crossover frequency phase margin reduction and deterioration of the system performance were inevitable to overcome this problem pid control solutions were replaced by more advanced control techniques based on optimal and linear quadratic gaussian lqg control and kalman filtering theory in balchen et al 1976 further modified and extended in grimble et al 1979 1980 balchen et al 1980 fung and grimble 1983 sælid et al 1983 sørensen et al 1996 fossen et al 1996 and fossen and perez 2009a since the application of lqg techniques to dp systems involves the linearization of the vessel s kinematic and dynamic equations about different operating points and the tuning of design variables such as the covariance of process and sensor noise simpler frameworks were developed using integrator back stepping techniques in aarset et al 1998 fossen and grøvlen 1998 robertsson and johansson 1998 and passive observers and nonlinear multivariate pid controllers in fossen and strand 1999 strand and fossen 1999 strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 fossen 2000 in recent years other techniques such as gain scheduling torsetnes et al 2004 robust control hassani et al 2012a b 2017 adaptive control tannuri et al 2006 hassani et al 2010 2013b and hybrid control nguyen et al 2007b hassani et al 2013b have come to the fore the literature on modeling and simulation of dp systems and the application of different control techniques to the design of dp controllers is vast and defies a simple summary the reader is referred to sørensen 2005 2011b hassani et al 2013a and the references therein for a short presentation of the subject and its historical evolution pm systems have been available since the late 1980s while pm systems are built upon dp systems there are some key differences between the two namely the main function of thruster assistance in pm systems is to keep the heading angle at a desired value and add damping in the surge sway and yaw motions while the mooring lines keep the position of the vessel in a predefined admissible region see strand 1999 this strategy leads to reduced activity of the thrusters in normal environmental condition however in harsh environmental conditions thruster assistance helps keeping the vessel in a predefined tolerable region in order to prevent the mooring lines tensions from rising above safety limits a mathematical model of a thruster assisted mooring system and a mooring line were developed in strand et al 1998b and aamo and fossen 2000 respectively back stepping techniques were applied to pm systems in strand et al 1998a chen et al 2013 in aamo and fossen 1999 a dynamic line tensioning controller was developed to reject constant or slowly varying environmental disturbances and hence reduce the thruster force and consumed fuel in sørensen et al 1999 a nonlinear multivariable controller and a passivity based observer were applied to a floating production storage and offloading fpso unit with pm systems a switching controller algorithm was proposed by nguyen et al 2007b whereby the sea state is identified through power spectral density analysis of the vessel s motion and a suitable controller is automatically selected to increase the operation weather window of the pm system under study the safety of dp and pm systems is of paramount concern in the marine industry and hence regulations are in place to define different levels of system redundancy to prevent faults in equipment from causing accidents at the system level dnv 2014 2015 any failures in mooring lines can cause loss of position keeping capability which in turn can lead to disasters on an unprecedented scale in strand et al 1998b a line break detection and compensation algorithm was coupled with an lqg based controller then any irregular tension measurement is monitored to detect a possible line break furthermore a compensation mechanism is developed in strand et al 1998b so that in case of line break detection a feed forward thrust in surge and sway and a feed forward momentum in yaw are applied to compensate for the lost tension due to line break and to alleviate the load increase in the remaining mooring lines in order to reduce the possibility of mooring line breakage in harsh environmental conditions a setpoint chasing algorithm was introduced in nguyen and sørensen 2009 a structural reliability index for integrity of the mooring lines was proposed in berntsen et al 2004 2006 2009 where a new controller was developed to keep the probability of line failure below an acceptable level a consistency based diagnosis technique was used to develop fault tolerant control of pm systems in nguyen et al 2007a using the methodology developed in blanke 2005 blanke et al 2006 a methodology to detect line breakage and loss of a buoyancy element in mooring lines was developed in fang and blanke 2011 blanke et al 2012 based on a structure graph approach blanke et al 2006 detection of line breakage was studied in ren et al 2015 using a supervisory control framework hespanha 2001 common to all of the above mention methods except for ren et al 2015 is the need for measuring the tension of mooring line forces which makes all these techniques susceptible to measurement noise or sensor failure as a matter of fact not all the mooring lines are equipped with loadcells and even when they are it is frequently reported that loadcells do not work properly and offshore personnel have little confidence in the reported values see gl noble denton 2006 furthermore in the case of abnormal sensor reading for submerged turrets it is laborious to figure out whether it was the line or the sensor that failed a reported mooring line failure incident for an instrumented north sea fpso in gl noble denton 2006 confirms that it took two weeks of data processing of the measured tension from the other lines to conclude that a recorded tension spike was indeed a real failure rather than an instrumentation fault the above circle of ideas motivates us to further develop a model based algorithm to detect any changes in the dynamic behavior of a pm system due to breakage in the mooring lines to this end we use the dynamic model of a pm system and calculate the conditional probabilities of any line break using input and output measurements only we further develop a dynamic hypothesis testing dht algorithm that will be used for failure detection in mooring lines our approach is motivated by the response learning system rls strategy for automatic line failure detection proposed in gl noble denton 2006 in rls by taking into account the expected performance of the system in a measured weather condition its true performance is analyzed to check if it is consistent with the expected performance and if not whether the inconsistency is due to change of system stiffness as a result of line failure as pointed out in gl noble denton 2006 doing so is a fairly complicated procedure that requires further research development and testing however if successful it has the real benefit of being a relatively simple retrofit to existing installations avoiding the need for expensive intervention work such as installing load cells and wiring the main contribution of the current article is the development of a model based supervisor in which by measuring the inputs and outputs of the pm system mooring line failures are detected without the need for measuring the tension forces in mooring lines using load cells to this end a set of hypotheses are built and the conditional probability of each hypothesis is calculated in an iterative manner using the conditional probabilities all hypotheses are tested in parallel at each sampling time to detect any possible line failure furthermore a sufficient condition for distinguishability of any pair of hypotheses is developed in order to validate our proposed algorithm we use a high fidelity nonlinear pm simulator to run a series of numerical simulations that illustrate the efficacy of the techniques proposed the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 proposes a representative dynamic model of a pm system section 3 describes the computation of the conditional probabilities of line breakage a key step in the proposed dht algorithm section 4 derives sufficient conditions for distinguishability of any pair of hypotheses the results of numerical monte carlo simulations with stochastic signals carried out in the marine cybernetics simulator aimed at illustrating the performance of the proposed line breakage detection algorithm are presented in section 5 conclusions and suggestions for future research are summarized in section 6 2 control plant model of the pm systems in this section we start by introducing the vessel model described in hassani and pascoal 2015 the model admits the realization 1 1 we would like to highlight the difference between the dynamic model 1 7 in particular 2 and the ones presented in fossen and strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 sørensen 2011a the evolution of the wave frequency components of the motion in 2 are modeled as a 2nd order linear time invariant lti system derived with gaussian white noise in body frame while in fossen and strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 sørensen 2011a the wave frequency components of the motion are modeled in earth fixed frame from a physical point of view it is obvious that the wave frequency motions depend on the angle between the heading of the vessel and the direction of the wave assuming stationary waves one can assume that a linear approximation can be used to described wave induced motions in the body frame for further details the reader is referred to

gaussian white measurement noise in general a mooring system consists of a number of mooring lines that connect the vessel directly or through a turret to an anchor on the sea floor the lines are composed of synthetic fiber rope wire and chain or a combination of the three the generalized mooring force of a spread mooring system projected in horizontal plane can be written as 8 τ m r t ψ t o t

mooring line characteristics the reader is referred to aamo and fossen 2000 he et al 2014 and also to dedicated software programs for marine slender structures such as riflex fylling et al 2011 linearizing the generalized mooring force τ m one can model the mooring line effects as extra damping and restoring terms in the system in the form of 2 2 see strand et al 1998b for details on the

assumptions that are commonly adopted in the literature see strand 1999 strand and fossen 1999 2000 loria et al 2000 torsetnes et al 2004 assumption 1 the position and heading sensor noise are neglected that is n 0 since the measurement error induced by measurement noise is negligible compared to the wave induced motion assumption 2 the amplitude of the wave induced yaw motion ψ ω is assumed to be small that is less than 2 3 during normal operation of the vessel and less than 5 in extreme weather conditions hence r ψ l r ψ l ψ w from assumption 1 it follows that r ψ l r ψ y where ψ y ψ l ψ w denotes the measured heading assumption 3 the time derivative of the total heading ψ t o t is small and close to zero low speed assumption we will also exploit the model property that the bias time constants in the x and y directions are equal i e t x t y we adopt a new set of coordinates referred to as vessel parallel coordinates introduced in fossen 2011 sørensen 2011a and fossen and perez 2009a vessel parallel coordinates are defined in a reference frame fixed to the vessel with axes parallel to the earth fixed frame vector η l p ℝ 3 consists of the low frequency position x l p y l p and low frequency heading ψ l p of the vessel expressed in body coordinates defined as 17 η l p r t ψ t o t η l computing the derivative of the above equation with respect to time yields 18 η l p r t ψ t o t η l r t ψ t o t η l r t ψ t o t r ψ t o t η l p r t ψ t o t r ψ l ν using a taylor series to expand r t ψ t o t about ψ l and neglecting the terms of order higher than two it follows that 19 r t ψ t o t r ψ l i ψ w s where s 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 using simple algebra we obtain 20 r t ψ t o t r ψ t o t ψ t o t s from 18 19 and 20 we conclude that 21 η l p ψ t o t s η l p ν ψ w s ν we now study the time evolution of the slowly varying bias forces b expressed in the vessel parallel coordinates b p as follows 22 b p r t ψ t o t b clearly 23 b r ψ t o t b p and differentiating both sides yields 24 b r ψ t o t b p r ψ t o t b p recalling 12 23 and 24 we now have 25 r ψ t o t b p r ψ t o t b p t 1 r ψ t o t b p e b w b reordering 25 and multiplying both sides by r t ψ t o t gives 26 b p r t ψ t o t t 1 r ψ t o t b p r t ψ t o t r ψ t o t b p r t ψ t o t e b w b using the assumption that t x t y it can be shown that r t ψ t o t t t r t ψ t o t simple algebra also shows that r t ψ t o

filtering in dynamic positioning since the controller regulates the heading of the vessel the designer can assign a new intensity to w b f however assigning the intensity of the noise in practice requires sound engineering judgement 3 dynamic hypothesis testing before starting our discussion on dht we represent the equations describing the kinematics and the dynamics of the pm system in the following standard form for multiple input multiple output mimo systems 39a x t a x t b u t l w t 39b y t c x t n t where x t ξ ω t t b p t t η l p t t ν t t t ℝ 15 denotes the state of the system u t

o o o o c c ω o i o where o and i are the null and identity matrices respectively of appropriate dimensions vectors w t and v t are zero mean white gaussian signals mutually independent with intensities e w t w t τ q δ t τ and e v t v t τ r δ t τ the initial condition x 0 of 39 is a gaussian random vector with mean and covariance given by e x 0 0 and e x 0 x t 0 σ 0 respectively before taking the discussion a stage further let us emphasis that the matrix a depends on d m o and g m o any mooring line break will change d m o and g m o which in turns leads to a change in matrix a this being being said one should expect that any changes in the configuration of mooring lines such as mooring line breakage or change of pre tension in mooring lines will change the dynamic behavior of the pm systems through changes in matrix a in what follows without loss of generality we consider the case of only single line failure 4 4 the extension of the algorithm to cover any combination of mooring line failure is straightforward let us assume the pm system consists of n 1 mooring lines hence the a matrix can take one of n possible configurations n 1 possible line break configuration plus one configuration without any fault we can now reformulate the problem by postulating n hypotheses ℋ i i 1 2 n among which only one is true let z t u t y t denote the time history of the observed input and output where y t y 1 y 2 y t and u t u 1 u 2 u t we define formally ℋ as the dht random variable which takes the value ℋ ℋ i on the event that the hypothesis ℋ i is true let us further assume that probabilities of any hypotheses being true at t 0 are equal i e p r ℋ ℋ i 1 n for i 1 2 n in what follows we establish an algorithm to calculate in real time the conditional probability of each hypothesis based on the observation vector i e 41 h i t p r ℋ ℋ i z t i 1 2 n intuitively as more measurement are available one should be able to compute conditional hypothesis probabilities h i t with more accuracy which in turn leads to more certainty in the choice of the true hypothesis to calculate the conditional probability of each hypothesis in an iterative manner we take a bayesian approach such that at any sampling time instant by relying on our current belief about all the hypotheses we only study the information hidden in the most recent measurement to this end by using bayes rule it follows that 42 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 z t p r z t 1 z t or equivalently 43 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t p r z t 1 z t p r z t p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t 1 z t where z t 1 u t 1 y t 1 is the most recent measurement of input and output applying the conditional probability theorem to the numerator of 43 yields 44 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t 1 z t furthermore applying the total probability theorem to the denominator of 44 yields 45 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t ℋ p r z t 1 z t ℋ p r ℋ z t d ℋ where ℋ is the sample space of the random variable ℋ and since ℋ represents a finite set of variable i e ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n equation 45 reduces to 46 p r h h i z t 1 p r z t 1 h h i z t p r h h i z t k 1 n p r z t 1 z t h h k p r h h k z t furthermore since the control action is a deterministic signal and known to us equation 46 can be simplified as 47 h i t 1 p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t k 1 n p r y t 1 z t ℋ ℋ k h k t h i t before continuing our discussion on the computation of the conditional probability of each hypothesis we highlight an important property of 47 notice that the the proposed dht algorithm relies on its current credence to adaptively settle on the most factual action by exploiting the information coded in the most recent measurement the iterative nature of 47 allows us to calculate at each sampling time the conditional probability of each hypothesis based only on the most recent measurement and our current credence about each hypothesis i e conditional probability of the hypothesis at previous sampling time going back to 47 to evaluate h i t 1 one needs to compute p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t for i 1 2 n given the linearity of system 39 and the fact that the disturbance and measurement noise are gaussian it is straightforward to conclude that the probability density function p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t for i 1 2 n is gaussian and it suffice to find its mean and covariance to evaluate the corresponding distribution furthermore these quantities mean and covariance matrix can be iteratively calculated by a kalman filter incorporating the assumption that ℋ ℋ i see anderson and moore 1979 5 5 for simplicity in presentation of the results we have used the formulation for a steady state kalman filter however the results are valid for time varying kalman filter 48a x ˆ ℋ i

observation history z t assuming ℋ ℋ i or simply x ˆ ℋ i t 1 e x t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t where e denotes expected value operator vector y ℋ i t denotes the innovation vector or one step error in predicting the output measurement vector and y ˆ ℋ i t denotes the estimation of the output vector y t based on the observation history z t 1 assuming ℋ ℋ i or simply y ˆ ℋ i t e y t ℋ ℋ i z t 1 the kalman filter gain is denoted by k ℋ i and the one step error covariance matrix in estimating the states denoted by σ ℋ i is the solution of the discrete riccati equation 49 0 σ h i a h i σ h i a h i t l q l t a h i t σ h i c t c σ h i c t r 1 c σ h i a h i we assume that a ℋ i l and a ℋ i c for i 1 n are controllable and observable respectively it is straightforward to verify that the covariance of the output estimation vector is given by 50 s ℋ i c σ ℋ i c t r from which by using the gaussian distribution for p r y t 1 z t ℋ ℋ i the conditional probability of each hypothesis in 47 reduces to 51 h i t 1 e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ i k 1 n h k t e 1 2 y ℋ k t t 1 s ℋ k 1 y ℋ k t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ k h i t at this stage we would like to highlight that in order to calculate the conditional probabilities of all the hypothesis in an iterative manner we need to run n kalman filters in parallel each kalman filter incorporates one of the n hypotheses this means that n kalman filters are designed using 39 for n different realization of the a matrix n 1 possible line break configurations plus one configuration without any fault having calculated the probability that each hypothesis is true one can setup an automatic alarm system which follows the evolution of the conditional probabilities and triggers proper alarm and inspection procedures as soon as a faulty condition is identified in what follows we conclude this section by proving that the space of n hypotheses forms a finite probability space theorem 1 suppose that the initial conditions h i 0 satisfy h i 0 0 1 and i 1 n h i 0 1 then for every t 0 the sample space ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n together with the function p ℋ ℝ where at time t the function p is defined as p ℋ i h i t forms a finite probability space proof we need to show that ℋ ℋ p ℋ 0 and ℋ ℋ p ℋ 1 defining p s u m t i 1 n h i t and computing its time evolution using 51 yields p s u m t 1 i 1 n e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ i k 1 n h k t e 1 2 y ℋ k t t 1 s ℋ k 1 y ℋ k t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ k h i t i 1 n h i t e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ i k 1 n h k t e 1 2 y ℋ k t t 1 s ℋ k 1 y ℋ k t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ k 1 therefore if p s u m 0 1 then p s u m t 1 t 0 we now show that if h i 0 0 then h i t 0 t 0 from 51 if h i 0 0 then it follows immediately that h i t will be always positive 4 distinguishability of hypotheses in this section we study under what conditions any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable from each other more specifically we examine the necessary condition under which the conditional probabilities of the true hypothesis converge to one the following theorem provides conditions for convergence of the conditional probability of the true hypothesis to one theorem 2 let ℋ i be the true hypothesis and let ℋ i ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n ℋ i be the set of all remaining hypothesis except ℋ i suppose that there exist positive constants n 1 t 1 and ε such that for all t t 1 n n 1 and ℋ j ℋ i the following condition holds 52 1 n τ t t n 1 1 2 y ℋ i t τ s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i τ 1 2 ln s ℋ j ε 1 n τ t t n 1 1 2 y ℋ j t τ s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j τ 1 2 ln s ℋ j then the conditional probability of the true hypothesis i e of h i t governed by 51 converges to one as t proof we define l i j t p r ℋ ℋ j z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t h j t h i t ℋ j ℋ i using 51 we obtain l i j t 1 e 1 2 y ℋ j t t 1 s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j t 1 s ℋ j e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 s ℋ i l i j t from which it follows that 53 l i j t n τ t t n 1 e 1 2 y ℋ j t τ 1 s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j τ 1 s ℋ j e 1 2 y ℋ i t τ 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i τ 1 s ℋ i l i j t taking logarithms of both sides yields 54 ln l i j t n l i j t τ t t n 1 ln e 1 2 y h j t τ 1 s h j 1 y h j τ 1 s h j τ t t n 1 ln e 1 2 y h i t τ 1 s h i 1 y h i τ 1 s h i τ t t n 1 1 2 y h j t τ 1 s h j 1 y h j τ 1 n 2 ln s h j τ t t n 1 1 2 y h i t τ 1 s h i 1 y h i τ 1 n 2 ln s h i for t t 1 and n n 1 by applying condition 52 we can conclude that there exists a positive ε such that 55 ln l i j t n l i j t n ε or equivalently 56 l i j t n e n ε l i j t from which it follows that l i j t p r ℋ ℋ j z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t converges to zero for all ℋ j ℋ i as n since the sample space ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n together with the defined probability function in theorem 1 form a finite probability space it is now straightforward to conclude that p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 and p r ℋ ℋ j z t 0 ℋ j ℋ i theorem 2 shows that as long as condition 52 holds any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable from each other and for sufficiently large n number of collected measurements the true hypothesis will be selected furthermore for linear time invariant lti systems and hence the pm system described in 39 the defined distinguishability condition can be verified in advance and off line 5 numerical simulations the proposed procedure for the detection of mooring line breakage is now evaluated using the marine cybernetics simulator mcsim sørensen et al 2003 perez et al 2005 2006 which was later enhanced to the marine system simulator mss fossen and perez 2009b the mcsim is a modular multi disciplinary simulator based on matlab simulink developed at the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu it includes high fidelity environmental module simulation plants and actuators models and guidance and navigation control modules the environmental section of mcsim contains different wave models surface current models and wind models the vessel dynamics module consists of a wave frequency model and a low frequency model based on the standard 6dof vessel dynamics whose inputs are the environmental loads and the interaction forces from thrusters and the external connected systems the model implemented captures also hydrodynamic effects generalized coriolis and centripetal forces nonlinear damping and current forces and generalized restoring forces the actuation unit of mcsim i e the thruster and shaft module contains thrust allocation routines for non rotating thrusters thruster dynamics and local thruster control the control library contains different controllers namely nonlinear multivariable pid controller for dp numerical simulations for a pm system with four mooring lines see fig 1 were conducted using mcsim in the simulations the vessel is excited by waves wind and currents and mooring lines are exposed to the ocean current disturbances the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 is used to simulate irregular waves we construct the set of hypotheses as ℋ ℋ 0 ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ 3 ℋ 4 where ℋ 0 is the hypothesis that all the mooring lines in the pm system are intact and ℋ 1 ℋ 4 denote the hypotheses of mooring line 1 4 breakage respectively fig 2 presents the results of simulations where the pm system is initially moored using four mooring lines and at t 150 sec line number two breaks the results show that the true hypotheses is identified in a few seconds 6 conclusions and future research this article presented and assessed in simulation the performance of a new algorithm for detection of mooring line breakage in thruster assisted position mooring with no tension measurement based on iterative dynamic hypothesis testing to this end a set of different hypotheses were formulated in which one hypothesis is set up assuming that all mooring lines are intact and the rest of hypotheses are build assuming that a single or multiple line breakages have occurred after deriving a dynamic model of the thruster assisted position mooring system the conditional probabilities of each hypothesis were computed in an iterative manner it was shown that the set of the hypotheses and the calculated conditional probabilities form a finite probability space we also derived a necessary condition under which any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable numerical simulation demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed methodology and confirmed that the method developed holds promise for practical applications application of the method developed to model test experiments is planned in the near future another topic that warrants consideration is that of deriving the conditional probabilities of hypotheses under non gaussian disturbances 
23385,this article proposes a novel methodology for the detection of mooring line breakage in thruster assisted position mooring pm systems when no measurements of the tensions on the mooring lines are available for dynamic positioning dp of marine vessels moored to the seabed via a turret based spread mooring system thrusters provide only complementary assistance to the mooring system which is responsible for generating a large part of the forces and moments required for station keeping however in extreme weather conditions thruster assistance is essential to avoid mooring line failure once a mooring line is parted the remaining lines must withstand an increase in the tension forces required to compensate for the lost tension in the ruptured line this in turn may lead to a cascade breakage of the mooring lines hence it is of paramount importance to detect any line breakage as soon as it occurs to compensate for the lost tension by proper use of dp thruster assistance as a contribution to solving this problem in this paper we propose a methodology that builds on dynamic hypothesis testing dht whereby a set of hypotheses are assessed at each sampling time using the measured inputs and outputs of the thruster assisted position mooring system while the first hypothesis corresponds to the assumption that all mooring lines are intact the remaining hypotheses are built assuming that a single or multiple line breakage events have taken place at each sampling time the inputs and outputs to the system are used to generate the conditional probability of each hypothesis being true the conditional probabilities are then used to evaluate which hypothesis is more probable to be compatible with the collected measurements in addition we find conditions for any pair of hypothesis to be distinguishable numerical simulations carried out using a high fidelity nonlinear pm simulator illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology keywords mooring line breakage fault detection dynamic positioning position mooring dynamic hypothesis testing 1 introduction rising world oil demand with only limited easy to access oil fields is steadily pushing offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation activities to increasingly remote deeper areas under extreme environmental conditions the latter expose offshore vessels and structures used for drilling and production of oil and gas to challenging operational conditions characterized by high winds reaching hurricane force and temperatures dropping below zero in such severe conditions the reliability of offshore vessels and their equipments as well as the efficacy of the corresponding monitoring and control systems are fundamental to the safety and success of the operations some of the commercially attractive alternatives to permanent platforms for offshore oil and gas exploitation are dynamic positioning dp and position mooring pm systems the research and development of thruster assisted position mooring systems follows the rich and by now mature applications of dp systems dp systems have been commercially available since the late 1960s for offshore drilling applications early dp systems were built around pid controllers driven by output measurements that were filtered using a cascade of notch and low pass filters aimed at suppressing thruster wear and tear caused by wave induced motions however since notch filters introduce some phase lag around the crossover frequency phase margin reduction and deterioration of the system performance were inevitable to overcome this problem pid control solutions were replaced by more advanced control techniques based on optimal and linear quadratic gaussian lqg control and kalman filtering theory in balchen et al 1976 further modified and extended in grimble et al 1979 1980 balchen et al 1980 fung and grimble 1983 sælid et al 1983 sørensen et al 1996 fossen et al 1996 and fossen and perez 2009a since the application of lqg techniques to dp systems involves the linearization of the vessel s kinematic and dynamic equations about different operating points and the tuning of design variables such as the covariance of process and sensor noise simpler frameworks were developed using integrator back stepping techniques in aarset et al 1998 fossen and grøvlen 1998 robertsson and johansson 1998 and passive observers and nonlinear multivariate pid controllers in fossen and strand 1999 strand and fossen 1999 strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 fossen 2000 in recent years other techniques such as gain scheduling torsetnes et al 2004 robust control hassani et al 2012a b 2017 adaptive control tannuri et al 2006 hassani et al 2010 2013b and hybrid control nguyen et al 2007b hassani et al 2013b have come to the fore the literature on modeling and simulation of dp systems and the application of different control techniques to the design of dp controllers is vast and defies a simple summary the reader is referred to sørensen 2005 2011b hassani et al 2013a and the references therein for a short presentation of the subject and its historical evolution pm systems have been available since the late 1980s while pm systems are built upon dp systems there are some key differences between the two namely the main function of thruster assistance in pm systems is to keep the heading angle at a desired value and add damping in the surge sway and yaw motions while the mooring lines keep the position of the vessel in a predefined admissible region see strand 1999 this strategy leads to reduced activity of the thrusters in normal environmental condition however in harsh environmental conditions thruster assistance helps keeping the vessel in a predefined tolerable region in order to prevent the mooring lines tensions from rising above safety limits a mathematical model of a thruster assisted mooring system and a mooring line were developed in strand et al 1998b and aamo and fossen 2000 respectively back stepping techniques were applied to pm systems in strand et al 1998a chen et al 2013 in aamo and fossen 1999 a dynamic line tensioning controller was developed to reject constant or slowly varying environmental disturbances and hence reduce the thruster force and consumed fuel in sørensen et al 1999 a nonlinear multivariable controller and a passivity based observer were applied to a floating production storage and offloading fpso unit with pm systems a switching controller algorithm was proposed by nguyen et al 2007b whereby the sea state is identified through power spectral density analysis of the vessel s motion and a suitable controller is automatically selected to increase the operation weather window of the pm system under study the safety of dp and pm systems is of paramount concern in the marine industry and hence regulations are in place to define different levels of system redundancy to prevent faults in equipment from causing accidents at the system level dnv 2014 2015 any failures in mooring lines can cause loss of position keeping capability which in turn can lead to disasters on an unprecedented scale in strand et al 1998b a line break detection and compensation algorithm was coupled with an lqg based controller then any irregular tension measurement is monitored to detect a possible line break furthermore a compensation mechanism is developed in strand et al 1998b so that in case of line break detection a feed forward thrust in surge and sway and a feed forward momentum in yaw are applied to compensate for the lost tension due to line break and to alleviate the load increase in the remaining mooring lines in order to reduce the possibility of mooring line breakage in harsh environmental conditions a setpoint chasing algorithm was introduced in nguyen and sørensen 2009 a structural reliability index for integrity of the mooring lines was proposed in berntsen et al 2004 2006 2009 where a new controller was developed to keep the probability of line failure below an acceptable level a consistency based diagnosis technique was used to develop fault tolerant control of pm systems in nguyen et al 2007a using the methodology developed in blanke 2005 blanke et al 2006 a methodology to detect line breakage and loss of a buoyancy element in mooring lines was developed in fang and blanke 2011 blanke et al 2012 based on a structure graph approach blanke et al 2006 detection of line breakage was studied in ren et al 2015 using a supervisory control framework hespanha 2001 common to all of the above mention methods except for ren et al 2015 is the need for measuring the tension of mooring line forces which makes all these techniques susceptible to measurement noise or sensor failure as a matter of fact not all the mooring lines are equipped with loadcells and even when they are it is frequently reported that loadcells do not work properly and offshore personnel have little confidence in the reported values see gl noble denton 2006 furthermore in the case of abnormal sensor reading for submerged turrets it is laborious to figure out whether it was the line or the sensor that failed a reported mooring line failure incident for an instrumented north sea fpso in gl noble denton 2006 confirms that it took two weeks of data processing of the measured tension from the other lines to conclude that a recorded tension spike was indeed a real failure rather than an instrumentation fault the above circle of ideas motivates us to further develop a model based algorithm to detect any changes in the dynamic behavior of a pm system due to breakage in the mooring lines to this end we use the dynamic model of a pm system and calculate the conditional probabilities of any line break using input and output measurements only we further develop a dynamic hypothesis testing dht algorithm that will be used for failure detection in mooring lines our approach is motivated by the response learning system rls strategy for automatic line failure detection proposed in gl noble denton 2006 in rls by taking into account the expected performance of the system in a measured weather condition its true performance is analyzed to check if it is consistent with the expected performance and if not whether the inconsistency is due to change of system stiffness as a result of line failure as pointed out in gl noble denton 2006 doing so is a fairly complicated procedure that requires further research development and testing however if successful it has the real benefit of being a relatively simple retrofit to existing installations avoiding the need for expensive intervention work such as installing load cells and wiring the main contribution of the current article is the development of a model based supervisor in which by measuring the inputs and outputs of the pm system mooring line failures are detected without the need for measuring the tension forces in mooring lines using load cells to this end a set of hypotheses are built and the conditional probability of each hypothesis is calculated in an iterative manner using the conditional probabilities all hypotheses are tested in parallel at each sampling time to detect any possible line failure furthermore a sufficient condition for distinguishability of any pair of hypotheses is developed in order to validate our proposed algorithm we use a high fidelity nonlinear pm simulator to run a series of numerical simulations that illustrate the efficacy of the techniques proposed the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 proposes a representative dynamic model of a pm system section 3 describes the computation of the conditional probabilities of line breakage a key step in the proposed dht algorithm section 4 derives sufficient conditions for distinguishability of any pair of hypotheses the results of numerical monte carlo simulations with stochastic signals carried out in the marine cybernetics simulator aimed at illustrating the performance of the proposed line breakage detection algorithm are presented in section 5 conclusions and suggestions for future research are summarized in section 6 2 control plant model of the pm systems in this section we start by introducing the vessel model described in hassani and pascoal 2015 the model admits the realization 1 1 we would like to highlight the difference between the dynamic model 1 7 in particular 2 and the ones presented in fossen and strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 sørensen 2011a the evolution of the wave frequency components of the motion in 2 are modeled as a 2nd order linear time invariant lti system derived with gaussian white noise in body frame while in fossen and strand 1999 torsetnes et al 2004 sørensen 2011a the wave frequency components of the motion are modeled in earth fixed frame from a physical point of view it is obvious that the wave frequency motions depend on the angle between the heading of the vessel and the direction of the wave assuming stationary waves one can assume that a linear approximation can be used to described wave induced motions in the body frame for further details the reader is referred to

linearizing the generalized mooring force τ m one can model the mooring line effects as extra damping and restoring terms in the system in the form of 2 2 see strand et al 1998b for details on the

assumptions that are commonly adopted in the literature see strand 1999 strand and fossen 1999 2000 loria et al 2000 torsetnes et al 2004 assumption 1 the position and heading sensor noise are neglected that is n 0 since the measurement error induced by measurement noise is negligible compared to the wave induced motion assumption 2 the amplitude of the wave induced yaw motion ψ ω is assumed to be small that is less than 2 3 during normal operation of the vessel and less than 5 in extreme weather conditions hence r ψ l r ψ l ψ w from assumption 1 it follows that r ψ l r ψ y where ψ y ψ l ψ w denotes the measured heading assumption 3 the time derivative of the total heading ψ t o t is small and close to zero low speed assumption we will also exploit the model property that the bias time constants in the x and y directions are equal i e t x t y we adopt a new set of coordinates referred to as vessel parallel coordinates introduced in fossen 2011 sørensen 2011a and fossen and perez 2009a vessel parallel coordinates are defined in a reference frame fixed to the vessel with axes parallel to the earth fixed frame vector η l p ℝ 3 consists of the low frequency position x l p y

filtering in dynamic positioning since the controller regulates the heading of the vessel the designer can assign a new intensity to w b f however assigning the intensity of the noise in practice requires sound engineering judgement 3 dynamic hypothesis testing before starting our discussion on dht we represent the equations describing the kinematics and the dynamics of the pm system in the

intensities e w t w t τ q δ t τ and e v t v t τ r δ t τ the initial condition x 0 of 39 is a gaussian random vector with mean and covariance given by e x 0 0 and e x 0 x t 0 σ 0 respectively before taking the discussion a stage further let us emphasis that the matrix a depends on d m o and g m o any mooring line break will change d m o and g m o which in turns leads to a change in matrix a this being being said one should expect that any changes in the configuration of mooring lines such as mooring line breakage or change of pre tension in mooring lines will change the dynamic behavior of the pm systems through changes in matrix a in what follows without loss of generality we consider the case of only single line failure 4 4 the extension of the algorithm to cover any combination of mooring line failure is straightforward let us assume the pm system consists of n 1 mooring lines hence the a matrix can take one of n possible configurations n 1 possible line break configuration plus one configuration without any fault we can now reformulate the problem by postulating n hypotheses ℋ i i 1 2 n among which only one is true let z t u t y t denote the time history of the observed input and output where y t y 1 y 2 y t and u t u 1 u 2 u t we define formally ℋ as the dht random variable which takes the value ℋ ℋ i on the event that the hypothesis ℋ i is true let us further assume that probabilities of any hypotheses being true at t 0 are equal i e p r ℋ ℋ i 1 n for i 1 2 n in what follows we establish an algorithm to calculate in real time the conditional probability of each hypothesis based on the observation vector i e 41 h i t p r ℋ ℋ i z t i 1 2 n intuitively as more measurement are available one should be able to compute conditional hypothesis probabilities h i t with more accuracy which in turn leads to more certainty in the choice of the true hypothesis to calculate the conditional probability of each hypothesis in an iterative manner we take a bayesian approach such that at any sampling time instant by relying on our current belief about all the hypotheses we only study the information hidden in the most recent measurement to this end by using bayes rule it follows that 42 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 z t p r z t 1 z t or equivalently 43 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t p r z t 1 z t p r z t p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t 1 z t where z t 1 u t 1 y t 1 is the most recent measurement of input and output applying the conditional probability theorem to the numerator of 43 yields 44 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t p r z t 1 z t furthermore applying the total probability theorem to the denominator of 44 yields 45 p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 p r z t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t ℋ p r z t 1 z t ℋ p r ℋ z t d ℋ where ℋ is the sample space of the random variable ℋ and since ℋ represents a finite set of variable i e ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n equation 45 reduces to 46 p r h h i z t 1 p r z t 1 h h i z t p r h h i z t k 1 n p r z t 1 z t h h k p r h h k z t furthermore since the control action is a deterministic signal and known to us equation 46 can be simplified as 47 h i t 1 p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t k 1 n p r y t 1 z t ℋ ℋ k h k t h i t before continuing our discussion on the computation of the conditional probability of each hypothesis we highlight an important property of 47 notice that the the proposed dht algorithm relies on its current credence to adaptively settle on the most factual action by exploiting the information coded in the most recent measurement the iterative nature of 47 allows us to calculate at each sampling time the conditional probability of each hypothesis based only on the most recent measurement and our current credence about each hypothesis i e conditional probability of the hypothesis at previous sampling time going back to 47 to evaluate h i t 1 one needs to compute p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t for i 1 2 n given the linearity of system 39 and the fact that the disturbance and measurement noise are gaussian it is straightforward to conclude that the probability density function p r y t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t for i 1 2 n is gaussian and it suffice to find its mean and covariance to evaluate the corresponding distribution furthermore these quantities mean and covariance matrix can be iteratively calculated by a kalman filter incorporating the assumption that ℋ ℋ i see anderson and moore 1979 5 5 for simplicity in presentation of the results we have used the formulation for a steady state kalman filter however the results are valid for time varying kalman filter 48a x ˆ ℋ i

observation history z t assuming ℋ ℋ i or simply x ˆ ℋ i t 1 e x t 1 ℋ ℋ i z t where e denotes expected value operator vector y ℋ i t denotes the innovation vector or one step error in predicting the output measurement vector and y ˆ ℋ i t denotes the estimation of the output vector y t based on the observation history z t 1 assuming ℋ ℋ i or simply y ˆ ℋ i t e y t ℋ ℋ i z t 1 the kalman filter gain is denoted by k ℋ i and the one step error covariance matrix in estimating the states denoted by σ ℋ i is the solution of the discrete riccati equation 49 0 σ h i a h i σ h i a h i t l q l t a h i t σ h i c t c σ h i c t r 1 c σ h i a h i we assume that a ℋ i l and a ℋ i c for i 1 n are controllable and observable respectively it is straightforward to verify that the covariance of the output estimation vector is given by 50 s ℋ i c σ ℋ i c t r from which by using the gaussian distribution for p r y t 1 z t ℋ ℋ i the conditional probability of each hypothesis in 47 reduces to 51 h i t 1 e

probabilities of all the hypothesis in an iterative manner we need to run n kalman filters in parallel each kalman filter incorporates one of the n hypotheses this means that n kalman filters are designed using 39 for n different realization of the a matrix n 1 possible line break configurations plus one configuration without any fault having calculated the probability that each hypothesis is true one can setup an automatic alarm system which follows the evolution of the conditional probabilities and triggers proper alarm and inspection procedures as soon as a faulty condition is identified in what follows we conclude this section by proving that the space of n hypotheses forms a finite probability space theorem 1 suppose that the initial conditions h i 0 satisfy h i 0 0 1 and i 1 n h i 0 1 then for every t 0 the sample space ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n together with the function p ℋ ℝ where at time t the function p is defined as p ℋ i h i t forms a finite probability space proof we need to show that ℋ ℋ p ℋ 0 and ℋ ℋ p ℋ 1 defining p s u m t i 1 n h i t and computing its time evolution using 51 yields p s u m t 1 i 1 n e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 2 π 3 s ℋ i k 1 n h k t e 1 2

p s u m t 1 t 0 we now show that if h i 0 0 then h i t 0 t 0 from 51 if h i 0 0 then it follows immediately that h i t will be always positive 4 distinguishability of hypotheses in this section we study under what conditions any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable from each other more specifically we examine the necessary condition under which the conditional probabilities of the true hypothesis converge to one the following theorem provides conditions for convergence of the conditional probability of the true hypothesis to one theorem 2 let ℋ i be the true hypothesis and let ℋ i ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n ℋ i be the set of all remaining hypothesis except ℋ i suppose that there exist positive constants n 1 t 1 and ε such that for all t t 1 n n 1 and ℋ j ℋ i the following condition holds 52 1 n τ t t n 1 1 2 y ℋ i t τ s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i τ 1 2 ln s ℋ j ε 1 n τ t t n 1 1 2 y ℋ j t τ s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j τ 1 2 ln s ℋ j then the conditional probability of the true hypothesis i e of h i t governed by 51 converges to one as t proof we define l i j t p r ℋ ℋ j z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t h j t h i t ℋ j ℋ i using 51 we obtain l i j t 1 e 1 2 y ℋ j t t 1 s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j t 1 s ℋ j e 1 2 y ℋ i t t 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i t 1 s ℋ i l i j t from which it follows that 53 l i j t n τ t t n 1 e 1 2 y ℋ j t τ 1 s ℋ j 1 y ℋ j τ 1 s ℋ j e 1 2 y ℋ i t τ 1 s ℋ i 1 y ℋ i τ 1 s ℋ i l i j t taking logarithms of both sides yields 54 ln l i j t n l i j t τ t t n 1 ln e 1 2 y h j t τ 1 s h j 1 y h j τ 1 s h j τ t t n 1 ln e 1 2 y h i t τ 1 s h i 1 y h i τ 1 s h i τ t t n 1 1 2 y h j t τ 1 s h j 1 y h j τ 1 n 2 ln s h j τ t t n 1 1 2 y h i t τ 1 s h i 1 y h i τ 1 n 2 ln s h i for t t 1 and n n 1 by applying condition 52 we can conclude that there exists a positive ε such that 55 ln l i j t n l i j t n ε or equivalently 56 l i j t n e n ε l i j t from which it follows that l i j t p r ℋ ℋ j z t p r ℋ ℋ i z t converges to zero for all ℋ j ℋ i as n since the sample space ℋ ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ n together with the defined probability function in theorem 1 form a finite probability space it is now straightforward to conclude that p r ℋ ℋ i z t 1 and p r ℋ ℋ j z t 0 ℋ j ℋ i theorem 2 shows that as long as condition 52 holds any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable from each other and for sufficiently large n number of collected measurements the true hypothesis will be selected furthermore for linear time invariant lti systems and hence the pm system described in 39 the defined distinguishability condition can be verified in advance and off line 5 numerical simulations the proposed procedure for the detection of mooring line breakage is now evaluated using the marine cybernetics simulator mcsim sørensen et al 2003 perez et al 2005 2006 which was later enhanced to the marine system simulator mss fossen and perez 2009b the mcsim is a modular multi disciplinary simulator based on matlab simulink developed at the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu it includes high fidelity environmental module simulation plants and actuators models and guidance and navigation control modules the environmental section of mcsim contains different wave models surface current models and wind models the vessel dynamics module consists of a wave frequency model and a low frequency model based on the standard 6dof vessel dynamics whose inputs are the environmental loads and the interaction forces from thrusters and the external connected systems the model implemented captures also hydrodynamic effects generalized coriolis and centripetal forces nonlinear damping and current forces and generalized restoring forces the actuation unit of mcsim i e the thruster and shaft module contains thrust allocation routines for non rotating thrusters thruster dynamics and local thruster control the control library contains different controllers namely nonlinear multivariable pid controller for dp numerical simulations for a pm system with four mooring lines see fig 1 were conducted using mcsim in the simulations the vessel is excited by waves wind and currents and mooring lines are exposed to the ocean current disturbances the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 is used to simulate irregular waves we construct the set of hypotheses as ℋ ℋ 0 ℋ 1 ℋ 2 ℋ 3 ℋ 4 where ℋ 0 is the hypothesis that all the mooring lines in the pm system are intact and ℋ 1 ℋ 4 denote the hypotheses of mooring line 1 4 breakage respectively fig 2 presents the results of simulations where the pm system is initially moored using four mooring lines and at t 150 sec line number two breaks the results show that the true hypotheses is identified in a few seconds 6 conclusions and future research this article presented and assessed in simulation the performance of a new algorithm for detection of mooring line breakage in thruster assisted position mooring with no tension measurement based on iterative dynamic hypothesis testing to this end a set of different hypotheses were formulated in which one hypothesis is set up assuming that all mooring lines are intact and the rest of hypotheses are build assuming that a single or multiple line breakages have occurred after deriving a dynamic model of the thruster assisted position mooring system the conditional probabilities of each hypothesis were computed in an iterative manner it was shown that the set of the hypotheses and the calculated conditional probabilities form a finite probability space we also derived a necessary condition under which any pair of hypotheses are distinguishable numerical simulation demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed methodology and confirmed that the method developed holds promise for practical applications application of the method developed to model test experiments is planned in the near future another topic that warrants consideration is that of deriving the conditional probabilities of hypotheses under non gaussian disturbances 
23386,the need of improving propulsive efficiency continuously encourages the development of energy saving devices the understanding of their underlying principles and the validation of their effectiveness in this work a design by optimization of propeller boss cap fin pbcf devices is carried out using computational fluid dynamics analyses rans equations solved by using the openfoam

the optimization evaluate the influence of alternative configurations and of main geometrical parameters in achieving higher efficiency the use of high fidelity rans calculations allows confirming the decrease of the hub vortex strength the reduction of the net torque and the influence of the additional fins on blades performance as the major contributors to the increase of efficiency results of

emissions and their phased implementation plan with even stricter restrictions within few years represents at the moment the most significant incentive to increase ship energy efficiency if still few years ago the initial investment on the vessel manufacturing was the main cost compared to operational and bunker the highly unpredictable cost of fuels plus the stricter regulations on green house gas emissions now turn the ship fuel consumption as one of the ship owners prime concern with an increased ambition to improve energy efficiency at any level of the design just because shipping is one of the most efficient mode of transportation in the next years a substantial increase of the seaborne travel can easily be expected and the successful development of efficient designs could simultaneously address both environmental regulations and operational costs in a substantially growing market the imo energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operation index eeoi imo

new materials and scantling optimization to maximize net payload hydrodynamic of hull shapes propellers and their mutual interactions or ship operations management i e weather routing and fleet optimization vernengo et al 2016a orlandi et al 2015 coraddu et al 2013 are some of the fields which will be directly or indirectly conditioned by the new regulations similar regulations have driven parallel research efforts concerning design optimization and continued search for even increased efficiency also in sectors other than naval for instance the clean sky program financed within the eu horizon 2020 saw a major investment of european aircraft manufacturers and research institution toward the reduction of co2 emissions of aircrafts to comply with even stricter rules testifying the widespread attention to environmental issues which turn themselves into the major driver of innovation and research from the hydrodynamic point of view and in particular for what regards improvements of the propulsive efficiency significant goals have been achieved the advance in numerical and modelling software makes optimization procedures increasingly popular for the design of highly efficient propellers and allows for the reliable exploitation of unconventional propellers performance mishima and kinnas 1997 bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2016a 2016b and recently vesting et al 2014 2016 proposed design approaches based on optimization in order to maximize the propeller efficiency simultaneously with the reduction of side effects cavitation induced pressure pulses and radiated noise that often are the counterbalance of increased efficiency unconventional geometries like kappel breslin and andersen 1996 andersen and andersen 1987 and clt sánchez caja et al 2006 2012 2014 were moreover developed by using numerically advanced approaches gaggero et al 2016a 2016b sánchez caja et al 2006 and optimization techniques to positively take advantage of tip loading and exploit their higher performance when operating in full scale several european funded projects were devoted to these demands among the others the tripod triple energy savings by use of crp clt and podded propulsion project sánchez caja et al 2013 quereda et al 2012 established some useful guidelines for the reduction of ship emissions the combination of counter rotating tip loaded propellers with the pod concept allowed for multiple outcomes reduction of emissions thanks to tip loaded propellers mounted in the counter rotating energy recovery configuration and higher flexibility of the propulsion system smaller optimum diameter reduction of loading per unit area streamlined hull shapes with noise and vibration attenuation and reduced harmful impact on the environment these solutions however could have an excessive impact for retrofitting and the adoption of energy saving devices esd which installation does not require substantial modifications of hulls and or rudders i e mewis ducts mewis 2009 stator fins pre swirl fins celik et al 2008 results preferable to comply with eeoi requirements in case of already operating ships one of the most popular esd are propeller boss cap fins pbcf they consists in a series of fins which number is generally equal to the number of the propeller blades attached at the boss cap of the hub with a negligible angle of attack their installation by simply replacing the hub cap is cheaper and the simplest exactly as their name imply pbcfs act as post swirl appendages that by reducing the hub vortex increase the propeller efficiency the reduction of the hub vortex i e the drag associated to the suction pressure acting on the hub however is not the only way pbcf acts to improve efficiency also delivering a negative torque to the propeller axis or positively influencing the thrust delivered by the blades at constant absorbed torque are ways through which pbcf allows energy saving the research and development of pbcf were originally carried out by ouchi et al 1988 1989 1990 and by ouchi and tamashima 1989 and since early 1990 more than 3100 pbcf as of april 2016 were installed on vessels all around the world mol techno trade which is the owner of the pbcf patent on the basis of this wide experience claims up to 5 reduction of fuel consumption at the same speed or 2 of boost speed at the same consumption mol 2017 literature results are a bit more scattered the original model scale studies carried out in open water conditions by ouchi showed an increase of efficiency no higher than 2 and also systematic measurements of the efficiency gains in the case of four five and six bladed propeller by nojiri et al 2011 were within 1 and 1 5 also measurements and cfd calculations of model scale efficiency of pbcf applied to different propellers kawamura et al 2012 resulted in slightly smaller increase of efficiency as well as the model tests by hansen et al 2011 results from the parametric study by lim et al 2014 featured this range of improvements achieved also by studying the influence of the converging diverging shape of the hub already assessed by ghassemi et al 2012 again the recent analyses of the influence of design parameters variations for pbcf on hub vortex reduction by seo et al 2016 showed efficiency improvements no higher than 2 depending on the loading configuration of the pbcf itself on the contrary full scale trials collected by the same authors were more in line with the claims by mol techno trade hansen et al 2011 analyzed the gain in efficiency due to pbcf fitted on an aframax tanker reporting a 3 5 and 4 reduction of shaft horsepower in ballast and in load conditions respectively also the full scale surveys by ouchi et al 1989 and nojiri et al 2011 pointed out the higher beneficial effect of pbcf at higher reynolds numbers with average efficiency increases of the order of 5 which suggested the presence of relevant scale effects a different development of the boundary layer the unsteady functioning in self propulsion condition behind the hull or the role of cavitation may explain these differences that recently have been approached numerically kawamura et al 2012 in addition to model scale carried out full scale rans analyses on two propellers fitted with pbcf while mizzi et al 2017 proposed a design approach directly based on full scale rans calculations and design space exploration by optimization in particular kawamura et al 2012 thanks to the comparison with identical model scale analyses highlighted a slight increase of efficiency gain due to full scale reynolds number the numerical analyses allow to identify in both the reduction of the hub drag the reduction of the net torque and the increase of the blade thrust the reasons of the overall increased efficiency despite the slightly increase of blade torque and the presence of the additional drag of pbcf fins mizzi et al 2017 drew similar conclusions the most significant contributions to efficiency come mainly from the increased blade thrust and partially by the reduction of the total torque pbcf fins add and additional drag that is balanced by the reduction of hub drag due to a lowered hub vortex strength in both cases however even the use of full scale calculations was not conclusive mizzi et al 2017 carried out their full scale analyses in unrealistic open water conditions that of course are a simplified assumption which could affect the comparison with sea trials in kawamura et al 2012 instead calculations were performed with non homogeneous radial distribution of velocity to mimic a more realistic functioning of these devices the increase of the reynolds number and the presence of the hull wake positively influenced the effect of the pbcf but the gap with sea trials measurements was still significant if discrepancies in the actual wake distribution interactions with hull and rudder unsteadiness of the functioning or surface roughness still approximately handled by rans calculations may explain these differences it is clear that to properly account for all these phenomena very detailed and computationally heavy calculations definitely not appropriate in any design approach have to be employed on the other hand even on the basis of some model scale systematic numerical and experimental analyses it was clear that the positive influence of pbcfs on efficiency can be magnified by controlling the geometrical characteristics of the fins or as suggested by hsin et al 2009 indirect parameters like distance from propeller blades or installation angle systematic model scale experiments carried out with combined variations of the geometrical configurations seo et al 2016 allowed correlating the increase of efficiency to the pbcf load f i n s p a n f i n c h o r d e f f e c t i v e a n g l e o f a t t a c k optimal configurations were obtained when span chord and pitch angle accurately balanced the increase of drag of the pbcf fins higher in case of high loads with a sufficient reduction of the hub vortex similarly lim et al 2014 analyzed various configurations with particular attention to installation angle chord span ratio and hub shape convergent or divergent concluding that only pitch and chord span ratio have a significant influence on efficiency hsin et al 2009 pointed out that the number of fins should be equal to the number of blades and that their optimal radius should be between 20 and 25 of that of the propeller the measurements by seo et al 2016 instead showed partially opposite trends with respect to previous analyses and calculations kawamura et al 2012 for instance negative torque was distinguishable for almost any of the combination of geometrical parameters analyzed only in heavy loading conditions and was practically ineffective in improving the open water propeller efficiency which resulted higher only thanks to the increase of total thrust the experimental setup adopted was not adequate however to determine which components blades hub or fins mostly contributed to this improvement the usefulness of model scale measurements and analyses in simplified configurations open water rather than self propulsion first of all is consequently still undeniable trends may be evidenced and design guidelines may be identified based on systematic but affordable model scale campaigns hence the usefulness of model scale rans calculations too sometimes as highlighted by the discording results by seo et al 2016 and kawamura et al 2012 high fidelity numerical analyses may complete the understanding of the phenomena behind complex devices whose experimental characterization may results difficult and expensive or can widen the range of the analyses comparing configurations for successive detailed measurements above all however model scale rans analyses could efficiently serve in the design process if the combination of empirical correlations model tests and low fidelity codes had represented a practical design approach of pbcf over the years the need to comply with stricter regulations together with the availability of efficient computational resources encourage the development of more detailed design approaches as in the case of propellers lifting line and lifting surface methods have represented the state of the art in pbcf design ryu et al 2014 integrated the sqcm method ando et al 1995 in a design process based on optimization to identify the optimal pitch and camber distributions of their turbo ring device and the comparison with model scale experiments shows some performance improvements zhian and hanren 1991 proposed design method based on classical vortex theories and cai et al 2013 extended the lifting surface approach to simultaneously deal with the propeller blades and the pbcf fins design by employing nested design loops similar to those adopted by celik and güner 2007 for the design of stator devices kawamura et al 2012 showed indeed that pbcfs influence the propeller by loading the inner sections close to root as a consequence of the decelerated flow i e higher local angles of attack due to the displacement effect of the pbcf fins themselves if a significant contribution to efficiency is provided by the increased delivered thrust of the propeller blades as shown above a procedure that can account also for the influence of the pbcf on the propeller blade design may exploit the best from the combination of the two devices the crucial point in all these design approaches however is the absolute reliability of potential flow based methods in dealing with the specific phenomena underlying the functioning of pbcf the accurate prediction of vortices which is the core of the interaction with the hub or the influence of viscosity which substantially influence the selection of the optimal parameters is possible only thanks to high fidelity rans analyses also experimentally effectively the magnitude of the changes in thrust and torque are of the order of 1 while usual potential flow based design approach have an accuracy level especially for the specific phenomena under investigation generally not sufficient for this type of application in this sense once more model scale calculations are useful a simplified configuration open water and well consolidated numerical schemes without the complexity of roughness treatment or of behind hull self propulsion conditions allows for relatively computationally efficient and accurate calculations using rans which can replace in the preliminary stage the experimental campaigns obviously possible only in model scale and the correspondent correlation studies based on which most part of pbcfs design still relies at best such calculations can directly enter into the design process through optimization strategies the key objective of this work is exactly to develop a design framework for pbcf analogous to those already proposed for conventional and non conventional propellers and hydrofoils as in bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2016a 2016b vernengo et al 2016b or in the case of turbomachinery and airfoils by benini 2004 burguburu and le pape 2003 dumont et al 2011 massaro and benini 2012 based on a parametric description of fins geometry and rans cfd calculations combined together through a genetic type optimization algorithm with the main aim to improve the efficiency gain provided by the esd in addition similarly to experimental campaigns the systematic analysis of the influence of the design parameters possible in a design by optimization further to highlight the optimal configuration for a specific application and propeller will serve to identify correlations and guidelines by exploring more widely than any experiments the entire design space and the interdependence of the parameters two propellers are addressed in the analysis the kp505 five blade propeller of the kcs kriso container ship test case van et al 1998 kim et al 2001 and the e779a four blade propeller designed in late 50 at insean calcagno et al 2003 salvatore et al 2006 for both the test cases verification and validation of openfoam weller et al 1998 openfoam foundation 2017 rans calculations through comparison with available measurements are proposed then the optimization framework is built and the influence of the design parameters is identified the best candidates for the two designs will be finally analyzed and the effectiveness of the design procedure discussed the successful application of rans into the optimization driven design process of pbcfs would represent a prime step towards the application of high fidelity approaches to the optimization of propellers without any particular constraints on delivered thrust necessary instead in the case of propellers thwarting the design and with a rather lightweight parametric description of the geometry that requires the analysis only of few hundreds of candidates to achieve convergence the pbcf design case is the ideal candidate to verify the feasibility the convenience and the robustness of a design approach exclusively based on rans calculations once consolidated it could be successfully extended to the sensibly more complex problem of propeller blades design still mainly addressed with potential flow codes 2 test cases 2 1 the kp505 and the e779a propellers two test cases were selected for the design of pbcfs and for the numerical identification of the correlations between efficiency gain and geometrical characteristics the first is the kp505 five blade propeller of the kriso container ship test case designed by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kim et al 2001 the principal particulars are detailed in table 1 the model scale propeller has a diameter of 0 25 m while the hub radius is equal to 0 0225 m the shape of the hub and in particular its cap has been modified in order to accommodate the pbcf as per fig 1 detailed open water measurements are reported in kim et al 2001 and in seo et al 2016 latter measurements in particular include experiments with a reverse pot reverse propeller open test arrangements i e model propeller located downstream the propeller driving system dynamometer that is necessary to allow the hub vortex to affect the propulsion system the second propeller under investigation is the insean e779a four blade propeller fig 2 it is a fixed pitch right handed propeller originally designed in 1959 blade skew and rake are small and pitch ratio is almost constant along the radius despite an obsolete geometry typical of early 60 designs the propeller still represents a challenging test cases especially for validation of numerical codes and cavitation models in the years the e779a geometry has been used as test case for several benchmarks salvatore et al 2009 vaz et al 2015 and extensive experimental datasets collected at insean are available pereira et al 2004 with the exception of reverse pot measurements thus in this specific case the validation of calculations has been carried out with the usual towing tank configuration section 3 detailed geometrical data are given in salvatore et al 2006 while the main characteristics are summarized in table 2 also in this case the hub of the model scale propeller has been slightly modified to accommodate the propeller boss cap fins 2 2 design parameters for pbcf design the choice of the relevant parameters for pbcf design was somewhat conditioned by the analyses and the campaigns available in literature ouchi and ogura 1988 for instance identified the number of fins the pitch angle the radius the fin inclination and a generic fin shape as the most important parameters for the pbcf design calculations by hsin et al 2009 pointed out that the most effective number of fins equals to the number of propeller blades and that the phase lag between the propeller trailing edge and the pbcf leading edge should be such that the pbcf is placed in the middle of the blades passage on the contrary the measurements by seo et al 2016 while confirming the influence of chord span ratio and pitch angle of the pbcf evidenced a substantial independence of the pbcf efficiency at any loading conditions from the phase lag angle the beneficial effect of the pbcf consists in fact largely in the reduction of the hub vortex funeno 2002 for instance carried out calculations to analyse the flow around boss caps comparing truncated and coned type geometries they showed that the presence of the hub vortex stronger in the case of cone type shapes in addition to be the results of the merging of the vortexes generated at the blades roots by the moving flow and the consequent difference in pressure between face and back sides is affected by the viscous boundary layer and by the differences of tangential velocities around the hub the pbcf disturbs the propeller root vortices and by avoiding their merging reduces the hub drag and increases the propulsive efficiency the ldv measurements by seo et al 2016 exactly shown the appearance of less adverse separated axial vortices in place of the stronger hub vortex as long as the pbcf loading i e a combination of chord length fin span and angle of attack was sufficiently high to block the progress of propeller blade root vortices and demonstrated differently from the work by hsin et al 2009 that their change in angular position as a consequence of phase lag variations of the pbcf did not affect the hub vortex reduction and in turn the gain in efficiency following the relevant and sometimes opposite results collected in literature consequently two sets of parameters were investigated the former concerns the shape of the pbcf fins are assumed to have a rectangular like shape tapered at tip chord at root and span pbcf diameter control the aspect ratio of the fin similarly to a propeller blade the pitch is handled by a four knots b spline curve control points are free to move at fixed radial positions respectively at rpbcf rpbcf equal to 0 2 0 5 0 7 and 1 to change section by section the pbcf angle of attack camber of sectional hydrofoils is instead constant with radius and proportionally scales as the maximum thickness the entire fin the fins of the pbcf are designed to avoid the merging of the blade root vortices and consequently they operate in an opposite way with respect to the propeller only negative values of hydrofoil camber compared to the sign convention usually adopted for propeller blades therefore have been considered in the analyses the latter set of parameters concerns instead the relative position between propeller blades and pbcf on the boss cap the phase lag angle as mentioned above plus the distance between the blades trailing edge and the pbcf leading edge are monitored also the fins inclination through a sort of rake applied to the fins is systematically changed in the analyses the number of fins instead is kept constant and equal to the number of propeller blades in order to exploit during calculations the periodicity of the geometry details of the parameters under investigation are shown in fig 3 allowed range of variations for the two test cases are summarized instead in table 2 for the sake of simplicity parameters are non dimensional with respect to the unmodified propeller diameter 3 numerical modelling 3 1 physics underlining rans equations with the hypotheses of a stationary incompressible constant density fluid the flow can be represented by continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum equations that in a cartesian reference system take the general form of 1 u i x i 0 ρ u j u i x j ρ f i x j p δ i j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j where u i and p are respectively the time averaged component of the velocity vector u and the time averaged pressure f the mean body force field external forces for instance and ρ u i u j the reynolds stress tensor i e the apparent stress owing to the fluctuating velocity field a moving reference frame can be used to exploit the axial periodicity of the solution and to solve a simpler steady problem in place of an unsteady set of equations that would have required adequate temporal resolution and the use of sliding meshes or rotating domains by assuming a fully turbulent flow these equations were discretized using a finite volume method and the sst k ω turbulent model among the rans solvers belonging to the openfoam library weller et al 1998 openfoam foundation 2017 simplefoam was used it solves the governing equation 1 but divided by the fluid density in a segregated form by using the simple algorithm to handle the velocity pressure coupling and applying under relaxation to achieve a steady state solution second for momentum and first for turbulent quantities order accurate schemes were employed to discretize equations with cell centered collocated variables and face based implementation to allow for arbitrary cell shapes 3 2 mesh and sensitivity analysis a verification study and a mesh sensitivity analysis were deemed necessary even if rans calculations have been extensively and successfully validated in literature in the case of propellers due to the relatively small changes in thrust and torque expected by the application of the pbcf therefore the uncertainties related to the grid resolution have to be verified in order to carry out the optimization process with a computational grid capable of sufficiently accurate results but at the same time computationally efficient to allow the entire design process in reasonable calculation times the grid convergence index gci and the richardson extrapolation celik et al 2008 were used as estimators of the discretization error and of the uncertainties related to the computational grid for both the test cases in the absence of a given pbcf configuration with geometry and measurements available in literature both the grid sensitivity analyses and the validation studies proposed in section 3 3 have been carried out for the propellers in open water configuration meshes were setup using the openfoam snappyhexmesh utility on a computational domain that by exploiting the periodic nature of the solution in open water conditions consists in a blade passage only positions of inlet and outlet were selected to avoid any disturbance of boundaries on the solution as shown in fig 4 boundary conditions are detailed in table 3 pbcf when included was treated exactly as the propeller blades the influence of the grid resolution was investigated using a reference computational mesh i e medium avg y 30 and two other meshes one with reduced coarse and one with increased resolution fine the isotropical refinement factor applied to the unrefined cells size i e far from local surface or volume refinements was 2 for both the propellers under investigation the reference hexa dominant mesh consists in about 1 3 million cells per blade coarse and fine setups consist respectively of about 500 k and 3 3 million elements details of the reference mesh in the case of the kp505 propeller are shown in fig 5 non dimensional information on cell sizes and refinements are summarized in table 4 the advance coefficients selected for the design of the pbcfs j 0 728 for kp505 j 0 800 for e779a were used as well for the grid sensitivity study the differences between the results on different meshes and for both the geometries is sufficiently small the numerical uncertainties are negligible especially for the thrust coefficient as well as negligible is the slightly non convergent behaviour observed at different mesh sizes for thrust kp505 and torque e779a the slightly higher differences in the case of torque predictions however do not invalidate the analysis being an uncertainty about 1 5 perfectly acceptable within the assumption of the calculations errors with respect to measurements for both propellers are of the order of 3 5 underestimation for thrust torque is overestimated of about 1 in case of the kp505 and underpredicted 2 for the e779a calculations are however in line with the results collected in literature for these two geometries bugalski and hoffmann 2011 gao et al 2012 for the kp505 vaz et al 2015 for the e779a which show similar trends and differences an additional sensitivity analysis based on the kp505 propeller has been carried out to verify the influence of the boundary layer treatment on computed results the reference medium mesh was characterized by an average non dimensional wall distance of about 30 solved by scalable wall functions by using the same zonal and surface refinement of table 4 two additional meshes with a different prism layers arrangement were arranged one was prepared increasing the first cell height at wall in order to double the averaged non dimensional wall distance and verify the robustness of wall functions this mesh consists in about 1 1 million cells the other by increasing the number of prism layers to reduce the non dimensional wall distance to an average value lower than 5 everywhere on the propeller blades and lower than 1 on the hub was devoted to solve the boundary layer without employing wall functions this latter configuration counts about 3 2 million cells details of meshes are shown in fig 5 while results of the analysis are summarized in fig 6 the improvements achievable with the use of a resolved boundary layer setup seem insufficient to justify the weighting of the simulations and the complexity to arrange a sufficient number of very thin prism layers by using snappyhexmesh compared to the meshes arranged for modelling boundary layer with wall functions indeed it was necessary to switch from the relative prism layers extrusion process usually preferred gaggero and villa 2017 to the absolute prism layer extrusion and to setup an iterative process devote do an one by one addition of layers to maintain prism cells within acceptable quality thresholds and sufficient wall coverage in all cases higher than 85 by solving the boundary layer the underestimation of the thrust decreases to 2 5 but the variations of hub performance are hardly appreciable these results confirm the reasonability of calculations with wall functions which in additions allows for the use of the relative prism layer extrusion processes in order not to excessively stress the automatic mesh generation during the optimization process indeed a total prism layer thickness relative to the undeformed mesh size as in the case of the calculations with y 30 and 60 was preferred to ease the prism layer adding process also in correspondence of highly curved regions this resulted in a variable non dimensional wall distance among the meshes under investigation that could have a certain influence also in the convergence analyses of tables 5 and 6 but that provides the flexibility necessary for the automatic design process in the light of these results the medium mesh with prism layers arranged for an averaged non dimensional distance of 30 was finally selected as an acceptable compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency 3 3 validation of the computational model the validation of the rans calculations is reported in figs 7 and 8 with the medium mesh from the grid sensitivity study the open water propellers performance were calculated for a reasonably wide range of advance coefficient across the selected design points and the calculations were compared to the available measurements in the case of the kp505 propeller reverse pot experiments are available from seo et al 2016 and thus the numerical analyses were carried out exactly with this configuration in the case of the e779a propeller only usual towing tank measurements with the shaft downstream are available for validation purposes consequently calculations were carried out with this arrangement the agreement with measurement is overall satisfactory for both the propellers as already pointed out in the sensitivity study thrust is slightly underestimated while torque especially for the kp505 is slightly overpredicted especially in lightly loaded conditions at the design point the discrepancy of thrust with respect to measurements is of about 3 for both propellers and reach its maximum about 6 close to the zero thrust condition at lower advance the error is negligible less than 1 5 up to j 0 6 and j 0 7 respectively for kp505 and e779a the overestimation of torque is a well known issue of rans calculations as reported in li 2006 but also in this case differences are at most of the order of 2 5 for both the geometries and for almost all the advance coefficients under investigations combined with the errors on thrust the overprediction of torque determines maximum efficiencies underestimated of about 5 the comparative nature of the design based on optimization anyhow should limit the influence of these discrepancies in the selection of the optimal configuration 4 optimization the design by optimization is a rather mature approach while traditional lifting line and or lifting surface design methodologies applied to pbcf define the shape based on simplified assumption circa the geometry a lifting line or a lattice of vortexes over the camber surface and the optimal forces distribution exactly as in the case of propellers optimization opens the design process also to computational tools not specifically dedicated to it the design by optimization indeed can be seen as a reverse trial and error design process by using any of the available flow solvers the optimal geometry the one that satisfies the design constraints and objectives is found by the iterative modification based on their predicted performance of an initial set of candidates the modification of the initial population can be achieved by using different strategies genetic type ones selected for this work exploit the analogy of natural selection and the subsequent generations are created by combining depending on the type of algorithm via crossover and mutation the best characters of each pre computed combinations in any case the design of the optimal configuration is indirect rising from the analysis of hundreds or thousands of different possible configurations among which the better candidates against constraints and objectives may be identified this indirect approach allows the application of potentially any analysis tools for the definition of the performances based on which the identification of the optimal designs will be carried out rans solvers belong to high fidelity approaches the higher the class of course the better is the accuracy and the reliability of the solution at a cost however of increased computational times in the context of the design by optimization that requires the analysis of hundreds thousands of variations computational efficiency is a fundamental parameter for the selection of the most appropriate solver as important as accuracy and reliability of the results even if boundary elements methods had proven accuracy in predicting propeller forces and sheet cavitation close to the design point fine 1992 and have been consequently extensively adopted for propellers design the peculiarities of pbcf make their applicability questionable and rans solvers the minimum compromise among other viscous approaches like des or les for reliable outputs the core of the design consequently consists in an optimization algorithm and a framework to drive and collect data throughout the process the modefrontier esteco 2016 optimization environment has been selected to build the optimization workflow that interacts with the parametric description of the geometry and with computationally efficient rans analyses by the simplefoam solver of the openfoam library to quantify how each pbcf fulfils the constraints and the objectives of the design 4 1 design workflow objective and constraints the design workflow adopted in present work and detailed in fig 9 is rather simple the pbcf geometry is selected as the result of a single objective optimization consisting in the maximization of the total propulsive efficiency throughout which the performance of the entire system blades fins and hub by themselves are monitored too in order to gather data circa the mutual influence and the most important contributors to efficiency as a post processing of the results as highlighted in section 2 2 the number of free parameters is reasonable and a total of 11 quantities are sufficient for a complete description of the fins geometry and position relative to the propeller blades only geometric constraints are included in the analysis most are hard coded directly in the range of variability of the parameters that for both propellers were selected to avoid as much as possible unfeasible configurations only few checks were included to account for particular combinations i e larger chord plus higher pitches and maximum or minimum value of longitudinal translation that could result in fins placed outside the boss cap or crashed into the propeller blades a restrictive choice of parameter ranges to avoid a priori any of these combinations would have excessively limited the possible modifications in case of non critical combinations of parameters the result of the parametric description of the geometry is a stereolithographic representation generated directly by the script which handles the free parameters of the pbcf shape fig 10 that is inherently handled by the snappyhexmesh library the fully scriptable nature of the snappyhexmesh library once parts and surface patches are included always with the same names allows for the automatic generation of the mesh as the one represented in fig 11 which parameters are those identified by the sensitivity analyses of open water propellers performance table 4 the initial population for the genetic evolution consists in 100 candidates selected based on sobol sequencing the initial population has in fact the additional scope to provide a sufficiently accurate exploration of the design space identifying areas of interest and avoiding as much as possible initial concentrations on local minima maxima that could condition the entire evolution of optimal candidates the highest benefits from the exploration phase would be achieved by a full factorial description of the design space fully crossed design that however with 11 free continuous variables would imply an excessive computational effort for the initial population analysis the sobol sequencing on the other hand is an example of a quasi random low discrepancy sequence with respect to random or pseudorandom sequences the random sampling of the design space by sobol algorithms is more uniform avoids repetitions and generates candidates evenly distributed without excessive clustering and providing an accurate overview of the design space and of design trends to be exploited by the subsequent generations for the same reasons a genetic type optimization algorithm has been preferred for the definition of the optimal configuration even if the single objective nature of the analysis could have allowed for simpler and more efficient minimum maximum search algorithms also in this case avoiding local minima with respect to which computationally efficient gradient based methods are more prone to was considered important for the analysis of trends and influence of combinations of parameters genetic algorithms in this sense with the inclusion of a certain randomness in the selection of the characters of the subsequent generations allow more unrestrained analyses and a certain margin against local minima evolution was allowed for eight generations and about 900 different geometries were analyzed using the simplefoam solver with the settings of table 3 with respect to propeller optimization with boundary elements methods bertetta et al 2012 this is a relatively small number of candidates optimal propeller geometries were selected after thousands more often tens of thousands evaluation of alternative configurations but number of parameters constraints and objectives was significantly higher and the computational efficiency of the boundary elements method definitively unattainable with rans and a medium end computational infrastructure the relatively simple nature of the problem and the need of a balance of design times in the light of the application of the optimization process in a real case justify the limitations of the proposed analyses based on which significant results can be extracted anyhow results were automatically post processed by using the embedded libraries of openfoam and calculations run for 500 iterations each which were sufficient to achieve low residuals fig 12 and converged forces each analysis took about 25 min including the generation of the mesh and the post processing on a medium end workstation allowing for the definition of the optimal pbcf in about 15 days of calculations 4 2 pbcf design for the kp505 propeller the results of the optimization for propeller kp505 are summarized in figs 13 and 14 the single objective design allows for a rather simple discussion of the outputs of the design procedure which simply consist in the collection of the total propulsive efficiency of any of the 900 candidates evaluated during the process the effectiveness of the design is undeniable by changing the pbcf parameters solutions asymptotically converge to an optimum that correspond at the advance coefficient selected for the design to an increase of total propulsive efficiency of about 1 this result is well in agreement with the measurements carried out by seo et al 2016 the experimental campaign at a different design point shown that the average efficiency gain achievable by using a pbcf on the boss cap of the kp505 propeller was about 1 5 and that a maximum of 2 of efficiency increase was obtained in the case of lightly loaded configurations by considering the uncertainties of numerical calculations and some differences in the geometrical configuration a different shape of boss cap for instance the outcomes of the optimization activity can be considered satisfactory in addition histories of the free parameters during the optimization process summarized in fig 14 demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure in particular the convergence trends of some of the pbcf free variables reinforce the correlations among parameters observed in figs 17 and 18 showing in any case the possibility to achieve values of efficiency comparable to that of the optimal configuration also with slightly different geometries by analysing the performance of all the geometries tested during the process some correlations and the relative importance of parameters in achieving the efficiency improvements can be discussed data are collected in the charts of figs 15 18 the student t test esteco 2016 is used to estimate the influence and the significance i e the trustworthiness of the devised relationship of the input variables the design parameters on the outputs in this case solely the propeller efficiency by combing the general variance the variance of the population for the output variables when only the upper the lower part of the design space of the input variables is considered the mean values of the outputs in the upper lower part of the design space of the input variables the number of values of the input variables in the upper lower part of the design space essentially the t test provides a measure of the strength of the relationship between the output and the input variables that is summarized in the pie charts of fig 15 global parameters and of fig 16 pitch parameters only and the kind of relationship direct or inverse among inputs and outputs highlighted by the bar chart of the same figure even if the number of elements over which the statistical analysis is carried out is rather limited some observations reinforced by the analyses of figs 17 and 18 circa the influence of the design parameters can be drawn also in the light of the very low values of significance obtained by the t test the lower the significance the higher the trustworthiness of the effects direct or inverse between inputs and outputs the pbcf diameter i e the span of the fins turns to be the most influencing parameter to achieve higher efficiency that is obtained for values at the lower limit of the allowed range of variation with camber and chord it mostly contributes to efficiency the inclination of the fins is almost irrelevant as well as the phase lag and the longitudinal position of the fin even if from fig 18 it is possible to observe a certain predilection for aft most positions maximum efficiency is achieved irrespectively of the angular position in the blade passage but the effectiveness in reducing the hub vortex strength is higher if the pbcf is placed as close as possible to the end of the boss cap the influence of the pbcf pitch is worth of specific comments its influence from the t test seems negligible and also from fig 17 higher values of efficiency seem achievable regardless the average pitch angle of the fins at least in the range 40 55 the experimental campaign by seo et al 2016 similarly shown a very limited influence of the pitch angle of the pbcf on the efficiency gain in the range 35 58 covered by their experimental investigations for instance the change in efficiency was of tenth of percent again with the highest value of efficiency increase in correspondence to lightly i e small pitch pbcf loading conditions instead by looking at the values of the coordinates of the b spline control points that monitor the radial distribution of pitch fig 16 it could be deduced that there is a certain influence of the local angle of attack not deducible by the analysis of the average value the interpretation of results is somehow complicated by the dependence of the pitch distribution from the diameter of the pbcf which is one of the free parameters of the optimization relatively to which the fixed radial positions of the control points defining the pitch are scaled the optimization process overall fosters higher value of pitch at the fin tip balanced by low pitches at midspan and again higher pitches at the root table 7 4 3 pbcf design for the e779a propeller the application of a pbcf to the boss cap of the e779a propeller significantly increase the propulsive efficiency up to a 4 in the case of the optimal configuration the optimization history of fig 19 summarizes this achievement that is basically obtained by the early pbcf configurations tested during optimization process while for the kp505 case the first 100 geometries the initial population that quite uniformly covers the design space are evenly divided between geometries with higher and geometries with lower efficiency with respect to the reference propeller without pbcf showing that a certain care is required to improve the efficiency of a well designed especially for what regards the avoidance of hub vortex propeller for the e779a case only few designs fall below the efficiency of the propeller without pbcf this could mean as expected by the old design of the e779a i e constant radial pitch distribution without any unloading at root and at tip to limit vortical phenomena that almost any shape of the fins is able to reduce enough the strength of the severe hub vortex characterizing this geometry vaz et al 2015 a refined selection of the parameters through the optimization process can further enlarge the gain in efficiency in this case differently from the kp505 an asymptotic convergence does not yet appear to have been reached after the eight genetic evolutions prescribed to the initial populations in optimization process a certain convergence comparable to that observed for the kp505 case is however highlighted in fig 20 for some of the most influencing as from fig 21 design parameters diameter and camber for instance the analysis of the influence of the design parameters on efficiency maybe conditioned also by a non sufficient number of evaluations in addition leads to different considerations figs 21 and 22 with respect to the tendencies evidenced for the previous propeller for e779a a direct effect on efficiency is provided by the pbcf diameter the higher the span of the fins the higher the increase of efficiency as also shown in fig 23 this effect is opposite to what observed for kp505 in that case consistently with the measurements by seo et al 2016 small within a certain lower limit fin chord length and span height were sufficient to prevent the hub vortex generation and the gain in net propulsive thrust and negative pbcf torque determined the increase of efficiency longer chords or higher fins span on the contrary were not useful the prevention of the hub vortex was not sufficient to overwhelm the additional drag associated with large fins for the e779a instead the hub vortex is particularly intense and on the basis of these calculations there is a positive influence of the fins size chord and span as for figs 21 and 23 on the achievable gain of efficiency local pitch variations similarly to the kp505 case are more significant fig 22 than the average pitch in achieving the highest efficiency the phase lag has an inverse influence opposite to that observed for the kp505 design higher efficiencies are achieved by angularly moving the fins on the blade passage towards the suction side of the propeller blade while for the previous geometry the optimal position was close to the pressure side the different number of blades of the two propeller may play a role in the optimal positioning that however has to be as close as possible in this case as in the previous to the boss cap end fig 24 the influence of the fins inclination as already observed in the previous calculations is negligible apparently as well as the average pitch angle of the fins for which however similar considerations to those summarized for the kp505 propeller circa the role of local variations of the angle of attack still hold 5 results and discussion the optimization activities demonstrated the effectiveness of pbcf for the increase of the total propulsive efficiency of the propellers and the need of accurate and customized choices of the geometrical parameters of the fins and of their positioning to get the most from the system in order to have an additional insight into the mechanisms that provide the efficiency increase detailed analyses of the performance at different working conditions and of the wake field of the propellers equipped with the boss cap fins have been carried out both the test cases have been investigated but only one pbcf geometry per propeller the optimal one from the design activity as summarized in table 7 has been considered for the kp505 geometry as already done for the analysis of the influence of the design parameters the results of this additional numerical campaign have been discussed with reference to the measurements carried out by seo et al 2016 in the case of the e779a propeller the validity of the results can be assessed in a comparative way with respect to the numerical outcomes of the kp505 propeller equipped with the pbcf with particular attention to the higher strength of the hub vortex that is the critical point of this rather old design 5 1 kp505 with optimal pbcf the comparison of computed propeller characteristics with and without the optimal pbcf for propeller kp505 is shown in fig 25 the effect of the pbcf and the influence of each element pbcf fins hub and blades on its own possible by the decomposition of forces allowed in the numerical calculations is additionally summarized in fig 27 the presence of the pbcf designed for a given functioning condition allows for an increase of efficiency at any propeller functioning condition that reach 1 5 when the propeller is heavily loaded and the pbcf acts more efficiently to prevent a stronger hub vortex as shown in fig 26 for the design advance coefficient the pressure distribution over the fins is opposite from that of propeller blades the back of the fins has a pressure higher than the reference while the face side is subjected to suction the pbcf generates consequently negative thrust drag and negative torque whose influence on efficiency can be discussed in the light of fig 27 the relative change in thrust torque and efficiency are defined with respect to the propeller performance without the pbcf by decomposing thrust and torque as the sum of the contribution of the blades the hub and the fins of the pbcf also the relative changes of each of these quantities kawamura yet al 2012 can be monitored as a function of the advance coefficient for the thrust coefficient analogously for the torque and the efficiency 2 δ k t k t k t p b c f k t k t where k t p b c f is the total thrust coefficient of the propeller equipped with the pbcf blades hub and fins and k t is the total thrust coefficient of the propeller without the pbcf only blades and hub for the each propulsive component similarly 3 δ k t b l a d e k t k t b l a d e p b c f k t b l a d e k t δ k t h u b k t k t h u b p b c f k t h u b k t δ k t f i n s k t k t f i n s p b c f k t where the subscript blade hub or fins indicates that the quantity in the case with or without the pbcf depending on the superscript is computed only for that element positive values obviously indicate that the presence of the pbcf has a positive effect as indicated in fig 27 the increase of efficiency is due to a combination of increased net thrust and decreased absorbed torque these two terms have almost the same magnitude in correspondence of low advance coefficient and contribute equally 0 75 each to the 1 5 increase of efficiency at higher advance coefficients in particular from maximum efficiency to zero thrust the net increase of thrust is negligible to become a drag for j 0 8 and the increase of efficiency is sustained only by the negative torque provided by the pbcf this behaviour can be better explained by considering the influence of each propulsive element by its own the presence of the pbcf fins dramatically reduces the hub drag by cancelling the hub vortex this is particularly evident in fig 28 where the pressure coefficients over the boss cap with and without the pbcf are compared the large suction observable when the propeller operates without the pbcf is almost disappeared with the inclusion of the fins the hub drag reduction however has a cost represented by the resistance of the fins that as discussed works in an opposite way with respect to the propeller blades up to j 0 75 these two contributions almost cancel each other while for higher advances the drag added by the fins is higher as higher is the negative torque due to the increased angle of attack when the inflow velocity increases of a fin that has an opposite camber with respect to the propeller blades most of the contribution to efficiency is consequently due to the reduction of the total absorbed torque that is sufficient also to overwhelm the increase of torque of the propeller blades in presence of the pbcf the pbcf in fact influence also the blades functioning as evidenced by kawamura et al 2012 and confirmed by these calculations the presence of the pbcf induces a decrease of the axial velocity that turns into higher angles of attack for the blade sections close to the root which consequence is an increase of the blades delivered thrust and absorbed torque the increased thrust is higher than the torque and the net influence on efficiency of the blades functioning in presence of the pbcf is positive axial velocity and vorticity contour of the wake fields near the hub vortex region at three downstream locations x d 0 275 x d 0 350 and x d 0 500 are shown in figs 29 and 30 within the limitation of the computational model for these calculations the fine mesh arrangement with additional local refinements in the wake of the pbcf has been adopted to prevent as much as possible smearing and numerical dissipation the presence of the tip vortex and the contraction of the wake are clearly observed outside the radial region where the pbcf wake evolves the influence of the additional fins is negligible and the computed wakes with or without the device are very similar as experimentally observed by seo et al 2016 close to the boss cap it is possible to observe lower values of axial velocity in the case of the pbcf that can be explained by the negative thrust delivered by the pbcf fins that turns into a decelerating action on the surrounding flow without the pbcf the presence of the hub vortex is pointed out by the negative value of the axial vorticity close to r r 0 when instead the pbcf is installed the average value of vorticity at the shaft centre is higher preventing the pressure decrease due to the intense rotational flow the whole vortical structure changes with the pbcf instead than a single intense vortex separated axial vortices can be clearly observed they are the results of the disturbing effect of the pbcf which prevents their merging in a single detrimental hub vortex 5 2 e779a with optimal pbcf results in the case of the e779a propeller mainly confirm the outcomes of the analysis carried out for the kp505 test case the application of a pbcf as shown in the description of the optimization process determines substantial improvements in the propeller efficiency that with the optimal geometry reaches 4 at the design condition and is even higher for lower advance coefficient as summarized in fig 31 exactly as in the case of the kp505 propeller the efficiency gain is achieved by a combination of increased net thrust and reduced absorbed torque nevertheless the influence of the torque in this case is much important at the design point as shown by the open water diagram and more precisely highlighted by the analysis of the influence of the various contributors to efficiency of fig 32 the total thrust delivered by the propeller is almost constant if not slightly lower at higher advance than that delivered by the propeller without the pbcf the reduction of the hub drag is exactly balanced by drag of the fins in this case the pbcf has fins substantially larger with respect to the previous design in order to prevent a stronger hub vortex whose action on the boss cap is that of the intense suction pressure highlighted by the calculations of fig 33 the consequence is a drag induced by the fins that suddenly increase with the increase of the advance coefficient i e angle of attack nullifying the positive effect on hub drag and the additional thrust provided by the blades subjected to the pbcf influence this result is perfectly in line with the design workflow that has been selected the only objective of the design is the maximization of the propulsive efficiency without any prescriptions or constraints circa the way to achieve this result any combination of δ k t and δ k q is allowed if within the limitation of the numerical method it permits higher values of efficiency and in this particular case the highest efficiency at this design condition was achieved only by torque reduction the analysis of the wake fields aft of the propeller figs 34 and 35 reinforces the conclusions discussed for the kp505 the presence of the fins does not significantly alter the blades wake the propeller tip vortex and the contraction of the propeller wake are unaffected by the presence of the pbcf a region of decelerated flow surrounding the fins confined within the pbcf radius can be observed and may be considered the reason of the increased angle of attack for the propeller blades the height of the fins higher than those of the optimal pbcf for kp505 favours their displacement effect and the influence is clearer than the previous test case the axial velocity again is slower at the core of the vortex when the pbcf is considered due to the drag of the fins that in this case 7 of the propeller thrust is higher than for the kp505 1 5 the velocity recovery far from the boss cap however is fast enough and 0 5 diameters aft the propeller the velocity fields are almost comparable in terms of average magnitude on the surrounding of the shaft centre the vorticity field demonstrate the effectiveness of the pbcf design the presence of the hub vortex identifiable by the negative vorticity at the shaft centre is almost completely prevented by the action of pbcf fins separated vortices are clearer with tip vortices emanating from the fins tip having opposite strength to those from the blades and a net positive vorticity at the shaft that is the evidence of the suppression of the hub vortex 6 conclusions in this paper the reliability and the effectiveness of an automatic design procedure based on rans calculations and optimization algorithms for the design of energy saving devices like propeller boss cap fins has been demonstrated the design workflow consisting in a parametric description of the fins geometry in a fully scriptable mesh generation tool based on the openfoam snappyhexmesh library in the efficient rans solver simplefoam and in an automatic post processing of the data together combined through the modefrontier framework was applied for the design of pbcfs for two test case propellers the kriso kp505 and the insean e779a accurate rans calculations allow for the definition of optimal designs for different case studies and operative conditions after analysing about 900 different pbcf configurations per test case it was possible to identify the geometries providing the maximum open water efficiency increase a 0 9 for the kp505 and a 4 for e779a gain were achieved if the e779a test case can be merely considered an exercise being the old propeller design particularly unrefined for what regards hub vortex avoidance nonetheless it represent an additional proof of the robustness and flexibility of the devised design approach the results for the kp505 propeller are worth of note the outcomes of the optimization and the performance of the optimal pbcf compare well with the systematic model scale measurements carried out even if with a slightly different hub and fins shape for the same propeller as well as with the measurements of the wake which demonstrate the effectiveness of the esd in cancelling the hub vortex the increase in efficiency is slightly underestimated but this difference can be attributed easily to the approximations of rans calculations being these small differences well within the interval of confidence of the method in this sense the comparative nature of the design by optimization should mitigate this aspect being the selection of the optimal configuration based on the relative merits of one geometry with respect to the others rather than on the absolute accuracy of the calculations another compelling aspect that strengthens the effectiveness of the design through optimization is the comparison of the numerical and experimental trends of the geometrical parameters exactly as in the case of the systematic experimental variations of the pbcf geometry numerical calculations show that small values of fins span with longer chords are preferable to ensure higher efficiency as well as the average pitch angle or the phase lag are less effective with respect to the open water efficiency than other design parameters completely different trends especially for what regards the fins span were instead evidenced by the analysis of the optimization history of e779a rather than being an inconsistency of the approach it is a further proof that a particular design or certain guidelines are not optimal for any scenario and that the design by optimization is flexible enough to comply with different functioning conditions and to provide each time a tailored optimal configuration hub vortex mitigation by pbcf turns out to be an important but not the sole contribution to efficiency gains the reduction of the hub drag by the disappearance of the low pressure area behind the boss cap depending on the geometrical configurations of propeller blades of the pbcf and on the functioning conditions is partially balanced by the additional drag of the fins which influence on blades performance is towards a relative increase of thrust higher than the relative increase of torque on the basis of the analyses carried out for these two propellers however in accordance with similar numerical calculations available in literature the increase of efficiency is thus a combination of effects among which the negative torque provided by the fins and the increase of the blades thrust seem prevalent of course there are many issues concerning both analysis and design and in a design by optimization design is strictly correlated with analysis which need to be dealt with the use of rans turned out to be unavoidable to evaluate accurately the merits of a geometry with respect to the others when tiny modifications of the fins were prescribed or to estimate the small viscous drag forces and pressure alterations on the hub instead roughly approximated in any traditional potential flow based design approach that can make the difference between an optimal and a non optimal configuration at the same time the computational efficiency remains a serious bottleneck of the process especially in light of the need for grids even more refined or for heavier numerical schemes to address the small discrepancies still highlighted by the comparison with measurements as evidenced in the case of the design of the pbcf for the kp505 propeller however the initial exploration of the design space gave already an effective improvement of propeller efficiency close to the maximum gain achieved with the optimal geometry in the frame of an industrial application or of day by day designs that step would have been enough in particular if combined with a surrogate model to perform based on the high quality results computed from the initial design of experiments inexpensive tunings of the final design as recently proposed in literature full scale calculations would be definitely necessary to assess the performance of pbcf in a real operative scenario at higher reynolds number the efficiency gain is expected to be even greater and thus close to the improvements measured during sea trials and devise an adequate design by optimization which includes the influence of the unsteady functioning of the propeller in the non homogeneous hull wake the interactions with the hull and the rudder in self propulsion conditions the risk of cavitation and possibly additional constraints and objectives related to the operative profile of the ship of course it will be possible only after adequate numerical methods for the accurate prediction of roughness influence and boundary layer transition will be extensively validated nevertheless even the application of the design by optimization in the easiest case model scale homogeneous inflow provided useful indications for both the specific problem of the pbcf design and for the general applicability of such approach based on viscous calculations to more complex problems the use of the openfoam library thanks to its fully scriptable nature that is also the major bottleneck for non routinely calculations allows for an easy integration with the parametric description of the geometry and with the optimization algorithm in the design workflow despite the use of periodic interfaces that are particularly problematic especially when a solid boundary intersect them none of hundreds of configurations automatically analyzed during the design process failed as a consequence of unfeasible or bad quality meshes and the calculations times on a relatively affordable infrastructure and with a reasonable grid were satisfactory these probably are the most important outcomes of the present analyses for the application to the design of marine propellers of optimization strategies based on rans viscous calculations 
23386,the need of improving propulsive efficiency continuously encourages the development of energy saving devices the understanding of their underlying principles and the validation of their effectiveness in this work a design by optimization of propeller boss cap fin pbcf devices is carried out using computational fluid dynamics analyses rans equations solved by using the openfoam library are applied in an automatic design approach involving a parametric description of the main characteristics of pbcfs and an optimization algorithm the optimization is carried out with multiple

the optimization evaluate the influence of alternative configurations and of main geometrical parameters in achieving higher efficiency the use of high fidelity rans calculations allows confirming the decrease of the hub vortex strength the reduction of the net torque and the influence of the additional fins on blades performance as the major contributors to the increase of efficiency results of detailed analyses of optimal pbcf configurations show model scale increases of efficiency of about 1 which can reach the outstanding value of 4 in the case of a rather unrefined propeller design

emissions and their phased implementation plan with even stricter restrictions within few years represents at the moment the most significant incentive to increase ship energy efficiency if still few years ago the initial investment on the vessel manufacturing was the main cost compared to operational and bunker the highly unpredictable cost of fuels plus the stricter regulations on green house gas emissions now turn the ship fuel consumption as one of the ship owners prime concern with an increased ambition to improve energy efficiency at any level of the design just because shipping is one of the most efficient mode of transportation in the next years a substantial increase of the seaborne travel can easily be expected and the successful development of efficient designs could simultaneously address both environmental regulations and operational costs in a substantially growing market the imo energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operation index eeoi imo

optimization vernengo et al 2016a orlandi et al 2015 coraddu et al 2013 are some of the fields which will be directly or indirectly conditioned by the new regulations similar regulations have driven parallel research efforts concerning design optimization and continued search for even increased efficiency also in sectors other than naval for instance the clean sky program financed within the eu horizon 2020 saw a major investment of european aircraft manufacturers and research institution toward the reduction of co2 emissions of aircrafts to comply with even stricter rules testifying the widespread attention to environmental issues which turn themselves into the major driver of innovation and research from the hydrodynamic point of view and in particular for what regards improvements of the propulsive efficiency significant goals have been achieved the advance in numerical and modelling software makes optimization procedures increasingly popular for the design of highly efficient propellers and allows for the reliable exploitation of unconventional propellers performance mishima and kinnas 1997 bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2016a 2016b and recently vesting et al 2014 2016 proposed design approaches based on optimization in order to maximize the propeller efficiency simultaneously with the reduction of side effects cavitation induced pressure pulses and radiated noise that often are the counterbalance of increased efficiency unconventional geometries like kappel breslin and andersen 1996 andersen and andersen 1987 and clt sánchez caja et al 2006 2012 2014 were moreover developed by using numerically advanced approaches gaggero et al 2016a 2016b sánchez caja et al 2006 and optimization techniques to positively take advantage of tip loading and exploit their higher performance when operating in full scale several european funded projects were devoted to these demands among the others the tripod triple energy savings by use of crp clt and podded propulsion project sánchez caja et al 2013 quereda et al 2012 established some useful guidelines for the reduction of ship emissions the combination of counter rotating tip loaded propellers with the pod concept allowed for multiple outcomes reduction of emissions thanks to tip loaded propellers mounted in the counter rotating energy recovery configuration and higher flexibility of the propulsion system smaller optimum diameter reduction of loading per unit area streamlined hull shapes with noise and vibration attenuation and reduced harmful impact on the environment these solutions however could have an excessive impact for retrofitting and the adoption of energy saving devices esd which installation does not require substantial modifications of hulls and or rudders i e mewis ducts mewis 2009 stator fins pre swirl fins celik et al 2008 results preferable to comply with eeoi requirements in case of already operating ships one of the most popular esd are propeller boss cap fins pbcf they consists in a series of fins which number is generally equal to the number of the propeller blades attached at the boss cap of the hub with a negligible angle of attack their installation by simply replacing the hub cap is cheaper and the simplest exactly as their name imply pbcfs act as post swirl appendages that by reducing the hub vortex increase the propeller efficiency the reduction of the hub vortex i e the drag associated to the suction pressure acting on the hub however is not the only way pbcf acts to improve efficiency also delivering a negative torque to the propeller axis or positively influencing the thrust delivered by the blades at constant absorbed torque are ways through which pbcf allows energy saving the research and development of pbcf were originally carried out by ouchi et al 1988 1989 1990 and by ouchi and tamashima 1989 and since early 1990 more than 3100 pbcf as of april 2016 were installed on vessels all around the world mol techno trade which is the owner of the pbcf patent on the basis of this wide experience claims up to 5 reduction of fuel consumption at the same speed or 2 of boost speed at the same consumption mol 2017 literature results are a bit more scattered the original model scale studies carried out in open water conditions by ouchi showed an increase of efficiency no higher than 2 and also systematic measurements of the efficiency gains in the case of four five and six bladed propeller by nojiri et al 2011 were within 1 and 1 5 also measurements and cfd calculations of model scale efficiency of pbcf applied to different propellers kawamura et al 2012 resulted in slightly smaller increase of efficiency as well as the model tests by hansen et al 2011 results from the parametric study by lim et al 2014 featured this range of improvements achieved also by studying the influence of the converging diverging shape of the hub already assessed by ghassemi et al 2012 again the recent analyses of the influence of design parameters variations for pbcf on hub vortex reduction by seo et al 2016 showed efficiency improvements no higher than 2 depending on the loading configuration of the pbcf itself on the contrary full scale trials collected by the same authors were more in line with the claims by mol techno trade hansen et al 2011 analyzed the gain in efficiency due to pbcf fitted on an aframax tanker reporting a 3 5 and 4 reduction of shaft horsepower in ballast and in load conditions respectively also the full scale surveys by ouchi et al 1989 and nojiri et al 2011 pointed out the higher beneficial effect of pbcf at higher reynolds numbers with average efficiency increases of the order of 5 which suggested the presence of relevant scale effects a different development of the boundary layer the unsteady functioning in self propulsion condition behind the hull or the role of cavitation may explain these differences that recently have been approached numerically kawamura et al 2012 in addition to model scale carried out full scale rans analyses on two propellers fitted with pbcf while mizzi et al 2017 proposed a design approach directly based on full scale rans calculations and design space exploration by optimization in particular kawamura et al 2012 thanks to the comparison with identical model scale analyses highlighted a slight increase of efficiency gain due to full scale reynolds number the numerical analyses allow to identify in both the reduction of the hub drag the reduction of the net torque and the increase of the blade thrust the reasons of the overall increased efficiency despite the slightly increase of blade torque and the presence of the additional drag of pbcf fins mizzi et al 2017 drew similar conclusions the most significant contributions to efficiency come mainly from the increased blade thrust and partially by the reduction of the total torque pbcf fins add and additional drag that is balanced by the reduction of hub drag due to a lowered hub vortex strength in both cases however even the use of full scale calculations was not conclusive mizzi et al 2017 carried out their full scale analyses in unrealistic open water conditions that of course are a simplified assumption which could affect the comparison with sea trials in kawamura et al 2012 instead calculations were performed with non homogeneous radial distribution of velocity to mimic a more realistic functioning of these devices the increase of the reynolds number and the presence of the hull wake positively influenced the effect of the pbcf but the gap with sea trials measurements was still significant if discrepancies in the actual wake distribution interactions with hull and rudder unsteadiness of the functioning or surface roughness still approximately handled by rans calculations may explain these differences it is clear that to properly account for all these phenomena very detailed and computationally heavy calculations definitely not appropriate in any design approach have to be employed on the other hand even on the basis of some model scale systematic numerical and experimental analyses it was clear that the positive influence of pbcfs on efficiency can be magnified by controlling the geometrical characteristics of the fins or as suggested by hsin et al 2009 indirect parameters like distance from propeller blades or installation angle systematic model scale experiments carried out with combined variations of the geometrical configurations seo et al 2016 allowed correlating the increase of efficiency to the pbcf load f i n s p a n f i n c h o r d e f f e c t i v e a n g l e o f a t t a c k optimal configurations were obtained when span chord and pitch angle accurately balanced the increase of drag of the pbcf fins higher in case of high loads with a sufficient reduction of the hub vortex similarly lim et al 2014 analyzed various configurations with particular attention to installation angle chord span ratio and hub shape convergent or divergent concluding that only pitch and chord span ratio have a significant influence on efficiency hsin et al 2009 pointed out that the number of fins should be equal to the number of blades and that their optimal radius should be between 20 and 25 of that of the propeller the measurements by seo et al 2016 instead showed partially opposite trends with respect to previous analyses and calculations kawamura et al 2012 for instance negative torque was distinguishable for almost any of the combination of geometrical parameters analyzed only in heavy loading conditions and was practically ineffective in improving the open water propeller efficiency which resulted higher only thanks to the increase of total thrust the experimental setup adopted was not adequate however to determine which components blades hub or fins mostly contributed to this improvement the usefulness of model scale measurements and analyses in simplified configurations open water rather than self propulsion first of all is consequently still undeniable trends may be evidenced and design guidelines may be identified based on systematic but affordable model scale campaigns hence the usefulness of model scale rans calculations too sometimes as highlighted by the discording results by seo et al 2016 and kawamura et al 2012 high fidelity numerical analyses may complete the understanding of the phenomena behind complex devices whose experimental characterization may results difficult and expensive or can widen the range of the analyses comparing configurations for successive detailed measurements above all however model scale rans analyses could efficiently serve in the design process if the combination of empirical correlations model tests and low fidelity codes had represented a practical design approach of pbcf over the years the need to comply with stricter regulations together with the availability of efficient computational resources encourage the development of more detailed design approaches as in the case of propellers lifting line and lifting surface methods have represented the state of the art in pbcf design ryu et al 2014 integrated the sqcm method ando et al 1995 in a design process based on optimization to identify the optimal pitch and camber distributions of their turbo ring device and the comparison with model scale experiments shows some performance improvements zhian and hanren 1991 proposed design method based on classical vortex theories and cai et al 2013 extended the lifting surface approach to simultaneously deal with the propeller blades and the pbcf fins design by employing nested design loops similar to those adopted by celik and güner 2007 for the design of stator devices kawamura et al 2012 showed indeed that pbcfs influence the propeller by loading the inner sections close to root as a consequence of the decelerated flow i e higher local angles of attack due to the displacement effect of the pbcf fins themselves if a significant contribution to efficiency is provided by the increased delivered thrust of the propeller blades as shown above a procedure that can account also for the influence of the pbcf on the propeller blade design may exploit the best from the combination of the two devices the crucial point in all these design approaches however is the absolute reliability of potential flow based methods in dealing with the specific phenomena underlying the functioning of pbcf the accurate prediction of vortices which is the core of the interaction with the hub or the influence of viscosity which substantially influence the selection of the optimal parameters is possible only thanks to high fidelity rans analyses also experimentally effectively the magnitude of the changes in thrust and torque are of the order of 1 while usual potential flow based design approach have an accuracy level especially for the specific phenomena under investigation generally not sufficient for this type of application in this sense once more model scale calculations are useful a simplified configuration open water and well consolidated numerical schemes without the complexity of roughness treatment or of behind hull self propulsion conditions allows for relatively computationally efficient and accurate calculations using rans which can replace in the preliminary stage the experimental campaigns obviously possible only in model scale and the correspondent correlation studies based on which most part of pbcfs design still relies at best such calculations can directly enter into the design process through optimization strategies the key objective of this work is exactly to develop a design framework for pbcf analogous to those already proposed for conventional and non conventional propellers and hydrofoils as in bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2016a 2016b vernengo et al 2016b or in the case of turbomachinery and airfoils by benini 2004 burguburu and le pape 2003 dumont et al 2011 massaro and benini 2012 based on a parametric description of fins geometry and rans cfd calculations combined together through a genetic type optimization algorithm with the main aim to improve the efficiency gain provided by the esd in addition similarly to experimental campaigns the systematic analysis of the influence of the design parameters possible in a design by optimization further to highlight the optimal configuration for a specific application and propeller will serve to identify correlations and guidelines by exploring more widely than any experiments the entire design space and the interdependence of the parameters two propellers are addressed in the analysis the kp505 five blade propeller of the kcs kriso container ship test case van et al 1998 kim et al 2001 and the e779a four blade propeller designed in late 50 at insean calcagno et al 2003 salvatore et al 2006 for both the test cases verification and validation of openfoam weller et al 1998 openfoam foundation 2017 rans calculations through comparison with available measurements are proposed then the optimization framework is built and the influence of the design parameters is identified the best candidates for the two designs will be finally analyzed and the effectiveness of the design procedure discussed the successful application of rans into the optimization driven design process of pbcfs would represent a prime step towards the application of high fidelity approaches to the optimization of propellers without any particular constraints on delivered thrust necessary instead in the case of propellers thwarting the design and with a rather lightweight parametric description of the geometry that requires the analysis only of few hundreds of candidates to achieve convergence the pbcf design case is the ideal candidate to verify the feasibility the convenience and the robustness of a design approach exclusively based on rans calculations once consolidated it could be successfully extended to the sensibly more complex problem of propeller blades design still mainly addressed with potential flow codes 2 test cases 2 1 the kp505 and the e779a propellers two test cases were selected for the design of pbcfs and for the numerical identification of the correlations between efficiency gain and geometrical characteristics the first is the kp505 five blade propeller of the kriso container ship test case designed by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kim et al 2001 the principal particulars are detailed in table 1 the model scale propeller has a diameter of 0 25 m while the hub radius is equal to 0 0225 m the shape of the hub and in particular its cap has been modified in order to accommodate the pbcf as per fig 1 detailed open water measurements are reported in kim et al 2001 and in seo et al 2016 latter measurements in particular include experiments with a reverse pot reverse propeller open test arrangements i e model propeller located downstream the propeller driving system dynamometer that is necessary to allow the hub vortex to affect the propulsion system the second propeller under investigation is the insean e779a four blade propeller fig 2 it is a fixed pitch right handed propeller originally designed in 1959 blade skew and rake are small and pitch ratio is almost constant along the radius despite an obsolete geometry typical of early 60 designs the propeller still represents a challenging test cases especially for validation of numerical codes and cavitation models in the years the e779a geometry has been used as test case for several benchmarks salvatore et al 2009 vaz et al 2015 and extensive experimental datasets collected at insean are available pereira et al 2004 with the exception of reverse pot measurements thus in this specific case the validation of calculations has been carried out with the usual towing tank configuration section 3 detailed geometrical data are given in salvatore et al 2006 while the main characteristics are summarized in table 2 also in this case the hub of the model scale propeller has been slightly modified to accommodate the propeller boss cap fins 2 2 design parameters for pbcf design the choice of the relevant parameters for pbcf design was somewhat conditioned by the analyses and the campaigns available in literature ouchi and ogura 1988 for instance identified the number of fins the pitch angle the radius the fin inclination and a generic fin shape as the most important parameters for the pbcf design calculations by hsin et al 2009 pointed out that the most effective number of fins equals to the number of propeller blades and that the phase lag between the propeller trailing edge and the pbcf leading edge should be such that the pbcf is placed in the middle of the blades passage on the contrary the measurements by seo et al 2016 while confirming the influence of chord span ratio and pitch angle of the pbcf evidenced a substantial independence of the pbcf efficiency at any loading conditions from the phase lag angle the beneficial effect of the pbcf consists in fact largely in the reduction of the hub vortex funeno 2002 for instance carried out calculations to analyse the flow around boss caps comparing truncated and coned type geometries they showed that the presence of the hub vortex stronger in the case of cone type shapes in addition to be the results of the merging of the vortexes generated at the blades roots by the moving flow and the consequent difference in pressure between face and back sides is affected by the viscous boundary layer and by the differences of tangential velocities around the hub the pbcf disturbs the propeller root vortices and by avoiding their merging reduces the hub drag and increases the propulsive efficiency the ldv measurements by seo et al 2016 exactly shown the appearance of less adverse separated axial vortices in place of the stronger hub vortex as long as the pbcf loading i e a combination of chord length fin span and angle of attack was sufficiently high to block the progress of propeller blade root vortices and demonstrated differently from the work by hsin et al 2009 that their change in angular position as a consequence of phase lag variations of the pbcf did not affect the hub vortex reduction and in turn the gain in efficiency following the relevant and sometimes opposite results collected in literature consequently two sets of parameters were investigated the former concerns the shape of the pbcf fins are assumed to have a rectangular like shape tapered at tip chord at root and span pbcf diameter control the aspect ratio of the fin similarly to a propeller blade the pitch is handled by a four knots b spline curve control points are free to move at fixed radial positions respectively at rpbcf rpbcf equal to 0 2 0 5 0 7 and 1 to change section by section the pbcf angle of attack camber of sectional hydrofoils is instead constant with radius and proportionally scales as the maximum thickness the entire fin the fins of the pbcf are designed to avoid the merging of the blade root vortices and consequently they operate in an opposite way with respect to the propeller only negative values of hydrofoil camber compared to the sign convention usually adopted for propeller blades therefore have been considered in the analyses the latter set of parameters concerns instead the relative position between propeller blades and pbcf on the boss cap the phase lag angle as mentioned above plus the distance between the blades trailing edge and the pbcf leading edge are monitored also the fins inclination through a sort of rake applied to the fins is systematically changed in the analyses the number of fins instead is kept constant and equal to the number of propeller blades in order to exploit during calculations the periodicity of the geometry details of the parameters under investigation are shown in fig 3 allowed range of variations for the two test cases are summarized instead in table 2 for the sake of simplicity parameters are non dimensional with respect to the unmodified propeller diameter 3 numerical modelling 3 1 physics underlining rans equations with the hypotheses of a stationary incompressible constant density fluid the flow can be represented by continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum equations that in a cartesian reference system take the general form of 1 u i x i 0 ρ u j u i x j ρ f i x j p δ i j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j where u i and p are respectively the time averaged component of the velocity vector u and the time averaged pressure f the mean body force field external forces for instance and ρ u i u j the reynolds stress tensor i e the apparent stress owing to the fluctuating velocity field a moving reference frame can be used to exploit the axial periodicity of the solution and to solve a simpler steady problem in place of an unsteady set of equations that would have required adequate temporal resolution and the use of sliding meshes or rotating domains by assuming a fully turbulent flow these equations were discretized using a finite volume method and the sst k ω turbulent model among the rans solvers belonging to the openfoam library weller et al 1998 openfoam foundation 2017 simplefoam was used it solves the governing equation 1 but divided by the fluid density in a segregated form by using the simple algorithm to handle the velocity pressure coupling and applying under relaxation to achieve a steady state solution second for momentum and first for turbulent quantities order accurate schemes were employed to discretize equations with cell centered collocated variables and face based implementation to allow for arbitrary cell shapes 3 2 mesh and sensitivity analysis a verification study and a mesh sensitivity analysis were deemed necessary even if rans calculations have been extensively and successfully validated in literature in the case of propellers due to the relatively small changes in thrust and torque expected by the application of the pbcf therefore the uncertainties related to the grid resolution have to be verified in order to carry out the optimization process with a computational grid capable of sufficiently accurate results but at the same time computationally efficient to allow the entire design process in reasonable calculation times the grid convergence index gci and the richardson extrapolation celik et al 2008 were used as estimators of the discretization error and of the uncertainties related to the computational grid for both the test cases in the absence of a given pbcf configuration with geometry and measurements available in literature both the grid sensitivity analyses and the validation studies proposed in section 3 3 have been carried out for the propellers in open water configuration meshes were setup using the openfoam snappyhexmesh utility on a computational domain that by exploiting the periodic nature of the solution in open water conditions consists in a blade passage only positions of inlet and outlet were selected to avoid any disturbance of boundaries on the solution as shown in fig 4 boundary conditions are detailed in table 3 pbcf when included was treated exactly as the propeller blades the influence of the grid resolution was investigated using a reference computational mesh i e medium avg y 30 and two other meshes one with reduced coarse and one with increased resolution fine the isotropical refinement factor applied to the unrefined cells size i e far from local surface or volume refinements was 2 for both the propellers under investigation the reference hexa dominant mesh consists in about 1 3 million cells per blade coarse and fine setups consist respectively of about 500 k and 3 3 million elements details of the reference mesh in the case of the kp505 propeller are shown in fig 5 non dimensional information on cell sizes and refinements are summarized in table 4 the advance coefficients selected for the design of the pbcfs j 0 728 for kp505 j 0 800 for e779a were used as well for the grid sensitivity study the differences between the results on different meshes and for both the geometries is sufficiently small the numerical uncertainties are negligible especially for the thrust coefficient as well as negligible is the slightly non convergent behaviour observed at different mesh sizes for thrust kp505 and torque e779a the slightly higher differences in the case of torque predictions however do not invalidate the analysis being an uncertainty about 1 5 perfectly acceptable within the assumption of the calculations errors with respect to measurements for both propellers are of the order of 3 5 underestimation for thrust torque is overestimated of about 1 in case of the kp505 and underpredicted 2 for the e779a calculations are however in line with the results collected in literature for these two geometries bugalski and hoffmann 2011 gao et al 2012 for the kp505 vaz et al 2015 for the e779a which show similar trends and differences an additional sensitivity analysis based on the kp505 propeller has been carried out to verify the influence of the boundary layer treatment on computed results the reference medium mesh was characterized by an average non dimensional wall distance of about 30 solved by scalable wall functions by using the same zonal and surface refinement of table 4 two additional meshes with a different prism layers arrangement were arranged one was prepared increasing the first cell height at wall in order to double the averaged non dimensional wall distance and verify the robustness of wall functions this mesh consists in about 1 1 million cells the other by increasing the number of prism layers to reduce the non dimensional wall distance to an average value lower than 5 everywhere on the propeller blades and lower than 1 on the hub was devoted to solve the boundary layer without employing wall functions this latter configuration counts about 3 2 million cells details of meshes are shown in fig 5 while results of the analysis are summarized in fig 6 the improvements achievable with the use of a resolved boundary layer setup seem insufficient to justify the weighting of the simulations and the complexity to arrange a sufficient number of very thin prism layers by using snappyhexmesh compared to the meshes arranged for modelling boundary layer with wall functions indeed it was necessary to switch from the relative prism layers extrusion process usually preferred gaggero and villa 2017 to the absolute prism layer extrusion and to setup an iterative process devote do an one by one addition of layers to maintain prism cells within acceptable quality thresholds and sufficient wall coverage in all cases higher than 85 by solving the boundary layer the underestimation of the thrust decreases to 2 5 but the variations of hub performance are hardly appreciable these results confirm the reasonability of calculations with wall functions which in additions allows for the use of the relative prism layer extrusion processes in order not to excessively stress the automatic mesh generation during the optimization process indeed a total prism layer thickness relative to the undeformed mesh size as in the case of the calculations with y 30 and 60 was preferred to ease the prism layer adding process also in correspondence of highly curved regions this resulted in a variable non dimensional wall distance among the meshes under investigation that could have a certain influence also in the convergence analyses of tables 5 and 6 but that provides the flexibility necessary for the automatic design process in the light of these results the medium mesh with prism layers arranged for an averaged non dimensional distance of 30 was finally selected as an acceptable compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency 3 3 validation of the computational model the validation of the rans calculations is reported in figs 7 and 8 with the medium mesh from the grid sensitivity study the open water propellers performance were calculated for a reasonably wide range of advance coefficient across the selected design points and the calculations were compared to the available measurements in the case of the kp505 propeller reverse pot experiments are available from seo et al 2016 and thus the numerical analyses were carried out exactly with this configuration in the case of the e779a propeller only usual towing tank measurements with the shaft downstream are available for validation purposes consequently calculations were carried out with this arrangement the agreement with measurement is overall satisfactory for both the propellers as already pointed out in the sensitivity study thrust is slightly underestimated while torque especially for the kp505 is slightly overpredicted especially in lightly loaded conditions at the design point the discrepancy of thrust with respect to measurements is of about 3 for both propellers and reach its maximum about 6 close to the zero thrust condition at lower advance the error is negligible less than 1 5 up to j 0 6 and j 0 7 respectively for kp505 and e779a the overestimation of torque is a well known issue of rans calculations as reported in li 2006 but also in this case differences are at most of the order of 2 5 for both the geometries and for almost all the advance coefficients under investigations combined with the errors on thrust the overprediction of torque determines maximum efficiencies underestimated of about 5 the comparative nature of the design based on optimization anyhow should limit the influence of these discrepancies in the selection of the optimal configuration 4 optimization the design by optimization is a rather mature approach while traditional lifting line and or lifting surface design methodologies applied to pbcf define the shape based on simplified assumption circa the geometry a lifting line or a lattice of vortexes over the camber surface and the optimal forces distribution exactly as in the case of propellers optimization opens the design process also to computational tools not specifically dedicated to it the design by optimization indeed can be seen as a reverse trial and error design process by using any of the available flow solvers the optimal geometry the one that satisfies the design constraints and objectives is found by the iterative modification based on their predicted performance of an initial set of candidates the modification of the initial population can be achieved by using different strategies genetic type ones selected for this work exploit the analogy of natural selection and the subsequent generations are created by combining depending on the type of algorithm via crossover and mutation the best characters of each pre computed combinations in any case the design of the optimal configuration is indirect rising from the analysis of hundreds or thousands of different possible configurations among which the better candidates against constraints and objectives may be identified this indirect approach allows the application of potentially any analysis tools for the definition of the performances based on which the identification of the optimal designs will be carried out rans solvers belong to high fidelity approaches the higher the class of course the better is the accuracy and the reliability of the solution at a cost however of increased computational times in the context of the design by optimization that requires the analysis of hundreds thousands of variations computational efficiency is a fundamental parameter for the selection of the most appropriate solver as important as accuracy and reliability of the results even if boundary elements methods had proven accuracy in predicting propeller forces and sheet cavitation close to the design point fine 1992 and have been consequently extensively adopted for propellers design the peculiarities of pbcf make their applicability questionable and rans solvers the minimum compromise among other viscous approaches like des or les for reliable outputs the core of the design consequently consists in an optimization algorithm and a framework to drive and collect data throughout the process the modefrontier esteco 2016 optimization environment has been selected to build the optimization workflow that interacts with the parametric description of the geometry and with computationally efficient rans analyses by the simplefoam solver of the openfoam library to quantify how each pbcf fulfils the constraints and the objectives of the design 4 1 design workflow objective and constraints the design workflow adopted in present work and detailed in fig 9 is rather simple the pbcf geometry is selected as the result of a single objective optimization consisting in the maximization of the total propulsive efficiency throughout which the performance of the entire system blades fins and hub by themselves are monitored too in order to gather data circa the mutual influence and the most important contributors to efficiency as a post processing of the results as highlighted in section 2 2 the number of free parameters is reasonable and a total of 11 quantities are sufficient for a complete description of the fins geometry and position relative to the propeller blades only geometric constraints are included in the analysis most are hard coded directly in the range of variability of the parameters that for both propellers were selected to avoid as much as possible unfeasible configurations only few checks were included to account for particular combinations i e larger chord plus higher pitches and maximum or minimum value of longitudinal translation that could result in fins placed outside the boss cap or crashed into the propeller blades a restrictive choice of parameter ranges to avoid a priori any of these combinations would have excessively limited the possible modifications in case of non critical combinations of parameters the result of the parametric description of the geometry is a stereolithographic representation generated directly by the script which handles the free parameters of the pbcf shape fig 10 that is inherently handled by the snappyhexmesh library the fully scriptable nature of the snappyhexmesh library once parts and surface patches are included always with the same names allows for the automatic generation of the mesh as the one represented in fig 11 which parameters are those identified by the sensitivity analyses of open water propellers performance table 4 the initial population for the genetic evolution consists in 100 candidates selected based on sobol sequencing the initial population has in fact the additional scope to provide a sufficiently accurate exploration of the design space identifying areas of interest and avoiding as much as possible initial concentrations on local minima maxima that could condition the entire evolution of optimal candidates the highest benefits from the exploration phase would be achieved by a full factorial description of the design space fully crossed design that however with 11 free continuous variables would imply an excessive computational effort for the initial population analysis the sobol sequencing on the other hand is an example of a quasi random low discrepancy sequence with respect to random or pseudorandom sequences the random sampling of the design space by sobol algorithms is more uniform avoids repetitions and generates candidates evenly distributed without excessive clustering and providing an accurate overview of the design space and of design trends to be exploited by the subsequent generations for the same reasons a genetic type optimization algorithm has been preferred for the definition of the optimal configuration even if the single objective nature of the analysis could have allowed for simpler and more efficient minimum maximum search algorithms also in this case avoiding local minima with respect to which computationally efficient gradient based methods are more prone to was considered important for the analysis of trends and influence of combinations of parameters genetic algorithms in this sense with the inclusion of a certain randomness in the selection of the characters of the subsequent generations allow more unrestrained analyses and a certain margin against local minima evolution was allowed for eight generations and about 900 different geometries were analyzed using the simplefoam solver with the settings of table 3 with respect to propeller optimization with boundary elements methods bertetta et al 2012 this is a relatively small number of candidates optimal propeller geometries were selected after thousands more often tens of thousands evaluation of alternative configurations but number of parameters constraints and objectives was significantly higher and the computational efficiency of the boundary elements method definitively unattainable with rans and a medium end computational infrastructure the relatively simple nature of the problem and the need of a balance of design times in the light of the application of the optimization process in a real case justify the limitations of the proposed analyses based on which significant results can be extracted anyhow results were automatically post processed by using the embedded libraries of openfoam and calculations run for 500 iterations each which were sufficient to achieve low residuals fig 12 and converged forces each analysis took about 25 min including the generation of the mesh and the post processing on a medium end workstation allowing for the definition of the optimal pbcf in about 15 days of calculations 4 2 pbcf design for the kp505 propeller the results of the optimization for propeller kp505 are summarized in figs 13 and 14 the single objective design allows for a rather simple discussion of the outputs of the design procedure which simply consist in the collection of the total propulsive efficiency of any of the 900 candidates evaluated during the process the effectiveness of the design is undeniable by changing the pbcf parameters solutions asymptotically converge to an optimum that correspond at the advance coefficient selected for the design to an increase of total propulsive efficiency of about 1 this result is well in agreement with the measurements carried out by seo et al 2016 the experimental campaign at a different design point shown that the average efficiency gain achievable by using a pbcf on the boss cap of the kp505 propeller was about 1 5 and that a maximum of 2 of efficiency increase was obtained in the case of lightly loaded configurations by considering the uncertainties of numerical calculations and some differences in the geometrical configuration a different shape of boss cap for instance the outcomes of the optimization activity can be considered satisfactory in addition histories of the free parameters during the optimization process summarized in fig 14 demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure in particular the convergence trends of some of the pbcf free variables reinforce the correlations among parameters observed in figs 17 and 18 showing in any case the possibility to achieve values of efficiency comparable to that of the optimal configuration also with slightly different geometries by analysing the performance of all the geometries tested during the process some correlations and the relative importance of parameters in achieving the efficiency improvements can be discussed data are collected in the charts of figs 15 18 the student t test esteco 2016 is used to estimate the influence and the significance i e the trustworthiness of the devised relationship of the input variables the design parameters on the outputs in this case solely the propeller efficiency by combing the general variance the variance of the population for the output variables when only the upper the lower part of the design space of the input variables is considered the mean values of the outputs in the upper lower part of the design space of the input variables the number of values of the input variables in the upper lower part of the design space essentially the t test provides a measure of the strength of the relationship between the output and the input variables that is summarized in the pie charts of fig 15 global parameters and of fig 16 pitch parameters only and the kind of relationship direct or inverse among inputs and outputs highlighted by the bar chart of the same figure even if the number of elements over which the statistical analysis is carried out is rather limited some observations reinforced by the analyses of figs 17 and 18 circa the influence of the design parameters can be drawn also in the light of the very low values of significance obtained by the t test the lower the significance the higher the trustworthiness of the effects direct or inverse between inputs and outputs the pbcf diameter i e the span of the fins turns to be the most influencing parameter to achieve higher efficiency that is obtained for values at the lower limit of the allowed range of variation with camber and chord it mostly contributes to efficiency the inclination of the fins is almost irrelevant as well as the phase lag and the longitudinal position of the fin even if from fig 18 it is possible to observe a certain predilection for aft most positions maximum efficiency is achieved irrespectively of the angular position in the blade passage but the effectiveness in reducing the hub vortex strength is higher if the pbcf is placed as close as possible to the end of the boss cap the influence of the pbcf pitch is worth of specific comments its influence from the t test seems negligible and also from fig 17 higher values of efficiency seem achievable regardless the average pitch angle of the fins at least in the range 40 55 the experimental campaign by seo et al 2016 similarly shown a very limited influence of the pitch angle of the pbcf on the efficiency gain in the range 35 58 covered by their experimental investigations for instance the change in efficiency was of tenth of percent again with the highest value of efficiency increase in correspondence to lightly i e small pitch pbcf loading conditions instead by looking at the values of the coordinates of the b spline control points that monitor the radial distribution of pitch fig 16 it could be deduced that there is a certain influence of the local angle of attack not deducible by the analysis of the average value the interpretation of results is somehow complicated by the dependence of the pitch distribution from the diameter of the pbcf which is one of the free parameters of the optimization relatively to which the fixed radial positions of the control points defining the pitch are scaled the optimization process overall fosters higher value of pitch at the fin tip balanced by low pitches at midspan and again higher pitches at the root table 7 4 3 pbcf design for the e779a propeller the application of a pbcf to the boss cap of the e779a propeller significantly increase the propulsive efficiency up to a 4 in the case of the optimal configuration the optimization history of fig 19 summarizes this achievement that is basically obtained by the early pbcf configurations tested during optimization process while for the kp505 case the first 100 geometries the initial population that quite uniformly covers the design space are evenly divided between geometries with higher and geometries with lower efficiency with respect to the reference propeller without pbcf showing that a certain care is required to improve the efficiency of a well designed especially for what regards the avoidance of hub vortex propeller for the e779a case only few designs fall below the efficiency of the propeller without pbcf this could mean as expected by the old design of the e779a i e constant radial pitch distribution without any unloading at root and at tip to limit vortical phenomena that almost any shape of the fins is able to reduce enough the strength of the severe hub vortex characterizing this geometry vaz et al 2015 a refined selection of the parameters through the optimization process can further enlarge the gain in efficiency in this case differently from the kp505 an asymptotic convergence does not yet appear to have been reached after the eight genetic evolutions prescribed to the initial populations in optimization process a certain convergence comparable to that observed for the kp505 case is however highlighted in fig 20 for some of the most influencing as from fig 21 design parameters diameter and camber for instance the analysis of the influence of the design parameters on efficiency maybe conditioned also by a non sufficient number of evaluations in addition leads to different considerations figs 21 and 22 with respect to the tendencies evidenced for the previous propeller for e779a a direct effect on efficiency is provided by the pbcf diameter the higher the span of the fins the higher the increase of efficiency as also shown in fig 23 this effect is opposite to what observed for kp505 in that case consistently with the measurements by seo et al 2016 small within a certain lower limit fin chord length and span height were sufficient to prevent the hub vortex generation and the gain in net propulsive thrust and negative pbcf torque determined the increase of efficiency longer chords or higher fins span on the contrary were not useful the prevention of the hub vortex was not sufficient to overwhelm the additional drag associated with large fins for the e779a instead the hub vortex is particularly intense and on the basis of these calculations there is a positive influence of the fins size chord and span as for figs 21 and 23 on the achievable gain of efficiency local pitch variations similarly to the kp505 case are more significant fig 22 than the average pitch in achieving the highest efficiency the phase lag has an inverse influence opposite to that observed for the kp505 design higher efficiencies are achieved by angularly moving the fins on the blade passage towards the suction side of the propeller blade while for the previous geometry the optimal position was close to the pressure side the different number of blades of the two propeller may play a role in the optimal positioning that however has to be as close as possible in this case as in the previous to the boss cap end fig 24 the influence of the fins inclination as already observed in the previous calculations is negligible apparently as well as the average pitch angle of the fins for which however similar considerations to those summarized for the kp505 propeller circa the role of local variations of the angle of attack still hold 5 results and discussion the optimization activities demonstrated the effectiveness of pbcf for the increase of the total propulsive efficiency of the propellers and the need of accurate and customized choices of the geometrical parameters of the fins and of their positioning to get the most from the system in order to have an additional insight into the mechanisms that provide the efficiency increase detailed analyses of the performance at different working conditions and of the wake field of the propellers equipped with the boss cap fins have been carried out both the test cases have been investigated but only one pbcf geometry per propeller the optimal one from the design activity as summarized in table 7 has been considered for the kp505 geometry as already done for the analysis of the influence of the design parameters the results of this additional numerical campaign have been discussed with reference to the measurements carried out by seo et al 2016 in the case of the e779a propeller the validity of the results can be assessed in a comparative way with respect to the numerical outcomes of the kp505 propeller equipped with the pbcf with particular attention to the higher strength of the hub vortex that is the critical point of this rather old design 5 1 kp505 with optimal pbcf the comparison of computed propeller characteristics with and without the optimal pbcf for propeller kp505 is shown in fig 25 the effect of the pbcf and the influence of each element pbcf fins hub and blades on its own possible by the decomposition of forces allowed in the numerical calculations is additionally summarized in fig 27 the presence of the pbcf designed for a given functioning condition allows for an increase of efficiency at any propeller functioning condition that reach 1 5 when the propeller is heavily loaded and the pbcf acts more efficiently to prevent a stronger hub vortex as shown in fig 26 for the design advance coefficient the pressure distribution over the fins is opposite from that of propeller blades the back of the fins has a pressure higher than the reference while the face side is subjected to suction the pbcf generates consequently negative thrust drag and negative torque whose influence on efficiency can be discussed in the light of fig 27 the relative change in thrust torque and efficiency are defined with respect to the propeller performance without the pbcf by decomposing thrust and torque as the sum of the contribution of the blades the hub and the fins of the pbcf also the relative changes of each of these quantities kawamura yet al 2012 can be monitored as a function of the advance coefficient for the thrust coefficient analogously for the torque and the efficiency 2 δ k t k t k t p b c f k t k t where k t p b c f is the total thrust coefficient of the propeller equipped with the pbcf blades hub and fins and k t is the total thrust coefficient of the propeller without the pbcf only blades and hub for the each propulsive component similarly 3 δ k t b l a d e k t k t b l a d e p b c f k t b l a d e k t δ k t h u b k t k t h u b p b c f k t h u b k t δ k t f i n s k t k t f i n s p b c f k t where the subscript blade hub or fins indicates that the quantity in the case with or without the pbcf depending on the superscript is computed only for that element positive values obviously indicate that the presence of the pbcf has a positive effect as indicated in fig 27 the increase of efficiency is due to a combination of increased net thrust and decreased absorbed torque these two terms have almost the same magnitude in correspondence of low advance coefficient and contribute equally 0 75 each to the 1 5 increase of efficiency at higher advance coefficients in particular from maximum efficiency to zero thrust the net increase of thrust is negligible to become a drag for j 0 8 and the increase of efficiency is sustained only by the negative torque provided by the pbcf this behaviour can be better explained by considering the influence of each propulsive element by its own the presence of the pbcf fins dramatically reduces the hub drag by cancelling the hub vortex this is particularly evident in fig 28 where the pressure coefficients over the boss cap with and without the pbcf are compared the large suction observable when the propeller operates without the pbcf is almost disappeared with the inclusion of the fins the hub drag reduction however has a cost represented by the resistance of the fins that as discussed works in an opposite way with respect to the propeller blades up to j 0 75 these two contributions almost cancel each other while for higher advances the drag added by the fins is higher as higher is the negative torque due to the increased angle of attack when the inflow velocity increases of a fin that has an opposite camber with respect to the propeller blades most of the contribution to efficiency is consequently due to the reduction of the total absorbed torque that is sufficient also to overwhelm the increase of torque of the propeller blades in presence of the pbcf the pbcf in fact influence also the blades functioning as evidenced by kawamura et al 2012 and confirmed by these calculations the presence of the pbcf induces a decrease of the axial velocity that turns into higher angles of attack for the blade sections close to the root which consequence is an increase of the blades delivered thrust and absorbed torque the increased thrust is higher than the torque and the net influence on efficiency of the blades functioning in presence of the pbcf is positive axial velocity and vorticity contour of the wake fields near the hub vortex region at three downstream locations x d 0 275 x d 0 350 and x d 0 500 are shown in figs 29 and 30 within the limitation of the computational model for these calculations the fine mesh arrangement with additional local refinements in the wake of the pbcf has been adopted to prevent as much as possible smearing and numerical dissipation the presence of the tip vortex and the contraction of the wake are clearly observed outside the radial region where the pbcf wake evolves the influence of the additional fins is negligible and the computed wakes with or without the device are very similar as experimentally observed by seo et al 2016 close to the boss cap it is possible to observe lower values of axial velocity in the case of the pbcf that can be explained by the negative thrust delivered by the pbcf fins that turns into a decelerating action on the surrounding flow without the pbcf the presence of the hub vortex is pointed out by the negative value of the axial vorticity close to r r 0 when instead the pbcf is installed the average value of vorticity at the shaft centre is higher preventing the pressure decrease due to the intense rotational flow the whole vortical structure changes with the pbcf instead than a single intense vortex separated axial vortices can be clearly observed they are the results of the disturbing effect of the pbcf which prevents their merging in a single detrimental hub vortex 5 2 e779a with optimal pbcf results in the case of the e779a propeller mainly confirm the outcomes of the analysis carried out for the kp505 test case the application of a pbcf as shown in the description of the optimization process determines substantial improvements in the propeller efficiency that with the optimal geometry reaches 4 at the design condition and is even higher for lower advance coefficient as summarized in fig 31 exactly as in the case of the kp505 propeller the efficiency gain is achieved by a combination of increased net thrust and reduced absorbed torque nevertheless the influence of the torque in this case is much important at the design point as shown by the open water diagram and more precisely highlighted by the analysis of the influence of the various contributors to efficiency of fig 32 the total thrust delivered by the propeller is almost constant if not slightly lower at higher advance than that delivered by the propeller without the pbcf the reduction of the hub drag is exactly balanced by drag of the fins in this case the pbcf has fins substantially larger with respect to the previous design in order to prevent a stronger hub vortex whose action on the boss cap is that of the intense suction pressure highlighted by the calculations of fig 33 the consequence is a drag induced by the fins that suddenly increase with the increase of the advance coefficient i e angle of attack nullifying the positive effect on hub drag and the additional thrust provided by the blades subjected to the pbcf influence this result is perfectly in line with the design workflow that has been selected the only objective of the design is the maximization of the propulsive efficiency without any prescriptions or constraints circa the way to achieve this result any combination of δ k t and δ k q is allowed if within the limitation of the numerical method it permits higher values of efficiency and in this particular case the highest efficiency at this design condition was achieved only by torque reduction the analysis of the wake fields aft of the propeller figs 34 and 35 reinforces the conclusions discussed for the kp505 the presence of the fins does not significantly alter the blades wake the propeller tip vortex and the contraction of the propeller wake are unaffected by the presence of the pbcf a region of decelerated flow surrounding the fins confined within the pbcf radius can be observed and may be considered the reason of the increased angle of attack for the propeller blades the height of the fins higher than those of the optimal pbcf for kp505 favours their displacement effect and the influence is clearer than the previous test case the axial velocity again is slower at the core of the vortex when the pbcf is considered due to the drag of the fins that in this case 7 of the propeller thrust is higher than for the kp505 1 5 the velocity recovery far from the boss cap however is fast enough and 0 5 diameters aft the propeller the velocity fields are almost comparable in terms of average magnitude on the surrounding of the shaft centre the vorticity field demonstrate the effectiveness of the pbcf design the presence of the hub vortex identifiable by the negative vorticity at the shaft centre is almost completely prevented by the action of pbcf fins separated vortices are clearer with tip vortices emanating from the fins tip having opposite strength to those from the blades and a net positive vorticity at the shaft that is the evidence of the suppression of the hub vortex 6 conclusions in this paper the reliability and the effectiveness of an automatic design procedure based on rans calculations and optimization algorithms for the design of energy saving devices like propeller boss cap fins has been demonstrated the design workflow consisting in a parametric description of the fins geometry in a fully scriptable mesh generation tool based on the openfoam snappyhexmesh library in the efficient rans solver simplefoam and in an automatic post processing of the data together combined through the modefrontier framework was applied for the design of pbcfs for two test case propellers the kriso kp505 and the insean e779a accurate rans calculations allow for the definition of optimal designs for different case studies and operative conditions after analysing about 900 different pbcf configurations per test case it was possible to identify the geometries providing the maximum open water efficiency increase a 0 9 for the kp505 and a 4 for e779a gain were achieved if the e779a test case can be merely considered an exercise being the old propeller design particularly unrefined for what regards hub vortex avoidance nonetheless it represent an additional proof of the robustness and flexibility of the devised design approach the results for the kp505 propeller are worth of note the outcomes of the optimization and the performance of the optimal pbcf compare well with the systematic model scale measurements carried out even if with a slightly different hub and fins shape for the same propeller as well as with the measurements of the wake which demonstrate the effectiveness of the esd in cancelling the hub vortex the increase in efficiency is slightly underestimated but this difference can be attributed easily to the approximations of rans calculations being these small differences well within the interval of confidence of the method in this sense the comparative nature of the design by optimization should mitigate this aspect being the selection of the optimal configuration based on the relative merits of one geometry with respect to the others rather than on the absolute accuracy of the calculations another compelling aspect that strengthens the effectiveness of the design through optimization is the comparison of the numerical and experimental trends of the geometrical parameters exactly as in the case of the systematic experimental variations of the pbcf geometry numerical calculations show that small values of fins span with longer chords are preferable to ensure higher efficiency as well as the average pitch angle or the phase lag are less effective with respect to the open water efficiency than other design parameters completely different trends especially for what regards the fins span were instead evidenced by the analysis of the optimization history of e779a rather than being an inconsistency of the approach it is a further proof that a particular design or certain guidelines are not optimal for any scenario and that the design by optimization is flexible enough to comply with different functioning conditions and to provide each time a tailored optimal configuration hub vortex mitigation by pbcf turns out to be an important but not the sole contribution to efficiency gains the reduction of the hub drag by the disappearance of the low pressure area behind the boss cap depending on the geometrical configurations of propeller blades of the pbcf and on the functioning conditions is partially balanced by the additional drag of the fins which influence on blades performance is towards a relative increase of thrust higher than the relative increase of torque on the basis of the analyses carried out for these two propellers however in accordance with similar numerical calculations available in literature the increase of efficiency is thus a combination of effects among which the negative torque provided by the fins and the increase of the blades thrust seem prevalent of course there are many issues concerning both analysis and design and in a design by optimization design is strictly correlated with analysis which need to be dealt with the use of rans turned out to be unavoidable to evaluate accurately the merits of a geometry with respect to the others when tiny modifications of the fins were prescribed or to estimate the small viscous drag forces and pressure alterations on the hub instead roughly approximated in any traditional potential flow based design approach that can make the difference between an optimal and a non optimal configuration at the same time the computational efficiency remains a serious bottleneck of the process especially in light of the need for grids even more refined or for heavier numerical schemes to address the small discrepancies still highlighted by the comparison with measurements as evidenced in the case of the design of the pbcf for the kp505 propeller however the initial exploration of the design space gave already an effective improvement of propeller efficiency close to the maximum gain achieved with the optimal geometry in the frame of an industrial application or of day by day designs that step would have been enough in particular if combined with a surrogate model to perform based on the high quality results computed from the initial design of experiments inexpensive tunings of the final design as recently proposed in literature full scale calculations would be definitely necessary to assess the performance of pbcf in a real operative scenario at higher reynolds number the efficiency gain is expected to be even greater and thus close to the improvements measured during sea trials and devise an adequate design by optimization which includes the influence of the unsteady functioning of the propeller in the non homogeneous hull wake the interactions with the hull and the rudder in self propulsion conditions the risk of cavitation and possibly additional constraints and objectives related to the operative profile of the ship of course it will be possible only after adequate numerical methods for the accurate prediction of roughness influence and boundary layer transition will be extensively validated nevertheless even the application of the design by optimization in the easiest case model scale homogeneous inflow provided useful indications for both the specific problem of the pbcf design and for the general applicability of such approach based on viscous calculations to more complex problems the use of the openfoam library thanks to its fully scriptable nature that is also the major bottleneck for non routinely calculations allows for an easy integration with the parametric description of the geometry and with the optimization algorithm in the design workflow despite the use of periodic interfaces that are particularly problematic especially when a solid boundary intersect them none of hundreds of configurations automatically analyzed during the design process failed as a consequence of unfeasible or bad quality meshes and the calculations times on a relatively affordable infrastructure and with a reasonable grid were satisfactory these probably are the most important outcomes of the present analyses for the application to the design of marine propellers of optimization strategies based on rans viscous calculations 
23387,computational fluid dynamics cfd that implement finite volume method are offering accurate and precise solutions for ship roll problem in this study the free roll decay of the benchmark dtmb 5415 hull with bilge keels in calm water was numerically solved by applying this type of code contributions of viscosity wave eddy and forward ship speed were separately investigated for ship roll damping and these were integral part of experimental setups numerical results were first validated with experiments additionally mathematical derivations of ship roll response were used where experiments were impractical or inapplicable related literature still lacks a validation procedure therefore a detailed analysis was made for the numerical estimation of roll damping the weaknesses of cfd and the mathematical model were identified and discussed by comparing the obtained results the results indicated that although the numerical simulations successfully captured the decay coefficients these simulations lacked accuracy in calculating the natural roll frequency keywords ship roll dtmb 5512 wave damping viscous damping forward speed effect 1 introduction computational fluid dynamics cfd approach involving the solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse for solving ship motions is a popular method to assess the hydrodynamic performance of ships although potential theory based methods are still widely used viscous effects involving turbulence is excluded from these methods viscosity can only be incorporated if the flow is laminar by using falkner skan equations which can be derived using the navier stokes equations efforts to include turbulent flow effects were inadequate to fully model the characteristics of the flow and therefore were failed to be adopted extensively while the ship roll motions are mainly predicted with decades old methods these are coupled with empirical estimations of viscous forces to reinforce the calculation procedures viscosity has significant effects on roll motion of a ship and all approaches that neglect viscous forces in roll is considered insufficient himeno 1981 estimation model of ikeda ikeda et al 1978 is a fast and practical method to solve the roll damping of ships which heavily relies on empirical data obtained from excessive number of experiments researches of ikeda included viscosity in terms of skin friction damping in addition to the remaining four components namely eddy wave lift and bilge keel damping method proposed by ikeda is still widely adopted by many researchers in this field however his empirical method is ineffective in various cases including shallow draft yildiz et al 2016 such restrictions and shortages in this semi empirical approach led researchers to utilize the fully nonlinear ranse based methods that are flexible to generate results in wider scope an overview regarding ship roll prediction methods is given in falzarano et al 2015 as fvm has reached the current state in last two decades the number of ranse based studies for solving ship roll motion have increased high speed computers led the way for using higher number of elements and enabled implementation of more flexible grid techniques for simulation of ship roll which included the overset or chimera grids overset grids have found wide application opportunities in numerically simulating ship roll among many researchers working in this field such as chen and liu 2002 araki et al 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2016 and begovic et al 2017a b these researchers have implemented this specific type of dynamic mesh system these types are especially beneficial for simulating large ship roll angles ship roll is one of the most poorly understood ship motions as discussed by falzarano et al 2015 therefore this method is appealing to researchers in computational sciences as the numbers of studies regarding computationally approach the ship roll problem has increased there are various experimental studies especially published for providing data for cfd simulations lee et al 2012 and lee et al 2016 have published experimental data to develop better cfd methods ittc have published a guideline for numerical estimation of roll damping for these cfd studies to comply with ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 although previous studies addressed ship roll response for intact condition only roll response in damaged condition is also analyzed in recent studies gao and vassalos 2011 lee et al 2012 begovic et al 2017a b sadat hosseini et al 2016 acanfora and de luca 2016 begovic et al 2017a b this study focused on free roll decay of a benchmark ship dtmb 5415 implementing a ranse based cfd approach numerical solution of roll motion using ranse based cfd is still relatively an unexplored section of ship hydrodynamics although the interest towards numerical simulations have increased recently similar studies are rarely found in the literature in some studies such as irkal et al 2016 reported that there is still a shortage in cfd simulations of free roll decay of ships it is believed that more numerical results are needed to establish a general approach to the problem one of the purposes of this study was to identify the contributions of wave and eddy damping viscous damping and the effect of forward speed on ship roll motion to evaluate the effect of each component inviscid solver as well as the analytical approach was adapted such an approach which only covered viscous and eddy damping only by mirroring the geometry in the water plane and solving it with a double body was previously adopted by jaouen et al 2011 the flexibility of commercial software in this study star ccm was used and the details of the numerical approach were given and explained in the following chapters implementing ranse also contributed to simplify the problem and to obtain faster results roll damping was assessed by making a free roll decay numerical simulation wasserman et al 2016 stated that free roll decay has certain advantages over harmonic excited roll motion technique while roll damping was estimated the authors stated that it is especially beneficial when there is no forward ship speed and damping are small analytical solutions to uncoupled roll motion of ships are mentioned where applicable in this study the analytical solution presented in section 5 as a second order ordinary differential function was adopted for understanding the theoretically mandatory motion of the ship hull under inviscid viscous flow and calm free water surface conditions with zero forward hull speed this approach was selected as a reference to assess the cfd based results although there are certain drawbacks of this evaluation procedure first the analytical solution includes the hull form effects in a very limited manner due to linearized approach secondly the cfd based results are always prone to errors such as numerical errors modeling errors etc thus these results must be evaluated carefully both methods have certain advantages and certain disadvantages thus the limitations of these methods should be discovered to use them effectively 2 geometric and hydrostatic properties of dtmb model 5415 numerical roll decay simulations were made for the dtmb 5512 hull where various experimental and numerical results are available in the literature the dtmb 5512 is a geosim of the full scale dtmb 5415 ship at 1 46 6 model scale the hull contains a sonar dome bilge keels on both sides of the ship and has a transom stern the geometry of dtmb 5512 is shown in fig 1 the propulsion is provided through twin propellers and the ship has twin rudders which are excluded in fig 1 these appendages were excluded in roll decay cfd simulations in this study bilge keel was considered as appendage in numerical simulations effect of bilge keels on roll damping was investigated by many studies in the field such as irvine et al 2013 araki et al 2014 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2014 2016 therefore the bilge keel effect was not separated as a stand alone case the hydrostatic and geometric properties of the dtmb model 5512 including the bilge keel are given in table 1 when values given in the table were considered it is important to note that the origin 0 0 is set where the bow meets the waterline 3 numerical approach 3 1 numerical simulation conditions all the simulations in this study were either uncoupled roll motions or only coupled with the surge motion of the ship surge was included in the numerical simulations to assess the effect of forward speed on ship roll in this respect the numerical simulations either had one degree of freedom 1 dof or 2 dof the fluid domain boundaries and the boundary conditions are given in fig 2 and table 2 respectively domain extents were selected in line with the recommendations of the ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 fig 2 is unscaled 3 2 grid structure hexahedral elements were used to solve the flow around hull for the implemented grid structure the hull was released to roll decay and during the simulations elements in the fluid domain were deformed with respect to the motion this was realized using the morphing grid option available in star ccm software a general view of the elements can be seen in fig 3 this type of grid system deforms the elements in the vicinity of the hull during roll decay by reconstructing the boundaries with respect to the movement of the control points in this study the control points were selected from the boundaries of the element and the displacements of the control points were calculated by an interpolation field in the region morphing or deforming grid was considered as a good selection for small ship motions other possible options such as overset grid or rigid body motion would have disadvantages in simulating ship roll for example in rigid body motion the fluid domain would be rotated instead of the ship itself which leads to problems with accurate prediction of the free surface overset grid on the other hand needs large computer memory due to high number of element requirement sukas et al 2017 high computational cost reduces the applicability of the overset grid option although morphing grid could be a suitable option for this study it would be disadvantageous for ships rolling in large angles elements deforming with respect to the ship would get skew in large motions which might lead to generation of nonphysical results while small roll angles adopted in this study were considered no additional adjustments in the morpher solver were made and the commercial software was used with default settings this type of grid structure has three important zones the first one is the kelvin waves zone which is marked as 1 in the figure this zone allows better simulation of the wake especially during surge which is available for cases when f r 0 the refinement is generally on x y plane with a small thickness along z direction that is expected to cover the free surface deformations the second zone covers the refinements near the hull which is marked as 2 in fig 3 this zone is a block that surrounds the hull the elements near the boundaries of the ship were selected small to capture correctly the flow characteristics during the roll motion the free surface refinement marked as 3 in the same figure is only in z direction and this is to ensure that the deformations in the water surface are correctly represented the morphing motion in the software calculates the new coordinates of the elements at each time step as the hull rolls from one side to the other the fluid in the rolled side is deferred this displaced fluid is represented by deforming elements and the displacement of each element is calculated by the induced velocities the initial grid along y z plane in the fluid domain when ϕ ϕ 0 at t 0 is given in fig 4 left and the deformed grid when ϕ ϕ 1 at t t 2 in the same plane is given in fig 4 right morphing grid structure may pose problems for the elements in the fluid domain when there are large translations or rotations of the structure the roll amplitude in this study was chosen relatively small ϕ 0 10 o to prevent skew elements being formed especially around the hull araki et al 2014 have also implemented morphing grid for small roll angles the authors have used morphing grid along with the overset grid the fluid domain of that study consisted of an overlapping grid that surrounded the rolling hull and that overlapping grid was surrounded by a morphing grid the study ensured that no skew elements were formed by selecting close morphing area for details refer to araki et al 2014 smaller elements especially near the bilge keels provide accurate simulation of the flow field and captures vortices formed at this part of the ship there were 6 prism layers around the hull to approximate the flow in the vicinity of the hull more accurately the prism layer was fixed and was not subjected to any deformations the grid structure around the bilge keel is given in fig 5 3 3 numerical modeling in this study star ccm commercial software was adopted for simulations the flow was assumed incompressible and the momentum equations in tensor form using cartesian coordinate system can be given as ρ u i x i 0 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j ρ f i where τ i j μ u i x j u j x i are the mean viscous stress tensor component p the mean pressure u i is the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector ρ u i u j the reynolds stresses ρ denotes the density of the fluid and μ is the dynamic viscosity f i is the body force where it is only defined by gravitational acceleration in the z direction as f 3 g and present in the rans solver due to the two phase flow around the ship urans equations along with k ε turbulence model were solved in an implicit unsteady solver k ω s s t model was also experienced if the selection of the turbulence model had any effects on free roll decay there were no significant distinctions between the findings of this study and of begovic et al 2017a b free surface effects that account for the wave damping of the roll motion were modeled with volume of fluid vof method to correctly model the wave deformations close to the ship grid refinements were made close to the free surface see fig 3 the refinements were made especially in the z direction so that there would be a better prediction of the interface between the air and water phases in the vof method the free surface is indicated by a fraction that represents the water air interface water phase fraction was given as 1 air phase as 0 and water air interface that is the free surface in this study was denoted by 0 5 the side wall boundary condition was selected as velocity inlet to prevent wave reflection from the sides during the roll motion the dynamic fluid body interaction model dfbi was activated in the software to solve for time dependent motion due to the nature of moving bodies inside the fluid dynamic mesh system is required for numerical approach of the problem morphing grid option details of this options was explained in the previous section that allows deformations of the elements in the fluid domain was selected in the software if the initial roll angle was large for the risk of generation of skew elements grid deformations can be problematic however this option was especially selected among the other dynamic mesh system alternatives such as rigid or overset grid systems due to easy implementation and robust stability the time step size was selected according to the ittc cfd guidelines ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 in the guideline it is advised that for periodic phenomena such as roll decay at least 100 time steps shall be used to adopt a safe operation one period of roll decay was divided roughly into 150 time steps which resulted in a time step size of δ t 0 01 s inner iteration number was set to 10 this value was considered sufficient to obtain lower residuals and more accurate simulations to restrain y values on the hull and to keep these values at desired levels the maximum boundary layer thickness of a flat plate whose length is equal to the length of the hull was calculated and used as a reference while the base sizes of the elements on the hull were specified hull forms have round bodies and the boundary layer thickness on the hull surface would be different on flat plate however this quick calculation gives a rough idea on how many elements were to be expected in the fluid domain this situation is useful before instantly starting to generate the grid structure although ittc recommendations stated dividing the periodic phenomena such as roll to at least 100 time steps begovic et al 2017a b recommended reducing the time step one order lower the authors stated that numerical simulations performed better with lower time step sizes and found that roll periods were improved to test the simulation results in this study another numerical simulation was applied for roll decay with a time step size of δ t 0 001 s this time step value is ten times smaller than ittcs recommendations it was found that the results hardly changed with smaller time step sizes as the difference in the roll period was only 0 15 as such small changes and extra computational operations were considered for all numerical calculations in this study time step size of δ t 0 01 s was selected by means of the discrepancy in selecting δ t there is a contradiction between begovic et al 2017a b and our numerical simulations the underlying reason of this contradiction might be caused by the cfl condition as known cfl condition is related with the selected time step size and the distance of the first cell from the boundaries however begovic et al 2017a b was unable to provide any details about the distance of the first cell from the ship s boundaries therefore it is impossible to continue research on the selection of the time step size on the other hand our results indicated that the results were independent of the time step size this meant that the cfl condition was satisfied 3 4 importance of release time in roll decay cfd simulations similar to usual practices deployed in experiments at the beginning of cfd simulations initial roll angle was given to the ship however the iterative nature of numerical simulations causes the wave system around the hull to be established late this drawback of the cfd simulations was covered by the release time option that is available in some cfd commercial software during this release time the ship hull was held stationary at the initial roll angle provided by the user and no ship motions were allowed the code uses this time to solve for the waves generated at the free surface that instantly occurs in experiments after the settlement of the wave system around the hull which is expected to be visible at the end of the release time the ship motion was allowed the default value of release time in star ccm is 1 s yet this usually is insufficient to create waves generated by the ship at the given speed to completely establish the expected wave system in the fluid domain for roll decay simulations setting release time to 6 8 s is advised it should be noted that this value is not scientifically quantified however this value purely depends on observation and experience roll periods with respect to various release times are given in fig 6 fig 6 indicates that the roll periods converge at around t 1 62 s before any roll motion of the ship 10 s release time was between acceptable limits to establish flow system around hull therefore in this study 10 s of release time was adopted in all numerical simulations 4 experimental validation the validation of the numerical procedure adopted in this study was made with the experimental results of irvine et al 2013 the hull was set free to roll decay with an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 and with a forward velocity at f r 0 41 the comparison of numerical results of this study and experiments of irvine et al 2013 are given in fig 7 in ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 there is no suggestion regarding any uncertainty analysis method in the recommended procedure in this study cfd validation was obtained in two steps which are specific to numerical estimation of roll damping compliance with experiments was sought in terms of the agreement of the decay and extinction coefficients and the natural roll period the decay coefficients constitute the vertical agreement of the graph given in fig 7 as the natural roll period composes the horizontal agreement a grid dependency study was also carried out and provided at the end of this section 4 1 validation with the decay and extinction coefficients the peaks of the roll angle given in fig 7 seems compatible in both methods which indicate a vertical agreement of cfd ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 recommended that the decay curve should be fit into a third degree polynomial in this section the decay and extinction coefficients for roll decay at f r 0 41 were calculated the peaks of the roll graph in fig 7 are listed in table 3 and the coefficients are listed in table 4 using the relations t n s t n m λ ω n s ω n m λ α s α m λ β s β m γ s γ m λ where the subscripts s and m denote ship and model scales respectively comparison between the experimental and numerical results are given in table 5 4 2 validation with the natural roll period the natural roll periods given by numerical simulations are given in fig 7 these should also be compatible with the experiments this compatibility reveals the horizontal compliance of the roll decay history fig 7 shows that the horizontal compliance of numerical simulations with the experiments was below the vertical compliance of the roll history curve levels for the assessment of the numerical validation natural roll periods should be calculated using the hydrostatic properties of the ship given in table 1 the undamped roll period was calculated as t 1 5285 s in their study irvine et al 2013 found the roll period as t 1 54 s this difference was caused by the damping factors such as viscosity waves etc the natural roll period calculated from the numerical simulations in this study suggested a mean roll period of t 1 62 s which pointed around 5 difference with the experiments the difference in roll history given in fig 7 is further mentioned at the later stages of the motion this is linked with addition of the miscalculation of the roll period in cfd simulations at each cycle it was observed that the natural roll periods were relatively higher than expected values it should be noted that this was observed in various studies gao et al 2011 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2016 as well as this study in all these studies vertical compliance of roll decay history was successfully achieved however the horizontal compliance which constitutes the roll decay period has lower achievement ratios one counter example to this situation was the study of araki et al 2014 where the authors used overset and morphing grids together in their study the horizontal agreement was better than the vertical agreement in roll decay another study implementing the overset mesh was gu et al 2016 they obtained a good match with the experiments for natural roll period yet they also stated that roll amplitudes were slightly overpredicted they have also tried using sliding mesh but the results were lower than overset mesh results regarding these flaws of numerical simulations 5 difference obtained between the experiments was considered acceptable 4 3 grid dependency with increasing number of grid elements in the fluid domain grid dependency study was conducted for 0 41 the ship was released to roll decay with an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 using 450 k coarse grid 1 m medium grid and 2 2 m elements fine grid while increasing the number of elements in the fluid domain element sizes in all directions were reduced isotropically except the kelvin waves zone refinement and the free surface refinement see fig 3 the element sizes were anisotropic in the x and y directions for the kelvin waves zone refinement and in the z direction for the free surface refinement the results are depicted in fig 9 fig 9 left indicated that all simulations showed similar behaviors even the coarse mesh with only 450 k elements vaguely represented the roll response of the hull however when the last 3 s of the roll decay fig 9 on the right was closely examined it was seen that the ship was non oscillating around the ϕ 0 condition and this was physically incorrect increasing the number of elements leveled the ship and established the oscillation at around ϕ 0 and this result is shown in the same figure 5 effect of wave and eddy dampings in roll decay total roll damping b t can be expressed in five components himeno 1981 1 b t b v b w b e b f s b b k in this equation b v denotes the viscous damping b w the wave damping b e the eddy damping b f s the damping due to forward speed in other words lift damping and b b k the damping due to the existence of the bilge keel in this study the bilge keel effect was not a primary source of concern therefore it was not distinguished from the ship but instead it was considered as a part of the ship for more information regarding bilge keel effects investigated by ranse please refer to irvine et al 2013 araki et al 2014 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2014 2016 numerical simulations in this section were for ships with zero forward speed only and the effects of viscosity were neglected when these were considered there were neither b f s nor b v contributed to total roll damping therefore in this section the ship roll was only damped due to wave and eddy damping that form in the fluid 2 b t b w b e in this section the effects of wave damping and eddy damping were investigated with inviscid numerical flow simulation the results were supported with the mathematical model both methods were used to understand the combined effects of wave and eddy damping in roll decay to understand the weaknesses of these methods the numerical and analytical results were assessed by comparison stepwise approach was determined as appropriate the roll decay was mathematically defined starting from the undamped case and including the damping terms on top of the equation of motion 5 1 the undamped roll equation in roll decay the undamped roll motion equation is given as 3 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t where i x x is the mass moment of inertia of the ship ϕ is the roll angle and m s t is the restoring moment the restoring moment m s t is created by the ship itself due to the existence of the surrounding fluid the mass moment of inertia can be expressed in terms of the radius of gyration k ϕ as 4 i x x δ g k ϕ 2 the restoring moment of the ship for small values of the roll angle is 5 m s t δ gm ϕ where gm denotes the metacentric height using equations 4 and 5 to substitute into equation 3 and rearranging will bring 6 d 2 ϕ d t 2 g gm k ϕ 2 ϕ 0 the natural frequency is defined as 7 ω n g gm k ϕ and substitution of ω n will return the undamped roll motion equation 8 d 2 ϕ d t 2 ω n 2 ϕ 0 solution of equation 8 for the roll angle is 9 ϕ a cos ω n t b sin ω n t constants a and b are maintained using the initial conditions for a ship with an initial roll angle ϕ 0 and d ϕ d t 0 at t 0 a ϕ 0 and b 0 therefore the solution of our roll motion equation becomes 10 ϕ ϕ 0 cos ω n t 5 2 roll angle and moment history of dtmb 5512 for the undamped case the roll angle was determined by equation 10 and the only moment component for the undamped case which is the restoring moment was obtained from equation 5 using the hydrostatic parameters of the dtmb5512 hull for an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 the roll and moment history is given in fig 10 the roll angle and moment would keep oscillating infinitely since there were no outside effects to introduce damping into the roll motion equation the ship would spend the restoring moment created due to a predetermined initial roll angle and swing back and forth forever in time without any damping 5 3 the damped roll equation in roll decay there are some contributions from the fluid that oppose the restoring moment m s t on the ship which lead to resisted rolling in water when this additional moment is depicted with m r the damped roll equation becomes 11 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m r where m r is the sum of m w the moment lost to create waves m v the moment lost due to friction and m e the moment lost to create eddies it is known that m v is nonlinear ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 and in proportion with d ϕ d t 2 bhattacharyya 1978 and considered to be small compared to other components neglecting viscous effects m r can be defined as 12 m r m w m e a ϕ d ϕ d t where a ϕ is a constant specific to a ship rearranging the equation using equation 7 and substituting 13 2 n ϕ g a ϕ k ϕ 2 δ a second order linear ordinary differential equation is obtained 14 d 2 ϕ d t 2 n ϕ d ϕ d t ω n 2 ϕ 0 when this differential equation under roll decay was solved for boundary conditions ϕ ϕ 0 and d ϕ d t 0 at t 0 we will obtain the damped roll equation for a ship in roll decay 15 ϕ e n ϕ t ϕ 0 cos ω n d t n ϕ ω n d sin ω n d t where ω n d is the damped natural roll frequency of the ship and defined as 16 ω n d ω n 2 n ϕ 2 equations 15 and 16 define the roll character of the ship under wave damping and eddy damping only 5 4 roll history of dtmb 5512 for the damped case the roll angle history of dtmb 5512 can be obtained using equation 15 for different values of n ϕ this value is a measure of damping acting on the ship hull for an initial roll angle ϕ 0 10 the ship roll over time is given in fig 11 for different n ϕ in fig 11 the case n ϕ 0 represents the undamped roll angle history of dtmb 5512 which was given in fig 10 this was expected since n ϕ 0 the damped roll angle equation given in 15 is the undamped roll angle equation given in 10 the damped natural frequency of roll given in equation 16 also becomes equal to the undamped natural frequency of roll when n ϕ is set as 0 it must be noted that the natural frequency of roll seems to be equal for all cases of n ϕ in fig 11 this is an incorrect perception based on equation 16 ω n d should change as n ϕ changes but this variation of n ϕ reflects as a minor change in the roll period of the hull due to ω n n ϕ the effects of wave and eddy damping were briefly introduced in this and previous sections using an analytical approach however one drawback of this method should be explained further while calculating these moments the ship hull form is included in calculations in a limited manner the effect of the hull form on wave and eddy moments is shrunk to a constant a ϕ equation 12 however this is a very complex phenomenon for obtaining applicable results this effect is linearized the constant a ϕ is one of the parameters included in n ϕ equation 13 however in the cfd results which were presented in the following sections the ship hull form and the free water surface were also included the existence of the hull form and the free surface in calculations significantly changed the roll response of the ship 5 5 the effect of the free surface and the hull form wave damping and eddy damping existence of a free water surface generates waves as the ship hull makes a roll motion the wave system generated by the hull is one of the factors that of roll damping the wave generation is also dependent on the form of the hull during roll a ship will create eddies at both sides of the hull these two factors namely the surrounding waves and eddies near the hull were investigated in this section to evaluate wave and eddy damping in roll decay the roll equation in this case should cover the moment to generate waves and eddies the change in the restoring moment m s t with respect to time is given in fig 10 the effect of the additional moments m w and m e in roll decay were investigated it was also possible to distinguish the wave damping using the strip method ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 yet in this study the effects of waves and eddies were handled together using ranse based method only these moments that damp the roll motion was obtained by a roll decay cfd simulation in inviscid flow the simulation included the free water surface to consider the effect of the waves the total moment calculated by the cfd simulation was subtracted from the restoring moment m s t equation 5 to obtain the moment t to generate waves and eddies the ship had zero forward speed so that there was no additional moment created by surge velocity of the ship the numerical simulation was initiated with an initial roll angle ϕ 0 10 total moment m s t m w m e changes over time are given in fig 12 left fig 12 left shows the change in moment and the difference in period generated by cfd there was significant and visible decrease in the maximum total moment due to the moment applied to generate the waves and eddies when periods are considered the results of the inviscid cfd solution with the free surface at f r 0 had larger values than the results of the analytical solution therefore it might be commented that the numerical results may be non compliant with the analytical results the roll and related restoring moment period of the ship was found as t 1 54 s as stated in irvine et al 2013 however the mean period of roll calculated in this study was t w 1 63 s this is also given in table 6 and from that table the mean period can be calculated when the rolling period was non compliant with the analytical results the results obtained for m w m e could be misleading for example at t 9 s in fig 12 on the left hand side it is clear that the moment calculated by numerical simulations were outside the phase of the analytical results if m w m e was calculated this way for the effect of wave and eddy damping a large value would be obtained this would be physically incorrect however for low values of n ϕ ω n d ω n for dtmb 5512 irvine et al 2013 the conditions are valid therefore one option was to compact the moment graph as given in fig 12 right so that the period would match the analytical roll period this way the phase difference which might happen because of modeling or numerical errors between the numerical results and the experiments was eliminated this process is believed to be more suitable to assess numerical simulations without the interference of viscosity the ship seems to roll infinitely although the amplitude of roll will damp at a slower pace at each period the amplitude may never reach to zero the first 25 s of roll decay at an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 is given in fig 13 in that figure it can be observed that the peak of the ship roll angle is limited around ϕ 3 and has no total damping see table 6 the ship would disturb the calm free surface at the beginning of roll decay and transfer some energy to the waves however this energy would continuously be transferred between the ship and the free surface the flow has no component to damp this transfer in nature viscosity helps to damp the roll this topic will be investigated in the following section it should be once noted that in the numerical simulations in this section the flow was inviscid therefore roll behavior of the ship was expected to be infinite on contrary to inviscid numerical simulation results presented in this section it was shown in previous sections that if n ϕ was set to a relatively high value i e n ϕ 0 50 in fig 11 infinite rolling was not observed this is because the mathematical model for damped roll angle equation presented in section 5 4 neglected the energy transfer between the waves and the ship the numerical simulations allow solving the actual ship in waves and communicating via velocities and accelerations induced on the ship and the free surface the numerical simulations actually solve for the real fluid structure interaction problem whereas the mathematical model only approaches the problem with a reduced order methodology the moment spent to generate waves and eddies was roughly taken as an order of d ϕ d t 6 other effects in roll decay viscosity and forward speed 6 1 the effect of viscosity viscous damping with the approach implemented in this study the different damping sources were discretized first later these sources were superimposed to understand the individual effects however they are actually intertwined and have secondary effects on each other the addition of the viscous damping into the roll motion equation with the free surface would turn the equation into 17 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m w m e m v in this equation m v denotes the moment to overcome the viscosity of the fluid for the discretization of the viscous damping a viscous roll decay cfd simulation at f r 0 was made and compared with the inviscid solution given in the previous section the initial conditions of the numerical simulations were same as it was previously except that there was a k ε turbulence model implemented in the simulations for the viscous and turbulent fluid to correctly model the turbulent flow around the vessel necessary gridding should be made along the hull as it is widely known this can be achieved by investigating the wall y distribution wall y values along the hull at f r 0 are given in fig 14 the moment components m s t and m w m e were already known from previous sections therefore the inclusion of m v was expected to change the moment acting on the hull the viscous damping effect on the total moment that includes all the terms in the right hand side of equation 17 can be seen from fig 15 without viscosity the period of ship roll would have been shorter naturally completely eliminating viscosity on experimental setup is impossible however cfd allows theoretically remove viscosity and solve for inviscid flow the results given in fig 15 were in line with the expectations again there was an increase in the period due to the inclusion of viscosity in the numerical simulations the period lagged the roll motion and limited the total moment as well since some of the moment was used for the viscosity of the fluid the shear stress between the molecules consumed some of the energy of the ship from fig 15 although this change was exaggerated in numerical simulations it might be suggested that viscous damping changed the natural period of roll although the numerical simulations in this study were applied for the model scale ship including reference experiments are for the model scale it must be noted that viscous effects tend to decrease with increasing ship size ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 stated that for full ships the viscosity only accounts for 1 3 when full scale ship was considered viscosity will be less influential for increasing reynolds number 6 2 the combined effect of viscous wave and eddy dampings the analytical solution that was explained in section 5 1 where the results were presented in section 5 2 is only valid when there are no flow disturbances when the ship hull interacts with the flow the viscosity free surface and eddies will be subjected to observable effects in this context their influence on roll decay were analytically presented in sections 5 3 and 5 4 viscosity free surface and eddies will consume the moment created by the ship to achieve stability in water it may be suggested that these constitute the response of the fluid to the roll decay of the hull eddies created near the bilge keels during a full period of ship roll is given in fig 16 these had effects on the damping of the roll angle and the decrease of the natural frequency of roll these lagged the motion of the vessel to create extra damping that lead increased periods of motion and diminished roll angles 6 3 the effect of forward speed roll decay is usually evaluated at zero forward speed but when in surge there will be an additional moment term acting on the ship hull this is called the forward speed moment m f s when forward speed moment is included the roll equation becomes 18 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m w m e m v m f s the forward speed moment will change the roll decay behavior of the vessel the effects may be seen by applying surge velocity on the ship in numerical simulations the effects of m s t m w m e and m v were previously investigated in this section the initial conditions were same however roll decay was analyzed with a forward ship speed at f r 0 41 the forward speed effect on the total moment can be seen from fig 17 in terms of diminishing total roll moment free surface viscosity and forward speed are similar on the other hand the forward speed decreased the roll period of the vessel unlike the wave and viscous effects waves and viscosity slowed down the roll motion but increased f r reduced roll period with increased forward speed is also visible in fig 18 previous studies reported that roll damping increases as the froude number increases haddara and zhang 1994 the experiments of irvine et al 2013 also indicated the same fact yet taylan 2004 suggested that there is a limit where roll amplitudes are no longer affected by the forward speed although the range of 0 f r 0 41 was partially investigated the numerical results of the present study also suggest that increasing the forward speed helps ship roll damping f r number where dtmb 5512 is unresponsive to roll damping was not determined in this study however it should be noted here that taylan 2004 suggested that there is a critical speed where roll damping of the ship is stable although speed is increased the author reported the critical speed for a l 50 m ship at f r 0 23 yet the author also stated that this value tends to change for ship types roll angle histories of the hull with zero forward speed and f r 0 41 are compared in fig 18 colbourne 1983 stated that wave damping is the major contributor of higher roll damping due to increased froude number although this study has no solid evidence on this subject this hypothesis is plausible when the hull energy loss occurs at each half cycle while moving forward and creating waves at higher speed the free surface elevations created during the roll motion of the hull is given in fig 19 increased forward velocity will also increase the wall y distribution along the hull this is crucial and must be evaluated in detail as coarse grid around the adverse pressure zones of the hull may lead to inadequate perception regarding the flow in the fluid domain although the k ε turbulence model can relatively handle flows with higher y values extremely high values of this parameter are undesires however even with a high forward speed at f r 0 41 wall y values are within acceptable range this is given in fig 20 7 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to present the ranse based cfd capability of the coupled and uncoupled ship roll problem in calm water and presenting numerical results for other numerical studies related literature still has few studies regarding computational ship roll results the aim of this study was to partially fill this gap in the literature another gap in the literature for the numerical roll damping estimation was identified as validation procedures in this study a two step approach with the roll histories of the ship was found appropriate in this study the numerical results were validated with the experiments by the curve of decay which constitutes vertical compliance with the experiments and natural roll period which constitutes horizontal compliance with the experiments using this valuable tool and with the aid of mathematical models various parameters affecting the ship roll such as free surface eddies viscosity and forward speed were investigated on dtmb 5512 ship related weaknesses of both approaches were explained it was found out that ranse based cfd is promising at calculating the curve of decay however it still has problems to accurately calculate the roll period on the other hand roll period of a ship is roughly known from the geometric properties of the hull it is possible to normalize results and obtain high compliance with the experiments ranse based cfd is an advanced tool to assess the contributions of different components defined by ikeda due to nonlinear theoretical background cfd can be used to elaborate the research on ship roll damping this could be adopted when ikeda s method is linearized and is unable to correctly predict roll response at certain cases however when all ranse based cfd results in related literature were considered it is believed that more advanced turbulence models are needed to approximate the motion in more accurate manner experiments should still constitute the core for ship roll predictions but computational studies can open the way for different methods to better understand the components of roll damping there are some studies in the literature implementing overset mesh and obtaining better results than the other grid systems future studies can use overset mesh to solve the ship roll problem and reveal the advantages of this specific grid implementation 
23387,computational fluid dynamics cfd that implement finite volume method are offering accurate and precise solutions for ship roll problem in this study the free roll decay of the benchmark dtmb 5415 hull with bilge keels in calm water was numerically solved by applying this type of code contributions of viscosity wave eddy and forward ship speed were separately investigated for ship roll damping and these were integral part of experimental setups numerical results were first validated with experiments additionally mathematical derivations of ship roll response were used where experiments were impractical or inapplicable related literature still lacks a validation procedure therefore a detailed analysis was made for the numerical estimation of roll damping the weaknesses of cfd and the mathematical model were identified and discussed by comparing the obtained results the results indicated that although the numerical simulations successfully captured the decay coefficients these simulations lacked accuracy in calculating the natural roll frequency keywords ship roll dtmb 5512 wave damping viscous damping forward speed effect 1 introduction computational fluid dynamics cfd approach involving the solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse for solving ship motions is a popular method to assess the hydrodynamic performance of ships although potential theory based methods are still widely used viscous effects involving turbulence is excluded from these methods viscosity can only be incorporated if the flow is laminar by using falkner skan equations which can be derived using the navier stokes equations efforts to include turbulent flow effects were inadequate to fully model the characteristics of the flow and therefore were failed to be adopted extensively while the ship roll motions are mainly predicted with decades old methods these are coupled with empirical estimations of viscous forces to reinforce the calculation procedures viscosity has significant effects on roll motion of a ship and all approaches that neglect viscous forces in roll is considered insufficient himeno 1981 estimation model of ikeda ikeda et al 1978 is a fast and practical method to solve the roll damping of ships which heavily relies on empirical data obtained from excessive number of experiments researches of ikeda included viscosity in terms of skin friction damping in addition to the remaining four components namely eddy wave lift and bilge keel damping method proposed by ikeda is still widely adopted by many researchers in this field however his empirical method is ineffective in various cases including shallow draft yildiz et al 2016 such restrictions and shortages in this semi empirical approach led researchers to utilize the fully nonlinear ranse based methods that are flexible to generate results in wider scope an overview regarding ship roll prediction methods is given in falzarano et al 2015 as fvm has reached the current state in last two decades the number of ranse based studies for solving ship roll motion have increased high speed computers led the way for using higher number of elements and enabled implementation of more flexible grid techniques for simulation of ship roll which included the overset or chimera grids overset grids have found wide application opportunities in numerically simulating ship roll among many researchers working in this field such as chen and liu 2002 araki et al 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2016 and begovic et al 2017a b these researchers have implemented this specific type of dynamic mesh system these types are especially beneficial for simulating large ship roll angles ship roll is one of the most poorly understood ship motions as discussed by falzarano et al 2015 therefore this method is appealing to researchers in computational sciences as the numbers of studies regarding computationally approach the ship roll problem has increased there are various experimental studies especially published for providing data for cfd simulations lee et al 2012 and lee et al 2016 have published experimental data to develop better cfd methods ittc have published a guideline for numerical estimation of roll damping for these cfd studies to comply with ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 although previous studies addressed ship roll response for intact condition only roll response in damaged condition is also analyzed in recent studies gao and vassalos 2011 lee et al 2012 begovic et al 2017a b sadat hosseini et al 2016 acanfora and de luca 2016 begovic et al 2017a b this study focused on free roll decay of a benchmark ship dtmb 5415 implementing a ranse based cfd approach numerical solution of roll motion using ranse based cfd is still relatively an unexplored section of ship hydrodynamics although the interest towards numerical simulations have increased recently similar studies are rarely found in the literature in some studies such as irkal et al 2016 reported that there is still a shortage in cfd simulations of free roll decay of ships it is believed that more numerical results are needed to establish a general approach to the problem one of the purposes of this study was to identify the contributions of wave and eddy damping viscous damping and the effect of forward speed on ship roll motion to evaluate the effect of each component inviscid solver as well as the analytical approach was adapted such an approach which only covered viscous and eddy damping only by mirroring the geometry in the water plane and solving it with a double body was previously adopted by jaouen et al 2011 the flexibility of commercial software in this study star ccm was used and the details of the numerical approach were given and explained in the following chapters implementing ranse also contributed to simplify the problem and to obtain faster results roll damping was assessed by making a free roll decay numerical simulation wasserman et al 2016 stated that free roll decay has certain advantages over harmonic excited roll motion technique while roll damping was estimated the authors stated that it is especially beneficial when there is no forward ship speed and damping are small analytical solutions to uncoupled roll motion of ships are mentioned where applicable in this study the analytical solution presented in section 5 as a second order ordinary differential function was adopted for understanding the theoretically mandatory motion of the ship hull under inviscid viscous flow and calm free water surface conditions with zero forward hull speed this approach was selected as a reference to assess the cfd based results although there are certain drawbacks of this evaluation procedure first the analytical solution includes the hull form effects in a very limited manner due to linearized approach secondly the cfd based results are always prone to errors such as numerical errors modeling errors etc thus these results must be evaluated carefully both methods have certain advantages and certain disadvantages thus the limitations of these methods should be discovered to use them effectively 2 geometric and hydrostatic properties of dtmb model 5415 numerical roll decay simulations were made for the dtmb 5512 hull where various experimental and numerical results are available in the literature the dtmb 5512 is a geosim of the full scale dtmb 5415 ship at 1 46 6 model scale the hull contains a sonar dome bilge keels on both sides of the ship and has a transom stern the geometry of dtmb 5512 is shown in fig 1 the propulsion is provided through twin propellers and the ship has twin rudders which are excluded in fig 1 these appendages were excluded in roll decay cfd simulations in this study bilge keel was considered as appendage in numerical simulations effect of bilge keels on roll damping was investigated by many studies in the field such as irvine et al 2013 araki et al 2014 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2014 2016 therefore the bilge keel effect was not separated as a stand alone case the hydrostatic and geometric properties of the dtmb model 5512 including the bilge keel are given in table 1 when values given in the table were considered it is important to note that the origin 0 0 is set where the bow meets the waterline 3 numerical approach 3 1 numerical simulation conditions all the simulations in this study were either uncoupled roll motions or only coupled with the surge motion of the ship surge was included in the numerical simulations to assess the effect of forward speed on ship roll in this respect the numerical simulations either had one degree of freedom 1 dof or 2 dof the fluid domain boundaries and the boundary conditions are given in fig 2 and table 2 respectively domain extents were selected in line with the recommendations of the ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 fig 2 is unscaled 3 2 grid structure hexahedral elements were used to solve the flow around hull for the implemented grid structure the hull was released to roll decay and during the simulations elements in the fluid domain were deformed with respect to the motion this was realized using the morphing grid option available in star ccm software a general view of the elements can be seen in fig 3 this type of grid system deforms the elements in the vicinity of the hull during roll decay by reconstructing the boundaries with respect to the movement of the control points in this study the control points were selected from the boundaries of the element and the displacements of the control points were calculated by an interpolation field in the region morphing or deforming grid was considered as a good selection for small ship motions other possible options such as overset grid or rigid body motion would have disadvantages in simulating ship roll for example in rigid body motion the fluid domain would be rotated instead of the ship itself which leads to problems with accurate prediction of the free surface overset grid on the other hand needs large computer memory due to high number of element requirement sukas et al 2017 high computational cost reduces the applicability of the overset grid option although morphing grid could be a suitable option for this study it would be disadvantageous for ships rolling in large angles elements deforming with respect to the ship would get skew in large motions which might lead to generation of nonphysical results while small roll angles adopted in this study were considered no additional adjustments in the morpher solver were made and the commercial software was used with default settings this type of grid structure has three important zones the first one is the kelvin waves zone which is marked as 1 in the figure this zone allows better simulation of the wake especially during surge which is available for cases when f r 0 the refinement is generally on x y plane with a small thickness along z direction that is expected to cover the free surface deformations the second zone covers the refinements near the hull which is marked as 2 in fig 3 this zone is a block that surrounds the hull the elements near the boundaries of the ship were selected small to capture correctly the flow characteristics during the roll motion the free surface refinement marked as 3 in the same figure is only in z direction and this is to ensure that the deformations in the water surface are correctly represented the morphing motion in the software calculates the new coordinates of the elements at each time step as the hull rolls from one side to the other the fluid in the rolled side is deferred this displaced fluid is represented by deforming elements and the displacement of each element is calculated by the induced velocities the initial grid along y z plane in the fluid domain when ϕ ϕ 0 at t 0 is given in fig 4 left and the deformed grid when ϕ ϕ 1 at t t 2 in the same plane is given in fig 4 right morphing grid structure may pose problems for the elements in the fluid domain when there are large translations or rotations of the structure the roll amplitude in this study was chosen relatively small ϕ 0 10 o to prevent skew elements being formed especially around the hull araki et al 2014 have also implemented morphing grid for small roll angles the authors have used morphing grid along with the overset grid the fluid domain of that study consisted of an overlapping grid that surrounded the rolling hull and that overlapping grid was surrounded by a morphing grid the study ensured that no skew elements were formed by selecting close morphing area for details refer to araki et al 2014 smaller elements especially near the bilge keels provide accurate simulation of the flow field and captures vortices formed at this part of the ship there were 6 prism layers around the hull to approximate the flow in the vicinity of the hull more accurately the prism layer was fixed and was not subjected to any deformations the grid structure around the bilge keel is given in fig 5 3 3 numerical modeling in this study star ccm commercial software was adopted for simulations the flow was assumed incompressible and the momentum equations in tensor form using cartesian coordinate system can be given as ρ u i x i 0 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j ρ f i where τ i j μ u i x j u j x i are the mean viscous stress tensor component p the mean pressure u i is the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector ρ u i u j the reynolds stresses ρ denotes the density of the fluid and μ is the dynamic viscosity f i is the body force where it is only defined by gravitational acceleration in the z direction as f 3 g and present in the rans solver due to the two phase flow around the ship urans equations along with k ε turbulence model were solved in an implicit unsteady solver k ω s s t model was also experienced if the selection of the turbulence model had any effects on free roll decay there were no significant distinctions between the findings of this study and of begovic et al 2017a b free surface effects that account for the wave damping of the roll motion were modeled with volume of fluid vof method to correctly model the wave deformations close to the ship grid refinements were made close to the free surface see fig 3 the refinements were made especially in the z direction so that there would be a better prediction of the interface between the air and water phases in the vof method the free surface is indicated by a fraction that represents the water air interface water phase fraction was given as 1 air phase as 0 and water air interface that is the free surface in this study was denoted by 0 5 the side wall boundary condition was selected as velocity inlet to prevent wave reflection from the sides during the roll motion the dynamic fluid body interaction model dfbi was activated in the software to solve for time dependent motion due to the nature of moving bodies inside the fluid dynamic mesh system is required for numerical approach of the problem morphing grid option details of this options was explained in the previous section that allows deformations of the elements in the fluid domain was selected in the software if the initial roll angle was large for the risk of generation of skew elements grid deformations can be problematic however this option was especially selected among the other dynamic mesh system alternatives such as rigid or overset grid systems due to easy implementation and robust stability the time step size was selected according to the ittc cfd guidelines ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 in the guideline it is advised that for periodic phenomena such as roll decay at least 100 time steps shall be used to adopt a safe operation one period of roll decay was divided roughly into 150 time steps which resulted in a time step size of δ t 0 01 s inner iteration number was set to 10 this value was considered sufficient to obtain lower residuals and more accurate simulations to restrain y values on the hull and to keep these values at desired levels the maximum boundary layer thickness of a flat plate whose length is equal to the length of the hull was calculated and used as a reference while the base sizes of the elements on the hull were specified hull forms have round bodies and the boundary layer thickness on the hull surface would be different on flat plate however this quick calculation gives a rough idea on how many elements were to be expected in the fluid domain this situation is useful before instantly starting to generate the grid structure although ittc recommendations stated dividing the periodic phenomena such as roll to at least 100 time steps begovic et al 2017a b recommended reducing the time step one order lower the authors stated that numerical simulations performed better with lower time step sizes and found that roll periods were improved to test the simulation results in this study another numerical simulation was applied for roll decay with a time step size of δ t 0 001 s this time step value is ten times smaller than ittcs recommendations it was found that the results hardly changed with smaller time step sizes as the difference in the roll period was only 0 15 as such small changes and extra computational operations were considered for all numerical calculations in this study time step size of δ t 0 01 s was selected by means of the discrepancy in selecting δ t there is a contradiction between begovic et al 2017a b and our numerical simulations the underlying reason of this contradiction might be caused by the cfl condition as known cfl condition is related with the selected time step size and the distance of the first cell from the boundaries however begovic et al 2017a b was unable to provide any details about the distance of the first cell from the ship s boundaries therefore it is impossible to continue research on the selection of the time step size on the other hand our results indicated that the results were independent of the time step size this meant that the cfl condition was satisfied 3 4 importance of release time in roll decay cfd simulations similar to usual practices deployed in experiments at the beginning of cfd simulations initial roll angle was given to the ship however the iterative nature of numerical simulations causes the wave system around the hull to be established late this drawback of the cfd simulations was covered by the release time option that is available in some cfd commercial software during this release time the ship hull was held stationary at the initial roll angle provided by the user and no ship motions were allowed the code uses this time to solve for the waves generated at the free surface that instantly occurs in experiments after the settlement of the wave system around the hull which is expected to be visible at the end of the release time the ship motion was allowed the default value of release time in star ccm is 1 s yet this usually is insufficient to create waves generated by the ship at the given speed to completely establish the expected wave system in the fluid domain for roll decay simulations setting release time to 6 8 s is advised it should be noted that this value is not scientifically quantified however this value purely depends on observation and experience roll periods with respect to various release times are given in fig 6 fig 6 indicates that the roll periods converge at around t 1 62 s before any roll motion of the ship 10 s release time was between acceptable limits to establish flow system around hull therefore in this study 10 s of release time was adopted in all numerical simulations 4 experimental validation the validation of the numerical procedure adopted in this study was made with the experimental results of irvine et al 2013 the hull was set free to roll decay with an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 and with a forward velocity at f r 0 41 the comparison of numerical results of this study and experiments of irvine et al 2013 are given in fig 7 in ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 there is no suggestion regarding any uncertainty analysis method in the recommended procedure in this study cfd validation was obtained in two steps which are specific to numerical estimation of roll damping compliance with experiments was sought in terms of the agreement of the decay and extinction coefficients and the natural roll period the decay coefficients constitute the vertical agreement of the graph given in fig 7 as the natural roll period composes the horizontal agreement a grid dependency study was also carried out and provided at the end of this section 4 1 validation with the decay and extinction coefficients the peaks of the roll angle given in fig 7 seems compatible in both methods which indicate a vertical agreement of cfd ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 recommended that the decay curve should be fit into a third degree polynomial in this section the decay and extinction coefficients for roll decay at f r 0 41 were calculated the peaks of the roll graph in fig 7 are listed in table 3 and the coefficients are listed in table 4 using the relations t n s t n m λ ω n s ω n m λ α s α m λ β s β m γ s γ m λ where the subscripts s and m denote ship and model scales respectively comparison between the experimental and numerical results are given in table 5 4 2 validation with the natural roll period the natural roll periods given by numerical simulations are given in fig 7 these should also be compatible with the experiments this compatibility reveals the horizontal compliance of the roll decay history fig 7 shows that the horizontal compliance of numerical simulations with the experiments was below the vertical compliance of the roll history curve levels for the assessment of the numerical validation natural roll periods should be calculated using the hydrostatic properties of the ship given in table 1 the undamped roll period was calculated as t 1 5285 s in their study irvine et al 2013 found the roll period as t 1 54 s this difference was caused by the damping factors such as viscosity waves etc the natural roll period calculated from the numerical simulations in this study suggested a mean roll period of t 1 62 s which pointed around 5 difference with the experiments the difference in roll history given in fig 7 is further mentioned at the later stages of the motion this is linked with addition of the miscalculation of the roll period in cfd simulations at each cycle it was observed that the natural roll periods were relatively higher than expected values it should be noted that this was observed in various studies gao et al 2011 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2016 as well as this study in all these studies vertical compliance of roll decay history was successfully achieved however the horizontal compliance which constitutes the roll decay period has lower achievement ratios one counter example to this situation was the study of araki et al 2014 where the authors used overset and morphing grids together in their study the horizontal agreement was better than the vertical agreement in roll decay another study implementing the overset mesh was gu et al 2016 they obtained a good match with the experiments for natural roll period yet they also stated that roll amplitudes were slightly overpredicted they have also tried using sliding mesh but the results were lower than overset mesh results regarding these flaws of numerical simulations 5 difference obtained between the experiments was considered acceptable 4 3 grid dependency with increasing number of grid elements in the fluid domain grid dependency study was conducted for 0 41 the ship was released to roll decay with an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 using 450 k coarse grid 1 m medium grid and 2 2 m elements fine grid while increasing the number of elements in the fluid domain element sizes in all directions were reduced isotropically except the kelvin waves zone refinement and the free surface refinement see fig 3 the element sizes were anisotropic in the x and y directions for the kelvin waves zone refinement and in the z direction for the free surface refinement the results are depicted in fig 9 fig 9 left indicated that all simulations showed similar behaviors even the coarse mesh with only 450 k elements vaguely represented the roll response of the hull however when the last 3 s of the roll decay fig 9 on the right was closely examined it was seen that the ship was non oscillating around the ϕ 0 condition and this was physically incorrect increasing the number of elements leveled the ship and established the oscillation at around ϕ 0 and this result is shown in the same figure 5 effect of wave and eddy dampings in roll decay total roll damping b t can be expressed in five components himeno 1981 1 b t b v b w b e b f s b b k in this equation b v denotes the viscous damping b w the wave damping b e the eddy damping b f s the damping due to forward speed in other words lift damping and b b k the damping due to the existence of the bilge keel in this study the bilge keel effect was not a primary source of concern therefore it was not distinguished from the ship but instead it was considered as a part of the ship for more information regarding bilge keel effects investigated by ranse please refer to irvine et al 2013 araki et al 2014 avalos et al 2014 irkal et al 2014 2016 numerical simulations in this section were for ships with zero forward speed only and the effects of viscosity were neglected when these were considered there were neither b f s nor b v contributed to total roll damping therefore in this section the ship roll was only damped due to wave and eddy damping that form in the fluid 2 b t b w b e in this section the effects of wave damping and eddy damping were investigated with inviscid numerical flow simulation the results were supported with the mathematical model both methods were used to understand the combined effects of wave and eddy damping in roll decay to understand the weaknesses of these methods the numerical and analytical results were assessed by comparison stepwise approach was determined as appropriate the roll decay was mathematically defined starting from the undamped case and including the damping terms on top of the equation of motion 5 1 the undamped roll equation in roll decay the undamped roll motion equation is given as 3 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t where i x x is the mass moment of inertia of the ship ϕ is the roll angle and m s t is the restoring moment the restoring moment m s t is created by the ship itself due to the existence of the surrounding fluid the mass moment of inertia can be expressed in terms of the radius of gyration k ϕ as 4 i x x δ g k ϕ 2 the restoring moment of the ship for small values of the roll angle is 5 m s t δ gm ϕ where gm denotes the metacentric height using equations 4 and 5 to substitute into equation 3 and rearranging will bring 6 d 2 ϕ d t 2 g gm k ϕ 2 ϕ 0 the natural frequency is defined as 7 ω n g gm k ϕ and substitution of ω n will return the undamped roll motion equation 8 d 2 ϕ d t 2 ω n 2 ϕ 0 solution of equation 8 for the roll angle is 9 ϕ a cos ω n t b sin ω n t constants a and b are maintained using the initial conditions for a ship with an initial roll angle ϕ 0 and d ϕ d t 0 at t 0 a ϕ 0 and b 0 therefore the solution of our roll motion equation becomes 10 ϕ ϕ 0 cos ω n t 5 2 roll angle and moment history of dtmb 5512 for the undamped case the roll angle was determined by equation 10 and the only moment component for the undamped case which is the restoring moment was obtained from equation 5 using the hydrostatic parameters of the dtmb5512 hull for an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 the roll and moment history is given in fig 10 the roll angle and moment would keep oscillating infinitely since there were no outside effects to introduce damping into the roll motion equation the ship would spend the restoring moment created due to a predetermined initial roll angle and swing back and forth forever in time without any damping 5 3 the damped roll equation in roll decay there are some contributions from the fluid that oppose the restoring moment m s t on the ship which lead to resisted rolling in water when this additional moment is depicted with m r the damped roll equation becomes 11 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m r where m r is the sum of m w the moment lost to create waves m v the moment lost due to friction and m e the moment lost to create eddies it is known that m v is nonlinear ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 and in proportion with d ϕ d t 2 bhattacharyya 1978 and considered to be small compared to other components neglecting viscous effects m r can be defined as 12 m r m w m e a ϕ d ϕ d t where a ϕ is a constant specific to a ship rearranging the equation using equation 7 and substituting 13 2 n ϕ g a ϕ k ϕ 2 δ a second order linear ordinary differential equation is obtained 14 d 2 ϕ d t 2 n ϕ d ϕ d t ω n 2 ϕ 0 when this differential equation under roll decay was solved for boundary conditions ϕ ϕ 0 and d ϕ d t 0 at t 0 we will obtain the damped roll equation for a ship in roll decay 15 ϕ e n ϕ t ϕ 0 cos ω n d t n ϕ ω n d sin ω n d t where ω n d is the damped natural roll frequency of the ship and defined as 16 ω n d ω n 2 n ϕ 2 equations 15 and 16 define the roll character of the ship under wave damping and eddy damping only 5 4 roll history of dtmb 5512 for the damped case the roll angle history of dtmb 5512 can be obtained using equation 15 for different values of n ϕ this value is a measure of damping acting on the ship hull for an initial roll angle ϕ 0 10 the ship roll over time is given in fig 11 for different n ϕ in fig 11 the case n ϕ 0 represents the undamped roll angle history of dtmb 5512 which was given in fig 10 this was expected since n ϕ 0 the damped roll angle equation given in 15 is the undamped roll angle equation given in 10 the damped natural frequency of roll given in equation 16 also becomes equal to the undamped natural frequency of roll when n ϕ is set as 0 it must be noted that the natural frequency of roll seems to be equal for all cases of n ϕ in fig 11 this is an incorrect perception based on equation 16 ω n d should change as n ϕ changes but this variation of n ϕ reflects as a minor change in the roll period of the hull due to ω n n ϕ the effects of wave and eddy damping were briefly introduced in this and previous sections using an analytical approach however one drawback of this method should be explained further while calculating these moments the ship hull form is included in calculations in a limited manner the effect of the hull form on wave and eddy moments is shrunk to a constant a ϕ equation 12 however this is a very complex phenomenon for obtaining applicable results this effect is linearized the constant a ϕ is one of the parameters included in n ϕ equation 13 however in the cfd results which were presented in the following sections the ship hull form and the free water surface were also included the existence of the hull form and the free surface in calculations significantly changed the roll response of the ship 5 5 the effect of the free surface and the hull form wave damping and eddy damping existence of a free water surface generates waves as the ship hull makes a roll motion the wave system generated by the hull is one of the factors that of roll damping the wave generation is also dependent on the form of the hull during roll a ship will create eddies at both sides of the hull these two factors namely the surrounding waves and eddies near the hull were investigated in this section to evaluate wave and eddy damping in roll decay the roll equation in this case should cover the moment to generate waves and eddies the change in the restoring moment m s t with respect to time is given in fig 10 the effect of the additional moments m w and m e in roll decay were investigated it was also possible to distinguish the wave damping using the strip method ittc 7 5 02 07 04 5 2011 yet in this study the effects of waves and eddies were handled together using ranse based method only these moments that damp the roll motion was obtained by a roll decay cfd simulation in inviscid flow the simulation included the free water surface to consider the effect of the waves the total moment calculated by the cfd simulation was subtracted from the restoring moment m s t equation 5 to obtain the moment t to generate waves and eddies the ship had zero forward speed so that there was no additional moment created by surge velocity of the ship the numerical simulation was initiated with an initial roll angle ϕ 0 10 total moment m s t m w m e changes over time are given in fig 12 left fig 12 left shows the change in moment and the difference in period generated by cfd there was significant and visible decrease in the maximum total moment due to the moment applied to generate the waves and eddies when periods are considered the results of the inviscid cfd solution with the free surface at f r 0 had larger values than the results of the analytical solution therefore it might be commented that the numerical results may be non compliant with the analytical results the roll and related restoring moment period of the ship was found as t 1 54 s as stated in irvine et al 2013 however the mean period of roll calculated in this study was t w 1 63 s this is also given in table 6 and from that table the mean period can be calculated when the rolling period was non compliant with the analytical results the results obtained for m w m e could be misleading for example at t 9 s in fig 12 on the left hand side it is clear that the moment calculated by numerical simulations were outside the phase of the analytical results if m w m e was calculated this way for the effect of wave and eddy damping a large value would be obtained this would be physically incorrect however for low values of n ϕ ω n d ω n for dtmb 5512 irvine et al 2013 the conditions are valid therefore one option was to compact the moment graph as given in fig 12 right so that the period would match the analytical roll period this way the phase difference which might happen because of modeling or numerical errors between the numerical results and the experiments was eliminated this process is believed to be more suitable to assess numerical simulations without the interference of viscosity the ship seems to roll infinitely although the amplitude of roll will damp at a slower pace at each period the amplitude may never reach to zero the first 25 s of roll decay at an initial roll angle of ϕ 0 10 is given in fig 13 in that figure it can be observed that the peak of the ship roll angle is limited around ϕ 3 and has no total damping see table 6 the ship would disturb the calm free surface at the beginning of roll decay and transfer some energy to the waves however this energy would continuously be transferred between the ship and the free surface the flow has no component to damp this transfer in nature viscosity helps to damp the roll this topic will be investigated in the following section it should be once noted that in the numerical simulations in this section the flow was inviscid therefore roll behavior of the ship was expected to be infinite on contrary to inviscid numerical simulation results presented in this section it was shown in previous sections that if n ϕ was set to a relatively high value i e n ϕ 0 50 in fig 11 infinite rolling was not observed this is because the mathematical model for damped roll angle equation presented in section 5 4 neglected the energy transfer between the waves and the ship the numerical simulations allow solving the actual ship in waves and communicating via velocities and accelerations induced on the ship and the free surface the numerical simulations actually solve for the real fluid structure interaction problem whereas the mathematical model only approaches the problem with a reduced order methodology the moment spent to generate waves and eddies was roughly taken as an order of d ϕ d t 6 other effects in roll decay viscosity and forward speed 6 1 the effect of viscosity viscous damping with the approach implemented in this study the different damping sources were discretized first later these sources were superimposed to understand the individual effects however they are actually intertwined and have secondary effects on each other the addition of the viscous damping into the roll motion equation with the free surface would turn the equation into 17 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m w m e m v in this equation m v denotes the moment to overcome the viscosity of the fluid for the discretization of the viscous damping a viscous roll decay cfd simulation at f r 0 was made and compared with the inviscid solution given in the previous section the initial conditions of the numerical simulations were same as it was previously except that there was a k ε turbulence model implemented in the simulations for the viscous and turbulent fluid to correctly model the turbulent flow around the vessel necessary gridding should be made along the hull as it is widely known this can be achieved by investigating the wall y distribution wall y values along the hull at f r 0 are given in fig 14 the moment components m s t and m w m e were already known from previous sections therefore the inclusion of m v was expected to change the moment acting on the hull the viscous damping effect on the total moment that includes all the terms in the right hand side of equation 17 can be seen from fig 15 without viscosity the period of ship roll would have been shorter naturally completely eliminating viscosity on experimental setup is impossible however cfd allows theoretically remove viscosity and solve for inviscid flow the results given in fig 15 were in line with the expectations again there was an increase in the period due to the inclusion of viscosity in the numerical simulations the period lagged the roll motion and limited the total moment as well since some of the moment was used for the viscosity of the fluid the shear stress between the molecules consumed some of the energy of the ship from fig 15 although this change was exaggerated in numerical simulations it might be suggested that viscous damping changed the natural period of roll although the numerical simulations in this study were applied for the model scale ship including reference experiments are for the model scale it must be noted that viscous effects tend to decrease with increasing ship size ittc 7 5 03 02 03 2011 stated that for full ships the viscosity only accounts for 1 3 when full scale ship was considered viscosity will be less influential for increasing reynolds number 6 2 the combined effect of viscous wave and eddy dampings the analytical solution that was explained in section 5 1 where the results were presented in section 5 2 is only valid when there are no flow disturbances when the ship hull interacts with the flow the viscosity free surface and eddies will be subjected to observable effects in this context their influence on roll decay were analytically presented in sections 5 3 and 5 4 viscosity free surface and eddies will consume the moment created by the ship to achieve stability in water it may be suggested that these constitute the response of the fluid to the roll decay of the hull eddies created near the bilge keels during a full period of ship roll is given in fig 16 these had effects on the damping of the roll angle and the decrease of the natural frequency of roll these lagged the motion of the vessel to create extra damping that lead increased periods of motion and diminished roll angles 6 3 the effect of forward speed roll decay is usually evaluated at zero forward speed but when in surge there will be an additional moment term acting on the ship hull this is called the forward speed moment m f s when forward speed moment is included the roll equation becomes 18 i x x d 2 ϕ d t 2 m s t m w m e m v m f s the forward speed moment will change the roll decay behavior of the vessel the effects may be seen by applying surge velocity on the ship in numerical simulations the effects of m s t m w m e and m v were previously investigated in this section the initial conditions were same however roll decay was analyzed with a forward ship speed at f r 0 41 the forward speed effect on the total moment can be seen from fig 17 in terms of diminishing total roll moment free surface viscosity and forward speed are similar on the other hand the forward speed decreased the roll period of the vessel unlike the wave and viscous effects waves and viscosity slowed down the roll motion but increased f r reduced roll period with increased forward speed is also visible in fig 18 previous studies reported that roll damping increases as the froude number increases haddara and zhang 1994 the experiments of irvine et al 2013 also indicated the same fact yet taylan 2004 suggested that there is a limit where roll amplitudes are no longer affected by the forward speed although the range of 0 f r 0 41 was partially investigated the numerical results of the present study also suggest that increasing the forward speed helps ship roll damping f r number where dtmb 5512 is unresponsive to roll damping was not determined in this study however it should be noted here that taylan 2004 suggested that there is a critical speed where roll damping of the ship is stable although speed is increased the author reported the critical speed for a l 50 m ship at f r 0 23 yet the author also stated that this value tends to change for ship types roll angle histories of the hull with zero forward speed and f r 0 41 are compared in fig 18 colbourne 1983 stated that wave damping is the major contributor of higher roll damping due to increased froude number although this study has no solid evidence on this subject this hypothesis is plausible when the hull energy loss occurs at each half cycle while moving forward and creating waves at higher speed the free surface elevations created during the roll motion of the hull is given in fig 19 increased forward velocity will also increase the wall y distribution along the hull this is crucial and must be evaluated in detail as coarse grid around the adverse pressure zones of the hull may lead to inadequate perception regarding the flow in the fluid domain although the k ε turbulence model can relatively handle flows with higher y values extremely high values of this parameter are undesires however even with a high forward speed at f r 0 41 wall y values are within acceptable range this is given in fig 20 7 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to present the ranse based cfd capability of the coupled and uncoupled ship roll problem in calm water and presenting numerical results for other numerical studies related literature still has few studies regarding computational ship roll results the aim of this study was to partially fill this gap in the literature another gap in the literature for the numerical roll damping estimation was identified as validation procedures in this study a two step approach with the roll histories of the ship was found appropriate in this study the numerical results were validated with the experiments by the curve of decay which constitutes vertical compliance with the experiments and natural roll period which constitutes horizontal compliance with the experiments using this valuable tool and with the aid of mathematical models various parameters affecting the ship roll such as free surface eddies viscosity and forward speed were investigated on dtmb 5512 ship related weaknesses of both approaches were explained it was found out that ranse based cfd is promising at calculating the curve of decay however it still has problems to accurately calculate the roll period on the other hand roll period of a ship is roughly known from the geometric properties of the hull it is possible to normalize results and obtain high compliance with the experiments ranse based cfd is an advanced tool to assess the contributions of different components defined by ikeda due to nonlinear theoretical background cfd can be used to elaborate the research on ship roll damping this could be adopted when ikeda s method is linearized and is unable to correctly predict roll response at certain cases however when all ranse based cfd results in related literature were considered it is believed that more advanced turbulence models are needed to approximate the motion in more accurate manner experiments should still constitute the core for ship roll predictions but computational studies can open the way for different methods to better understand the components of roll damping there are some studies in the literature implementing overset mesh and obtaining better results than the other grid systems future studies can use overset mesh to solve the ship roll problem and reveal the advantages of this specific grid implementation 
23388,the paper presents an empirical method to calculate slamming load acting as bottom impact pressure on the forward region of the vessel firstly hull shape coefficient as a function of the deadrise angle of the section is derived relative velocity is derived in terms of the extreme motions viz heaving and pitching due to extreme waves forward speed is considered in terms of threshold slamming velocity finally limiting condition for slamming load is derived cfd simulations are performed to obtain the variation of the slamming load along the length of the vessel various hull shapes with varying block coefficients speed and length are considered for slamming load calculations results are validated against the rules formulation of bottom impact pressure as given in published classification society rules reliable formulation for slamming loads with due consideration of geometry of the vessel seakeeping characteristics and probability of slamming is achieved for various types of displacement vessels application of slamming loads on the vessel for scantling calculations of bottom plating is also discussed keywords bottom impact slamming severity limiting slamming pressure hull shape coefficient bottom scantlings 1 introduction waves can cause loads at much higher frequencies due to impact of the ship s hull on water surface commonly known as slamming this type of load usually occurs when some part of the bottom of the ship comes out of the water and re enters consecutively theoretically slamming can happen at any point along the length but it is most predominant at the bottom in the forward part of the hull significant slams can also occur at the stern in following seas and at flare in the bow the necessary and sufficient conditions for vessel to experience bottom slamming impact pressure are 1 bow emergence and 2 certain magnitude of relative velocity that is for slam impact at a location along the ship length the location has to emerge out of the water surface however only this is not a sufficient condition for slamming when a ship is moving in waves since the impact at re entry may be insignificant if the bottom just causes wave surface breaking at the bow flare location velocity of re entry further gets modified since after the impact of bow the velocity of the section under consideration gets reduced flow in the flare region is tangential to the section thus relative angle made by the flare location with reference to the water surface also plays vital role however in the present work impact pressure only at the bottommost location of the bow of the vessel is discussed this impact is referred as slamming in the present work various methods and empirical formulae are available in literature to determine impact pressure due to slamming mizoguchi and tanizawa 1996 reviewed the state of the art of studies on slamming which included theories numerical methods elastic responses due to impact loads and stochastic theories ramos and guedes soares 1998 have reviewed and compared the results of some methods to quantify the slamming loads to be used as input to obtain corresponding responses extensive model tests for mariner model were carried by ochi 1964 for slamming load computations various speeds and sea states were considered extent of slamming along the length was also discussed performance of the u and v forms of the vessel challenger and townsend in irregular waves was discussed in detail by ochi 1967 severity of slamming for two forms for same wave conditions variation of slamming along the length of the vessel was also discussed in detail ochi and motter 1973 described the principles and detailed procedure of the prediction method for slamming characteristics such as frequency of occurrence of slamming ship speed free from slamming extreme slamming pressure for design consideration slamming extents along the length of the vessel and girth of the section etc also the application of the prediction method to practical ship design using numerical examples was discussed by ochi and motter 1973 many classification society rules for bottom impact slamming are based on the comprehensive design paper by ochi and motter 1973 charts for determining hull shape coefficient k are given by ochi and motter 1973 wherein the sectional properties such as area breadth 1 10th of the local draft are considered formulation of e g abs 2017b utilizes same parameters for slamming load as given by ochi motter on the other hand k defined in lrs 2017a rules is a function of deadrise angle with limits of k being in line with ochi and motter charts local draft is considered for calculating probability of slamming which is also in accordance with the procedure outlined by ochi and motter relative velocity v r is a function of the heaving and pitching motion in combination with wave elevation forward speed component also affects the relative velocity detailed derivation for finding the relative velocity at bow can be referred in bhattacharyya 1978 based on these formulations maximum relative bow velocity as a function of the froude number of the vessel for various types of vessels is also suggested in this reference relative velocity formulation given in krs 2017 is in line with bhattacharyya 1978 whereas v r is empirically calculated in lrs 2017a slamming pressure on a barge model was measured for varied sea conditions by huang and sibul 1971 the basic assumption of slamming pressure variation with square of the impact velocity was verified in this work also the factor k introduced by ochi was concluded to be applicable for barges as well 3d model tests were recommended compared to the 2d drop tests for practical purpose tajima et al 1998 simulated impacts of a vessel on water surface by cubic interpolated pseudoparticle propagation cip scheme these simulations demonstrated that the air layer between vessel and the water surface plays important role to determine pressure profile haugen et al 1997 presented the results of extensive studies carried out for catamaran s wet deck slamming both theoretically and experimentally by means of drop test the main objective was to derive simple relationships to account for the forward speed effects and predicting associated stresses in the structure including any potential hydroelastic effects establishment of correct criteria for voluntary speed reduction and change of course is considered to be very important in this work wet deck slamming measurements are interpreted by theory by faltinsen 1999 the effect of structural vibrations on the fluid flow is incorporated and hydrodynamic and structural error sources are discussed hydroelasticity as a function of deadrise angle and impact velocity is studied a key finding is that the larger the impact velocity and smaller the deadrise angle the greater the influence of hydroelasticity 2d theories of slamming e g by wagner and von karman are popular because of the ease of its application and practical difficulty to incorporate 3d model in the recent times generalized wagner models e g de lauzon et al 2015 are introduced by numerical improvements limitation of using 2d theory for very small angles are overcame by solving dobrovol s kaya s boundary integral equations wang and faltinsen 2017 free fall of finite wedge is investigated with potential non linear model by bao et al 2017 all these works are based on potential theory which is the base for most of practical engineering purposes at present however more sophisticated models which can account for actual flow physics e g numerical simulation using cfd are more relevant for slamming recent research in this field e g by hong et al 2017 charles monroy et al 2017 deals with benchmarking of various codes to assess slamming loads a wedge and a ship section were investigated in general cfd results were found to be in better agreement with experiments data provided by wils iii jip mesh and time step sensitivity are crucial in cfd based analyses which requires enormous time as compared to potential codes the fluid structure interaction in local structural areas might be important indicating that the elasticity of the structure has influence on impact loads in this regard one of the main conclusions of faltinsen et al 2004 was that slamming should be considered together with the dynamic response of the structure and very high pressures concentrated in time and space may not matter also the global effects such as slamming induced bending moments can be accurately predicted only by nonlinear hydroelastic methodologies jensen and mansour 2003 however these methods are still not well suited for use in the routine design process due to their high computational demands in this regard it is very important to provide the designer with relatively simple tools applicable at early design stage kapsenberg et al 2003 used such a simple analytical model calibrated by hitting the segmented flexible model at the aft end and comparing predicted and measured responses in this work it was shown that the hydroelastic effects on local loads can be neglected the practical consequence of this finding is the possibility of calculating whipping response using local pressures from rigid body approximation bacicchi et al 2004 concluded that the simpler numerical methods and in particular analytical model were all well suited for use during the first stages of structural design as they require far less detailed information on structural characteristics by comparison to 3d fe models present paper attempts to derive the simple analytical formulation for slamming load which takes into account the actual physical phenomenon involved bottom impact pressure as obtained is useful for appropriate bow design scantlings variation of the slamming pressure along the length of vessel and section girth is derived based on cfd simulations

k also called as hull shape coefficient v r relative velocity between wave and ship bow at the instant of impact 2 3 vessel particulars development of a generalized formulation of slamming load is targeted in this work hence various types of vessels varying in length block coefficient froude number and bow geometries are taken into account as listed in table 1 3 determination of k an experimental investigation of rigid body slamming was performed at the david taylor model basin chuang 1966 by dropping one flat bottom steel model and five wedge shaped steel models with small deadrise angles from 1 to 15 deg from various elevated positions above calm water surface from the test results a set of charts was derived which provides means to predict the maximum impact pressures due to slamming of rigid wedge shaped bodies empirical equations as a function of deadrise angle are given to find slamming pressure 2d theories of wagner von karman are briefly explained by faltinsen 1990 wherein the dependence of impact pressure on deadrise angle for wedge sections is highlighted coefficient of pressure similar to k in terms of deadrise angle is defined for circular sections such equations results in unrealistically high pressures in the present paper equation for hull shape coefficient as a function of deadrise angle is derived referring ochi and motter 1973 3 different series viz a b and c each with 5 curves for b d 1 0 are given as representative ship sections various flat bottom lengths b are accounted in each series hull shape coefficient for a total of eight b d and different a 2bd is given in this reference where a is the sectional area below 1 10th of the draft initially 5 curves of each series a b and c are scaled to eight different b ds for which k is known thus a total of 3 5 x 8 120 different curves are obtained each of these curves is divided into 10 equal segments along the girth lines are drawn connecting origin intersection point of centre line and the curve and end of each segment respectively segments are numbered from origin angle of these drawn lines with horizontal βi 1 i 10 are measured fig 1 let β be the deadrise angle of the section under consideration there exist a unique value of β βi which will govern the value of k to establish an equation between k and the deadrise angle 10 different plots each corresponding to the ith 1 i 10 segment as per fig 1 are prepared these plots are shown in fig 2 the dots corresponding to ochi k are 120 k values plotted against the angle β for each curve corresponding to the ith segment 1 i 10 refer table 2 for details in order to decide upon the relation of k with deadrise angle pooled standard deviation of k along deadrise angle for each of the plot of fig 2 has been determined and are as given in table 3 it is observed that the least pooled standard deviation is about 1 4 for segment 6 and 7 and detailed comparison is made in table 4 for segment 6 and 7 it can be observed that the minimum pooled standard deviation for 6 35 is for 6th segment and it is also noted form fig 2 that the distribution of points is uniform and continuous for 6th segment thus it is decided to take β corresponding to the end of 6th segment to find the dependence of k on β quadratic equation is fitted which results in y 0 0273x 2 1 6658x 30 465 fig 3 where y is the coefficient k hull shape coefficient and x is the angle β the equation of k as a function of β is derived as k 0 028 β 2 1 68 β 30 for practical purpose β can be limited to 30 deg which limits value of k for β more than 30 deg to 4 8 thus above equation can be rewritten as 2 k 0 028 β 2 1 68 β 30 f o r β 30 0 k 4 8 f o r β 30 0 deadrise angle is the angle with respect to horizontal made by line joining intersection point of centre line with section and the 60 of the section girth at 1 10th of the draft fig 4 3 1 validation of equation for finding k for validating the equation of k eq 2 sections of the container vessel kcs and tanker kvlcc2 are used table 1 in fig 5 ochi k values are for b d and b b rounded off to the nearest b d and b d respectively as available from ochi and motter 1973 hence same values of coefficient k can be seen for set of frames it can be observed from fig 5 that the k calculated using eq 2 referred as present k and w r t ochi and motter 1973 are in good agreement slightly conservative values as obtained using eq 2 can be suitable for practical purposes 4 relative velocity relative velocity of the bow can be calculated by considering linearized motion approach as follows in a regular seaway heaving and pitching motions are described as z z a cos ω e t ε z θ θ a cos ω e t ε θ where ω e ω 1 ω u g cos μ let us assume μ π rad i e head sea condition for this formulation thus ω e ω 1 ω u g where wave frequency is given as ω 2 π g λ w let x is the distance in m of bow or station under consideration from the lcg of the ship then bow motion can be written as z b z x θ water elevation at the bow at any given instant of time is ζ b ζ a cos x k e ω e t where k e 2 π λ w cos μ 2 π λ w position of the bow in relation to waves is given as s b z b ζ b the velocity of the bow relative to that of the wave is the time derivative of the bow motion and is given as s b z b ζ b the forward motion of the ship greatly influences slamming pressure because 1 the motion of the bow relative to the wave may change considerably because of the change in encountering frequency which depends on ship speed 2 pressure calculations are based on the normal component of the relative velocity i e normal to keel and hence forward speed may make a significant contribution to this component 4 1 normal component of relative velocity total normal component of relative velocity as required for slamming pressure calculation can be given as 3 v n z b n ζ b n u n where z b n n o r m a l c o m p o n e n t o f b o w v e l o c i t y z cos θ x θ ζ b n n o r m a l c o m p o

b wave velocity ω e ζ a sin x k e ω e t equation 3 can thus be rewritten as v n z cos θ x θ ζ cos θ u sin θ v n ω e z a sin ω e t ε z cos θ x ω e θ a sin ω e t ε θ ω e ζ a sin x k e ω e t cos θ u sin θ 4 v n ω e z a sin ω e t ε z cos θ x θ a sin ω e t ε θ ζ a sin x k e ω e t cos θ u sin θ eq 4 is applicable for regular waves and can be used to find the rao of the relative velocity at a given location significant relative velocity can be obtained by spectral analysis as v s i g 2 m 0 where m 0 is the variance of the relative velocity and can be obtained by considering extreme values of motions extreme values of wave induced motions and loads are available in classification society rules for ships e g abs 2017a bv 2017 dnvgl 2017b irs 2017 lrs 2017b etc extreme value of each term in eq 4 is discussed below 4 2 extreme wave amplitude wave parameter for a ship is given as c w 0 0856 l f o r l 90 m c w 10 75 300 l 100 1 5 f o r 90 l 300 m c w 10 75 f o r 300 l 350 m c w 10 75 l 350 150 1 5 f o r l 350 m significant wave height can be obtained as h s i g c c w where c l λ w 25 l thus significant wave amplitude ζ s i g h s i g 2 maximum or extreme wave height can be given as shigemi and zhu 2003 h e x t c h s i g c is the ratio of significant wave height and maximum wave height in short term sea state if the probability distribution of wave heights in short term sea state is assumed to be rayleigh distribution and maximum wave height is taken as 1 n times the maximum expected value of wave height then c is given as c 2 ln n γ 2 ln n 2 here γ is the euler s constant γ 0 5772 c 1 9 can be used as representative value at which n 1000 thus and 5 h e x t 1 9 h s i g and ζ e x t h e x t 2 1 9 h s i g 2 4 3 extreme heave motion for calculation purpose extreme heave can be considered equivalent to the local draft ballast condition at a section under consideration 6 z e x t t b a l 4 4 extreme pitching motion extreme long term value of pitching motion can be obtained using following formula irs 2017 7 θ e x t 0 25 a 0 c b where a 0 acceleration parameter 3 c w l c v u 0 514 l c v l 50 f o r l 100 m and c v 0 2 f o r l 100 m 4 5 phase difference in order to find the significant relative velocity it can be assumed that heaving and pitching motions are in phase with each other and wave motion is out of phase with bow motion for extreme conditions sinusoidal components of phases can be assumed to be 1 thus variance m 0 of relative velocity without considering the component due to forward speed can be written as 8 m 0 ω e x t z e x t 1 cos θ x θ e x t 1 ζ e x t 1 cos θ along the length of the vessel wave crest and trough position keeps changing hence eq 8 gives the variance of extreme relative velocity at a particular location slamming pressures are applicable only in the forward region of the vessel ranging from forward end till 20 30 of the length of vessel from fp thus peak pressure occurs aft of fp and can be assumed to be e g at 0 1l aft of fp distribution of slamming pressure along the length is discussed in detail in subsequent sections frequency considered in eq 8 is the worst case frequency causing highest relative velocity dependence of bow emergence and relative velocity on speed of the vessel and wave frequency is discussed in bhattacharyya 1978 maximum non dimensional relative velocity as a function of froude number is given in fig 6 reproduced from reference bhattacharyya 1978 it can be observed that the highest relative velocity is obtained for λ w l 1 05 for 0 f n 0 16 and λ w l 1 57 for 0 16 f n corresponding frequency can be considered as the extreme frequency ω e x t in eq 8 4 6 component of forward speed threshold speed for slamming and significant pitch motion for finding significant relative velocity forward speed term of eq 4 can be written as v t h sin θ s i g where v th is the vessel speed corresponding to the threshold slamming speed and θ s i g is the significant pitching motion v th is considered since the design speed u cannot be achieved for sea state corresponding to an extreme wave height of h e x t or significant wave height h s i g vessel with a length of 167 64 m 550 ft will have a threshold slamming speed of 3 6576 m s 12fps ochi and motter 1973 bhattacharyya 1978 experimentally it has been found that the threshold velocity for slamming decreases with an increase in froude number and froude law is used for ships of different lengths thus v th can be derived considering froude scaling as v t h l 12 0 3048 550 0 3048 9 v t h 0 29 l the significant pitch motion θ s i g is to be used rather than θ e x t along with the threshold slamming velocity to maintain consistency it can be determined as below the probability that extreme motion occurs in short term sea state is given as 10 p 1 n e x e x t 2 2 m 0 m o t x e x t 2 m 0 m o t ln n where x e x t is the extreme motion m 0 m o t is the variance of extreme motion and n is the number of response cycles extreme pitch motion as defined by eq 7 corresponds to n 108 i e long term value eq 10 can be used for long term probability as p 1 n i j k l e x e x t 2 2 m 0 m o t p i j p k p l where p i j is the probability of occurrence of sea state p k is the probability of particular heading condition and p l is probability of loading condition in present case probabilities p i j p k p l can be taken equal to 1 0 since extreme waves head sea and particular draft is considered in deriving relative velocity which results in the equation similar to eq 10 except n 108 and x e x t θ e x t rearranging the terms in this equation x e x t ln n 2 m 0 m o t 2 x e x t ln n 2 m 0 m o t 11 s i g n i f i c a n t p i t c h θ s i g 2 m 0 m o t 2 θ e x t ln n 0 33 θ e x t 4 7 significant relative velocity based on the extreme values as discussed above significant relative velocity i e impact velocity for slamming can be given as v s i g 2 a b s ω e x t z e x t 1 cos θ e x t x θ e x t 1 ζ e x t 1 cos θ e x t v t h sin θ s i g at 0 1l aft of fp generalized form can be given as 12 v s i g 2 a b s ω e x t z e x t cos θ e x t x θ e x t ζ e x t sin 1 25 2 5 x π 2 cos θ e x t v t h sin θ s i g significant relative velocity as given by eq 12 is to be used for finding maximum slamming pressure eq 1 for determining bottom plating scantlings 5 limiting condition for slamming pressure pressure calculated using relative velocity eq 12 and hull shape coefficient as discussed in section 3 may lead to very high pressures typically in the region of 0 25 0 3l from fp this is because hull sections have flat bottoms in this region resulting in very high k values resulting pressures can be unrealistic thus limiting condition of pressure is derived in this section slamming pressure given by eq 1 can be converted to equivalent maximum static head h m a x to find maximum slamming pressure as p m a x 1 2 ρ k v 2 ρ g h m a x to find the maximum pressure limiting condition rearranging the terms gives maximum static head as h m a x 1 2 k v 2 g k 2 v g v g k 2 v g f n l 13 h m a x k 2 v l l g f l k 2 g v l f n l for displacement vessels v l 1 86 savitsky and brown 1976 where v can be considered as maximum velocity for slamming given as below with reference to fig 6 14 v 134 f n 2 31 f n 3 ω e ζ a f o r 0 f n 0 16 λ w l 1 05 15 v 105 f n 2 65 f n 3 ω e ζ a f o r 0 16 f n λ w l 1 57 eqs 14 and 15 can be considered as limiting values of relative vertical velocity these equations are valid for regular waves thus wave amplitude can be obtained as ζ a 1 1 41 ζ e x t which corresponds to the average wave height and encounter wave frequency ω e ω e x t ω 1 ω u g where wave frequency is given as ω 2 π g λ w l l with highest λ w l as per fig 6 f n is the froude number corresponding to the design speed u of the vessel 5 1 determination of k for limiting pressure as we know k depends upon the local draft and breadth also keeping the same form of hull for same wave conditions slamming pressure reduces for longer vessels probability of slamming decreases with increase in vessel length thus k can be represented as k f t b a l b l non dimensional form of this equation can be written as k f t b a l l b l l l k 1 k 2 k 3 where k 1 factor to account for the draft t bal of the vessel ballast condition k 2 factor to account for local breadth b at 1 10th of the draft k 3 factor to account for probability of slamming variation in length l threshold length of the vessel beyond which slamming pressure will decrease correlation of wave and severity of slamming is discussed by ochi 1964 slamming was studied for severe sea state and light draft condition for a moderate speed of 10kn slams produced by individual wave components are categorized as moderate severe and very severe a moderate slam is defined as slam for which impact pressure is applied to the ship s bottom forward of 0 15l only a severe slam is considered when the range of application of impact pressure extends to 0 25l while very severe slam extends beyond 0 25l it is noted that the relatively short and long wave lengths do not cause slamming the waves with λ w l 0 75 to 2 25 and of heights h with h l 1 26 cause slamming it is observed from this study that very severe slam occurs for vessel lengths ranging from 150 to 300 m 500 1000 ft referring ochi 1964 for higher wave heights severe slams were noted for 120 500 m 400 1600 ft referring ochi 1964 vessels and moderate slams were noted for wide range 100 600 m i e 300 2000 ft referring ochi 1964 of vessels for varying wave steepness thus threshold length of vessel for very severe slamming can be assumed to be l 300 m beyond this length only moderate or severe slamming may occur for any given sea condition 5 1 1 determination of max k 1 as discussed in previous section k is represented as function of deadrise angle eq 2 1 10th of the local draft t is considered for calculating deadrise angle thus deadrise angle varies with t slamming pressure is suggested to be determined for drafts ranging from 0 01l 0 045l csr 2015 for deeper drafts slamming need not be considered whereas for drafts less than 0 01l slamming needs to be specially treated these conditions are very less likely for tankers as well as container vessels further referring to csr 2015 slamming coefficient depending on draft is given as 16 c s l 5 95 10 5 t l 0 2 in the present work the dependence of hull shape coefficient on deadrise angle is discussed in section 3 in order to investigate effect of varying draft on hull shape coefficient sample calculations are performed for a tanker kvlcc2 and container kcs vessel for finding deadrise angle at various sections of the vessel table 5 for the sections aft of 0 1l from fp for all the drafts considered the deadrise angle is found to be 0 deg for tanker for container the sections aft of 0 1l result in non zero angles only for highest draft for sections forward for fp lower deadrise angle 0 deg can be observed for lower drafts for container vessel and higher deadrise angles 25 deg for higher drafts the hull shape coefficient is proportional to deadrise angle and to establish the dependence of hull shape coefficient on draft let us assume 1 least draft 0 01l is associated with deadrise angle of say 2 deg assuming deadrise angle of 0 deg will result in highest k hence not considered 2 highest draft 0 045l is associated with deadrise angle of 30 deg for extreme drafts 0 01l and 0 045l k can thus be calculated from eq 2 refer table 6 with reference to eq 16 logarithmic relation can be fitted for varying t l to find c sl c s l 0 978 ln t l 2 7 similarly logarithmic relation is fitted for extreme drafts 0 01l and 0 045l with deadrise as assumed above to find k and shown in fig 7 thus factor k 1 relating k with draft of the vessel is given as 17 k 1 14 6 ln t l 40 5 w h e r e 0 01 t l 0 045 k calculated using eq 2 and eq 17 for kvlcc2 and kcs is shown in table 7 it can be observed that eq 17 results in less conservative realistic values of k 1 for tankers for container vessels eq 17 results in higher values of k for intermediate drafts thus dependence of overall k on local breadth is investigated factor k 2 however it is to be noted that eq 17 is independent of vessel form and thus can be considered as limiting k 1 for maximum pressure value for any type of vessel 5 1 2 determination of max k 2 k 2 is a function of local breadth at 1 10th of the draft considered for slamming calculations for finer form vessels e g naval vessels and container vessels breadth in the forward region of the vessel is much less compared to its full breadth b whereas for fuller vessels e g tankers breadth in forward region is almost same as the full breadth of the vessel severe to very severe slams can be expected for container vessels due to their higher speeds these slams occur till 25 30 of vessel length from fp whereas for tankers moderate slams till 15 of the length from fp can be expected to occur due to lower speeds this fact is clearly evident form the pressure limiting lines as discussed in section 6 figs 13 and 14 in fact the cases considered in this work indicate lesser extent of slamming along the length for tankers 0 1l from fp and containers 0 2l from fp thus dependence of limiting slam on the breadth of vessel i e k 2 can be written as for container vessels k 2 f b r e a d t h a t 1 10 t h d r a f t o f s e c t i o n a t 0 25 l f r o m f p for tankers k 2 f b r e a d t h a t 1 10 t h d r a f t o f s e c t i o n a t 0 15 l f r o m f p in order to find the breadth b at 1 10th of the draft various vessels of different types are selected local breadths at various sections from forward end till 0 3l from fp are found table 8 summarizes the data for various vessels since lower draft governs slamming pressure for scantling calculations same draft is considered for finding k 2 in general for container vessels factor k 2 as a f b can be considered as reduction factor i e less than 1 0 because of the lesser breadth subjected to slam whereas for tankers k 2 can be considered as amplifying factor greater than 1 0 because of the larger breadth subjected to slam from table 8 it is noted that for containers b l varies from 0 041 to 0 079 at 0 25l from fp and for tankers b l varies from 0 12 to 0 138 at 0 15l from fp k 2 can be taken as k 2 10 b l from table 8 minimum value of k 2 for container vessels is 10 0 041 0 41 and maximum value of k 2 for tankers is 10 0 138 1 38 thus k 2 can be taken as 0 5 k 2 1 3 to avoid underestimation of pressure for container vessels and overestimation for tankers finally for all types of vessels b l can be found at 1 10th of the ballast draft for a section at 0 25l from fp as 18 k 2 10 b l 0 5 k 2 1 3 5 1 3 determination of max k 3 as discussed earlier u and v form of the vessels were studied in detail by ochi 1967 probability of bow emergence as a function of vessel length was discussed in detail for various speeds vessels moving in sea state 6 with light draft condition were investigated from this study it is observed that probability of bow emergence i e slamming reduces exponentially with increase in vessel length this reduction is observed to be as low as 13 for lower speeds and approximately 25 for higher speeds for both forms of the vessels refer fig 8 wherein the results of ochi 1967 are reproduced probability of slamming for two forms of vessels are shown with dotted lines curves of u form of the vessel challenger are denoted with c and v form of the vessel townsend are denoted with t based on this factor k 3 to account for the slamming variation with length of the vessel is suggested as k 3 1 57 e x p 0 01 l 2 3 factor 1 57 is taken into account such that for vessels of l l 300 m k 3 1 0 for l 300 m k 3 will be less than 1 0 and for l 300 m k 3 is more than 1 0 exponential variation is followed ref fig 8 k 3 variation of approximately 25 from l 300 m to l 100 m can be noted from fig 8 similarly k 3 and hence pressure decreases exponentially beyond 300 m however application of k 3 for l 100 m and l 500 m may result in incorrect slamming pressure thus additional condition for k 3 can be given as 19 k 3 1 57 e x p 0 01 l 2 3 0 84 k 3 1 25 5 1 4 applicability of limiting pressure p m a x calculated by considering its dependence on draft breadth and length of the vessel is in general applicable to various types of displacement vessels although for vessels where hull form extends below the base line e g sonar domes fitted on naval vessels p m a x as discussed in this section is not directly applicable this is because the local breadth at 0 15l or 0 25l from fp at 1 10th of draft is much less than at dome resulting in much less pressure thus formula for k 2 is needs to be modified for calculation of slam loads on sonar domes a detailed study of naval vessel dtmb for slamming load calculations on its dome is made and is discussed in section 9 6 variation of slamming pressure along the length of vessel although maximum pressure can be calculated using eq 13 the limiting pressures at individual frame locations along the length of the vessel must be determined to ensure structure integrity subjected these slam pressures in order to determine the nature of the slamming pressures along the length of the vessel numerical studies based on computational fluid dynamics cfd are carried out for different types of vessels the ranse based finite volume code starccm is used for the computations since the slamming pressures are most crucial in the forward region of the vessel various bow geometries are considered for the computations the purpose of this study is to capture the variation observed in the slamming pressure along the length of the vessel and not to verify or validate the magnitude of pressure with the analytical calculations cfd based computations are carried out under some assumptions as follows 1 waves are not modelled 2 pitching motion equal to the extreme pitch θ e x t is imposed on the hull at the vessel cog and the vessel s other degrees of freedom are frozen the pitch motion for the simulation is defined as θ e x t θ e x t sin 2 π t p i t c h t where pitching period t p i t c h 1 8 l g irs 2017 3 the forward speed is duplicated by a current equal to the maximum speed and in the opposite direction to the vessel 4 computational domain mesh and time step in each case are used as per the standard practice ittc 2011 dhavalikar et al 2015 although the mesh and time dependency studies are not carried out an appropriate mesh count and time is chosen based on standard practice of keeping courant number within 1 0 near hull surface two types of vessels namely tankers and containers are chosen for the numerical simulations details of each type of vessel are given in table 1 the detailed method to develop the linear normalized pressure envelope to enclose wide range of length of the vessel is described in the following section 6 1 pressure envelope for the impact pressures the method is described below for a single vessel container kcs and the same methodology is applied to all the analysed vessels initially cfd simulation is carried out for finding impact pressure in the bow region of the vessel cfd provides the time varying nature of the pressures at a given location pressure along the length is computed at various points along the centre line up to 30 length from the fp sample points are shown in fig 9 in order to capture the maximum or the slam pressure at each frame location points time varying pressures are monitored and compiled these computed time varying pressures at point 1 point 41 and point 65 as a sample are shown in fig 10 which is a representation of the occurrence of slamming at different points it can be observed that peak pressure at point 1 occurs approximately at 3 0 s first peak whereas for point 65 peak is observed beyond 5 s and for intermediate location at point 41 peak pressure is obtained at roughly 3 8 s it can be inferred from the plot that the slam at points 1 to 65 occurs in between 3 0 s and 6 s of simulation time with point 1 being the farthest and point 65 closest to fp fig 10 can be represented as pressure along the length of vessel for various time instances as shown in fig 11 the maximum pressure at any location at any given instance of time can be captured from these results fig 11 shows the complete set of variation observed along length for each time step of the simulation this plot brings out the changes in pressures taking place at a given location at any given time instance various curves represent different time instances a black dotted line is obtained by extracting the maximum pressure at each location at any instant pressure will not exceed beyond the value indicated by black dotted line this line is the limiting pressure line for the given location in order to develop envelope curve for slamming pressure the limiting pressure as obtained above is normalized by the peak pressure and is replotted as shown in fig 12 the normalized pressure along the length of the vessel is then enclosed in an envelope of linearly varying pressure enclosing all the variations observed in the cfd based limiting pressure line this gives us a linearly varying impact pressures along the length accommodating all the pressure changes in a more generic manner the linear envelope for the kcs container is also shown in fig 12 following the same procedure envelopes are generated for all container vessels ref table 1 the study concentrates on the bow region pressures and it is observed that the passenger vessel s named as container 2 bow shape is similar to other containers so this vessel is included in the study carried for container class vessel envelopes of all these vessels are superimposed by a final envelope represented by the black dashed line that covers the normalized linear lines for limiting pressures fig 13 this envelope is the limiting pressure envelope for the container vessels fig 13 shows the results for container vessel since the container vessels used are varying in length from approximately 140 m 355 m it can be concluded that in general all container vessel will follow the same trend as per fig 13 similar exercise is carried out for tankers of length varying between 210 m and 320 m the final envelope curve for tankers is shown in the fig 14 dependence of peak slamming pressure on the geometry of the container vessel and tankers is clearly depicted in the figs 13 and 14 container and tanker respectively peak pressures are observed in the region near fp for tankers due to the flat bottom sections whereas for container vessels the peak pressure shifts aft of fp due to absence of flat bottom peak pressure p max obtained in section 5 is to be varied along the length of vessel as per figs 13 and 14 depending on the type of vessel 7 sample calculations for kcs pressure is calculated along the length of the vessel based on hull shape coefficient and relative velocity as per section 3 and section 4 respectively these calculations are termed as theoretical calculations p th pressure calculations as a limiting condition are as per section 5 this pressure is termed as p max finally the pressures governing the scantlings are chosen as the minimum of the two pressure calculations and termed as p slam fig 15 tables 9 and 10 gives the details of slamming pressure calculations for kcs 8 variation along the girth slamming pressure as obtained in previous sections is applicable on bottom plating and the peak is applied at the bottommost location of the plating along the girth of the section it diminishes gradually till 1 10th of the local draft along the girth of the section vertical component of pressure can be calculated as a function of flare angle varying along the girth the detailed discussion can be referred in ochi and motter 1973 this aspect is very much important for scantling calculations of bottom shell plating in order to find the variation of the slamming pressure along the girth 2d numerical simulations are carried out three sections of the container vessel kcs at 0 05l frame 218 5 0 125l frame 201 25 and 0 175l frame 189 75 from fp are selected relative velocity at these locations as calculated from section 4 eq 12 is 10 19 m s 9 83 m s and 9 49 m s table 10 numerical simulation is carried by dropping the section on the calm water surface with the constant velocity specified trimmed structured hexahedral grids are generated volumetric grid refinements are carried out near the section and waterline zone a computational grid of 2 9 million cells was used for slamming load evaluation the time step selection is done based on the criterion satisfying courant number 0 5 for the present case a time step of 0 0007sec is used throughout the simulation to compute the slamming load slamming pressure computed from these numerical simulations is represented in fig 16 as pressure time histories for all the sections considered pressure is computed at various locations along the girth point p1 being the bottommost location the computed peak pressures are 310 kn m2 653 kn m2 and 1326 kn m2 at the frame numbers 218 5 201 25 and 189 75 respectively the slam time is different due to the variation in the drop height chosen for simulation in each case the duration of the impulse observed are very small roughly 0 02 s computed slamming pressures are generally in line with the theoretical pressure as calculated in table 10 for the frame 201 25 pressures are measured along the girth until t 0 094 s where slamming impulse diminishes from the time history the maximum of the pressure till 0 094 s of simulation duration is captured for all the locations the pressure measured at the various locations along girth till t 0 094s can be assumed to be exclusive of static pressure since the section immersion is negligible and thus the measured pressure can be directly taken as slamming pressures it is noted from the results of numerical simulation that the pressures computed beyond 0 094 s are higher especially at the locations far away from the p1 this is due the fact that static pressure is included in this pressure whereas slamming effect is diminished pressure can be calculated along the girth ochi and motter 1973 by assuming maximum pressure at the bottommost location and linearly varying till 1 10th of the draft i e p 0 kn m2 at 6 9 10 m from the bottommost location comparison of calculated pressure p ochi and the numerical computations p cfd is shown in fig 17 form fig 17 it can be observed that the numerical computations agree well with ochi s approximation slamming pressure diminishes near 1 10th of the draft considered thus for scantling calculations the slamming pressure can be assumed to be linearly varying along the girth till 1 10th of the local draft 9 results of slamming pressure slamming pressure calculations based on the empirical relations developed in this paper are performed for the vessels listed in table 1 draft at fp in ballast loading condition is considered for calculation of slamming pressure in each case calculated pressures are compared with empirical formulae of various classification societies viz abs 2017a b c bv 2017 dnvgl 2017b lrs 2017a b etc and the pressures based on csr 2015 fig 18 shows the slamming pressures calculated for container vessels results of passenger vessel are also included in fig 18 results of the slamming pressure for tankers are shown in fig 19 it is observed that each rule formulation results in varied slamming pressure however the trend of slamming pressure is similar in each case 9 1 naval vessel dtmb sonar dome of the vessel dtmb extends below the base line of the hull because of the typical geometry circular sections of the dome huge slamming pressure is expected at the dome bottom since dome is generally made of special material the classification society prescriptive rules of steel ships are not directly valid for scantling calculations of dome structure rather direct strength assessment can be carried out by using pressure obtained from calculation as per methodology given by ochi and motter 1973 various classification societies have developed rules specific to naval vessels considering its fine form and specific operational requirements in the present work the theoretical pressure calculations as per section 4 can be used for finding extreme slamming load on dome which is considered unrealistic for dome hence required to be limited by appropriately modifying the applicable formulations as discussed in section 5 limiting condition of pressure of section 5 is applicable to displacement vessels v l 1 86 and for dtmb v l 1 3 thus equations of section 5 can be applied for dtmb draft at fp local draft is considered for finding k 1 in section 5 for sonar dome the local draft varies over the length of the dome and is generally higher than draft at fp thus the highest local draft over the length of the dome can be considered for using to find k 1 breadth dependent coefficient k 2 is derived in section 5 considering the extent of slamming over the vessel length this extent exceeds the length of the dome i e entire dome is subjected to slamming load thus it would be appropriate to assume k 2 1 0 for dome in order to obviate the effect of breadth k 3 being the parameter for probability of slamming remains unchanged for the case of sonar dome of dtmb the values of these coefficients turn out to be k 1 4 86 for a draft of 6 35 m and k 3 1 19 maximum pressure obtained is p max 689 6 kn m2 calculated average wave height for this pressure calculation is 9 61 m variation of the pressure along the length is found following the methodology as described in section 6 for this purpose the pressure only at the dome bottom is plotted and shown in fig 20 pressure calculations using the theoretical formulation i e without limit as per section 4 p th are also performed and shown in fig 21 pressure calculations using classification society rules abs 2017c dnv gl 2015a and lrs 2017a are also shown in fig 21 the calculation results indicate huge pressures 1000 kn m2 along the length of the dome fig 21 this is due to the fact that very high sea state corresponding to h sig 13 6 m as per eq 5 is used for the pressure calculations in practice naval vessels with dome are unlikely exposed to such severe wave height thus for practical purpose realistic h sig should be taken into account to find impact pressure on dome classification society rules take into account factors such as probability of slamming wave head e g lrs 2017a for finding slamming load for naval vessels wave head considered in present calculation lrs is cw 5 28 m i e h sig of 10 6 m abs 2017c rules for high speed naval crafts suggest the operational limiting condition of h sig 4 m whereas survival condition of h sig 6 m the mission requirement for vessel fitted with sonar dome may be to operate at high speed but relatively lesser wave heights thus various factors need to be used judiciously to get realistic values of loads for input to scantling calculations 10 scantlings as discussed in section 8 calculated slamming pressures are applicable only till 1 10th of the draft of the vessel the slamming pressure is calculated for ballast draft which results in highest possible impact pressure on the forward bottom of the vessel for rest of the hull scantlings would be governed by the combined static and dynamic pressures empirical relations for finding dynamic pressures and associated scantlings of structural members are available e g classification society rules these pressures are to be calculated for design draft the pressure variation for a frame of kcs 0 125l from fp is shown in fig 22 the combined static and dynamic pressure is called as total pressure the calculated slamming pressure varies linearly from maximum at baseline to the value of zero at 1 10th of the draft 0 69 m from baseline in the presented case slamming pressure is governing from baseline till 0 6 m above baseline abl and the total pressure is governing pressure above 0 6 m abl the net pressure evaluated along the girth is as shown in fig 22 d scantling calculations based on various classification society rules are performed to decide on the bottom plating thickness the calculations for container 1 and tanker 2 are performed and compared with provided thickness from available drawings the computed thicknesses are the net thickness without corrosion addition as the magnitude of corrosion margin varies for each of the classification society rules it is not considered in the comparison in case of scantling of container 1 it is observed from fig 23 that provided thickness forward of 0 3l from fp is higher than the calculated thickness from all classification society rule requirements the trend of thickness variation along length is almost similar between all classification society rules the thickness computation based on new pressure formulation is indicated by t slam shows that the computed thickness is less than the provided thickness and trend of thickness variation along the length is agrees well with provided thickness the scantling comparison for tanker 2 is as shown in fig 24 the comparison shows that the provided thicknesses are more than the calculated thickness except as calculated by lrs 2017b rules the provided thickness is constant i e 19 mm forward of 0 3l 0 05l from fp whereas at fp it is 22 mm it is observed that there is decrease in the scantling requirement near to fp 0 05l fwd of fp as per classification rules whereas provided thickness is increased in the region near to fp this is due to the owners extra voluntary addition thickness indicated on the available drawing the thickness computation as per new pressure formulation is less than the provided 10 1 future scope the presented formulation for slamming loads is valid for bottom impact only these pressures are governed by deadrise angle of the section of the hull on the other hand bow impact pressures are governed by deadrise as well as waterline angle also bow impact pressures are strongly dependent on forward speed of the vessel these aspects need to be further investigated also may be noted the pressure formulation for planning crafts high speed crafts is not dealt with in present work studies on both 2d and 3d numerical analyses are covered in the present work slamming phenomena with realistic waves and vessel with forward speed can be simulated to find the pressure at bottom and bow as well as on deck due to deck wetness these simulations are very much time consuming and requires huge computational resource mesh and time step dependency with the help of mathematical techniques such as grid convergence index gci can be used for these simulations for accuracy as well as reliability of the numerical simulations these simulations are targeted in future 10 2 conclusions bottom impact load formulation derived in this paper provides the reliable loads for determination of realistic structural scantlings theoretically determined pressures as well as limiting pressure for practical purpose are the outcome of this work for wedge shaped sections deadrise angles is clearly precisely defined and empirical relations can be dependent upon to determine reliable slamming pressure however for circular sections or for common ship shape sections empirical relations of wedge are not applicable although empirical relations in terms of deadrise angle are available for ship shape section finding the deadrise angle itself is a tedious task as such a method is developed to find the deadrise angle for a given ship section and subsequently the hull shape coefficient k is derived as required for slamming load calculation 2d numerical studies compute very high pressures typically away from fp these are in accordance with the theoretical slamming pressures similar results are noted in the past literature as well this is due to the very high velocity of impact as well as higher k for the considered sections in reality 3d effects reduce the slamming pressure a methodology is developed in the presented work to account for such 3d effects to derive the practical values of impact pressure for scantling calculations slamming pressure variation along the length of the vessel as well as girth of the section is discussed in detail and verified with numerical studies trend of slamming pressure computed for various container and tanker vessels are found to be in line with the results as obtained from available published empirical formulations for a specific case of dtmb with sonar dome computations are performed with various wave conditions as suitable for operational purpose the magnitude of the slamming pressure as obtained using presented method are also found to be in line with that given by available empirical relations as evidenced in figs 18 19 and 21 based on this outcome it can be inferred that limiting pressure condition as derived in this work plays a vital role application of slamming load in combination with hydrodynamic and static pressure is discussed this aspect is very much useful for the scantling calculations overall the methodology of slamming load calculations and its application for scantling calculations can be used for any type of vessel acknowledgements the authors express their earnest gratitude to the indian register of shipping mumbai for supporting the reported work 
23388,the paper presents an empirical method to calculate slamming load acting as bottom impact pressure on the forward region of the vessel firstly hull shape coefficient as a function of the deadrise angle of the section is derived relative velocity is derived in terms of the extreme motions viz heaving and pitching due to extreme waves forward speed is considered in terms of threshold slamming velocity finally limiting condition for slamming load is derived cfd simulations are performed to obtain the variation of the slamming load along the length of the vessel various hull shapes with varying block coefficients speed and length are considered for slamming load calculations results are validated against the rules formulation of bottom impact pressure as given in published classification society rules reliable formulation for slamming loads with due consideration of geometry of the vessel seakeeping characteristics and probability of slamming is achieved for various types of displacement vessels application of slamming loads on the vessel for scantling calculations of bottom plating is also discussed keywords bottom impact slamming severity limiting slamming pressure hull shape coefficient bottom scantlings 1 introduction waves can cause loads at much higher frequencies due to impact of the ship s hull on water surface commonly known as slamming this type of load usually occurs when some part of the bottom of the ship comes out of the water and re enters consecutively theoretically slamming can happen at any point along the length but it is most predominant at the bottom in the forward part of the hull significant slams can also occur at the stern in following seas and at flare in the bow the necessary and sufficient conditions for vessel to experience bottom slamming impact pressure are 1 bow emergence and 2 certain magnitude of relative velocity that is for slam impact at a location along the ship length the location has to emerge out of the water surface however only this is not a sufficient condition for slamming when a ship is moving in waves since the impact at re entry may be insignificant if the bottom just causes wave surface breaking at the bow flare location velocity of re entry further gets modified since after the impact of bow the velocity of the section under consideration gets reduced flow in the flare region is tangential to the section thus relative angle made by the flare location with reference to the water surface also plays vital role however in the present work impact pressure only at the bottommost location of the bow of the vessel is discussed this impact is referred as slamming in the present work various methods and empirical formulae are available in literature to determine impact pressure due to slamming mizoguchi and tanizawa 1996 reviewed the state of the art of studies on slamming which included theories numerical methods elastic responses due to impact loads and stochastic theories ramos and guedes soares 1998 have reviewed and compared the results of some methods to quantify the slamming loads to be used as input to obtain corresponding responses extensive model tests for mariner model were carried by ochi 1964 for slamming load computations various speeds and sea states were considered extent of slamming along the length was also discussed performance of the u and v forms of the vessel challenger and townsend in irregular waves was discussed in detail by ochi 1967 severity of slamming for two forms for same wave conditions variation of slamming along the length of the vessel was also discussed in detail ochi and motter 1973 described the principles and detailed procedure of the prediction method for slamming characteristics such as frequency of occurrence of slamming ship speed free from slamming extreme slamming pressure for design consideration slamming extents along the length of the vessel and girth of the section etc also the application of the prediction method to practical ship design using numerical examples was discussed by ochi and motter 1973 many classification society rules for bottom impact slamming are based on the comprehensive design paper by ochi and motter 1973 charts for determining hull shape coefficient k are given by ochi and motter 1973 wherein the sectional properties such as area breadth 1 10th of the local draft are considered formulation of e g abs 2017b utilizes same parameters for slamming load as given by ochi motter on the other hand k defined in lrs 2017a rules is a function of deadrise angle with limits of k being in line with ochi and motter charts local draft is considered for calculating probability of slamming which is also in accordance with the procedure outlined by ochi and motter relative velocity v r is a function of the heaving and pitching motion in combination with wave elevation forward speed component also affects the relative velocity detailed derivation for finding the relative velocity at bow can be referred in bhattacharyya 1978 based on these formulations maximum relative bow velocity as a function of the froude number of the vessel for various types of vessels is also suggested in this reference relative velocity formulation given in krs 2017 is in line with bhattacharyya 1978 whereas v r is empirically calculated in lrs 2017a slamming pressure on a barge model was measured for varied sea conditions by huang and sibul 1971 the basic assumption of slamming pressure variation with square of the impact velocity was verified in this work also the factor k introduced by ochi was concluded to be applicable for barges as well 3d model tests were recommended compared to the 2d drop tests for practical purpose tajima et al 1998 simulated impacts of a vessel on water surface by cubic interpolated pseudoparticle propagation cip scheme these simulations demonstrated that the air layer between vessel and the water surface plays important role to determine pressure profile haugen et al 1997 presented the results of extensive studies carried out for catamaran s wet deck slamming both theoretically and experimentally by means of drop test the main objective was to derive simple relationships to account for the forward speed effects and predicting associated stresses in the structure including any potential hydroelastic effects establishment of correct criteria for voluntary speed reduction and change of course is considered to be very important in this work wet deck slamming measurements are interpreted by theory by faltinsen 1999 the effect of structural vibrations on the fluid flow is incorporated and hydrodynamic and structural error sources are discussed hydroelasticity as a function of deadrise angle and impact velocity is studied a key finding is that the larger the impact velocity and smaller the deadrise angle the greater the influence of hydroelasticity 2d theories of slamming e g by wagner and von karman are popular because of the ease of its application and practical difficulty to incorporate 3d model in the recent times generalized wagner models e g de lauzon et al 2015 are introduced by numerical improvements limitation of using 2d theory for very small angles are overcame by solving dobrovol s kaya s boundary integral equations wang and faltinsen 2017 free fall of finite wedge is investigated with potential non linear model by bao et al 2017 all these works are based on potential theory which is the base for most of practical engineering purposes at present however more sophisticated models which can account for actual flow physics e g numerical simulation using cfd are more relevant for slamming recent research in this field e g by hong et al 2017 charles monroy et al 2017 deals with benchmarking of various codes to assess slamming loads a wedge and a ship section were investigated in general cfd results were found to be in better agreement with experiments data provided by wils iii jip mesh and time step sensitivity are crucial in cfd based analyses which requires enormous time as compared to potential codes the fluid structure interaction in local structural areas might be important indicating that the elasticity of the structure has influence on impact loads in this regard one of the main conclusions of faltinsen et al 2004 was that slamming should be considered together with the dynamic response of the structure and very high pressures concentrated in time and space may not matter also the global effects such as slamming induced bending moments can be accurately predicted only by nonlinear hydroelastic methodologies jensen and mansour 2003 however these methods are still not well suited for use in the routine design process due to their high computational demands in this regard it is very important to provide the designer with relatively simple tools applicable at early design stage kapsenberg et al 2003 used such a simple analytical model calibrated by hitting the segmented flexible model at the aft end and comparing predicted and measured responses in this work it was shown that the hydroelastic effects on local loads can be neglected the practical consequence of this finding is the possibility of calculating whipping response using local pressures from rigid body approximation bacicchi et al 2004 concluded that the simpler numerical methods and in particular analytical model were all well suited for use during the first stages of structural design as they require far less detailed information on structural characteristics by comparison to 3d fe models present paper attempts to derive the simple analytical formulation for slamming load which takes into account the actual physical phenomenon involved bottom impact pressure as obtained is useful for appropriate bow design scantlings variation of the slamming pressure along the length of vessel and section girth is derived based on cfd simulations

experimental investigation of rigid body slamming was performed at the david taylor model basin chuang 1966 by dropping one flat bottom steel model and five wedge shaped steel models with small deadrise angles from 1 to 15 deg from various elevated positions above calm water surface from the test results a set of charts was derived which provides means to predict the maximum impact pressures due to slamming of rigid wedge shaped bodies empirical equations as a function of deadrise angle are given to find slamming pressure 2d theories of wagner von karman are briefly explained by faltinsen 1990 wherein the dependence of impact pressure on deadrise angle for wedge sections is highlighted coefficient of pressure similar to k in terms of deadrise angle is defined for circular sections such equations results in unrealistically high pressures in the present paper equation for hull shape coefficient as a function of deadrise angle is derived referring ochi and motter 1973 3 different series viz a b and c each with 5 curves for b d 1 0 are given as representative ship sections various flat bottom lengths b are accounted in each series hull shape coefficient for a total of eight b d and different a 2bd is given in this reference where a is the sectional area below 1 10th of the draft initially 5 curves of each series a b and c are scaled to eight different b ds for which k is known thus a total of 3 5 x 8 120 different curves are obtained each of these curves is divided into 10 equal segments along the girth lines are drawn connecting origin intersection point of centre line and the curve and end of each segment respectively segments are numbered from origin angle of these drawn lines with horizontal βi 1 i 10 are measured fig 1 let β be the deadrise angle of the section under consideration there exist a unique value of β βi which will govern the value of k to establish an equation between k and the deadrise angle 10 different plots each corresponding to the ith 1 i 10 segment as per fig 1 are prepared these plots are shown in fig 2 the dots corresponding to ochi k are 120 k values plotted against the angle β for each curve corresponding to the ith segment 1 i 10 refer table 2 for details in order to decide upon the relation of k with deadrise angle pooled standard deviation of k along deadrise angle for each of the plot of fig 2 has been determined and are as given in table 3 it is observed that the least pooled standard deviation is about 1 4 for segment 6 and 7 and detailed comparison is made in table 4 for segment 6 and 7 it can be observed that the minimum pooled standard deviation for 6 35 is for 6th segment and it is also noted form fig 2 that the distribution of points is uniform and continuous for 6th segment thus it is decided to take β corresponding to the end of 6th segment to find the dependence of k on β quadratic equation is fitted which results in y 0 0273x 2 1 6658x 30 465 fig 3 where y is the coefficient k hull shape coefficient and x is the angle β the equation of k as a function of β is derived as k 0 028 β 2 1 68 β 30 for practical purpose β can be limited to 30 deg which limits value of k for β more than 30 deg to 4 8 thus above equation can be rewritten as 2 k 0 028 β 2 1 68 β 30 f o r β 30 0 k 4 8 f o r β 30 0 deadrise angle is the angle with respect to horizontal made by line joining intersection point of centre line with section and the 60 of the section girth at 1 10th of the draft fig 4 3 1 validation of equation for finding k for validating the equation of k eq 2 sections of the container vessel kcs and tanker kvlcc2 are used table 1 in fig 5 ochi k values are for b d and b b rounded off to the nearest b d and b d respectively as available from ochi and motter 1973 hence same values of coefficient k can be seen for set of frames it can be observed from fig 5 that the k calculated using eq 2 referred as present k and w r t ochi and motter 1973 are in good agreement slightly conservative values as obtained using eq 2 can be suitable for practical purposes 4 relative velocity relative velocity of the bow can be calculated by considering linearized motion approach as follows in a regular seaway heaving and pitching motions are described as z z a cos ω e t ε z θ θ a cos ω e t ε θ where ω e ω 1 ω u g cos μ let us assume μ π rad i e head sea condition for this formulation thus ω e ω 1 ω u g where wave frequency is given as ω 2 π g λ w let x is the distance in m of bow or station under consideration from the lcg of the ship then bow motion can be written as z b z x θ water elevation at the bow at any given instant of time is ζ b ζ a cos x k e ω e t where k e 2 π λ w cos μ 2 π λ w position of the bow in relation to waves is given as s b z b ζ b the velocity of the bow relative to that of the wave is the time derivative of the bow motion and is given as s b z b ζ b the forward motion of the ship greatly influences slamming pressure because 1 the motion of the bow relative to the wave may change considerably because of the change in encountering frequency which depends on ship speed 2 pressure calculations are based on the normal component of the relative velocity i e normal to keel and hence forward speed may make a significant contribution to this component 4 1 normal component of relative velocity total normal component of relative velocity as required for slamming pressure calculation can be given as 3 v n z b n ζ b n u n where z b n n o r m a l c o m p o n e n t o f b o w v e l o c i t y z cos θ x θ ζ b n n o r m a l c o m p o

location significant relative velocity can be obtained by spectral analysis as v s i g 2 m 0 where m 0 is the variance of the relative velocity and can be obtained by considering extreme values of motions extreme values of wave induced motions and loads are available in classification society rules for ships e g abs 2017a bv 2017 dnvgl 2017b irs 2017 lrs 2017b etc extreme value of each term in eq 4 is discussed below 4 2 extreme wave amplitude wave parameter for a ship is given as c w 0 0856 l f o r l 90 m c w 10 75 300 l 100 1 5 f o r 90 l 300 m c w 10 75 f o r 300 l 350 m c w 10 75 l 350 150 1 5 f o r l 350 m significant wave height can be obtained as h s i g c c w where c l λ w 25 l thus significant wave amplitude ζ s i g h s i g 2 maximum or extreme wave height can be given as shigemi and zhu 2003 h e x t c h s i g c is the ratio of significant wave height and maximum wave height in short term sea state if the probability distribution of wave heights in short term sea state is assumed to be rayleigh distribution and maximum wave height is taken as 1 n times the maximum expected value of wave height then c is given as c 2 ln n γ 2 ln n 2 here γ is the euler s constant γ 0 5772 c 1 9 can be used as representative value at which n 1000 thus and 5 h e x t 1 9 h s i g and ζ e x t h e x t 2 1 9 h s i g 2 4 3 extreme heave motion for calculation purpose extreme heave can be considered equivalent to the local draft ballast condition at a section under consideration 6 z e x t t b a l 4 4 extreme pitching motion extreme long term value of pitching motion can be obtained using following formula irs 2017 7 θ e x t 0 25 a 0 c b where a 0 acceleration parameter 3 c w l c v u 0 514 l c v l 50 f o r l 100 m and c v 0 2 f o r l 100 m 4 5 phase difference in order to find the significant relative velocity it can be assumed that heaving and pitching motions are in phase with each other and wave motion is out of phase with bow motion for extreme conditions sinusoidal components of phases can be assumed to be 1 thus variance m 0 of relative velocity without considering the component due to forward speed can be written as 8 m 0 ω e x t z e x t 1 cos θ x θ e x t 1 ζ e x t 1 cos θ along the length of the vessel wave crest and trough position keeps changing hence eq 8 gives the variance of extreme relative velocity at a particular location slamming pressures are applicable only in the forward region of the vessel ranging from forward end till 20 30 of the length of vessel from fp thus peak pressure occurs aft of fp and can be assumed to be e g at 0 1l aft of fp distribution of slamming pressure along the length is discussed in detail in subsequent sections frequency considered in eq 8 is the worst case frequency causing highest relative velocity dependence of bow emergence and relative velocity on speed of the vessel and wave frequency is discussed in bhattacharyya 1978 maximum non dimensional relative velocity as a function of froude number is given in fig 6 reproduced from reference bhattacharyya 1978 it can be observed that the highest relative velocity is obtained for λ w l 1 05 for 0 f n 0 16 and λ w l 1 57 for 0 16 f n corresponding frequency can be considered as the extreme frequency ω e x t in eq 8 4 6 component of forward speed threshold speed for slamming and significant pitch motion for finding significant relative velocity forward speed term of eq 4 can be written as v t h sin θ s i g where v th is the vessel speed corresponding to the threshold slamming speed and θ s i g is the significant pitching motion v th is considered since the design speed u cannot be achieved for sea state corresponding to an extreme wave height of h e x t or significant wave height h s i g vessel with a length of 167 64 m 550 ft will have a threshold slamming speed of 3 6576 m s 12fps ochi and motter 1973 bhattacharyya 1978 experimentally it has been found that the threshold velocity for slamming decreases with an increase in froude number and froude law is used for ships of different lengths thus v th can be derived considering froude scaling as v t h l 12 0 3048 550 0 3048 9 v t h 0 29 l the significant pitch motion θ s i g is to be used rather than θ e x t along with the threshold slamming velocity to maintain consistency it can be determined as below the probability that extreme motion occurs in short term sea state is given as 10 p 1 n e x e x t 2 2 m 0 m o t x e x t 2 m 0 m o t ln n where x e x t is the extreme motion m 0 m o t is the variance of extreme motion and n is the number of response cycles extreme pitch motion as defined by eq 7 corresponds to n 108 i e long term value eq 10 can be used for long term probability as p 1 n i j k l e x e x t 2 2 m 0 m o t p i j p k p l where p i j is the probability of occurrence of sea state p k is the probability of particular heading condition and p l is probability of loading condition in present case probabilities p i j p k p l can be taken equal to 1 0 since extreme waves head sea and particular draft is considered in deriving relative velocity which results in the equation similar to eq 10 except n 108 and x e x t θ e x t rearranging the terms in this equation x e x t ln n 2 m 0 m o t 2 x e x t ln n 2 m 0 m o t 11 s i g n i f i c a n t p i t c h θ s i g 2 m 0 m o t 2 θ e x t ln n 0 33 θ e x t 4 7 significant relative velocity based on the extreme values as discussed above significant relative velocity i e impact velocity for slamming can be given as v s i g 2 a b s ω e x t z e x t 1 cos θ e x t x θ e x t 1 ζ e x t 1 cos θ e x t v t h sin θ s i g at 0 1l aft of fp generalized form can be given as 12 v s i g 2 a b s ω e x t z e x t cos θ e x t x θ e x t ζ e x t sin 1 25 2 5 x π 2 cos θ e x t v t h sin θ s i g significant relative velocity as given by eq 12 is to be used for finding maximum slamming pressure eq 1 for determining bottom plating scantlings 5 limiting condition for slamming pressure pressure calculated using relative velocity eq 12 and hull shape coefficient as discussed in section 3 may lead to very high pressures typically in the region of 0 25 0 3l from fp this is because hull sections have flat bottoms in this region resulting in very high k values resulting pressures can be unrealistic thus limiting condition of pressure is derived in this section slamming pressure given by eq 1 can be converted to equivalent maximum static head h m a x to find maximum slamming pressure as p m a x 1 2 ρ k v 2 ρ g h m a x to find the maximum pressure limiting condition rearranging the terms gives maximum static head as h m a x 1 2 k v 2 g k 2 v g v g k 2 v g f n l 13 h m a x k 2 v l l g f l k 2 g v l f n l for displacement vessels v l 1 86 savitsky and brown 1976 where v can be considered as

can be considered as limiting values of relative vertical velocity these equations are valid for regular waves thus wave amplitude can be obtained as ζ a 1 1 41 ζ e x t which corresponds to the average wave height and encounter wave frequency ω e ω e x t ω 1 ω u g where wave frequency is given as ω 2 π g λ w l l with highest λ w l as per fig 6 f n is the froude number corresponding to the design speed u of the vessel 5 1 determination of k for limiting pressure as we know k depends upon the local draft and breadth also keeping the same form of hull for same wave conditions slamming pressure reduces for longer vessels probability of slamming decreases with increase in vessel length thus k can be represented as k f t b a l b l non dimensional form of this equation can be written as k f t b a l l b l l l k 1 k 2 k 3 where k 1 factor to account for the draft t bal of the vessel ballast condition k 2 factor to account for local breadth b at 1 10th of the draft k 3 factor to account for probability of slamming variation in length l threshold length of the vessel beyond which slamming pressure will decrease correlation of wave and severity of slamming is discussed by ochi 1964 slamming was studied for severe sea state and light draft condition for a moderate speed of 10kn slams produced by individual wave components are categorized as moderate severe and very severe a moderate slam is defined as slam for which impact pressure is applied to the ship s bottom forward of 0 15l only a severe slam is considered when the range of application of impact pressure extends to 0 25l while very severe slam extends beyond 0 25l it is noted that the relatively short and long wave lengths do not cause slamming the waves with λ w l 0 75 to 2 25 and of heights h with h l 1 26 cause slamming it is observed from this study that very severe slam occurs for vessel lengths ranging from 150 to 300 m 500 1000 ft referring ochi 1964 for higher wave heights severe slams were noted for 120 500 m 400 1600 ft referring ochi 1964 vessels and moderate slams were noted for wide range 100 600 m i e 300 2000 ft referring ochi 1964 of vessels for varying wave steepness thus threshold length of vessel for very severe slamming can be assumed to be l 300 m beyond this length only moderate or severe slamming may occur for any given sea condition 5 1 1 determination of max k 1 as discussed in previous section k is represented as function of deadrise angle eq 2 1 10th of the local draft t is considered for calculating deadrise angle thus deadrise angle varies with t slamming pressure is suggested to be determined for drafts ranging from 0 01l 0 045l csr 2015 for deeper drafts slamming need not be considered whereas for drafts less than 0 01l slamming needs to be specially treated these conditions are very less likely for tankers as well as container vessels further referring to csr 2015 slamming coefficient depending on draft is given as 16 c s l 5 95 10 5 t l 0 2 in the present work the dependence of hull shape coefficient on deadrise angle is discussed in section 3 in order to investigate effect of varying draft on hull shape coefficient sample calculations are performed for a tanker kvlcc2 and container kcs vessel for finding deadrise angle at various sections of the vessel table 5 for the sections aft of 0 1l from fp for all the drafts considered the deadrise angle is found to be 0 deg for tanker for container the sections aft of 0 1l result in non zero angles only for highest draft for sections forward for fp lower deadrise angle 0 deg can be observed for lower drafts for container vessel and higher deadrise angles 25 deg for higher drafts the hull shape coefficient is proportional to deadrise angle and to establish the dependence of hull shape coefficient on draft let us assume 1 least draft 0 01l is associated with deadrise angle of say 2 deg assuming deadrise angle of 0 deg will result in highest k hence not considered 2 highest draft 0 045l is associated with deadrise angle of 30 deg for extreme drafts 0 01l and 0 045l k can thus be calculated from eq 2 refer table 6 with reference to eq 16 logarithmic relation can be fitted for varying t l to find c sl c s l 0 978 ln t l 2 7 similarly logarithmic relation is fitted for extreme drafts 0 01l and 0 045l with deadrise as assumed above to find k and shown in fig 7 thus factor k 1 relating k with draft of the vessel is given as 17 k 1 14 6 ln t l 40 5 w h e r e 0 01 t l 0 045 k calculated using eq 2 and eq 17 for kvlcc2 and kcs is shown in table 7 it can be observed that eq 17 results in less conservative realistic values of k 1 for tankers for container vessels eq 17 results in higher values of k for intermediate drafts thus dependence of overall k on local breadth is investigated factor k 2 however it is to be noted that eq 17 is independent of vessel form and thus can be considered as limiting k 1 for maximum pressure value for any type of vessel 5 1 2 determination of max k 2 k 2 is a function of local breadth at 1 10th of the draft considered for slamming calculations for finer form vessels e g naval vessels and container vessels breadth in the forward region of the vessel is much less compared to its full breadth b whereas for fuller vessels e g tankers breadth in forward region is almost same as the full breadth of the vessel severe to very severe slams can be expected for container vessels due to their higher speeds these slams occur till 25 30 of vessel length from fp whereas for tankers moderate slams till 15 of the length from fp can be expected to occur due to lower speeds this fact is clearly evident form the pressure limiting lines as discussed in section 6 figs 13 and 14 in fact the cases considered in this work indicate lesser extent of slamming along the length for tankers 0 1l from fp and containers 0 2l from fp thus dependence of limiting slam on the breadth of vessel i e k 2 can be written as for container vessels k 2 f b r e a d t h a t 1 10 t h d r a f t o f s e c t i o n a t 0 25 l f r o m f p for tankers k 2 f b r e a d t h a t 1 10 t h d r a f t o f s e c t i o n a t 0 15 l f r o m f p in order to find the breadth b at 1 10th of the draft various vessels of different types are selected local breadths at various sections from forward end till 0 3l from fp are found table 8 summarizes the data for various vessels since lower draft governs slamming pressure for scantling calculations same draft is considered for finding k 2 in general for container vessels factor k 2 as a f b can be considered as reduction factor i e less than 1 0 because of the lesser breadth subjected to slam whereas for tankers k 2 can be considered as amplifying factor greater than 1 0 because of the larger breadth subjected to slam from table 8 it is noted that for containers b l varies from 0 041 to 0 079 at 0 25l from fp and for tankers b l varies from 0 12 to 0 138 at 0 15l from fp k 2 can be taken as k 2 10 b l from table 8 minimum value of k 2 for container vessels is 10 0 041 0 41 and maximum value of k 2 for tankers is 10 0 138 1 38 thus k 2 can be taken as 0 5 k 2 1 3 to avoid underestimation of pressure for container vessels and overestimation for tankers finally for all types of vessels b l can be found at 1 10th of the ballast draft for a section at 0 25l from fp as 18 k 2 10 b l 0 5 k 2 1 3 5 1 3 determination of max k 3 as discussed earlier u and v form of the vessels were studied in detail by ochi 1967 probability of bow emergence as a function of vessel length was discussed in detail for various speeds vessels moving in sea state 6 with light draft condition were investigated from this study it is observed that probability of bow emergence i e slamming reduces exponentially with increase in vessel length this reduction is observed to be as low as 13 for lower speeds and approximately 25 for higher speeds for both forms of the vessels refer fig 8 wherein the results of ochi 1967 are reproduced probability of slamming for two forms of vessels are shown with dotted lines curves of u form of the vessel challenger are denoted with c and v form of the vessel townsend are denoted with t based on this factor k 3 to account for the slamming variation with length of the vessel is suggested as k 3 1 57 e x p 0 01 l 2 3 factor 1 57 is taken into account such that for vessels of l l 300 m k 3 1 0 for l 300 m k 3 will be less than 1 0 and for l 300 m k 3 is more than 1 0 exponential variation is followed ref fig 8 k 3 variation of approximately 25 from l 300 m to l 100 m can be noted from fig 8 similarly k 3 and hence pressure decreases exponentially beyond 300 m however application of k 3 for l 100 m and l 500 m may result in incorrect slamming pressure thus additional condition for k 3 can be given as 19 k 3 1 57 e x p 0 01 l 2 3 0 84 k 3 1 25 5 1 4 applicability of limiting pressure p m a x calculated by considering its dependence on draft breadth and length of the vessel is in general applicable to various types of displacement vessels although for vessels where hull form extends below the base line e g sonar domes fitted on naval vessels p m a x as discussed in this section is not directly applicable this is because the local breadth at 0 15l or 0 25l from fp at 1 10th of draft is much less than at dome resulting in much less pressure thus formula for k 2 is needs to be modified for calculation of slam loads on sonar domes a detailed study of naval vessel dtmb for slamming load calculations on its dome is made and is discussed in section 9 6 variation of slamming pressure along the length of vessel although maximum pressure can be calculated using eq 13 the limiting pressures at individual frame locations along the length of the vessel must be determined to ensure structure integrity subjected these slam pressures in order to determine the nature of the slamming pressures along the length of the vessel numerical studies based on computational fluid dynamics cfd are carried out for different types of vessels the ranse based finite volume code starccm is used for the computations since the slamming pressures are most crucial in the forward region of the vessel various bow geometries are considered for the computations the purpose of this study is to capture the variation observed in the slamming pressure along the length of the vessel and not to verify or validate the magnitude of pressure with the analytical calculations cfd based computations are carried out under some assumptions as follows 1 waves are not modelled 2 pitching motion equal to the extreme pitch θ e x t is imposed on the hull at the vessel cog and the vessel s other degrees of freedom are frozen the pitch motion for the simulation is defined as θ e x t θ e x t sin 2 π t p i t c h t where pitching period t p i t c h 1 8 l g irs 2017 3 the forward speed is duplicated by a current equal to the maximum speed and in the opposite direction to the vessel 4 computational domain mesh and time step in each case are used as per the standard practice ittc 2011 dhavalikar et al 2015 although the mesh and time dependency studies are not carried out an appropriate mesh count and time is chosen based on standard practice of keeping courant number within 1 0 near hull surface two types of vessels namely tankers and containers are chosen for the numerical simulations details of each type of vessel are given in table 1 the detailed method to develop the linear normalized pressure envelope to enclose wide range of length of the vessel is described in the following section 6 1 pressure envelope for the impact pressures the method is described below for a single vessel container kcs and the same methodology is applied to all the analysed vessels initially cfd simulation is carried out for finding impact pressure in the bow region of the vessel cfd provides the time varying nature of the pressures at a given location pressure along the length is computed at various points along the centre line up to 30 length from the fp sample points are shown in fig 9 in order to capture the maximum or the slam pressure at each frame location points time varying pressures are monitored and compiled these computed time varying pressures at point 1 point 41 and point 65 as a sample are shown in fig 10 which is a representation of the occurrence of slamming at different points it can be observed that peak pressure at point 1 occurs approximately at 3 0 s first peak whereas for point 65 peak is observed beyond 5 s and for intermediate location at point 41 peak pressure is obtained at roughly 3 8 s it can be inferred from the plot that the slam at points 1 to 65 occurs in between 3 0 s and 6 s of simulation time with point 1 being the farthest and point 65 closest to fp fig 10 can be represented as pressure along the length of vessel for various time instances as shown in fig 11 the maximum pressure at any location at any given instance of time can be captured from these results fig 11 shows the complete set of variation observed along length for each time step of the simulation this plot brings out the changes in pressures taking place at a given location at any given time instance various curves represent different time instances a black dotted line is obtained by extracting the maximum pressure at each location at any instant pressure will not exceed beyond the value indicated by black dotted line this line is the limiting pressure line for the given location in order to develop envelope curve for slamming pressure the limiting pressure as obtained above is normalized by the peak pressure and is replotted as shown in fig 12 the normalized pressure along the length of the vessel is then enclosed in an envelope of linearly varying pressure enclosing all the variations observed in the cfd based limiting pressure line this gives us a linearly varying impact pressures along the length accommodating all the pressure changes in a more generic manner the linear envelope for the kcs container is also shown in fig 12 following the same procedure envelopes are generated for all container vessels ref table 1 the study concentrates on the bow region pressures and it is observed that the passenger vessel s named as container 2 bow shape is similar to other containers so this vessel is included in the study carried for container class vessel envelopes of all these vessels are superimposed by a final envelope represented by the black dashed line that covers the normalized linear lines for limiting pressures fig 13 this envelope is the limiting pressure envelope for the container vessels fig 13 shows the results for container vessel since the container vessels used are varying in length from approximately 140 m 355 m it can be concluded that in general all container vessel will follow the same trend as per fig 13 similar exercise is carried out for tankers of length varying between 210 m and 320 m the final envelope curve for tankers is shown in the fig 14 dependence of peak slamming pressure on the geometry of the container vessel and tankers is clearly depicted in the figs 13 and 14 container and tanker respectively peak pressures are observed in the region near fp for tankers due to the flat bottom sections whereas for container vessels the peak pressure shifts aft of fp due to absence of flat bottom peak pressure p max obtained in section 5 is to be varied along the length of vessel as per figs 13 and 14 depending on the type of vessel 7 sample calculations for kcs pressure is calculated along the length of the vessel based on hull shape coefficient and relative velocity as per section 3 and section 4 respectively these calculations are termed as theoretical calculations p th pressure calculations as a limiting condition are as per section 5 this pressure is termed as p max finally the pressures governing the scantlings are chosen as the minimum of the two pressure calculations and termed as p slam fig 15 tables 9 and 10 gives the details of slamming pressure calculations for kcs 8 variation along the girth slamming pressure as obtained in previous sections is applicable on bottom plating and the peak is applied at the bottommost location of the plating along the girth of the section it diminishes gradually till 1 10th of the local draft along the girth of the section vertical component of pressure can be calculated as a function of flare angle varying along the girth the detailed discussion can be referred in ochi and motter 1973 this aspect is very much important for scantling calculations of bottom shell plating in order to find the variation of the slamming pressure along the girth 2d numerical simulations are carried out three sections of the container vessel kcs at 0 05l frame 218 5 0 125l frame 201 25 and 0 175l frame 189 75 from fp are selected relative velocity at these locations as calculated from section 4 eq 12 is 10 19 m s 9 83 m s and 9 49 m s table 10 numerical simulation is carried by dropping the section on the calm water surface with the constant velocity specified trimmed structured hexahedral grids are generated volumetric grid refinements are carried out near the section and waterline zone a computational grid of 2 9 million cells was used for slamming load evaluation the time step selection is done based on the criterion satisfying courant number 0 5 for the present case a time step of 0 0007sec is used throughout the simulation to compute the slamming load slamming pressure computed from these numerical simulations is represented in fig 16 as pressure time histories for all the sections considered pressure is computed at various locations along the girth point p1 being the bottommost location the computed peak pressures are 310 kn m2 653 kn m2 and 1326 kn m2 at the frame numbers 218 5 201 25 and 189 75 respectively the slam time is different due to the variation in the drop height chosen for simulation in each case the duration of the impulse observed are very small roughly 0 02 s computed slamming pressures are generally in line with the theoretical pressure as calculated in table 10 for the frame 201 25 pressures are measured along the girth until t 0 094 s where slamming impulse diminishes from the time history the maximum of the pressure till 0 094 s of simulation duration is captured for all the locations the pressure measured at the various locations along girth till t 0 094s can be assumed to be exclusive of static pressure since the section immersion is negligible and thus the measured pressure can be directly taken as slamming pressures it is noted from the results of numerical simulation that the pressures computed beyond 0 094 s are higher especially at the locations far away from the p1 this is due the fact that static pressure is included in this pressure whereas slamming effect is diminished pressure can be calculated along the girth ochi and motter 1973 by assuming maximum pressure at the bottommost location and linearly varying till 1 10th of the draft i e p 0 kn m2 at 6 9 10 m from the bottommost location comparison of calculated pressure p ochi and the numerical computations p cfd is shown in fig 17 form fig 17 it can be observed that the numerical computations agree well with ochi s approximation slamming pressure diminishes near 1 10th of the draft considered thus for scantling calculations the slamming pressure can be assumed to be linearly varying along the girth till 1 10th of the local draft 9 results of slamming pressure slamming pressure calculations based on the empirical relations developed in this paper are performed for the vessels listed in table 1 draft at fp in ballast loading condition is considered for calculation of slamming pressure in each case calculated pressures are compared with empirical formulae of various classification societies viz abs 2017a b c bv 2017 dnvgl 2017b lrs 2017a b etc and the pressures based on csr 2015 fig 18 shows the slamming pressures calculated for container vessels results of passenger vessel are also included in fig 18 results of the slamming pressure for tankers are shown in fig 19 it is observed that each rule formulation results in varied slamming pressure however the trend of slamming pressure is similar in each case 9 1 naval vessel dtmb sonar dome of the vessel dtmb extends below the base line of the hull because of the typical geometry circular sections of the dome huge slamming pressure is expected at the dome bottom since dome is generally made of special material the classification society prescriptive rules of steel ships are not directly valid for scantling calculations of dome structure rather direct strength assessment can be carried out by using pressure obtained from calculation as per methodology given by ochi and motter 1973 various classification societies have developed rules specific to naval vessels considering its fine form and specific operational requirements in the present work the theoretical pressure calculations as per section 4 can be used for finding extreme slamming load on dome which is considered unrealistic for dome hence required to be limited by appropriately modifying the applicable formulations as discussed in section 5 limiting condition of pressure of section 5 is applicable to displacement vessels v l 1 86 and for dtmb v l 1 3 thus equations of section 5 can be applied for dtmb draft at fp local draft is considered for finding k 1 in section 5 for sonar dome the local draft varies over the length of the dome and is generally higher than draft at fp thus the highest local draft over the length of the dome can be considered for using to find k 1 breadth dependent coefficient k 2 is derived in section 5 considering the extent of slamming over the vessel length this extent exceeds the length of the dome i e entire dome is subjected to slamming load thus it would be appropriate to assume k 2 1 0 for dome in order to obviate the effect of breadth k 3 being the parameter for probability of slamming remains unchanged for the case of sonar dome of dtmb the values of these coefficients turn out to be k 1 4 86 for a draft of 6 35 m and k 3 1 19 maximum pressure obtained is p max 689 6 kn m2 calculated average wave height for this pressure calculation is 9 61 m variation of the pressure along the length is found following the methodology as described in section 6 for this purpose the pressure only at the dome bottom is plotted and shown in fig 20 pressure calculations using the theoretical formulation i e without limit as per section 4 p th are also performed and shown in fig 21 pressure calculations using classification society rules abs 2017c dnv gl 2015a and lrs 2017a are also shown in fig 21 the calculation results indicate huge pressures 1000 kn m2 along the length of the dome fig 21 this is due to the fact that very high sea state corresponding to h sig 13 6 m as per eq 5 is used for the pressure calculations in practice naval vessels with dome are unlikely exposed to such severe wave height thus for practical purpose realistic h sig should be taken into account to find impact pressure on dome classification society rules take into account factors such as probability of slamming wave head e g lrs 2017a for finding slamming load for naval vessels wave head considered in present calculation lrs is cw 5 28 m i e h sig of 10 6 m abs 2017c rules for high speed naval crafts suggest the operational limiting condition of h sig 4 m whereas survival condition of h sig 6 m the mission requirement for vessel fitted with sonar dome may be to operate at high speed but relatively lesser wave heights thus various factors need to be used judiciously to get realistic values of loads for input to scantling calculations 10 scantlings as discussed in section 8 calculated slamming pressures are applicable only till 1 10th of the draft of the vessel the slamming pressure is calculated for ballast draft which results in highest possible impact pressure on the forward bottom of the vessel for rest of the hull scantlings would be governed by the combined static and dynamic pressures empirical relations for finding dynamic pressures and associated scantlings of structural members are available e g classification society rules these pressures are to be calculated for design draft the pressure variation for a frame of kcs 0 125l from fp is shown in fig 22 the combined static and dynamic pressure is called as total pressure the calculated slamming pressure varies linearly from maximum at baseline to the value of zero at 1 10th of the draft 0 69 m from baseline in the presented case slamming pressure is governing from baseline till 0 6 m above baseline abl and the total pressure is governing pressure above 0 6 m abl the net pressure evaluated along the girth is as shown in fig 22 d scantling calculations based on various classification society rules are performed to decide on the bottom plating thickness the calculations for container 1 and tanker 2 are performed and compared with provided thickness from available drawings the computed thicknesses are the net thickness without corrosion addition as the magnitude of corrosion margin varies for each of the classification society rules it is not considered in the comparison in case of scantling of container 1 it is observed from fig 23 that provided thickness forward of 0 3l from fp is higher than the calculated thickness from all classification society rule requirements the trend of thickness variation along length is almost similar between all classification society rules the thickness computation based on new pressure formulation is indicated by t slam shows that the computed thickness is less than the provided thickness and trend of thickness variation along the length is agrees well with provided thickness the scantling comparison for tanker 2 is as shown in fig 24 the comparison shows that the provided thicknesses are more than the calculated thickness except as calculated by lrs 2017b rules the provided thickness is constant i e 19 mm forward of 0 3l 0 05l from fp whereas at fp it is 22 mm it is observed that there is decrease in the scantling requirement near to fp 0 05l fwd of fp as per classification rules whereas provided thickness is increased in the region near to fp this is due to the owners extra voluntary addition thickness indicated on the available drawing the thickness computation as per new pressure formulation is less than the provided 10 1 future scope the presented formulation for slamming loads is valid for bottom impact only these pressures are governed by deadrise angle of the section of the hull on the other hand bow impact pressures are governed by deadrise as well as waterline angle also bow impact pressures are strongly dependent on forward speed of the vessel these aspects need to be further investigated also may be noted the pressure formulation for planning crafts high speed crafts is not dealt with in present work studies on both 2d and 3d numerical analyses are covered in the present work slamming phenomena with realistic waves and vessel with forward speed can be simulated to find the pressure at bottom and bow as well as on deck due to deck wetness these simulations are very much time consuming and requires huge computational resource mesh and time step dependency with the help of mathematical techniques such as grid convergence index gci can be used for these simulations for accuracy as well as reliability of the numerical simulations these simulations are targeted in future 10 2 conclusions bottom impact load formulation derived in this paper provides the reliable loads for determination of realistic structural scantlings theoretically determined pressures as well as limiting pressure for practical purpose are the outcome of this work for wedge shaped sections deadrise angles is clearly precisely defined and empirical relations can be dependent upon to determine reliable slamming pressure however for circular sections or for common ship shape sections empirical relations of wedge are not applicable although empirical relations in terms of deadrise angle are available for ship shape section finding the deadrise angle itself is a tedious task as such a method is developed to find the deadrise angle for a given ship section and subsequently the hull shape coefficient k is derived as required for slamming load calculation 2d numerical studies compute very high pressures typically away from fp these are in accordance with the theoretical slamming pressures similar results are noted in the past literature as well this is due to the very high velocity of impact as well as higher k for the considered sections in reality 3d effects reduce the slamming pressure a methodology is developed in the presented work to account for such 3d effects to derive the practical values of impact pressure for scantling calculations slamming pressure variation along the length of the vessel as well as girth of the section is discussed in detail and verified with numerical studies trend of slamming pressure computed for various container and tanker vessels are found to be in line with the results as obtained from available published empirical formulations for a specific case of dtmb with sonar dome computations are performed with various wave conditions as suitable for operational purpose the magnitude of the slamming pressure as obtained using presented method are also found to be in line with that given by available empirical relations as evidenced in figs 18 19 and 21 based on this outcome it can be inferred that limiting pressure condition as derived in this work plays a vital role application of slamming load in combination with hydrodynamic and static pressure is discussed this aspect is very much useful for the scantling calculations overall the methodology of slamming load calculations and its application for scantling calculations can be used for any type of vessel acknowledgements the authors express their earnest gratitude to the indian register of shipping mumbai for supporting the reported work 
23389,floating breakwaters are an effective solution for protecting fragile beaches from being washed away coastlines from erosion floating structures marinas and ports from strong wave action this paper presents a literature review on the research and developments of floating breakwaters floating breakwaters may be categorized into seven main types namely the box type the pontoon type the frame type the mat type the tethered float type the horizontal plate type and other types the research and developments as well as the performance of these different types of floating breakwaters and wave attenuating devices are reviewed and discussed keywords floating breakwater wave energy dissipation transmission coefficient very large floating structure 1 introduction oceans and seas cover more than 70 of the earth surface and they continue to expand with the rising sea level due to global warming they possess a huge amount of valuable natural resources including water aquaculture oil gas and minerals that are crucial to the economic development of mankind over the past few decades the urbanization of modern metropolises and advancement of human society have led to an increasingly growing demand for more resources and space with limited resources and usable space on land mankind has embarked on the colonisation of the ocean for energy food water resources and space creation coastlines are the frontiers of land facing the seas marinas ports dockyards and floating structures along the shoreline play an important role in supporting human activities on the sea in addition ocean exploration relies heavily on marine engineering structures and facilities the protection of both coastal and offshore structures against strong wave action is of utmost significance breakwaters also known as wave attenuators are commonly seen as coastal structures that reduce the wave action in inshore waters and thereby diminish coastal erosion and provide safe harbourage they may be built from quarried rocks see fig 1 a or massive concrete caissons resting on a rock mound foundation see fig 1b integrated publishing 2017 there is no doubt that the growing offshore and maritime activities have led to the demand for larger ports with a deeper fairway depth this definitely increases the difficulty and costs in constructing conventional bottom founded breakwaters to protect harbours that are exposed to rough seas moreover the classical wave theory estimates that most wave energy is concentrated at the free surface in fact more than 90 of the total wave energy is distributed within a depth of three times the wave height below the free surface gao 2017 conventional bottom founded breakwaters are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape to resist the overturning moment at the bottom clearly the variation in the section and thus the construction materials is not compatible with the wave energy distribution along the water depth in addition these bottom founded breakwaters strongly block the natural water circulation leading to aggravated pollution and sediment issues within the protected area floating breakwaters represent an appealing alternative to their bottom founded counterparts their construction is hardly affected by the water depth and seabed conditions tidal variation and water surface elevation induced by global warming have a little effect on these floating structures they have a low profile and thus they have little visual impact on the horizon particularly for areas with high tidal variations furthermore they are environmentally friendly as they present minimal interference with the water circulation more importantly they can be easily rearranged relocated and removed with minimum effort however floating breakwaters are often criticized for their ineffectiveness in resisting long waves their mooring systems are more prone to damage under severe environmental conditions leading to drift away of the floating breakwaters that jeopardise the surrounding structures the application of floating breakwaters at least dates back to 1811 when a wooden breakwater was proposed to the admiralty to protect the plymouth sound the wooden breakwater consisted of 117 floats of wood in a triangular or prismatic form each float spans 9 m in width and depth 12 m in length and they are to be moored by iron chains stuart 1842 although the admiralty finally settled on a stone breakwater the accumulation of mud and silt and the consequent diminution of water depth within the harbor after years of constructing revealed the problems due to the installation of a fixed breakwater since then researchers and coastal engineers have paid greater attention to floating breakwaters as floating breakwaters became popular as a viable alternative solution to shoreline and harbourage protection they were proposed designed and constructed in various forms in the 1970s jones 1971 and richey and nece 1974 recognized more than 60 different floating breakwater configurations based on their geometric and functional similarities hales 1981 classified these floating breakwaters into 11 categories according to their fundamental features later mccartney 1985 separated them into 4 general categories box pontoon mat and tethered floats based on the shape and reviewed their performance in reducing wave height and evaluated their construction costs according to the wave attenuation mechanisms sawaragi 1995 classified the floating breakwaters into 3 groups reflection type reflection and wave breaking type and friction type to date more floating breakwaters with distinct shapes and wave attenuation mechanisms have been proposed tested and built modern designs often enable multiple wave attenuation mechanisms to achieve a low transmission coefficient note that transmission coefficient is defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incoming wave height and it is a key indicator of the effectiveness of floating breakwaters thus there is certainly an imperative need to review the recent research and developments as well as the performance of various floating breakwaters this review should be beneficial to not only researchers but also practicing engineers working in the area of coastal and offshore engineering the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on the research and developments of different types of floating breakwaters we shall categorize them according to their shapes somewhat similar to that of mccartney 1985 they are 1 box type 2 pontoon type 3 frame type 4 mat type 5 tethered float type 6 horizontal plate type and 7 other types section 2 presents the research and developments on box type breakwaters and also some real examples of such breakwaters that have been constructed section 3 is devoted to the review on pontoon type breakwaters section 4 discusses the research on frame type breakwaters the mat type breakwaters tethered float type and horizontal plate type are discussed in section 5 section 6 and section 7 respectively recent research and developments of other types of floating breakwaters are presented in section 8 the effectiveness of wave attenuating devices that can be coupled with different types of breakwaters is discussed in section 9 finally section 10 summarizes the conclusions and recommendations for future studies on floating breakwaters 2 box type breakwaters the prismatic rectangular box type floating breakwater see fig 2 may be the simplest type and it has been investigated extensively bottin and turner 1980 carr 1950 carver 1979 hay 1966 ofuya 1968 in the last century this type of breakwater attenuates ocean sea waves mainly through reflecting incoming waves owing to its simple geometry theoretical formulae have been derived to predict the wave transmission coefficient this includes the following classic formula obtained by macagno 1953 based on the linear wave theory and assuming zero motion of breakwater no green water on top deck and constant water depth conditions 1 k t 1 1 k i b sinh k i h 2 cosh k i h k i d 2 where k t is the transmission coefficient defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height over the incident wave height k i 2π l the incident wave number l the incident wave length b the width of the breakwater d the draft and h the water depth floating breakwaters are laterally held in position by mooring lines piles or dolphins and they are bound to take some motions under wave actions their complex performance and the corresponding mooring forces were analysed using theoretical models based on two dimensional potential theory by adee 1976 1975 1974 adee and martin 1974 adee et al 1976 and drimer et al 1992 these analytical models furnish reasonable predictions when compared to physical model tests by davidson 1971 at oak harbor in washington for the analysis of more complex systems researchers often resort to powerful numerical approaches for example diamantoulaki and angelides 2010 investigated the performance of an array of hinged floating box type breakwaters by implementing generalized modes that are built based on tent functions to represent the motion due to the hinges the performance of a submerged box type breakwater held in position by vertical and inclined mooring lines was studied by rahman et al 2006 they used a two dimensional numerical model based on the volume of fluid method in their study the navier stokes equation was employed to investigate wave breaking and vortices as waves pass by the breakwater the weight w of the breakwater was also assumed to be much smaller than the buoyancy force bf i e w bf 0 32 and 0 66 so as to avoid the undesirable impulsive mooring forces due to mooring lines slack events under wave action in order to consider the effect of the confined domain protected by the breakwater a reflective quay sidewall was considered by elchahal et al 2009 in their numerical simulations they found that the sidewall significantly influences the motion and effectiveness of the breakwater especially for short waves resonance behind the breakwater is expected to occur when the clearance distance between the breakwater and the sidewall is nl 2 where n is an integer the performance of a pile restrained flexible floating breakwater was investigated by diamantoulaki et al 2008 based on a three dimensional hydrodynamic model as compared to a rigid breakwater the hydroelasticity was found to be significant for small b l ratios but the response decreases sharply when this ratio exceeds 0 7 compared to a rigid breakwater the flexural rigidity of the flexible breakwater was found to affect the pile restraining loads for surge and pitch motions significantly for b l 0 9 tay et al 2009 studied the effect of using floating breakwaters on mitigating the hydroelastic responses of two floating hydrocarbon storage rectangular tanks arranged side by side based on a hybrid finite element boundary element approach by means of a higher order boundary element method hong et al 2002 analysed the hydroelastic behaviour of a mega float structure with the presence of box type floating breakwaters the latter two research studies were discussed in a review paper by wang et al 2010 on methods to mitigate hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures vlfs the review paper also highlighted that the effectiveness of floating box type breakwaters depends significantly on their widths mooring systems and incident wave angles as an example the width to wave length ratio b l usually needs to exceed 0 35 so as to ensure that the wave transmission coefficient k t 0 5 a high k t is often inevitable with small width to wave length ratios e g b l 0 15 in order words these narrow breakwaters are almost transparent to long waves in order to enhance the performance of box type floating breakwaters williams et al 2000 investigated the performance of two floating long boxes arranged side by side see fig 3 based on the 2 d potential theory numerical parametric studies revealed that the geometry of and the spacing between the two floating boxes as well as the mooring line stiffness are the key factors that affect the performance of the floating breakwater for instance the dual box breakwater with a narrow spacing in between is effective in reflecting long waves due to the continuation in the width whereas a larger spacing is desired for reflecting short waves as the two boxes are essentially acting as two independent breakwaters in sequence in addition by reducing the mooring line stiffness the breakwater is more effective in reflecting long waves but it also leads to a narrow frequency band of acceptable performance the performance of the dual box breakwater against short waves is insensitive to the mooring stiffness unless the mooring lines are too soft to restrain the motion of the breakwater depending on the overall configuration this dual box breakwater may outperform the single box type breakwater with the same overall dimensions the performance of a breakwater consisting of three identical box type floating modules that are flexibly connected along their longitudinal direction was investigated by loukogeorgaki et al 2014 in a 1 20 scale model test they found that the obliquity of incoming waves affects the internal forces across the connectors significantly for low wave frequency range due to the excitation of the bending mode of the breakwater these values are b l 0 25 under 60 oblique waves and b l 0 15 under 45 oblique waves under such a situation the mooring lines are also subject to great tension forces and snap loads are expected to occur for h l 0 04 furthermore this breakwater is found to be effective k t 0 5 when this b l ratio is greater than the aforementioned values and thus the orientation of the breakwater of 45 with respect to the incoming wave direction leads to the most efficient behaviour of the floating breakwater the well established theory and model test results of floating breakwaters have given confidence to coastal engineers many box type floating breakwaters have been constructed at coastal areas with mild wave conditions one example is the holy loch breakwater on the west coast of scotland see fig 4 a this 240 m long and 3 8 m wide breakwater is made of 12 identical precast concrete pontoons each weighing 42 tons and was installed onsite within a single day maritimejournal com 2017 similar structures include the 4 m wide floating breakwater protecting 260 berths at fezzano sp italy see fig 4b the kan on floating composite concrete and steel breakwater at hiroshima bay 97 8 m long 20 m wide and 3 5 m high see fig 4c and the floating breakwater in the monaco pier hercule extension project that measures 352 5 m long 28 m wide and 16 m draft see fig 4d 3 pontoon type breakwaters by imitating the popular pontoon boat designs a typical pontoon type floating breakwater comprises two or more lengthwise pontoons that are usually rigidly connected at intervals or by a deck on top of them as shown in fig 5 this design is also often referred to as double pontoon twin pontoon and sometimes catamaran type when compared with box type floating breakwaters this design increases the inertia and thus the stability without adding much to the total mass and the material cost pontoon type floating breakwaters attenuate waves in a similar way by reflection as a box breakwater in addition the gap between the two floaters allows turbulent energy dissipation early studies include the experimental tests by ofuya 1968 who reported that the draft plays a significant role in reducing the coefficient of wave transmission also k t 0 5 can be achieved by tuning the structural natural period to wave period ratio t n t to be greater than 0 65 the development of a boat basin at oak harbor washington gave attention to floating breakwaters to protect the harbor with a maximum 4 4 m tidal elevation in this project davidson 1971 proposed a pontoon design where concrete pontoons are connected by rectangular wooden modules of 13 m long and 3 m wide a 1 10 scale two dimensional model test was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the design and the mooring forces since then many theoretical and experimental studies were carried out to test the pontoon type breakwaters williams and abul azm 1997 analysed the hydrodynamic properties of a floating breakwater consisting of a pair of floating rectangular prisms connected by a rigid deck and showed that similar to the dual box breakwater williams et al 2000 the draft spacing between two prisms and mooring line stiffness have a strong effect on the wave reflection properties when compared with a single box type breakwater of the same overall dimensions and mooring stiffness this pontoon design is found to be more effective in reflecting moderate and long waves this makes the pontoon type breakwater a cost effective solution ikeno et al 1988 proposed the use of the space between the two pontoons as a pressurised air chamber see fig 6 and investigated its effect on the wave energy attenuation both theoretically and experimentally a comparison with a concave shaped floating breakwater and a single box type breakwater of the same overall dimensions showed that the use of pressurised air chamber is effective in attenuating the wave energy they also found that the performance of the breakwater can be further improved by increasing the size of the air chamber and the pressurised head weng and chou 2007 developed a numerical model based on boundary element method bem for analysing the behaviours of two arbitrary shaped pontoons connected by a rigid frame and held in position by mooring lines modelled as linear springs the study revealed that the spacing between two pontoons has a great effect on both the natural frequency and the heave motion in the high frequency range the surge motion of the breakwater was found to be insensitive to the mooring line stiffness but a higher stiffness tends to induce peak response in heave and pitch motions at higher frequencies dong et al 2008 conducted experimental studies to compare the wave transmission on a single breakwater and a double box breakwater under regular waves with or without currents the 1 40 scale model test results showed that the double box design performs better than the single box however under long waves both designs require a large width to achieve a small wave transmission coefficient i e k t 0 5 the increase in width means that more materials and stronger mooring system have to be used in the design in order to improve the effectiveness of pontoon type breakwaters in attenuating long waves koo 2009 proposed a design that makes use of the spacing between the two pontoons as a pneumatic chamber see fig 7 a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank technique was adopted in the time domain analysis to evaluate wave blocking and energy absorption he found that the pneumatic damping is most effective for energy transmission reduction when b l 0 4 and the system is thus useful for blocking long waves ji et al 2015 proposed the use of two interconnected horizontal cylinders with down hanged mesh cage filled with rubber hollow balls see model 3 in fig 8 the cage is to disturb fluid particle orbit and through the motions of balls the wave energy is further dissipated as a comparison three other configurations were considered 1 double pontoon only see model 1 in fig 8 2 double pontoon with cage only see model 2 in fig 8 and 3 single box with equivalent overall dimensions a 1 20 scale model test showed that the double pontoon design with both cage and balls outperforms the other three configurations in terms of wave attenuation this design also performs reasonably well in long waves k t in the range of 0 7 0 8 for b l 0 2 where the rest designs are almost transparent to the incoming waves however the forces on the seaward mooring lines were found to be at least 50 greater than model 1 and single box model owing to the existence of the mesh cage a small difference in mooring forces between model 2 and model 3 revealed that the balls do not bring further burden to the mooring systems very recently a three dimensional model test demonstrated the effectiveness of the design ji et al 2016b the experimental results showed that the design is effective for b l 0 25 under both beam sea and oblique wave conditions it is also interesting to note that a decreasing trend in wave transmission coefficient was observed after k t reaching its peak value around 0 9 for b l 0 15 to less than 0 8 for longer waves when b l 0 125 the model test results suggested that higher degree of oscillation of the breakwater under long waves helps disperse more wave energy the researchers also suggested that the sway period be designed to avoid the most possible wave frequency at a given sea condition to ensure effective wave attenuation 4 frame type breakwaters frame type floating breakwaters are often a combination of pontoons and frames or truss structures they attenuate waves through both reflection by pontoons as well as turbulence and disturbance by frames earlier test examples include the a frame merlevede 2012 see fig 9 and twin log jackson 1964 floating breakwater because of the readily available timber in north america modern designs usually resort to concrete or steel pontoons for both strength and durability one example is the floating breakwater constructed at the port of brownsville marina located in port orchard bay washington in 1999 allyn et al 2001 this breakwater incorporates submerged porous treated timber wave fences installed on the sides of the concrete pontoons so as to reduce wave transmission shen et al 2016 eight concrete pontoon units were connected to each other by a rubber cushion shear tube and bolt assembly on each side of the pontoon and were held in position by steel piles both numerical and model test results showed that the structure is effective in reducing wave heights in oblique waves the use of engineered timber material in the design could lead to a relatively inexpensive solution for marina protection however timber structures suffer from low strength and poor durability thus they may not be suitable for use in a very harsh environment besides the design combining pontoon and timber nakamura 1999 proposed a floating breakwater comprising two rectangular floats connected by horizontal cylinders see fig 10 a these cylinders were placed near the water surface to dissipate wave energy by means of wave slamming phenomenon an experimental study revealed that this design is not as effective as a box type breakwater of similar overall dimensions in attenuating short waves i e b l 0 25 to further improve its performance additional footing plates and l shaped plates were attached to the floats see fig 10b c to alter the natural period of heave motion of the breakwater to a longer period in addition the l shaped plates also amplify the surrounding wave motions to further dissipate the wave energy both alterations were shown to achieve higher wave energy dissipation as compared to the box type breakwater mani 2014 proposed a y frame breakwater by installing evenly spaced cylindrical pipes to the bottom of a pontoon with trapezoidal cross section see fig 11 the 1 20 scale model test results suggested that k t is expected to be in the range of 0 35 0 65 for a low b l ratio in the range from 0 096 to 0 224 this implies that the onsite installation activities can be substantially reduced as compared to box type and pontoon type breakwaters that usually requires the b l ratio to be greater than 0 3 in order to achieve the desired effectiveness i e k t to be at least equal to 0 5 on the other hand the mooring forces are expected to increase exponentially with the dimensionless quantity h gt 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the wave period and they are found to be substantially greater 13 5 than those reported by davidson 1971 for a pontoon type floating breakwater of similar wave and structural parameters subsequently a cage type floating breakwater using cylinder frames and double pontoon breakwater was proposed by murali and mani 1997 see fig 11 when compared to the previous y frame design the cage configuration was found to be 10 20 more efficient in controlling the k t they also recommended a b l ratio of 0 14 0 18 for controlling the transmitted waves within the desirable limits the frames in cage types breakwater have no doubt contributed to the wave energy dissipation but they also increase the construction cost a 50 increase in the cost when compared with the y frame design in addition to attaching frame structures to the bottom of the floating boxes pontoons matsunaga et al 2002 and uzaki et al 2011 investigated the effect of attaching truss structures at the front and rear faces of a steel box type floating breakwaters see fig 12 they found that the truss in front of the pontoon can break incident waves resulting in an improved wave attenuation as compared to a single pontoon 5 mat type breakwaters approximately 70 of the world rubber consumption is attributed to the tyre industry however only a small portion of used tyres are recycled this leaves the industry a huge challenge in seeking pollution free disposal or reuse of these worn out tyres for other applications hales 1981 in 1963 stitt and noble 1963 invented the wave maze in which scrap truck tyres filled with flotation materials were assembled a geometric configuration was formed such that both top and bottom layers of tyres were bolted to the centre portion of vertical tyres arranged in a triangular pattern see fig 13 a this system attenuates incoming waves mainly by friction along the wetted surface and also by disturbing the wave particle orbits the efficiency of the wave maze was tested by kamel and davidson 1968 and noble 1976 1969 and the results suggested that the width shall be at least the half length of the wave length to ensure effective attenuation also the height of the breakwater needs to exceed the wave height h for h 1 2 m the successful study on this resilient floating breakwater soon attracted interests from both researchers and the rubber industry the goodyear tire and rubber company studied the use of scrap tyres for wave attenuation the modular design consisting of interlocking scrap tyre bundles with high strength rope or cable is now known as goodyear candle 1974 see fig 13b kowalski 1974 investigated the design of stacked layers of scrap automobile tyres fastened together harms et al 1982 proposed the wave guard design which utilized structural logs such as telephone poles and concrete beams that were threaded by scrap tyres see fig 13c these poles together with scrap tyres were connected to each other using conveyor belting together with wave maze and goodyear these three configurations received many attentions in the experimental studies model testing results showed that the wave guard design which has both large inertia and stiffness dissipates waves more effectively as compared to the other two configurations mccartney 1985 inspired by the wave guard design wu et al 2002 proposed a modular design utilizing steel tubes and scrap tyres see fig 14 each module comprises two parallel steel tubes threaded with tyres and spaced apart the two tubes are connected by a layer of tyres interlocked by leather belts the modules may be connected by either flexible or rigid connectors in their experimental study a 1 35 scale model was considered and found that a minimum k t 0 22 can be achieved under short waves besides scrap tyres other materials have also been considered in the design of a mat type floating breakwater for example wu et al 2001 proposed using linking an array of circular wooden blocks by nylon ropes see fig 15 this duckweed like floating structure is found to effectively dissipate short waves i e k t 0 4 for b l 2 5 yang and wu 2003 investigated the effectiveness of bamboo rafts with different configurations see fig 16 they found that the trapezoidal and combined triangular configurations attracted large wave forces thereby resulting in noticeable sway motions and large mooring forces for single layered rafts the mooring forces are substantially smaller as the wave energy is mainly dissipated through friction along the wetted surface and elastic deformation of the raft instead of wave reflection however the width of a single layered raft needs to exceed the wave length to ensure an effective attenuation i e k t 0 5 for b l 1 3 hegde et al 2007 proposed the design of multi layered horizontally interlaced pvc circular tubes see fig 17 a 1 30 scale model test suggested that for b l 1 0 k t is in the range of 0 6 0 8 depending on the wave steepness computational intelligence techniques such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis patil et al 2011 and the hybrid genetic algorithm tuned support vector machine regression ga svmr model patil et al 2012 were subsequently employed to predict the wave transmission of such a breakwater design the hydroelastic response a flexible mat type floating breakwater with internal flexible connections was also studied by loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the researchers adopted the mode superposition technique and the wet modes of the breakwater structure with added mass and hydrostatic gravitational stiffness were employed their study results showed that the existence of the internal connections affects the heave motion of the breakwater when faced with long waves i e 0 07 b l 0 3 also the effectiveness of the breakwater is significantly affected by the rotational stiffness of the connections for roughly the same range of the aforementioned b l ratio where the increase in the rotational stiffness tends to reduce the effectiveness of the breakwater the use of scrap and recycled materials is definitely a giant advantage of mat type floating breakwaters and for the circular economy unlike box type and pontoon type breakwaters that attenuate waves mainly by reflection mat type breakwaters dissipate wave energy through friction along their wetted surfaces and by disturbing wave particle orbits this significantly alleviate the burden on the mooring systems however most of the designs require the width to be in the same order of the incoming wave length which could result in a large footprint in order to reduce the height of long waves thus there is still work to be done on improving their effectiveness under long waves so that the sea space can be reduced 6 tethered float type breakwaters tethered type floating breakwaters are a unique group comprising a number of floaters tethered to the seabed or ballast modules under the water surface and these floaters move like inverted swinging pendulums under waves the pioneers working on this type of floating breakwaters include professor jones hales 1981 jones 1978 who proposed to use a mobile system consisting of a large number of spherical floaters tethered to reinforced concrete units see fig 18 for the protection of a container off loading and transfer system whose efficiency is significantly affected by waves with periods between 2 and 7 s the study concluded that this tethered type floating breakwater is able to achieve 50 reduction of the significant wave height associated with the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum with 7 s peak period jones 1978 unlike the other types of breakwater discussed above that mainly utilize their inertia to dissipate waves by reflection and friction tethered floats attenuate waves through drag arising from the buoy motion due to the wave pressure gradient this design was no later given attention and a feasibility study was carried out to evaluate its commercialization potential hales 1981 since experimental studies suggested that the energy dissipation is little attributed to wave scattering and reflection seymour and isaacs 1974 and seymour and hanes 1979 developed analytical models for the tethered float type of breakwaters considering only fluid drag dissipation in the form of quadratic damping the theoretical models developed showed that the number of floaters or the dimension of the floater array is determined by the desired wave attenuation they also found that the performance of the breakwater is insensitive to the tether length and suggested that the reasonable characteristic dimension of the floaters shall be in the same order of the significant wave height vethamony et al 1992 derived the added mass and damping coefficients for a single spherical tethered float based on potential theory and studied the relationship between the wave exciting force amplitude and the damping coefficient the effect of depth of submergence of the float on added mass and damping coefficient however was not considered in their study subsequently vethamony and sastry 1993 discussed the role of the relative velocity between a tethered spherical float and wave particle in the evaluation of the fluid drag force and drag power vethamony 1995 improved his theoretical model by accounting for the effect of submergence of the float and used it to predict the effectiveness of a tethered spherical float in wave attenuation the study showed that k t increases with respect to increasing float size due to the decrease in float velocity he also concluded that the system performs well when the float is just submerged however a comparison between the theoretical and experimental results suggested that the theoretical model tends to overestimate the wave attenuation besides spherical floaters stacked cylindrical tanks or scrap tyres can also be used hales 1981 mccartney 1985 moreover hales 1981 and jones 1978 have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different ballast modular designs concrete barge type concrete articulated frame and steel frame the steel frame ballast modules made from scrap railroad rails together with floaters consisting of stacked scrap automobile tyres filled with polyurethane foam were installed at an ocean site near san diego california in 1977 as the mooring lines are important components in the tethered float system their performance is also studied for example the cables chains may experience a transient but violent snap load from a slack condition to a taut condition suddenly the snap loads could jeopardise their life span and such effect was studied by many researchers huang and vassalos 1993 liu 1973 papazoglou et al 1990 plaut et al 2000 7 horizontal plate type breakwaters researchers are also interested in using horizontal plates to attenuate incoming waves the rigidity and the size of the plate are two key factors affecting its wave attenuation performance in this research direction dong et al 2008 proposed a board net design made of a thin plane board with rows of polyethylene nets underneath see fig 19 in this configuration the board is designed to suppress the wave particle motion in the vertical direction while the nets disturb the particle orbits the nets can also be used to constitute an aquaculture cage model test results suggested that the board alone has poor wave attenuation efficiency k t 0 5 unless the width of the board is sufficiently large e g 100 m the nets not only help to reduce k t but they are also found to slow down the current speed by approximately 20 in their scaled model tests the researchers further suggested that the nets be arranged at intervals of 20 m to achieve satisfactory performance the performance of a single elastic thin plate as a floating breakwater was also examined by shugan et al 2012 in their theoretical study flexible plates with length much shorter than the incoming wave length are found to be ineffective in wave attenuation when compared with a rigid plate however for plate length in the same magnitude of the wave length and beyond the elastic plate may be more efficient than a rigid plate in reducing the k t this is due to the fact that the plate vibration induced waves can effectively reduce the transmitted waves through phase cancellation once the elasticity of the plate is property tuned very recently koley and sahoo 2017 developed an analytical tool for the analysis of oblique wave scattering due to a floating flexible porous membrane the study suggested that k t is significantly affected by the porosity and the membrane tension besides the design with only one plate floating on the water surface the idea of using multi layered horizontal plates to break waves by suppressing wave particle motion in the vertical direction has also generated interest in many researchers for example cheong and patarapanich 1992 studied the reflection and transmission coefficients of a horizontal double plate system consisting of a seaward surface plate and a submerged leeward plate by using numerical simulations and experimental tests they found that the optimal submergence to water depth ratio of the leeward plate is 0 1 0 2 for minimum wave transmission the performance of a submerged double plate breakwater with the upper plate porous and the lower plate solid was analysed by liu et al 2008 wang and shen 1999 developed an analytical solution to wave reflection and transmission over a group of submerged horizontal plates using the eigenfunction expansion approach they found that the wave reflection and transmission are affected by the plate length submergence of the top plate and the relative water depth by using the same technique usha and gayathri 2005 analysed the double plate problem with the top plate floating at the free surface and found that the optimal plate width is about 0 37 0 39 times that of the wave length when the relative submergence spacing 0 22 to 0 23 for minimum wave transmission the performance of a submerged double thick plates system was studied by liu et al 2009 and they concluded that the top plate should be installed near the free surface the reduction in plate thickness is also effective in enhancing the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater in practice takaki et al 2001 kanda et al 2001 and fujikubo et al 2001 studied the performance of a sub plate floating breakwater this breakwater consisting of a bottom plate and two submerged top plates that are attached to floating cylinders see fig 20 when incident wave propagates into the submerged plate the flow due to the wave is accelerated around the weather side edge of the plate while strong reverse flow is generated around the lee side edge these two flows hit on the plate and the resulting wave breaking and wave fission dissipates the incident wave energy lo and liu 2014 as fast fluid velocity is generated at the upper submerged plate strong lifting forces act on these plates thereby resulting in the floating breakwater heaving upwards the effectiveness of this breakwater was found to be largely dependent on its submerged depth this configuration was also found to block lesser flows thereby alleviating the burden on the mooring systems 8 other types the demand for economical and effective floating breakwaters have also led to many innovative designs that do not fit so well in the categories described above the design reported by ohkusu et al 1991 and ikegami et al 1994 is one of them this design allows water to flow inside the breakwater see fig 21 and makes use of the internal wave motion to reduce the transmitted wave height the internal channels are sophistically designed to mobilize multiple modes of internal water winding flow for a wide range wave period and performs well even under relatively long waves k t 0 5 for l b up to 7 0 this design known as the resonance type was realised and installed at the aquaculture ground offshore hegushi area kagoshima prefecture japan in 1998 one year later a destructive typhoon hit the west japan when the breakwater was partially damaged but yet it still served its purpose and the aquaculture ground did not lose its function arami et al 2007 this design was subsequently employed by sundaravadivelu et al 2013 in their experimental test to study the feasibility of carrying wind turbines off the shore of agathi island india plastic float modules that are commonly seen at marinas can also be linked together to reduce incoming wave height wavebrake comprises lldpe linear low density polyethylene cubic units linked together by using high strength lines see fig 22 a this system disrupts the laminar flow of waves and channels the resulting turbulence into the porous cavities between the modules and is suitable for protecting small marinas and beaches against short waves and wakes k t is about 0 5 under 4 6 s waves of height up to 1 8 m wavebreak 2017 similar designs include the famous whisprwave see fig 22b made of hdpe high density polyethylene modules whisprwave 2017 and the porous floating breakwater made of perforated diamond shaped blocks see fig 22c by wang and sun 2010 compared to conventional box type and pontoon type floating breakwaters these porous breakwaters exhibit a relatively lower transmission coefficient they also reflect lesser waves that alleviates the burden on the mooring system furthermore the design of the porous cavities including the shape and layout leads to a more effective wave energy dissipation when compared with the mat type floating breakwaters and thus their widths are usually much smaller however both porous and mat type breakwaters are subjected to limited buoyancy force this requires a careful design of the mooring system to hold them in place firmly a spar buoy floating breakwater was proposed by liang et al 2004 this design comprises an array of submerged hdpe pipes tethered to the seabed by pretensioned mooring lines see fig 23 theoretical models for the predicting the wave transmission were developed and validated by experimental results parametric study showed that this design is most effective k t 0 3 when s l 0 3 and d b 7 in which s is the spacing between two adjacent fence rows d the diameter of the buoy and b the clear spacing between two adjacent units in the same row similar to the frame structures in the frame type breakwaters these spar buoys dissipate the waves energy mainly by disturbing the wave particle orbits and reflecting incoming waves one advantage of this design is that the footprint can be easily scaled up or down and the configuration of the spar buoys can be rearranged if needed however it is expected that this design can lead to a larger footprint as compared to the frame type breakwaters due to the lack of floating pontoons that reflect incoming waves 9 wave attenuating devices in addition to the different types of floating breakwaters discussed in the previous sections there are also designs of wave attenuating devices that can be employed in combination with the breakwaters to achieve an improved performance in dissipating the wave energy the vertical plate is one example among these designs christian 2000 and gesraha 2006 proposed attaching vertical plates to the bottom of a floating box to disturb the wave particle orbits they found that these plates can help reduce the transmission coefficient but an increase in k t may be observed for short waves alizadeh et al 2014 investigated the arrangement of the vertical plates and concluded that by attaching two rows of plates to both the front and the rear of the box a smaller k t is observed as compared to the case of only one row of plate attached to the centre of the box bottom koutandos and prinos 2011 studied the effectiveness of attaching either a vertical porous or impermeable plate to the front end of a box type breakwater both numerically and experimentally and they found that the breakwater with the impermeable plate is more effective but at the expense of larger mooring forces recently ji et al 2016a studied the design of attaching both horizontal and vertical porous plates to the top surface of the floater see fig 24 physical test results showed that the porous plates result in an improved inertia and motion damping such that the heave and roll motions are reduced also their study examined the use of a mesh cage design whose performance is similar to the porous floating breakwater xiao et al 2016 proposed the design of attaching two layers of perforated walls to a ring shaped very large floating structure vlfs as shown in fig 25 the performances of the design in terms of motion wave attenuation and mooring forces were investigated by carrying out a model test with a 1 80 scale ratio they found that the perforated walls with smaller porosity are most effective in wave attenuation in a mild environment where the interaction between the wave particles and the porous plates is strong the effectiveness of the breakwater is observed to be limited when facing long incident waves due to the fact that only the part of the waves close to the free surface is affected by the porous walls in addition to designs using impermeable or porous vertical plates nakamura et al 2001 investigated the performance of a double walled barrier comprising an impermeable wall on the shore side and an array of inclined plates on the seaside see fig 26 the inclined plates were found to enhance the generation of vortex flow that effectively dissipates the wave energy with lesser wave reflections as compared to a vertical impermeable plate the researchers also investigated the effect of the orientation of these inclined plates and they found that the downslope model reflects less waves than the up fin model but the wave transmission coefficient is virtually unaffected by the orientation the introduction of a horizontal plate attached to the bottom of the barrier was also found to improve the wave energy dissipation makimoto and nakamura 2007 although this double walled barrier is pile supported in the original design the design principles can be adopted in the design of a wave attenuating device floating breakwaters can also be equipped with hydraulic jets discharging water in the opposite direction of the train of surface waves the discharged water forms a current dissipating wave energy by partial or even complete wave breaking as early as the late 1960s rao 1968 and nece et al 1968 have foreseen the important application of hydraulic breakwaters in deep seas where the wave energy concentrates at the free surface as the efficiency of hydraulic breakwaters relies heavily on the jet power the early experimental works involved only the manifold discharging water chiu et al 1996 attached hydraulic jets to three horizontal cylinders linked together in an inclined arrangement test results showed that k t is about 0 8 without surface current formed by the jets the discharged water flow can significantly bring down the k t especially for short waves they also suggested that the draft be increased to compensate the discharge rate constraint due to economic reasons wave energy convertors such as oscillating water columns owcs also find their application as a wave attenuating device maeda et al 2000 investigated the reduction in the hydroelastic response of a vlfs with two different owcs in their study two numerical approaches were developed namely the 3d source distribution method and the equivalent floating body method both methods were found to agree well with experimental results they also found that the owc devices are effective in mitigating the hydroelastic response of the vlfs hong et al 2006 studied the effect of a freely floating owc breakwater on shielding a vlfs based on an analytical approach see fig 27 a parametric study was conducted by varying the wave period in the range of 6 s 20 s with a 30 m water depth the results showed that the effectiveness of the floating owc breakwater is dependent on the damping coefficient of the air chamber γ and the spacing between the breakwater and the vlfs ds furthermore its effectiveness can be improved by increasing the width of both the air chamber and the submerged bottom plate in addition to freely floating owc breakwaters hong and hong 2007 investigated the performance of a floating owc device attached to a vlfs through a pin connection see fig 27 the effectiveness of a pile supported owc breakwater was examined by he and huang 2014 in their experimental study a symmetric owc box with a slot on the top surface was considered the slot covers 20 of the top surface and is reserved for mounting plates with different orifice openings see fig 28 both slot and orifice openings with three opening ratios namely 0 625 1 25 and 1 875 were examined in addition two extreme cases with fully opened 20 opening ratio and full closed plates were also tested the researchers found that the owc device with an orifice opening ratio of 0 625 achieved the smallest k t a half wave height reduction k t 0 5 can be observed for b l 0 22 in their experimental tests a smaller b l ratio can be achieved by increasing the draft of the breakwater in addition these devices with pneumatic chambers have also been introduced to the floating breakwaters this includes the design of a floating box with symmetric pneumatic chambers on both the seaside and the leeside by he et al 2012 and later with asymmetric pneumatic chambers he et al 2013 see fig 29 the latter is an improved version with a 1 3 width ratio between the chamber in front and the one at the rear this configuration was found to increase air pressure fluctuation in both chambers experimental results also showed that k t 0 35 can be achieved for b l 0 5 and minimum transmission coefficient is obtained for b l 0 42 10 conclusions presented herein is a literature review on the research activities and developments of floating breakwaters over the past few decades the analytical numerical and experimental methods used in studying the effectiveness of various types of floating breakwaters in wave attenuation were also reviewed the box type and pontoon type floating breakwaters are the most common designs and they are effective in protecting the shoreline mainly by reflecting incoming waves their regular configurations enable economical and efficient construction and installation compared to box type breakwaters pontoon designs enjoy larger inertia in roll without much increase in the material extensive studies on the performance of different designs have been conducted and many innovative configurations such as porous plates and pneumatic chambers have also been introduced to reduce the wave transmission in practice both box and pontoon widths usually need to be at least one third of the target wave length for satisfactory wave attenuation this however makes the construction cost unfavourable when facing long waves a combination of boxes or pontoons and frames leads to the frame type of floating breakwaters these breakwaters not only reduce transmitted wave height by wave reflection but they also disturb wave particle orbits by using the frames experimental results have shown their effectiveness in attenuating incoming waves even with a low b l ratio mat type floating breakwaters are very cost effective as they are made of scrap and recycled materials also they can be constructed with unskilled labour as the name implies these breakwaters generally have larger plan dimensions than their depth they dissipate most wave energy through friction between the floaters and the water wave particles and reflect much fewer waves as compared to the pontoons however most designs require the width to be larger than the incoming wave length resulting in a huge footprint in the sea the floater materials are also susceptible to deterioration in a harsh marine environment their life span is usually less than 20 years tethered floats oscillate as inverted pendulums under wave actions and their wave attenuation characteristics are broadband simple yet effective analytical models are available to predict the performance on wave attenuation through the fluid drag together with modular construction they can be tailored to meet the prescribed limit imposed on the transmitted wave height this makes them particularly attractive for protecting coastal construction and operation projects as this type of floating breakwaters contains many tethered floats great attention should be paid to the design and maintenance of the mooring lines horizontally arranged floating and submerged plates also dissipate incoming wave energy effective by suppressing the wave particle orbits in the vertical direction as well as wave breaking and wave fission induced by the collision between the accelerated incoming waves at the fore edge of the submerged plate and the strong reverse flow generated at the aft edge for a single floating plate to be effective in attenuate incoming waves its width needs to be in the same magnitude of the wave length and beyond the performance may be improved by tuning the elasticity of the plate properly such that the radiated waves can effectively reduce the transmitted waves through phase cancellation alternatively the floating plate can be used in combination with submerged plates besides these traditional types of floating breakwaters many other designs with distinct configurations and wave attenuation mechanisms have also been invented and studied these include the resonance type which performs very well even under relatively long waves the porous breakwaters and spar buoy wave attenuators made from readily available hdpe modules in addition there are various designs of wave attenuating devices that could be employed in combination with different types of floating breakwaters and even conventional bottom founded breakwaters to enhance the wave attenuating performance these include the vertical impermeable and porous plates to reflect incoming waves the hydraulic jets that discharge water in the opposite direction of the surface waves and the floating pneumatic chambers that reduce incident wave height by extracting the wave energy the floating breakwaters are very attractive solutions to shoreline harbourage and coastal construction and aquaculture protection against wave action as human activities progress towards deeper seas the marine environment becomes harsher and waves become fiercer this poses challenges to the floating breakwater design to ensure that they not only survive severe storms but also serve their purpose of protecting the construction and operation of offshore structures both enhancements to the current configurations and new designs for achieving satisfactory performance under long waves are always the key driver for further research further studies may also include the research on fluid structure foundation interaction and the capacity and failure mechanism of mooring lines and anchors under snap loads or cyclic loads other interesting lines of investigation are the use of attachable devices or structures to serve as windbreakers and marine energy converters these devices and structures will add value to the floating breakwaters acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the australian research council

23389,floating breakwaters are an effective solution for protecting fragile beaches from being washed away coastlines from erosion floating structures marinas and ports from strong wave action this paper presents a literature review on the research and developments of floating breakwaters floating breakwaters may be categorized into seven main types namely the box type the pontoon type the frame type the mat type the tethered float type the horizontal plate type and other types the research and developments as well as the performance of these different types of floating breakwaters and wave attenuating devices are reviewed and discussed keywords floating breakwater wave energy dissipation transmission coefficient very large floating structure 1 introduction oceans and seas cover more than 70 of the earth surface and they continue to expand with the rising sea level due to global warming they possess a huge amount of valuable natural resources including water aquaculture oil gas and minerals that are crucial to the economic development of mankind over the past few decades the urbanization of modern metropolises and advancement of human society have led to an increasingly growing demand for more resources and space with limited resources and usable space on land mankind has embarked on the colonisation of the ocean for energy food water resources and space creation coastlines are the frontiers of land facing the seas marinas ports dockyards and floating structures along the shoreline play an important role in supporting human activities on the sea in addition ocean exploration relies heavily on marine engineering structures and facilities the protection of both coastal and offshore structures against strong wave action is of utmost significance breakwaters also known as wave attenuators are commonly seen as coastal structures that reduce the wave action in inshore waters and thereby diminish coastal erosion and provide safe harbourage they may be built from quarried rocks see fig 1 a or massive concrete caissons resting on a rock mound foundation see fig 1b integrated publishing 2017 there is no doubt that the growing offshore and maritime activities have led to the demand for larger ports with a deeper fairway depth this definitely increases the difficulty and costs in constructing conventional bottom founded breakwaters to protect harbours that are exposed to rough seas moreover the classical wave theory estimates that most wave energy is concentrated at the free surface in fact more than 90 of the total wave energy is distributed within a depth of three times the wave height below the free surface gao 2017 conventional bottom founded breakwaters are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape to resist the overturning moment at the bottom clearly the variation in the section and thus the construction materials is not compatible with the wave energy distribution along the water depth in addition these bottom founded breakwaters strongly block the natural water circulation leading to aggravated pollution and sediment issues within the protected area floating breakwaters represent an appealing alternative to their bottom founded counterparts their construction is hardly affected by the water depth and seabed conditions tidal variation and water surface elevation induced by global warming have a little effect on these floating structures they have a low profile and thus they have little visual impact on the horizon particularly for areas with high tidal variations furthermore they are environmentally friendly as they present minimal interference with the water circulation more importantly they can be easily rearranged relocated and removed with minimum effort however floating breakwaters are often criticized for their ineffectiveness in resisting long waves their mooring systems are more prone to damage under severe environmental conditions leading to drift away of the floating breakwaters that jeopardise the surrounding structures the application of floating breakwaters at least dates back to 1811 when a wooden breakwater was proposed to the admiralty to protect the plymouth sound the wooden breakwater consisted of 117 floats of wood in a triangular or prismatic form each float spans 9 m in width and depth 12 m in length and they are to be moored by iron chains stuart 1842 although the admiralty finally settled on a stone breakwater the accumulation of mud and silt and the consequent diminution of water depth within the harbor after years of constructing revealed the problems due to the installation of a fixed breakwater since then researchers and coastal engineers have paid greater attention to floating breakwaters as floating breakwaters became popular as a viable alternative solution to shoreline and harbourage protection they were proposed designed and constructed in various forms in the 1970s jones 1971 and richey and nece 1974 recognized more than 60 different floating breakwater configurations based on their geometric and functional similarities hales 1981 classified these floating breakwaters into 11 categories according to their fundamental features later mccartney 1985 separated them into 4 general categories box pontoon mat and tethered floats based on the shape and reviewed their performance in reducing wave height and evaluated their construction costs according to the wave attenuation mechanisms sawaragi 1995 classified the floating breakwaters into 3 groups reflection type reflection and wave breaking type and friction type to date more floating breakwaters with distinct shapes and wave attenuation mechanisms have been proposed tested and built modern designs often enable multiple wave attenuation mechanisms to achieve a low transmission coefficient note that transmission coefficient is defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incoming wave height and it is a key indicator of the effectiveness of floating breakwaters thus there is certainly an imperative need to review the recent research and developments as well as the performance of various floating breakwaters this review should be beneficial to not only researchers but also practicing engineers working in the area of coastal and offshore engineering the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on the research and developments of different types of floating breakwaters we shall categorize them according to their shapes somewhat similar to that of mccartney 1985 they are 1 box type 2 pontoon type 3 frame type 4 mat type 5 tethered float type 6 horizontal plate type and 7 other types section 2 presents the research and developments on box type breakwaters and also some real examples of such breakwaters that have been constructed section 3 is devoted to the review on pontoon type breakwaters section 4 discusses the research on frame type breakwaters the mat type breakwaters tethered float type and horizontal plate type are discussed in section 5 section 6 and section 7 respectively recent research and developments of other types of floating breakwaters are presented in section 8 the effectiveness of wave attenuating devices that can be coupled with different types of breakwaters is discussed in section 9 finally section 10 summarizes the conclusions and recommendations for future studies on floating breakwaters 2 box type breakwaters the prismatic rectangular box type floating breakwater see fig 2 may be the simplest type and it has been investigated extensively bottin and turner 1980 carr 1950 carver 1979 hay 1966 ofuya 1968 in the last century this type of breakwater attenuates ocean sea waves mainly through reflecting incoming waves owing to its simple geometry theoretical formulae have been derived to predict the wave transmission coefficient this includes the following classic formula obtained by macagno 1953 based on the linear wave theory and assuming zero motion of breakwater no green water on top deck and constant water depth conditions 1 k t 1 1 k i b sinh k i h 2 cosh k i h k i d 2 where k t is the transmission coefficient defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height over the incident wave height k i 2π l the incident wave number l the incident wave length b the width of the breakwater d the draft and h the water depth floating breakwaters are laterally held in position by mooring lines piles or dolphins and they are bound to take some motions under wave actions their complex performance and the corresponding mooring forces were analysed using theoretical models based on two dimensional potential theory by adee 1976 1975 1974 adee and martin 1974 adee et al 1976 and drimer et al 1992 these analytical models furnish reasonable predictions when compared to physical model tests by davidson 1971 at oak harbor in washington for the analysis of more complex systems researchers often resort to powerful numerical approaches for example diamantoulaki and angelides 2010 investigated the performance of an array of hinged floating box type breakwaters by implementing generalized modes that are built based on tent functions to represent the motion due to the hinges the performance of a submerged box type breakwater held in position by vertical and inclined mooring lines was studied by rahman et al 2006 they used a two dimensional numerical model based on the volume of fluid method in their study the navier stokes equation was employed to investigate wave breaking and vortices as waves pass by the breakwater the weight w of the breakwater was also assumed to be much smaller than the buoyancy force bf i e w bf 0 32 and 0 66 so as to avoid the undesirable impulsive mooring forces due to mooring lines slack events under wave action in order to consider the effect of the confined domain protected by the breakwater a reflective quay sidewall was considered by elchahal et al 2009 in their numerical simulations they found that the sidewall significantly influences the motion and effectiveness of the breakwater especially for short waves resonance behind the breakwater is expected to occur when the clearance distance between the breakwater and the sidewall is nl 2 where n is an integer the performance of a pile restrained flexible floating breakwater was investigated by diamantoulaki et al 2008 based on a three dimensional hydrodynamic model as compared to a rigid breakwater the hydroelasticity was found to be significant for small b l ratios but the response decreases sharply when this ratio exceeds 0 7 compared to a rigid breakwater the flexural rigidity of the flexible breakwater was found to affect the pile restraining loads for surge and pitch motions significantly for b l 0 9 tay et al 2009 studied the effect of using floating breakwaters on mitigating the hydroelastic responses of two floating hydrocarbon storage rectangular tanks arranged side by side based on a hybrid finite element boundary element approach by means of a higher order boundary element method hong et al 2002 analysed the hydroelastic behaviour of a mega float structure with the presence of box type floating breakwaters the latter two research studies were discussed in a review paper by wang et al 2010 on methods to mitigate hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures vlfs the review paper also highlighted that the effectiveness of floating box type breakwaters depends significantly on their widths mooring systems and incident wave angles as an example the width to wave length ratio b l usually needs to exceed 0 35 so as to ensure that the wave transmission coefficient k t 0 5 a high k t is often inevitable with small width to wave length ratios e g b l 0 15 in order words these narrow breakwaters are almost transparent to long waves in order to enhance the performance of box type floating breakwaters williams et al 2000 investigated the performance of two floating long boxes arranged side by side see fig 3 based on the 2 d potential theory numerical parametric studies revealed that the geometry of and the spacing between the two floating boxes as well as the mooring line stiffness are the key factors that affect the performance of the floating breakwater for instance the dual box breakwater with a narrow spacing in between is effective in reflecting long waves due to the continuation in the width whereas a larger spacing is desired for reflecting short waves as the two boxes are essentially acting as two independent breakwaters in sequence in addition by reducing the mooring line stiffness the breakwater is more effective in reflecting long waves but it also leads to a narrow frequency band of acceptable performance the performance of the dual box breakwater against short waves is insensitive to the mooring stiffness unless the mooring lines are too soft to restrain the motion of the breakwater depending on the overall configuration this dual box breakwater may outperform the single box type breakwater with the same overall dimensions the performance of a breakwater consisting of three identical box type floating modules that are flexibly connected along their longitudinal direction was investigated by loukogeorgaki et al 2014 in a 1 20 scale model test they found that the obliquity of incoming waves affects the internal forces across the connectors significantly for low wave frequency range due to the excitation of the bending mode of the breakwater these values are b l 0 25 under 60 oblique waves and b l 0 15 under 45 oblique waves under such a situation the mooring lines are also subject to great tension forces and snap loads are expected to occur for h l 0 04 furthermore this breakwater is found to be effective k t 0 5 when this b l ratio is greater than the aforementioned values and thus the orientation of the breakwater of 45 with respect to the incoming wave direction leads to the most efficient behaviour of the floating breakwater the well established theory and model test results of floating breakwaters have given confidence to coastal engineers many box type floating breakwaters have been constructed at coastal areas with mild wave conditions one example is the holy loch breakwater on the west coast of scotland see fig 4 a this 240 m long and 3 8 m wide breakwater is made of 12 identical precast concrete pontoons each weighing 42 tons and was installed onsite within a single day maritimejournal com 2017 similar structures include the 4 m wide floating breakwater protecting 260 berths at fezzano sp italy see fig 4b the kan on floating composite concrete and steel breakwater at hiroshima bay 97 8 m long 20 m wide and 3 5 m high see fig 4c and the floating breakwater in the monaco pier hercule extension project that measures 352 5 m long 28 m wide and 16 m draft see fig 4d 3 pontoon type breakwaters by imitating the popular pontoon boat designs a typical pontoon type floating breakwater comprises two or more lengthwise pontoons that are usually rigidly connected at intervals or by a deck on top of them as shown in fig 5 this design is also often referred to as double pontoon twin pontoon and sometimes catamaran type when compared with box type floating breakwaters this design increases the inertia and thus the stability without adding much to the total mass and the material cost pontoon type floating breakwaters attenuate waves in a similar way by reflection as a box breakwater in addition the gap between the two floaters allows turbulent energy dissipation early studies include the experimental tests by ofuya 1968 who reported that the draft plays a significant role in reducing the coefficient of wave transmission also k t 0 5 can be achieved by tuning the structural natural period to wave period ratio t n t to be greater than 0 65 the development of a boat basin at oak harbor washington gave attention to floating breakwaters to protect the harbor with a maximum 4 4 m tidal elevation in this project davidson 1971 proposed a pontoon design where concrete pontoons are connected by rectangular wooden modules of 13 m long and 3 m wide a 1 10 scale two dimensional model test was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the design and the mooring forces since then many theoretical and experimental studies were carried out to test the pontoon type breakwaters williams and abul azm 1997 analysed the hydrodynamic properties of a floating breakwater consisting of a pair of floating rectangular prisms connected by a rigid deck and showed that similar to the dual box breakwater williams et al 2000 the draft spacing between two prisms and mooring line stiffness have a strong effect on the wave reflection properties when compared with a single box type breakwater of the same overall dimensions and mooring stiffness this pontoon design is found to be more effective in reflecting moderate and long waves this makes the pontoon type breakwater a cost effective solution ikeno et al 1988 proposed the use of the space between the two pontoons as a pressurised air chamber see fig 6 and investigated its effect on the wave energy attenuation both theoretically and experimentally a comparison with a concave shaped floating breakwater and a single box type breakwater of the same overall dimensions showed that the use of pressurised air chamber is effective in attenuating the wave energy they also found that the performance of the breakwater can be further improved by increasing the size of the air chamber and the pressurised head weng and chou 2007 developed a numerical model based on boundary element method bem for analysing the behaviours of two arbitrary shaped pontoons connected by a rigid frame and held in position by mooring lines modelled as linear springs the study revealed that the spacing between two pontoons has a great effect on both the natural frequency and the heave motion in the high frequency range the surge motion of the breakwater was found to be insensitive to the mooring line stiffness but a higher stiffness tends to induce peak response in heave and pitch motions at higher frequencies dong et al 2008 conducted experimental studies to compare the wave transmission on a single breakwater and a double box breakwater under regular waves with or without currents the 1 40 scale model test results showed that the double box design performs better than the single box however under long waves both designs require a large width to achieve a small wave transmission coefficient i e k t 0 5 the increase in width means that more materials and stronger mooring system have to be used in the design in order to improve the effectiveness of pontoon type breakwaters in attenuating long waves koo 2009 proposed a design that makes use of the spacing between the two pontoons as a pneumatic chamber see fig 7 a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank technique was adopted in the time domain analysis to evaluate wave blocking and energy absorption he found that the pneumatic damping is most effective for energy transmission reduction when b l 0 4 and the system is thus useful for blocking long waves ji et al 2015 proposed the use of two interconnected horizontal cylinders with down hanged mesh cage filled with rubber hollow balls see model 3 in fig 8 the cage is to disturb fluid particle orbit and through the motions of balls the wave energy is further dissipated as a comparison three other configurations were considered 1 double pontoon only see model 1 in fig 8 2 double pontoon with cage only see model 2 in fig 8 and 3 single box with equivalent overall dimensions a 1 20 scale model test showed that the double pontoon design with both cage and balls outperforms the other three configurations in terms of wave attenuation this design also performs reasonably well in long waves k t in the range of 0 7 0 8 for b l 0 2 where the rest designs are almost transparent to the incoming waves however the forces on the seaward mooring lines were found to be at least 50 greater than model 1 and single box model owing to the existence of the mesh cage a small difference in mooring forces between model 2 and model 3 revealed that the balls do not bring further burden to the mooring systems very recently a three dimensional model test demonstrated the effectiveness of the design ji et al 2016b the experimental results showed that the design is effective for b l 0 25 under both beam sea and oblique wave conditions it is also interesting to note that a decreasing trend in wave transmission coefficient was observed after k t reaching its peak value around 0 9 for b l 0 15 to less than 0 8 for longer waves when b l 0 125 the model test results suggested that higher degree of oscillation of the breakwater under long waves helps disperse more wave energy the researchers also suggested that the sway period be designed to avoid the most possible wave frequency at a given sea condition to ensure effective wave attenuation 4 frame type breakwaters frame type floating breakwaters are often a combination of pontoons and frames or truss structures they attenuate waves through both reflection by pontoons as well as turbulence and disturbance by frames earlier test examples include the a frame merlevede 2012 see fig 9 and twin log jackson 1964 floating breakwater because of the readily available timber in north america modern designs usually resort to concrete or steel pontoons for both strength and durability one example is the floating breakwater constructed at the port of brownsville marina located in port orchard bay washington in 1999 allyn et al 2001 this breakwater incorporates submerged porous treated timber wave fences installed on the sides of the concrete pontoons so as to reduce wave transmission shen et al 2016 eight concrete pontoon units were connected to each other by a rubber cushion shear tube and bolt assembly on each side of the pontoon and were held in position by steel piles both numerical and model test results showed that the structure is effective in reducing wave heights in oblique waves the use of engineered timber material in the design could lead to a relatively inexpensive solution for marina protection however timber structures suffer from low strength and poor durability thus they may not be suitable for use in a very harsh environment besides the design combining pontoon and timber nakamura 1999 proposed a floating breakwater comprising two rectangular floats connected by horizontal cylinders see fig 10 a these cylinders were placed near the water surface to dissipate wave energy by means of wave slamming phenomenon an experimental study revealed that this design is not as effective as a box type breakwater of similar overall dimensions in attenuating short waves i e b l 0 25 to further improve its performance additional footing plates and l shaped plates were attached to the floats see fig 10b c to alter the natural period of heave motion of the breakwater to a longer period in addition the l shaped plates also amplify the surrounding wave motions to further dissipate the wave energy both alterations were shown to achieve higher wave energy dissipation as compared to the box type breakwater mani 2014 proposed a y frame breakwater by installing evenly spaced cylindrical pipes to the bottom of a pontoon with trapezoidal cross section see fig 11 the 1 20 scale model test results suggested that k t is expected to be in the range of 0 35 0 65 for a low b l ratio in the range from 0 096 to 0 224 this implies that the onsite installation activities can be substantially reduced as compared to box type and pontoon type breakwaters that usually requires the b l ratio to be greater than 0 3 in order to achieve the desired effectiveness i e k t to be at least equal to 0 5 on the other hand the mooring forces are expected to increase exponentially with the dimensionless quantity h gt 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the wave period and they are found to be substantially greater 13 5 than those reported by davidson 1971 for a pontoon type floating breakwater of similar wave and structural parameters subsequently a cage type floating breakwater using cylinder frames and double pontoon breakwater was proposed by murali and mani 1997 see fig 11 when compared to the previous y frame design the cage configuration was found to be 10 20 more efficient in controlling the k t they also recommended a b l ratio of 0 14 0 18 for controlling the transmitted waves within the desirable limits the frames in cage types breakwater have no doubt contributed to the wave energy dissipation but they also increase the construction cost a 50 increase in the cost when compared with the y frame design in addition to attaching frame structures to the bottom of the floating boxes pontoons matsunaga et al 2002 and uzaki et al 2011 investigated the effect of attaching truss structures at the front and rear faces of a steel box type floating breakwaters see fig 12 they found that the truss in front of the pontoon can break incident waves resulting in an improved wave attenuation as compared to a single pontoon 5 mat type breakwaters approximately 70 of the world rubber consumption is attributed to the tyre industry however only a small portion of used tyres are recycled this leaves the industry a huge challenge in seeking pollution free disposal or reuse of these worn out tyres for other applications hales 1981 in 1963 stitt and noble 1963 invented the wave maze in which scrap truck tyres filled with flotation materials were assembled a geometric configuration was formed such that both top and bottom layers of tyres were bolted to the centre portion of vertical tyres arranged in a triangular pattern see fig 13 a this system attenuates incoming waves mainly by friction along the wetted surface and also by disturbing the wave particle orbits the efficiency of the wave maze was tested by kamel and davidson 1968 and noble 1976 1969 and the results suggested that the width shall be at least the half length of the wave length to ensure effective attenuation also the height of the breakwater needs to exceed the wave height h for h 1 2 m the successful study on this resilient floating breakwater soon attracted interests from both researchers and the rubber industry the goodyear tire and rubber company studied the use of scrap tyres for wave attenuation the modular design consisting of interlocking scrap tyre bundles with high strength rope or cable is now known as goodyear candle 1974 see fig 13b kowalski 1974 investigated the design of stacked layers of scrap automobile tyres fastened together harms et al 1982 proposed the wave guard design which utilized structural logs such as telephone poles and concrete beams that were threaded by scrap tyres see fig 13c these poles together with scrap tyres were connected to each other using conveyor belting together with wave maze and goodyear these three configurations received many attentions in the experimental studies model testing results showed that the wave guard design which has both large inertia and stiffness dissipates waves more effectively as compared to the other two configurations mccartney 1985 inspired by the wave guard design wu et al 2002 proposed a modular design utilizing steel tubes and scrap tyres see fig 14 each module comprises two parallel steel tubes threaded with tyres and spaced apart the two tubes are connected by a layer of tyres interlocked by leather belts the modules may be connected by either flexible or rigid connectors in their experimental study a 1 35 scale model was considered and found that a minimum k t 0 22 can be achieved under short waves besides scrap tyres other materials have also been considered in the design of a mat type floating breakwater for example wu et al 2001 proposed using linking an array of circular wooden blocks by nylon ropes see fig 15 this duckweed like floating structure is found to effectively dissipate short waves i e k t 0 4 for b l 2 5 yang and wu 2003 investigated the effectiveness of bamboo rafts with different configurations see fig 16 they found that the trapezoidal and combined triangular configurations attracted large wave forces thereby resulting in noticeable sway motions and large mooring forces for single layered rafts the mooring forces are substantially smaller as the wave energy is mainly dissipated through friction along the wetted surface and elastic deformation of the raft instead of wave reflection however the width of a single layered raft needs to exceed the wave length to ensure an effective attenuation i e k t 0 5 for b l 1 3 hegde et al 2007 proposed the design of multi layered horizontally interlaced pvc circular tubes see fig 17 a 1 30 scale model test suggested that for b l 1 0 k t is in the range of 0 6 0 8 depending on the wave steepness computational intelligence techniques such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis patil et al 2011 and the hybrid genetic algorithm tuned support vector machine regression ga svmr model patil et al 2012 were subsequently employed to predict the wave transmission of such a breakwater design the hydroelastic response a flexible mat type floating breakwater with internal flexible connections was also studied by loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the researchers adopted the mode superposition technique and the wet modes of the breakwater structure with added mass and hydrostatic gravitational stiffness were employed their study results showed that the existence of the internal connections affects the heave motion of the breakwater when faced with long waves i e 0 07 b l 0 3 also the effectiveness of the breakwater is significantly affected by the rotational stiffness of the connections for roughly the same range of the aforementioned b l ratio where the increase in the rotational stiffness tends to reduce the effectiveness of the breakwater the use of scrap and recycled materials is definitely a giant advantage of mat type floating breakwaters and for the circular economy unlike box type and pontoon type breakwaters that attenuate waves mainly by reflection mat type breakwaters dissipate wave energy through friction along their wetted surfaces and by disturbing wave particle orbits this significantly alleviate the burden on the mooring systems however most of the designs require the width to be in the same order of the incoming wave length which could result in a large footprint in order to reduce the height of long waves thus there is still work to be done on improving their effectiveness under long waves so that the sea space can be reduced 6 tethered float type breakwaters tethered type floating breakwaters are a unique group comprising a number of floaters tethered to the seabed or ballast modules under the water surface and these floaters move like inverted swinging pendulums under waves the pioneers working on this type of floating breakwaters include professor jones hales 1981 jones 1978 who proposed to use a mobile system consisting of a large number of spherical floaters tethered to reinforced concrete units see fig 18 for the protection of a container off loading and transfer system whose efficiency is significantly affected by waves with periods between 2 and 7 s the study concluded that this tethered type floating breakwater is able to achieve 50 reduction of the significant wave height associated with the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum with 7 s peak period jones 1978 unlike the other types of breakwater discussed above that mainly utilize their inertia to dissipate waves by reflection and friction tethered floats attenuate waves through drag arising from the buoy motion due to the wave pressure gradient this design was no later given attention and a feasibility study was carried out to evaluate its commercialization potential hales 1981 since experimental studies suggested that the energy dissipation is little attributed to wave scattering and reflection seymour and isaacs 1974 and seymour and hanes 1979 developed analytical models for the tethered float type of breakwaters considering only fluid drag dissipation in the form of quadratic damping the theoretical models developed showed that the number of floaters or the dimension of the floater array is determined by the desired wave attenuation they also found that the performance of the breakwater is insensitive to the tether length and suggested that the reasonable characteristic dimension of the floaters shall be in the same order of the significant wave height vethamony et al 1992 derived the added mass and damping coefficients for a single spherical tethered float based on potential theory and studied the relationship between the wave exciting force amplitude and the damping coefficient the effect of depth of submergence of the float on added mass and damping coefficient however was not considered in their study subsequently vethamony and sastry 1993 discussed the role of the relative velocity between a tethered spherical float and wave particle in the evaluation of the fluid drag force and drag power vethamony 1995 improved his theoretical model by accounting for the effect of submergence of the float and used it to predict the effectiveness of a tethered spherical float in wave attenuation the study showed that k t increases with respect to increasing float size due to the decrease in float velocity he also concluded that the system performs well when the float is just submerged however a comparison between the theoretical and experimental results suggested that the theoretical model tends to overestimate the wave attenuation besides spherical floaters stacked cylindrical tanks or scrap tyres can also be used hales 1981 mccartney 1985 moreover hales 1981 and jones 1978 have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different ballast modular designs concrete barge type concrete articulated frame and steel frame the steel frame ballast modules made from scrap railroad rails together with floaters consisting of stacked scrap automobile tyres filled with polyurethane foam were installed at an ocean site near san diego california in 1977 as the mooring lines are important components in the tethered float system their performance is also studied for example the cables chains may experience a transient but violent snap load from a slack condition to a taut condition suddenly the snap loads could jeopardise their life span and such effect was studied by many researchers huang and vassalos 1993 liu 1973 papazoglou et al 1990 plaut et al 2000 7 horizontal plate type breakwaters researchers are also interested in using horizontal plates to attenuate incoming waves the rigidity and the size of the plate are two key factors affecting its wave attenuation performance in this research direction dong et al 2008 proposed a board net design made of a thin plane board with rows of polyethylene nets underneath see fig 19 in this configuration the board is designed to suppress the wave particle motion in the vertical direction while the nets disturb the particle orbits the nets can also be used to constitute an aquaculture cage model test results suggested that the board alone has poor wave attenuation efficiency k t 0 5 unless the width of the board is sufficiently large e g 100 m the nets not only help to reduce k t but they are also found to slow down the current speed by approximately 20 in their scaled model tests the researchers further suggested that the nets be arranged at intervals of 20 m to achieve satisfactory performance the performance of a single elastic thin plate as a floating breakwater was also examined by shugan et al 2012 in their theoretical study flexible plates with length much shorter than the incoming wave length are found to be ineffective in wave attenuation when compared with a rigid plate however for plate length in the same magnitude of the wave length and beyond the elastic plate may be more efficient than a rigid plate in reducing the k t this is due to the fact that the plate vibration induced waves can effectively reduce the transmitted waves through phase cancellation once the elasticity of the plate is property tuned very recently koley and sahoo 2017 developed an analytical tool for the analysis of oblique wave scattering due to a floating flexible porous membrane the study suggested that k t is significantly affected by the porosity and the membrane tension besides the design with only one plate floating on the water surface the idea of using multi layered horizontal plates to break waves by suppressing wave particle motion in the vertical direction has also generated interest in many researchers for example cheong and patarapanich 1992 studied the reflection and transmission coefficients of a horizontal double plate system consisting of a seaward surface plate and a submerged leeward plate by using numerical simulations and experimental tests they found that the optimal submergence to water depth ratio of the leeward plate is 0 1 0 2 for minimum wave transmission the performance of a submerged double plate breakwater with the upper plate porous and the lower plate solid was analysed by liu et al 2008 wang and shen 1999 developed an analytical solution to wave reflection and transmission over a group of submerged horizontal plates using the eigenfunction expansion approach they found that the wave reflection and transmission are affected by the plate length submergence of the top plate and the relative water depth by using the same technique usha and gayathri 2005 analysed the double plate problem with the top plate floating at the free surface and found that the optimal plate width is about 0 37 0 39 times that of the wave length when the relative submergence spacing 0 22 to 0 23 for minimum wave transmission the performance of a submerged double thick plates system was studied by liu et al 2009 and they concluded that the top plate should be installed near the free surface the reduction in plate thickness is also effective in enhancing the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater in practice takaki et al 2001 kanda et al 2001 and fujikubo et al 2001 studied the performance of a sub plate floating breakwater this breakwater consisting of a bottom plate and two submerged top plates that are attached to floating cylinders see fig 20 when incident wave propagates into the submerged plate the flow due to the wave is accelerated around the weather side edge of the plate while strong reverse flow is generated around the lee side edge these two flows hit on the plate and the resulting wave breaking and wave fission dissipates the incident wave energy lo and liu 2014 as fast fluid velocity is generated at the upper submerged plate strong lifting forces act on these plates thereby resulting in the floating breakwater heaving upwards the effectiveness of this breakwater was found to be largely dependent on its submerged depth this configuration was also found to block lesser flows thereby alleviating the burden on the mooring systems 8 other types the demand for economical and effective floating breakwaters have also led to many innovative designs that do not fit so well in the categories described above the design reported by ohkusu et al 1991 and ikegami et al 1994 is one of them this design allows water to flow inside the breakwater see fig 21 and makes use of the internal wave motion to reduce the transmitted wave height the internal channels are sophistically designed to mobilize multiple modes of internal water winding flow for a wide range wave period and performs well even under relatively long waves k t 0 5 for l b up to 7 0 this design known as the resonance type was realised and installed at the aquaculture ground offshore hegushi area kagoshima prefecture japan in 1998 one year later a destructive typhoon hit the west japan when the breakwater was partially damaged but yet it still served its purpose and the aquaculture ground did not lose its function arami et al 2007 this design was subsequently employed by sundaravadivelu et al 2013 in their experimental test to study the feasibility of carrying wind turbines off the shore of agathi island india plastic float modules that are commonly seen at marinas can also be linked together to reduce incoming wave height wavebrake comprises lldpe linear low density polyethylene cubic units linked together by using high strength lines see fig 22 a this system disrupts the laminar flow of waves and channels the resulting turbulence into the porous cavities between the modules and is suitable for protecting small marinas and beaches against short waves and wakes k t is about 0 5 under 4 6 s waves of height up to 1 8 m wavebreak 2017 similar designs include the famous whisprwave see fig 22b made of hdpe high density polyethylene modules whisprwave 2017 and the porous floating breakwater made of perforated diamond shaped blocks see fig 22c by wang and sun 2010 compared to conventional box type and pontoon type floating breakwaters these porous breakwaters exhibit a relatively lower transmission coefficient they also reflect lesser waves that alleviates the burden on the mooring system furthermore the design of the porous cavities including the shape and layout leads to a more effective wave energy dissipation when compared with the mat type floating breakwaters and thus their widths are usually much smaller however both porous and mat type breakwaters are subjected to limited buoyancy force this requires a careful design of the mooring system to hold them in place firmly a spar buoy floating breakwater was proposed by liang et al 2004 this design comprises an array of submerged hdpe pipes tethered to the seabed by pretensioned mooring lines see fig 23 theoretical models for the predicting the wave transmission were developed and validated by experimental results parametric study showed that this design is most effective k t 0 3 when s l 0 3 and d b 7 in which s is the spacing between two adjacent fence rows d the diameter of the buoy and b the clear spacing between two adjacent units in the same row similar to the frame structures in the frame type breakwaters these spar buoys dissipate the waves energy mainly by disturbing the wave particle orbits and reflecting incoming waves one advantage of this design is that the footprint can be easily scaled up or down and the configuration of the spar buoys can be rearranged if needed however it is expected that this design can lead to a larger footprint as compared to the frame type breakwaters due to the lack of floating pontoons that reflect incoming waves 9 wave attenuating devices in addition to the different types of floating breakwaters discussed in the previous sections there are also designs of wave attenuating devices that can be employed in combination with the breakwaters to achieve an improved performance in dissipating the wave energy the vertical plate is one example among these designs christian 2000 and gesraha 2006 proposed attaching vertical plates to the bottom of a floating box to disturb the wave particle orbits they found that these plates can help reduce the transmission coefficient but an increase in k t may be observed for short waves alizadeh et al 2014 investigated the arrangement of the vertical plates and concluded that by attaching two rows of plates to both the front and the rear of the box a smaller k t is observed as compared to the case of only one row of plate attached to the centre of the box bottom koutandos and prinos 2011 studied the effectiveness of attaching either a vertical porous or impermeable plate to the front end of a box type breakwater both numerically and experimentally and they found that the breakwater with the impermeable plate is more effective but at the expense of larger mooring forces recently ji et al 2016a studied the design of attaching both horizontal and vertical porous plates to the top surface of the floater see fig 24 physical test results showed that the porous plates result in an improved inertia and motion damping such that the heave and roll motions are reduced also their study examined the use of a mesh cage design whose performance is similar to the porous floating breakwater xiao et al 2016 proposed the design of attaching two layers of perforated walls to a ring shaped very large floating structure vlfs as shown in fig 25 the performances of the design in terms of motion wave attenuation and mooring forces were investigated by carrying out a model test with a 1 80 scale ratio they found that the perforated walls with smaller porosity are most effective in wave attenuation in a mild environment where the interaction between the wave particles and the porous plates is strong the effectiveness of the breakwater is observed to be limited when facing long incident waves due to the fact that only the part of the waves close to the free surface is affected by the porous walls in addition to designs using impermeable or porous vertical plates nakamura et al 2001 investigated the performance of a double walled barrier comprising an impermeable wall on the shore side and an array of inclined plates on the seaside see fig 26 the inclined plates were found to enhance the generation of vortex flow that effectively dissipates the wave energy with lesser wave reflections as compared to a vertical impermeable plate the researchers also investigated the effect of the orientation of these inclined plates and they found that the downslope model reflects less waves than the up fin model but the wave transmission coefficient is virtually unaffected by the orientation the introduction of a horizontal plate attached to the bottom of the barrier was also found to improve the wave energy dissipation makimoto and nakamura 2007 although this double walled barrier is pile supported in the original design the design principles can be adopted in the design of a wave attenuating device floating breakwaters can also be equipped with hydraulic jets discharging water in the opposite direction of the train of surface waves the discharged water forms a current dissipating wave energy by partial or even complete wave breaking as early as the late 1960s rao 1968 and nece et al 1968 have foreseen the important application of hydraulic breakwaters in deep seas where the wave energy concentrates at the free surface as the efficiency of hydraulic breakwaters relies heavily on the jet power the early experimental works involved only the manifold discharging water chiu et al 1996 attached hydraulic jets to three horizontal cylinders linked together in an inclined arrangement test results showed that k t is about 0 8 without surface current formed by the jets the discharged water flow can significantly bring down the k t especially for short waves they also suggested that the draft be increased to compensate the discharge rate constraint due to economic reasons wave energy convertors such as oscillating water columns owcs also find their application as a wave attenuating device maeda et al 2000 investigated the reduction in the hydroelastic response of a vlfs with two different owcs in their study two numerical approaches were developed namely the 3d source distribution method and the equivalent floating body method both methods were found to agree well with experimental results they also found that the owc devices are effective in mitigating the hydroelastic response of the vlfs hong et al 2006 studied the effect of a freely floating owc breakwater on shielding a vlfs based on an analytical approach see fig 27 a parametric study was conducted by varying the wave period in the range of 6 s 20 s with a 30 m water depth the results showed that the effectiveness of the floating owc breakwater is dependent on the damping coefficient of the air chamber γ and the spacing between the breakwater and the vlfs ds furthermore its effectiveness can be improved by increasing the width of both the air chamber and the submerged bottom plate in addition to freely floating owc breakwaters hong and hong 2007 investigated the performance of a floating owc device attached to a vlfs through a pin connection see fig 27 the effectiveness of a pile supported owc breakwater was examined by he and huang 2014 in their experimental study a symmetric owc box with a slot on the top surface was considered the slot covers 20 of the top surface and is reserved for mounting plates with different orifice openings see fig 28 both slot and orifice openings with three opening ratios namely 0 625 1 25 and 1 875 were examined in addition two extreme cases with fully opened 20 opening ratio and full closed plates were also tested the researchers found that the owc device with an orifice opening ratio of 0 625 achieved the smallest k t a half wave height reduction k t 0 5 can be observed for b l 0 22 in their experimental tests a smaller b l ratio can be achieved by increasing the draft of the breakwater in addition these devices with pneumatic chambers have also been introduced to the floating breakwaters this includes the design of a floating box with symmetric pneumatic chambers on both the seaside and the leeside by he et al 2012 and later with asymmetric pneumatic chambers he et al 2013 see fig 29 the latter is an improved version with a 1 3 width ratio between the chamber in front and the one at the rear this configuration was found to increase air pressure fluctuation in both chambers experimental results also showed that k t 0 35 can be achieved for b l 0 5 and minimum transmission coefficient is obtained for b l 0 42 10 conclusions presented herein is a literature review on the research activities and developments of floating breakwaters over the past few decades the analytical numerical and experimental methods used in studying the effectiveness of various types of floating breakwaters in wave attenuation were also reviewed the box type and pontoon type floating breakwaters are the most common designs and they are effective in protecting the shoreline mainly by reflecting incoming waves their regular configurations enable economical and efficient construction and installation compared to box type breakwaters pontoon designs enjoy larger inertia in roll without much increase in the material extensive studies on the performance of different designs have been conducted and many innovative configurations such as porous plates and pneumatic chambers have also been introduced to reduce the wave transmission in practice both box and pontoon widths usually need to be at least one third of the target wave length for satisfactory wave attenuation this however makes the construction cost unfavourable when facing long waves a combination of boxes or pontoons and frames leads to the frame type of floating breakwaters these breakwaters not only reduce transmitted wave height by wave reflection but they also disturb wave particle orbits by using the frames experimental results have shown their effectiveness in attenuating incoming waves even with a low b l ratio mat type floating breakwaters are very cost effective as they are made of scrap and recycled materials also they can be constructed with unskilled labour as the name implies these breakwaters generally have larger plan dimensions than their depth they dissipate most wave energy through friction between the floaters and the water wave particles and reflect much fewer waves as compared to the pontoons however most designs require the width to be larger than the incoming wave length resulting in a huge footprint in the sea the floater materials are also susceptible to deterioration in a harsh marine environment their life span is usually less than 20 years tethered floats oscillate as inverted pendulums under wave actions and their wave attenuation characteristics are broadband simple yet effective analytical models are available to predict the performance on wave attenuation through the fluid drag together with modular construction they can be tailored to meet the prescribed limit imposed on the transmitted wave height this makes them particularly attractive for protecting coastal construction and operation projects as this type of floating breakwaters contains many tethered floats great attention should be paid to the design and maintenance of the mooring lines horizontally arranged floating and submerged plates also dissipate incoming wave energy effective by suppressing the wave particle orbits in the vertical direction as well as wave breaking and wave fission induced by the collision between the accelerated incoming waves at the fore edge of the submerged plate and the strong reverse flow generated at the aft edge for a single floating plate to be effective in attenuate incoming waves its width needs to be in the same magnitude of the wave length and beyond the performance may be improved by tuning the elasticity of the plate properly such that the radiated waves can effectively reduce the transmitted waves through phase cancellation alternatively the floating plate can be used in combination with submerged plates besides these traditional types of floating breakwaters many other designs with distinct configurations and wave attenuation mechanisms have also been invented and studied these include the resonance type which performs very well even under relatively long waves the porous breakwaters and spar buoy wave attenuators made from readily available hdpe modules in addition there are various designs of wave attenuating devices that could be employed in combination with different types of floating breakwaters and even conventional bottom founded breakwaters to enhance the wave attenuating performance these include the vertical impermeable and porous plates to reflect incoming waves the hydraulic jets that discharge water in the opposite direction of the surface waves and the floating pneumatic chambers that reduce incident wave height by extracting the wave energy the floating breakwaters are very attractive solutions to shoreline harbourage and coastal construction and aquaculture protection against wave action as human activities progress towards deeper seas the marine environment becomes harsher and waves become fiercer this poses challenges to the floating breakwater design to ensure that they not only survive severe storms but also serve their purpose of protecting the construction and operation of offshore structures both enhancements to the current configurations and new designs for achieving satisfactory performance under long waves are always the key driver for further research further studies may also include the research on fluid structure foundation interaction and the capacity and failure mechanism of mooring lines and anchors under snap loads or cyclic loads other interesting lines of investigation are the use of attachable devices or structures to serve as windbreakers and marine energy converters these devices and structures will add value to the floating breakwaters acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the australian research council
