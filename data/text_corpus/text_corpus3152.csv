15760,biodegradation of pollutants is a sustainable and cost effective solution to groundwater pollution here we investigate microbial populations involved in biodegradation of poly contaminants in a pipeline for heavily contaminated groundwater groundwater moves from a polluted park to a treatment plant where an aerated bioreactor effectively removes the contaminants while the biomass does not settle in the reactor sediment is collected afterwards and used to seed the new polluted groundwater via a backwash cycle the pipeline has successfully operated since 1999 but the biological components in the reactor and the contaminated park groundwater have never been described we sampled seven points along the pipeline representing the entire remediation process and characterized the changing microbial communities using genome resolved metagenomic analysis we assembled 297 medium and high quality metagenome assembled genome sequences representing on average 46 3 of the total dna per sample we found that the communities cluster into two distinct groups separating the anaerobic communities in the park groundwater from the aerobic communities inside the plant in the park the community is dominated by members of the genus sulfuricurvum while the plant is dominated by generalists from the order burkholderiales known aromatic compound biodegradation pathways are four times more abundant in the plant side communities compared to the park side our findings provide a genome resolved portrait of the microbial community in a highly effective groundwater treatment system that

aerobic as well as anaerobic degradation have been identified dhar et al 2020 ghosal et al 2016 however complex mixtures and high concentrations of hydrocarbons combined with limitations in nutrients and electron acceptors inhibit microbial growth and thus their ability to effectively remove contaminants this leads to persistence of btex and pahs e g in groundwater and soil johnsen et al 2005 at sites where the native microbial community cannot effectively metabolize the contaminants human assistance may be required to remediate the contaminated environment several strategies for assisted hydrocarbon bioremediation have been successfully applied biostimulation with surfactants increases the bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons because it makes them more soluble and therefore less likely to stick to soil particles calvo et al 2009 xu et al 2018 biostimulation can also be performed with nutrients that facilitate the growth of biodegrading microbes powell et al 2006 röling et al 2002 bioaugmentation helps remove contaminants by introducing micro organisms into the environment that have known biodegradation capabilities vogel 1996 wu et al 2016 in bioreactor based remediation contaminated material is moved into a reactor with favorable conditions for biodegradation such as a specific temperature or ph or with stable aerobic conditions and the contaminants are removed ex

environment contamination with hydrocarbons has been associated with an increase of members belonging to proteobacteria compared to uncontaminated samples after an oil spill in a lake in italy d ugo et al 2021 specifically enrichments of alpha and betaproteobacteria were observed both of which contain known hydrocarbon degrading bacteria d ugo et al 2021 beneath a former petrochemical plant in china the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera amycolatopsis actinobacteria rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria sulfurimonas and sulfuricurvum both epsilonproteobacteria sun et al 2017 in formation waters from a canadian oil sands reservoir a massive dominance of epsilonbacteria particularly belonging to the genus sulfuricurvum was observed hubert et al 2012 metagenomic profiling of the microbiome both in contaminated native environments and in bioremediation based wastewater treatment systems provides the basic understanding of the microbial organisms and their functional potential this knowledge could contribute to improved bioremediation efforts by enabling knowledge transfer between contaminated sites in this study we use genome resolved metagenomics to investigate the microbiome of a heavily hydrocarbon contaminated city park in utrecht the netherlands as well as the highly effective bioremediation based wastewater treatment system that removes the contaminants from the park groundwater see box 1 for details about the site the bioremediation system has been in operation since 1999 continuously pumping water out of the park to protect surrounding drinking water reserves that serve several towns in the province the water is transported via an underground pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant where most of the pollutants are removed by microorganisms in an anti bulking reactor abr leurink et al 2008 although the bioremediation capacity of the microorganisms in the abr has been known for a long time their identity as well as the details of their biodegradation potential are still unknown to identify the changes that occur within the microbial community during transport and aeration and zoom in on the microbial hydrocarbon degradation process we determined the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbes through genome resolved metagenomics we present detailed analyses of the microbiome at different locations within the bioremediation system fig 2a including from the groundwater directly emerging from the park and the water in the abr our results show that the microbiomes form distinct groups outside and within the treatment plant and that each group is dominated by few highly abundant taxa for the first time we provide insight into the genomic potential of the microbial communities in the transport pipeline and the anti bulking reactor box 1 the griftpark in utrecht the netherlands unlabelled box the griftpark fig 1 today a popular urban recreational park was a municipal gas plant that produced gas from coal between 1859 and 1960 in 1980 heavy soil and groundwater pollution with btex pahs and crude oil was discovered at the plant s former dump site see table 1 to prevent lateral diffusion of the pollutants an underground bentonite wall was built around the most heavily polluted area 80cm thick and reaching on average 64m into the ground since 1999 groundwater is continuously pumped out of the park keeping the local water level low and preventing dissolved contamination of the surrounding drinking water reserves the water is transported to a local wastewater treatment plant wtp where the pollutants are biologically removed in an aerated anti bulking reactor abr fig 2 leurink et al 2008 as the pipeline has never been augmented with external microorganisms the bacteria responsible for biodegradation were named griftpark bacteria and highlighted in the popular press over a decade ago unieke bacterie peuzelt gif op in vervuild griftpark 2008 still their identity as well as the details of their biodegradation potential have remained unknown 2 materials methods 2 1 the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline fig 2a has enabled effective removal of pollutants from groundwater since 1999 fig 2c pollutant and geochemical measurements were carried out by the department for city development environment and sustainability in utrecht independent of water sampling for dna extraction the entire treatment process takes 26 5 hours groundwater from the contaminated site is gathered in a collection basin which is infused with small amounts of oxygen p2 and pumped over 3km 3 5 hours to a treatment plant the groundwater enters via the influent buffer p4 where it is inoculated with bacteria from the sludge thickener p7 which is located at the end of the treatment plant then the water proceeds to the aeration tank p5 where it spends 13 hours while it is oxygenated and most of the contaminants are removed after passing into an overflow p6 the water enters the settling tank where it separates from the sludge the sludge phase is pumped into the sludge thickener p7 while the water phase undergoes treatment via sand filters optional and activated carbon optional before entering the sludge thickener as well finally a portion of the sludge from the sludge thickener is pumped back into the influent buffer while the remainder is sufficiently remediated to allow discharge into the communal wastewater influent 2 2 dna isolation sequencing and quality control seven different points fig 2 along the pipeline were sampled 1 5 times for a total of 24 metagenomic samples sampling dates were between march 22nd and august 29th 2016 bacteria were obtained from 700 to 10 000ml of water per sample supplementary table s1 by centrifugation and filtration dna was isolated using the mobio powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad usa followed by a phenol chloroform extraction step to remove polluting residues sambrook et al 1989 to increase the dna yield of the samples taken in march and april an amplification step was added using the dna nanokit for 6 cycles all samples were sequenced on an illumina hiseq platform with a read length of 150bp one sample from the aeration tank p5 was additionally sequenced on the oxford nanopore technologies minion platform to enable hybrid assembly reads

s1 the datasets have been deposited in the sequence read archive sra under bioproject prjna816463 2 3 metagenome assembly and binning the metagenomic datasets were assembled using short long read hybrid de novo sequence assembly miller et al 2017 with metaspades v3 11 1 nurk et al 2017 except 2 100817 which was assembled using only short reads due to technical limitations assembly quality was assessed using quast v4 6 3 gurevich et al 2013 reads from each illumina sequenced metagenomic sample were mapped back to the assembled contigs using bwa mem v0 7 12 r1039 li 2013 the mapped reads made up 63 83 1 of reads per sample read alignments were sorted with samtools v1 7 li et al 2009 the contigs were binned using metabat v2 12 1 lin and liao 2016 into 675 metagenome assembled genomes mags see supplementary table s2 across all samples completeness and contamination of mags was assessed with checkm v 1 0 11 parks et al 2015 and taxonomic classification performed with bat v5 0 4 meijenfeldt et al 2019 phylogenetic analysis of robust quality mags 50 complete 10 contamination was performed based on marker genes as identified by checkm as follows the mags of all samples were dereplicated using drep olm et al 2017 closest known relatives of the dereplicated genomes were selected from the genome taxonomy database r202 gtdb 34 by aligning the protein sequences of known marker gene to a set of gtdb proteins from representative genomes with diamond blastp v2 0 5 buchfink et al 2015 for each robust quality mag the top two reference genomes with the highest number of best hits over all the gene sets were selected as closest known relatives the protein sequences were aligned with mafft v7 453 katoh and standley 2013 in e ins i mode the resulted msas were trimmed using trimal v1 4rev15 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 and alignment blocks concatenated a phylogenetic tree was inferred using iq tree v2 1 2 nguyen et al 2015 and plotted with itol letunic and bork 2019 terrabacteria was selected as outgroup for rooting the tree hug et al 2016 2 4 microbial community profiling all assembled contigs were classified using cat v5 0 4 meijenfeldt et al 2019 using the nr database version of 4th of march 2020 sayers et al 2020 relative abundance of taxa mags was estimated per taxonomic rank by calculating the fraction of illumina reads that were mapped to contigs classified within each detected taxon mag shannon diversity was calculated using the diversity function of package vegan oksanen et al 2019 in r v3 6 1 r core team n d multiple linear regression was performed using the lm function of the r standard library principle component analysis pca was done with the r standard library and plotted with the packages ggplot2 wickham 2009 and ggfortify tang et al 2016 2 5 analysis of anaerobic aerobic marker genes we analyzed the abundance of five different genes that are typical for aerobic anaerobic metabolism cytochrome c oxidase ubib menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase nrdd and nrdg we downloaded all homologues of the five aforementioned proteins from refseq built a diamond database and mapped the quality filtered reads using diamond blastx v2 0 5 buchfink et al 2015 we then calculated the fraction of reads that mapped to each gene per sampling point 2 6 microbial co response networks microbial co response networks were constructed at genus rank by using the relative abundances of genera per sample genera with an abundance of 0 1 in at least two samples were selected n 94 the spearman rank correlation across samples was calculated using r r core team n d from the correlation matrix pairs with a correlation 0 75 were selected for visualization in the co response network the network layout was made using the igraph r package csardi and nepusz 2006 and visualized using ggplot2 wickham 2009 correlations with environmental factors were calculated using the environmental measurements taken closest to the sampling point and date spearman correlation was calculated between the relative abundance of all selected genera and the environmental factors and visualized as node colors in the co response networks 2 7 functional profiling all proteins identified by prodigal during cat classification see microbial community profiling were mapped to the uniref50 database suzek et al 2007 using diamond v0 8 22 buchfink et al 2015 where hits were defined as having 50 identity over 80 of the query the hit with the highest bitscore was selected for queries with multiple hits metagenomic reads were mapped to a custom database containing these annotated proteins and the corresponding gene sequences with humann2 v0 11 2 franzosa et al 2018 pathways were annotated based on the metacyc pathway database caspi et al 2019 pathway abundance was normalized to pathway copies per million pathways copm all pathway abundances are provided in supplementary table s3 the distribution of pathway reactions across mags was determined using the output of humann2 contigs were translated and mapped against uniref50 gene families by metaphlan v2 1 0 truong et al 2015 based on the uniref50 annotations of the contigs reactions were annotated as being present or absent in each mag supplementary table s4 3 results and discussion we aimed to determine the identity and genomic potential of microorganisms from the contaminated groundwater beneath an urban recreational park and trace their abundance as the groundwater is pumped through a transport system and into an aerated bioreactor anti bulking reactor abr where the contaminants are removed we performed a full metagenomic analysis charting the taxonomic and functional composition reconstructed draft genome sequences of the most important players in the system and identified known biodegradation pathways over the course of six months we sampled seven points of the groundwater treatment pipeline that represent the entire treatment process fig 2a each point was sampled 1 5 times adding up to a total of 24 samples we extracted dna from every sample and sequenced the metagenome resulting in over 400 million reads supplementary table s1 de novo assembly of the metagenomes yielded over 7 5 million contigs supplementary table s1 3 1 the microbial community transforms as the water flows from the park into the wtp to estimate the relative abundance of microbial taxa along the bioremediation pipeline we determined the fraction of reads that mapped to contigs that were classified by cat fig 3 a supplementary table s5 in the anti bulking reactor abr where most of the contamination is degraded fig 2c the microbial community was dominated by betaproteobacteria at the order level being represented by almost equal abundances of a diverse community of burkholderiales 30 6 in the abr and unclassified betaproteobacteria 31 2 in the abr most of which we also identified as belonging to the order burkholderiales in our subsequent analysis see below the remaining abr community consisted of members of proteobacteria that could not be further classified 10 5 sphingomonadales 5 6 and unclassified bacteria 3 1 burkholderiales include strictly aerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs that are often capable of metabolizing aromatic compounds and are known as versatile degraders pérez pantoja et al 2012 the most abundant burkholderiales species in the abr was macromonas bipunctata 6 7 a sulfur oxidizing bacterium that so far has not been linked to biodegradation willems 2014 sphingomonadales including the strictly aerobic genus novosphingobium have been shown to biodegrade pahs baboshin et al 2008 colquhoun et al 2012 kertesz et al 2019 pinyakong et al 2003 the microbial community was markedly different in groundwater extracted from the park here the community was dominated by epsilonproteobacteria fig 3a 68 2 of mapped reads in p1 a class that has been shown to thrive in a canadian oil sands reservoir hubert et al 2012 the dominant genus in the park was sulfuricurvum 57 5 in p1 that may occupy a similar niche as the cultured species sulfuricurvum kujiense kodama and watanabe 2004 s kujiense is a facultatively anaerobic chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium that was originally isolated from oil contaminated groundwater from a crude oil storage cavity in japan other abundant microorganisms in the park belong to campylobacterales 5 9 unclassified bacteria 4 5 likely multiple bacteria and pseudomonas 3 2 a versatile genus found in many environments gomila et al 2015 spiers et al 2000 that has been associated to hydrocarbon degradation including diesel contaminated soils gallego et al 2001 izmalkova et al 2013 tian et al 2002 while changes in the microbial community are expected along the treatment process tiwari et al 2021 it is striking that only 0 38 of the community in the park belonged to betaproteobacteria which are massively enriched in the abr on average 16 2 of reads from the abr mapped to the assembly of the park microbiome showing that the biodegradation community in the wtp dominates the bacteria derived from the park we tested the abundance of a set of marker genes for aerobic metabolism i cytochrome c oxidase which catalyzes the transport of electrons to molecular oxygen ludwig 1987 mixed metabolism ii ubib which produces ubiquinone which is present in all bacteria but the relative abundance of which should be lower in anaerobic environments compared to aerobic environments as anaerobic gram negative bacteria produce menaquinone as well collins and jones 1981 and anaerobic metabolism iii menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase which produces a quinone present in anaerobic gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria collins and jones 1981 iv nrdg and v nrdd which catalyze ribonucleotide reduction in anaerobic growth garriga et al 1996 the fraction of reads mapping to cytochrome c oxidase increased more than threefold from the park to the aeration tank from 2 0 10 4 to 6 4 10 4 indicating the abundance of aerobic bacteria in the aeration tank supplementary figure s1 nrdd decreased tenfold between the park and the aeration tank 1 5 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 indicating an aerobic microbial community while nrdd remained stagnant menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase and ubib showed mirroring trends with ubib decreasing between the park and the influent p3 and then increasing in the wtp this also indicates an aerobic microbial community in the wtp to further investigate the taxonomic classification and inter relationships of the reconstructed mags especially those that only had a classification at high taxonomic rank we generated a phylogenetic tree based on 60 universal marker genes supplementary figure s2 we dereplicated the 675 assembled mags resulting in a non redundant set of 57 high quality mags we chose the closest relatives of our mags from the genome taxonomy database to provide context parks et al 2018 twelve of the dereplicated mags belong to the order burkholderiales five mags were classified as betaproteobacteria by bat but did not receive a robust classification at a lower taxonomic rank in the phylogenetic tree the same five genomes were placed within burkholderiales supplementary figure s2 burkholderiales and sphingomonadales genomes were generally more abundant in the wtp compared to the park while sulfuricurvum and pseudomonas were more abundant in or close to the park as the metagenomic datasets are compositional in nature we could not assess whether the bacteria from the park decreased in absolute abundance in the wtp gloor et al 2017 i e which of them were able to grow under aeration 3 2 backwash cycle drives shift in microbial communities from park side to the wtp to explore the effect of oxygen on the microbial community we built a microbial co response network to reveal significant correlations in the abundance of different microbial taxa and between the taxa and chemical parameters fig 3b supplementary figure s3 the network showed two distinct clusters of bacteria the first cluster included alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria flavobacteria gammaproteobacteria xanthomonadales and oligoflexia that correlate positively with oxygen and were abundant in the wtp wtp cluster fig 3b the second cluster included actinobacteria deltaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria erysipelotrichia and gammaproteobacteria pseudomonadales that correlated inversely with oxygen and were abundant in or close to the park park side cluster the separation of the clusters was further supported by principal component analysis fig 3c where principal component pc1 correlated with the sampling point in the pipeline small amounts of oxygen were pumped into the collection basin at p2 by the municipality this basin is never emptied completely and could therefore contain an adapted microbial community explaining the increased abundance of pseudomonas and acinetobacter in the wtp the added oxygen in the abr facilitated the change from an anaerobic to an aerobic microbial community sampling points p3 and p4 are located within 20m of each other yet p4 samples fell among the wtp communities in the pca fig 4 c showing that inoculation of sludge from the sludge thickener p7 into the influent buffer p4 via the backwash cycle see fig 2a is a major driver of the shift in microbial composition to investigate the relative contribution of activated sludge and groundwater derived from the park to the p4 microbial community we used multiple linear regression of the 98 taxa that contributed more than 0 1 of the community to estimate the relative abundance of taxa in p4 from their abundances in p3 and p7 based on this analysis we estimate that p7 contributes nine times as many microbes to the p4 community as p3 89 9 and 10 1 respectively adjusted r2 0 965 consistent with a much higher bacterial density in sludge p7 than in the influent water p3 3 3 diversity decreases as the microbes enter the treatment plant the diversity of the microbial communities in the park side is higher than in the wtp mean species level shannon diversity 3 04 0 41 and 2 7 0 45 respectively see supplementary table s6 this higher diversity might explain i the shorter contigs in the park relative to the wtp mean contig length 447nt and 615nt supplementary table s1 although the number of sequencing reads was similar ii the lower mean depth of contigs 3 24 and 3 65 fold coverage after read mapping iii the fact that a higher fraction of reads did not map to contigs 27 8 8 8 and 13 7 1 3 3 4 known aerobic aromatic compound degradation pathways are more abundant in the treatment plant to identify the shifts in functional potential of the microbial community we mapped metagenomic reads to metacyc pathways we observed a marked difference between the park and wtp side of the pipeline in the number of reads per sample that mapped to the proteins identified in that assembly 22 46 55 6 and 49 44 61 22 of reads respectively while many of the proteins encoded by the microorganisms in the treatment plant had homologs with well described functions the organisms in the park microbiome remain under studied meijenfeldt et al 2019 resulting in a lower annotation rate to analyze the shifts in metabolic potential along the pipeline we searched for known pathways using humann2 caspi et al 2019 the direction and magnitude of the change in relative pathway abundance varied throughout the treatment pipeline and among different pathways fig 4 for example the sampling points at the beginning and the end of the 3km transport pipe p2 and p3 the influent buffer p4 and the sludge thickener p7 showed the largest changes in pathway abundance relative to the previous points here we address aromatic compound degradation acd pathways information about all other pathways involved in e g nucleotide amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism can be found in supplementary table s3 the relative abundance of biodegradation pathway genes particularly all subcategories of acd increased dramatically in the treatment plant fig 4 as most of the well described acd pathways are aerobic this increase in relative abundance is consistent with the oxygen availability in the abr and the backwash cycle from p7 to p4 fig 2 caspi et al 2019 weelink et al 2010 the most abundant metacyc acd pathways identified are related to the degradation of toluene catechol p cumate 3 phenylpropanoate and unspecified aromatic compounds supplementary table s3 catechol is a common intermediate metabolite in aromatic compound degradation surendra et al 2017 which could imply that aromatic compounds from the park are degraded via catechol in the abr pathways for degradation of toluene catechol p cumate and unspecified aromatic compounds appear to increase at p2 then decrease from p2 to p3 before abruptly increasing at p4 fig 4 supplementary table s3 the peak in p2 could have two explanations first the water in the collection basin next to the park is a mixture of water from all around the park and not just from sampling point p1 aromatic compound degradation pathways could be more abundant in other areas of the park which would lead to a higher abundance of acd pathways in the collection basin second small amounts of oxygen are pumped into the collection basin which could lead to an increase in the abundance of aerobic aromatic compound degradation pathways three and a half hours later before the water enters the influent buffer in the treatment plant at p3 the oxygen is all but depleted fig 2b which is mirrored in the decreased relative abundance of degradation pathways at p3 fig 5 based on the decrease of acd pathways in sampling point p3 we suggest that oxygen availability rather than mixture of communities drove the increase of acd pathways in p2 3 5 acd pathways prevalent in key taxa of the plant side next we investigated whether the mags that were enriched in the wtp preferentially contained acd pathways of the 57 high quality non redundant mags 34 contained complete acd pathways 19 of which were enriched in the wtp compared to the park while the remaining 15 mags where more abundant in the park 14 of the 34 mags belonged to the class betaproteobacteria eleven burkholderiales three rhodocyclales other mags that contained complete acd pathways belonged to the orders campylobacterales 4 sulfuricurvum 3 arcobacter pseudomonadales 3 pseudomonas 2 acinetobacter desulfuromonadales 1 geobacter and sphingomonadales 1 unknown genus mags that contain acd pathways make up 24 2 of the community in the park due to some sulfuricurvum genomes containing a syringate degradation pathway in the abr mags that contain acd pathways add up to 42 of the community these results suggest that the taxa enriched in the wtp burkholderiales rhodocyclales sphingomonadales are responsible for the rapid degradation of the pollutants in the abr the only mags that were more abundant in the park side and contained more than one acd pathway belonged to pseudomonadales pseudomonadales are most abundant in the collection basin aerobic biodegradation is possible the most ubiquitous acd pathway among the park enriched mags was the syringate degradation pathway syringate is an intermediate metabolite in the degradation of lignin which is part of the woody plant cell wall and the most abundant aromatic compound in nature janusz et al 2017 while lignin itself is not a toxic compound it bears structural resemblance to some pahs dhar et al 2020 so these proteins annotated as belonging to the syringate degradation pathway may play a role in biodegradation in sulfuricurvum which can thrive in hydrocarbon polluted soil without breaking down the pollutants kodama and watanabe 2004 no known acd pathways other than syringate degradation were found fewer acd pathways were found in the park side bacteria compared to the bacteria in the wtp however the absence of known acd pathways does not rule out biodegradation in the park groundwater among the many genes of unknown function that we recovered 92 3 in the park versus 86 3 in the wtp undescribed anaerobic mechanisms for biodegradation of btex and pah may exist currently 179 out of the 194 acd pathways in the metacyc database depend on oxygen whereas the conditions in the griftpark groundwater are mainly anaerobic anaerobic biodegradation pathways have been found for btex compounds weelink et al 2010 but we found no known complete anaerobic biodegradation pathways in any of the mags in this study 4 conclusions and outlook in this study we investigated the microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation of aromatic compounds in the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline the pipeline microbiome consists of two distinct groups of microorganisms shifting from mainly anaerobic organisms in the park groundwater to a highly specialized aerobic community in the wtp the microbial communities are dominated by a few highly abundant bacterial taxa both in the park sulfuricurvum and in the wtp burkholderiales burkholderiales which account for only 0 3 of the community in the park make up half of the community in the abr and contain many known aromatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways the highly specialized microbial communities in the abr are enriched and maintained by a backwash cycle that inoculates the influent of the wtp with bacteria from the previous treatment cycle our results provide insight into the biological processes involved in a highly effective groundwater bioremediation system from before treatment to the effluent of the pipeline we show that burkholderiales already well known degraders of various pollutants are likely the driving force behind the degradation in the abr as well as the conditions in the abr are aerobic possible acd pathways are much better described than for the anaerobic conditions in the park whether biodegradation of the pollutants is also happening in the anaerobic groundwater in the park is still an open question and will require further research due to the thorough sampling of the treatment process from beginning to end our results improve the understanding of how the microbial community changes at each step in bioremediation this additional insight will aid in the interpretation of biological processes active in other bioremediation pipelines as well as the design of new bioremediation pipelines declaration of competing interest the authors

15760,biodegradation of pollutants is a sustainable and cost effective solution to groundwater pollution here we investigate microbial populations involved in biodegradation of poly contaminants in a pipeline for heavily contaminated groundwater groundwater moves from a polluted park to a treatment plant where an aerated bioreactor effectively removes the contaminants while the biomass does not settle in the reactor sediment is collected afterwards and used to seed the new polluted groundwater via a backwash cycle the pipeline has successfully operated since 1999 but the biological components in the reactor and the contaminated park groundwater have never been described we sampled seven points along the pipeline representing the entire remediation process and characterized the changing microbial communities using genome resolved metagenomic analysis we assembled 297 medium and high quality metagenome assembled genome sequences representing on average 46 3 of the total dna per sample we found that the communities cluster into two distinct groups separating the anaerobic communities in the park groundwater from the aerobic communities inside the plant in the park the community is dominated by members of the genus sulfuricurvum while the plant is dominated by generalists from the order burkholderiales known aromatic compound biodegradation pathways are four times

environment rodríguez eugenio et al 2018 btex and pah pollution in soil and groundwater limits plant growth and is toxic to animals salanitro et al 1997 for humans btex and pahs are carcinogens and exposure to these compounds can lead to reproductive problems respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases bolden et al 2015 in recent years microbial biodegradation of pollutants has been established as a sustainable and cost effective strategy to remediate hydrocarbon polluted terrestrial and aquatic environments guerra et al 2018 many microorganisms are known to degrade hydrocarbons chakraborty and coates 2004 gallego et al 2001 head et al 2006 izmalkova et al 2013 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2017 meckenstock et al 2004 tian et al 2002 wang et al 2020 and pathways involved in aerobic as well as anaerobic degradation have been identified dhar et al 2020 ghosal et al 2016 however complex mixtures and high concentrations of hydrocarbons combined with limitations in nutrients and electron acceptors inhibit microbial growth and thus their ability to effectively remove contaminants this leads to persistence of btex and pahs e g in groundwater and soil johnsen et al 2005 at sites where the native microbial community cannot effectively metabolize the contaminants human assistance may be required to remediate the contaminated environment several strategies for assisted hydrocarbon bioremediation have been successfully applied biostimulation with surfactants increases the bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons because it makes them more soluble and therefore less likely to stick to soil particles calvo et al 2009 xu et al 2018 biostimulation can also be performed with nutrients that facilitate the growth of biodegrading microbes powell et al 2006 röling et al 2002 bioaugmentation helps remove contaminants by introducing micro organisms into the environment that have known biodegradation capabilities vogel 1996 wu et al 2016 in bioreactor based remediation contaminated material is moved into a reactor with favorable conditions for biodegradation such as a specific temperature or ph or with stable aerobic conditions and the contaminants are removed ex situ safdari et al 2018 bioremediation techniques have been shown to effectively remove hydrocarbons from groundwater and soil natural attenuation that is unassisted bioremediation biostimulation and bioaugmentation effectively degraded diesel oil in different soils from long beach and hong kong in a microcosm experiment bento et al 2005 in another microcosm experiment soil from different regions in china all showed strong biodegradation abilities for hydrocarbons from crude oil liu et al 2017 bacteria in soil from seven different regions in the us were all able to degrade 80 of crude oil contamination with different microbes responding to the contamination depending on soil properties hamamura et al 2006 the microbial response to hydrocarbon pollution can differ depending on the environment contamination with hydrocarbons has been associated with an increase of members belonging to proteobacteria compared to uncontaminated samples after an oil spill in a lake in italy d ugo et al 2021 specifically enrichments of alpha and betaproteobacteria were observed both of which contain known hydrocarbon degrading bacteria d ugo et al 2021 beneath a former petrochemical plant in china the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera amycolatopsis actinobacteria rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria sulfurimonas and sulfuricurvum both epsilonproteobacteria sun et al 2017 in formation waters from a canadian oil sands reservoir a massive dominance of epsilonbacteria particularly belonging to the genus sulfuricurvum was observed hubert et al 2012 metagenomic profiling of the microbiome both in contaminated native environments and in bioremediation based wastewater treatment systems provides the basic understanding of the microbial organisms and their functional potential this knowledge could contribute to improved bioremediation efforts by enabling knowledge transfer between contaminated sites in this study we use genome resolved metagenomics to investigate the microbiome of a heavily hydrocarbon contaminated city park in utrecht the netherlands as well as the highly effective bioremediation based wastewater treatment system that removes the contaminants from the park groundwater see box 1 for details about the site the bioremediation system has been in operation since 1999 continuously pumping water out of the park to protect surrounding drinking water reserves that serve several towns in the province the water is transported via an underground pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant where most of the pollutants are removed by microorganisms in an anti bulking reactor abr leurink et al 2008 although the bioremediation capacity of the microorganisms in the abr has been known for a long time their identity as well as the details of their biodegradation potential are still unknown to identify the changes that occur within the microbial community during transport and aeration and zoom in on the microbial hydrocarbon degradation process we determined the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbes through genome resolved metagenomics we present detailed analyses of the microbiome at different locations within the bioremediation system fig 2a including from the groundwater directly emerging from the park and the water in the abr our results show that the microbiomes form distinct groups outside and within the treatment plant and that each group is dominated by few highly abundant taxa for the first time we provide insight into the genomic potential of the microbial communities in the transport pipeline and the anti bulking reactor box 1 the griftpark in utrecht the netherlands unlabelled box the griftpark fig 1 today a popular urban recreational park was a municipal gas plant that produced gas from coal between 1859 and 1960 in 1980 heavy soil and groundwater pollution with btex pahs and crude oil was discovered at the plant s former dump site see table 1 to prevent lateral diffusion of the pollutants an underground bentonite wall was built around the most heavily polluted area 80cm thick and reaching on average 64m into the ground since 1999 groundwater is continuously pumped out of the park keeping the local water level low and preventing dissolved contamination of the surrounding drinking water reserves the water is transported to a local wastewater treatment plant wtp where the pollutants are biologically removed in an aerated anti bulking reactor abr fig 2 leurink et al 2008 as the pipeline has never been augmented with external microorganisms the bacteria responsible for biodegradation were named griftpark bacteria and highlighted in the popular press over a decade ago unieke bacterie peuzelt gif op in vervuild griftpark 2008 still their identity as well as the details of their biodegradation potential have remained unknown 2 materials methods 2 1 the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline fig 2a has enabled effective removal of pollutants from groundwater since 1999 fig 2c pollutant and geochemical measurements were carried out by the department for city development environment and sustainability in utrecht independent of water sampling for dna extraction the entire treatment process takes 26 5 hours groundwater from the contaminated site is gathered in a collection basin which is infused with small amounts of oxygen p2 and pumped over 3km 3 5 hours to a treatment plant the groundwater enters via the influent buffer p4 where it is inoculated with bacteria from the sludge thickener p7 which is located at the end of the treatment plant then the water proceeds to the aeration tank p5 where it spends 13 hours while it is oxygenated and most of the contaminants are removed after passing into an overflow p6 the water enters the settling tank where it separates from the sludge the sludge phase is pumped into the sludge thickener p7 while the water phase undergoes treatment via sand filters optional and activated carbon optional before entering the sludge thickener as well finally a portion of the sludge from the sludge thickener is pumped back into the influent buffer while the remainder is sufficiently remediated to allow discharge into the communal wastewater influent 2 2 dna isolation sequencing and quality control seven different points fig 2 along the pipeline were sampled 1 5 times for a total of 24 metagenomic samples sampling dates were between march 22nd and august 29th 2016 bacteria were obtained from 700 to 10 000ml of water per sample supplementary table s1 by centrifugation and filtration dna was isolated using the mobio powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad usa followed by a phenol chloroform extraction step to remove polluting residues sambrook et al 1989 to increase the dna yield of the samples taken in march and april an amplification step was added using the dna nanokit for 6 cycles all samples were sequenced on an illumina hiseq platform with a read length of 150bp one sample from the aeration tank p5 was additionally sequenced on the oxford nanopore technologies minion platform to enable hybrid assembly reads

s1 the datasets have been deposited in the sequence read archive sra under bioproject prjna816463 2 3 metagenome assembly and binning the metagenomic datasets were assembled using short long read hybrid de novo sequence assembly miller et al 2017 with metaspades v3 11 1 nurk et al 2017 except 2 100817 which was assembled using only short reads due to technical limitations assembly quality was assessed using quast v4 6 3 gurevich et al 2013 reads from each illumina sequenced metagenomic sample were mapped back to the assembled contigs using bwa mem v0 7 12 r1039 li 2013 the mapped reads made up 63 83 1 of reads per sample read alignments were sorted with samtools v1 7 li et al 2009 the contigs were binned using metabat v2 12 1 lin and liao 2016 into 675 metagenome assembled genomes mags see supplementary table s2 across all samples completeness and contamination of mags was assessed with checkm v 1 0 11 parks et al 2015 and taxonomic classification performed with bat v5 0 4 meijenfeldt et al 2019 phylogenetic analysis of robust quality mags 50 complete 10 contamination was performed based on marker genes as identified by checkm as follows the mags of all samples were dereplicated using drep olm et al 2017 closest known relatives of the dereplicated genomes were selected from the genome taxonomy database r202 gtdb 34 by aligning the protein sequences of known marker gene to a set of gtdb proteins from representative genomes with diamond blastp v2 0 5 buchfink et al 2015 for each robust quality mag the top two reference genomes with the highest number of best hits over all the gene sets were selected as closest known relatives the protein sequences were aligned with mafft v7 453 katoh and standley 2013 in e ins i mode the resulted msas were trimmed using trimal v1 4rev15 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 and alignment blocks concatenated a phylogenetic tree was inferred using iq tree v2 1 2 nguyen et al 2015 and plotted with itol letunic and bork 2019 terrabacteria was selected as outgroup for rooting the tree hug et al 2016 2 4 microbial community profiling all assembled contigs were classified using cat v5 0 4 meijenfeldt et al 2019 using the nr database version of 4th of march 2020 sayers et al 2020 relative abundance of taxa mags was estimated per taxonomic rank by calculating the fraction of illumina reads that were mapped to contigs classified within each detected taxon mag shannon diversity was calculated using the diversity function of package vegan oksanen et al 2019 in r v3 6 1 r core team n d multiple linear regression was performed using the lm function of the r standard library principle component analysis pca was done with the r standard library and plotted with the packages ggplot2 wickham 2009 and ggfortify tang et al 2016 2 5 analysis of anaerobic aerobic marker genes we analyzed the abundance of five different genes that are typical for aerobic anaerobic metabolism cytochrome c oxidase ubib menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase nrdd and nrdg we downloaded all homologues of the five aforementioned proteins from refseq built a diamond database and mapped the quality filtered reads using diamond blastx v2 0 5 buchfink et al 2015 we then calculated the fraction of reads that mapped to each gene per sampling point 2 6 microbial co response networks microbial co response networks were constructed at genus rank by using the relative abundances of genera per sample genera with an abundance of 0 1 in at least two samples were selected n 94 the spearman rank correlation across samples was calculated using r r core team n d from the correlation matrix pairs with a correlation 0 75 were selected for visualization in the co response network the network layout was made using the igraph r package csardi and nepusz 2006 and visualized using ggplot2 wickham 2009 correlations with environmental factors were calculated using the environmental measurements taken closest to the sampling point and date spearman correlation was calculated between the relative abundance of all selected genera and the environmental factors and visualized as node colors in the co response networks 2 7 functional profiling all proteins identified by prodigal during cat classification see microbial community profiling were mapped to the uniref50 database suzek et al 2007 using diamond v0 8 22 buchfink et al 2015 where hits were defined as having 50 identity over 80 of the query the hit with the highest bitscore was selected for queries with multiple hits metagenomic reads were mapped to a custom database containing these annotated proteins and the corresponding gene sequences with humann2 v0 11 2 franzosa et al 2018 pathways were annotated based on the metacyc pathway database caspi et al 2019 pathway abundance was normalized to pathway copies per million pathways copm all pathway abundances are provided in supplementary table s3 the distribution of pathway reactions across mags was determined using the output of humann2 contigs were translated and mapped against uniref50 gene families by metaphlan v2 1 0 truong et al 2015 based on the uniref50 annotations of the contigs reactions were annotated as being present or absent in each mag supplementary table s4 3 results and discussion we aimed to determine the identity and genomic potential of microorganisms from the contaminated groundwater beneath an urban recreational park and trace their abundance as the groundwater is pumped through a transport system and into an aerated bioreactor anti bulking reactor abr where the contaminants are removed we performed a full metagenomic analysis charting the taxonomic and functional composition reconstructed draft genome sequences of the most important players in the system and identified known biodegradation pathways over the course of six months we sampled seven points of the groundwater treatment pipeline that represent the entire treatment process fig 2a each point was sampled 1 5 times adding up to a total of 24 samples we extracted dna from every sample and sequenced the metagenome resulting in over 400 million reads supplementary table s1 de novo assembly of the metagenomes yielded over 7 5 million contigs supplementary table s1 3 1 the microbial community transforms as the water flows from the park into the wtp to estimate the relative abundance of microbial taxa along the bioremediation pipeline we determined the fraction of reads that mapped to contigs that were classified by cat fig 3 a supplementary table s5 in the anti bulking reactor abr where most of the contamination is degraded fig 2c the microbial community was dominated by betaproteobacteria at the order level being represented by almost equal abundances of a diverse community of burkholderiales 30 6 in the abr and unclassified betaproteobacteria 31 2 in the abr most of which we also identified as belonging to the order burkholderiales in our subsequent analysis see below the remaining abr community consisted of members of proteobacteria that could not be further classified 10 5 sphingomonadales 5 6 and unclassified bacteria 3 1 burkholderiales include strictly aerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs that are often capable of metabolizing aromatic compounds and are known as versatile degraders pérez pantoja et al 2012 the most abundant burkholderiales species in the abr was macromonas bipunctata 6 7 a sulfur oxidizing bacterium that so far has not been linked to biodegradation willems 2014 sphingomonadales including the strictly aerobic genus novosphingobium have been shown to biodegrade pahs baboshin et al 2008 colquhoun et al 2012 kertesz et al 2019 pinyakong et al 2003 the microbial community was markedly different in groundwater extracted from the park here the community was dominated by epsilonproteobacteria fig 3a 68 2 of mapped reads in p1 a class that has been shown to thrive in a canadian oil sands reservoir hubert et al 2012 the dominant genus in the park was sulfuricurvum 57 5 in p1 that may occupy a similar niche as the cultured species sulfuricurvum kujiense kodama and watanabe 2004 s kujiense is a facultatively anaerobic chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium that was originally isolated from oil contaminated groundwater from a crude oil storage cavity in japan other abundant microorganisms in the park belong to campylobacterales 5 9 unclassified bacteria 4 5 likely multiple bacteria and pseudomonas 3 2 a versatile genus found in many environments gomila et al 2015 spiers et al 2000 that has been associated to hydrocarbon degradation including diesel contaminated soils gallego et al 2001 izmalkova et al 2013 tian et al 2002 while changes in the microbial community are expected along the treatment process tiwari et al 2021 it is striking that only 0 38 of the community in the park belonged to betaproteobacteria which are massively enriched in the abr on average 16 2 of reads from the abr mapped to the assembly of the park microbiome showing that the biodegradation community in the wtp dominates the bacteria derived from the park we tested the abundance of a set of marker genes for aerobic metabolism i cytochrome c oxidase which catalyzes the transport of electrons to molecular oxygen ludwig 1987 mixed metabolism ii ubib which produces ubiquinone which is present in all bacteria but the relative abundance of which should be lower in anaerobic environments compared to aerobic environments as anaerobic gram negative bacteria produce menaquinone as well collins and jones 1981 and anaerobic metabolism iii menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase which produces a quinone present in anaerobic gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria collins and jones 1981 iv nrdg and v nrdd which catalyze ribonucleotide reduction in anaerobic growth garriga et al 1996 the fraction of reads mapping to cytochrome c oxidase increased more than threefold from the park to the aeration tank from 2 0 10 4 to 6 4 10 4 indicating the abundance of aerobic bacteria in the aeration tank supplementary figure s1 nrdd decreased tenfold between the park and the aeration tank 1 5 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 indicating an aerobic microbial community while nrdd remained stagnant menaquinone biosynthesis decarboxylase and ubib showed mirroring trends with ubib decreasing between the park and the influent p3 and then increasing in the wtp this also indicates an aerobic microbial community in the wtp to further investigate the taxonomic classification and inter relationships of the reconstructed mags especially those that only had a classification at high taxonomic rank we generated a phylogenetic tree based on 60 universal marker genes supplementary figure s2 we dereplicated the 675 assembled mags resulting in a non redundant set of 57 high quality mags we chose the closest relatives of our mags from the genome taxonomy database to provide context parks et al 2018 twelve of the dereplicated mags belong to the order burkholderiales five mags were classified as betaproteobacteria by bat but did not receive a robust classification at a lower taxonomic rank in the phylogenetic tree the same five genomes were placed within burkholderiales supplementary figure s2 burkholderiales and sphingomonadales genomes were generally more abundant in the wtp compared to the park while sulfuricurvum and pseudomonas were more abundant in or close to the park as the metagenomic datasets are compositional in nature we could not assess whether the bacteria from the park decreased in absolute abundance in the wtp gloor et al 2017 i e which of them were able to grow under aeration 3 2 backwash cycle drives shift in microbial communities from park side to the wtp to explore the effect of oxygen on the microbial community we built a microbial co response network to reveal significant correlations in the abundance of different microbial taxa and between the taxa and chemical parameters fig 3b supplementary figure s3 the network showed two distinct clusters of bacteria the first cluster included alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria flavobacteria gammaproteobacteria xanthomonadales and oligoflexia that correlate positively with oxygen and were abundant in the wtp wtp cluster fig 3b the second cluster included actinobacteria deltaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria erysipelotrichia and gammaproteobacteria pseudomonadales that correlated inversely with oxygen and were abundant in or close to the park park side cluster the separation of the clusters was further supported by principal component analysis fig 3c where principal component pc1 correlated with the sampling point in the pipeline small amounts of oxygen were pumped into the collection basin at p2 by the municipality this basin is never emptied completely and could therefore contain an adapted microbial community explaining the increased abundance of pseudomonas and acinetobacter in the wtp the added oxygen in the abr facilitated the change from an anaerobic to an aerobic microbial community sampling points p3 and p4 are located within 20m of each other yet p4 samples fell among the wtp communities in the pca fig 4 c showing that inoculation of sludge from the sludge thickener p7 into the influent buffer p4 via the backwash cycle see fig 2a is a major driver of the shift in microbial composition to investigate the relative contribution of activated sludge and groundwater derived from the park to the p4 microbial community we used multiple linear regression of the 98 taxa that contributed more than 0 1 of the community to estimate the relative abundance of taxa in p4 from their abundances in p3 and p7 based on this analysis we estimate that p7 contributes nine times as many microbes to the p4 community as p3 89 9 and 10 1 respectively adjusted r2 0 965 consistent with a much higher bacterial density in sludge p7 than in the influent water p3 3 3 diversity decreases as the microbes enter the treatment plant the diversity of the microbial communities in the park side is higher than in the wtp mean species level shannon diversity 3 04 0 41 and 2 7 0 45 respectively see supplementary table s6 this higher diversity might explain i the shorter contigs in the park relative to the wtp mean contig length 447nt and 615nt supplementary table s1 although the number of sequencing reads was similar ii the lower mean depth of contigs 3 24 and 3 65 fold coverage after read mapping iii the fact that a higher fraction of reads did not map to contigs 27 8 8 8 and 13 7 1 3 3 4 known aerobic aromatic compound degradation pathways are more abundant in the treatment plant to identify the shifts in functional potential of the microbial community we mapped metagenomic reads to metacyc pathways we observed a marked difference between the park and wtp side of the pipeline in the number of reads per sample that mapped to the proteins identified in that assembly 22 46 55 6 and 49 44 61 22 of reads respectively while many of the proteins encoded by the microorganisms in the treatment plant had homologs with well described functions the organisms in the park microbiome remain under studied meijenfeldt et al 2019 resulting in a lower annotation rate to analyze the shifts in metabolic potential along the pipeline we searched for known pathways using humann2 caspi et al 2019 the direction and magnitude of the change in relative pathway abundance varied throughout the treatment pipeline and among different pathways fig 4 for example the sampling points at the beginning and the end of the 3km transport pipe p2 and p3 the influent buffer p4 and the sludge thickener p7 showed the largest changes in pathway abundance relative to the previous points here we address aromatic compound degradation acd pathways information about all other pathways involved in e g nucleotide amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism can be found in supplementary table s3 the relative abundance of biodegradation pathway genes particularly all subcategories of acd increased dramatically in the treatment plant fig 4 as most of the well described acd pathways are aerobic this increase in relative abundance is consistent with the oxygen availability in the abr and the backwash cycle from p7 to p4 fig 2 caspi et al 2019 weelink et al 2010 the most abundant metacyc acd pathways identified are related to the degradation of toluene catechol p cumate 3 phenylpropanoate and unspecified aromatic compounds supplementary table s3 catechol is a common intermediate metabolite in aromatic compound degradation surendra et al 2017 which could imply that aromatic compounds from the park are degraded via catechol in the abr pathways for degradation of toluene catechol p cumate and unspecified aromatic compounds appear to increase at p2 then decrease from p2 to p3 before abruptly increasing at p4 fig 4 supplementary table s3 the peak in p2 could have two explanations first the water in the collection basin next to the park is a mixture of water from all around the park and not just from sampling point p1 aromatic compound degradation pathways could be more abundant in other areas of the park which would lead to a higher abundance of acd pathways in the collection basin second small amounts of oxygen are pumped into the collection basin which could lead to an increase in the abundance of aerobic aromatic compound degradation pathways three and a half hours later before the water enters the influent buffer in the treatment plant at p3 the oxygen is all but depleted fig 2b which is mirrored in the decreased relative abundance of degradation pathways at p3 fig 5 based on the decrease of acd pathways in sampling point p3 we suggest that oxygen availability rather than mixture of communities drove the increase of acd pathways in p2 3 5 acd pathways prevalent in key taxa of the plant side next we investigated whether the mags that were enriched in the wtp preferentially contained acd pathways of the 57 high quality non redundant mags 34 contained complete acd pathways 19 of which were enriched in the wtp compared to the park while the remaining 15 mags where more abundant in the park 14 of the 34 mags belonged to the class betaproteobacteria eleven burkholderiales three rhodocyclales other mags that contained complete acd pathways belonged to the orders campylobacterales 4 sulfuricurvum 3 arcobacter pseudomonadales 3 pseudomonas 2 acinetobacter desulfuromonadales 1 geobacter and sphingomonadales 1 unknown genus mags that contain acd pathways make up 24 2 of the community in the park due to some sulfuricurvum genomes containing a syringate degradation pathway in the abr mags that contain acd pathways add up to 42 of the community these results suggest that the taxa enriched in the wtp burkholderiales rhodocyclales sphingomonadales are responsible for the rapid degradation of the pollutants in the abr the only mags that were more abundant in the park side and contained more than one acd pathway belonged to pseudomonadales pseudomonadales are most abundant in the collection basin aerobic biodegradation is possible the most ubiquitous acd pathway among the park enriched mags was the syringate degradation pathway syringate is an intermediate metabolite in the degradation of lignin which is part of the woody plant cell wall and the most abundant aromatic compound in nature janusz et al 2017 while lignin itself is not a toxic compound it bears structural resemblance to some pahs dhar et al 2020 so these proteins annotated as belonging to the syringate degradation pathway may play a role in biodegradation in sulfuricurvum which can thrive in hydrocarbon polluted soil without breaking down the pollutants kodama and watanabe 2004 no known acd pathways other than syringate degradation were found fewer acd pathways were found in the park side bacteria compared to the bacteria in the wtp however the absence of known acd pathways does not rule out biodegradation in the park groundwater among the many genes of unknown function that we recovered 92 3 in the park versus 86 3 in the wtp undescribed anaerobic mechanisms for biodegradation of btex and pah may exist currently 179 out of the 194 acd pathways in the metacyc database depend on oxygen whereas the conditions in the griftpark groundwater are mainly anaerobic anaerobic biodegradation pathways have been found for btex compounds weelink et al 2010 but we found no known complete anaerobic biodegradation pathways in any of the mags in this study 4 conclusions and outlook in this study we investigated the microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation of aromatic compounds in the griftpark groundwater treatment pipeline the pipeline microbiome consists of two distinct groups of microorganisms shifting from mainly anaerobic organisms in the park groundwater to a highly specialized aerobic community in the wtp the microbial communities are dominated by a few highly abundant bacterial taxa both in the park sulfuricurvum and in the wtp burkholderiales burkholderiales which account for only 0 3 of the community in the park make up half of the community in the abr and contain many known aromatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways the highly specialized microbial communities in the abr are enriched and maintained by a backwash cycle that inoculates the influent of the wtp with bacteria from the previous treatment cycle our results provide insight into the biological processes involved in a highly effective groundwater bioremediation system from before treatment to the effluent of the pipeline we show that burkholderiales already well known degraders of various pollutants are likely the driving force behind the degradation in the abr as well as the conditions in the abr are aerobic possible acd pathways are much better described than for the anaerobic conditions in the park whether biodegradation of the pollutants is also happening in the anaerobic groundwater in the park is still an open question and will require further research due to the thorough sampling of the treatment process from beginning to end our results improve the understanding of how the microbial community changes at each step in bioremediation this additional insight will aid in the interpretation of biological processes active in other bioremediation pipelines as well as the design of new bioremediation pipelines declaration of competing interest the authors

15761,currently intercalation materials such as prussian blue analogs have attracted considerable attention in water treatment applications due to their excellent size based selectivity toward cations this study aimed to explore the feasibility of using a nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf electrode for selective nh4 capture from effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant to assess the competitive intercalation between nh4 and other common cations na ca2 a nihcf activated carbon ac hybrid capacitive deionization cdi cell was established to treat mixed salt solutions the results of cyclic voltammetry cv analysis showed a higher current response of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 ions than toward na and ca2 ions in a single salt solution with nh4 the optimized operating voltage of the hybrid cdi cell was 0 8 v with a higher salt adsorption capacity 51 2 mg g than those obtained at other voltages 0 1 0 4 1 2 v in a multisalt solution containing nh4 na and ca2 ions the selectivity coefficients of nh4 ca2 and nh4 na were 9 5 and 4 9 respectively the feasibility of selective nh4 capture using the nihcf electrode in a hybrid cdi cell was demonstrated by treating the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp the intercalation preference of the nihcf electrode with the wwtp effluent was nh4 k na ca2 mg2 and nh4 showed the highest salt adsorption capacity among the cations during consecutive cycles our results revealed that cations with smaller hydrated radii and lower de hydration energies were more favorably intercalated by the nihcf electrode the results provide important knowledge regarding the use of intercalation type electrodes for selective nutrient removal and recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical

increasing human population growth and the rapid development of industrial activities the growing use of anthropogenic ammonia has resulted in excess emissions of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to the aquatic environment le et al 2010 fowler et al 2013 a high concentration of nh4 n tends to cause acidification and eutrophication of water and those effects usually damage ecosystems and lead to economic losses dodds et al 2009 stevens 2019 in many countries nh4 n is regarded as one of the major contaminants in wastewaters and thus stricter regulations have been implemented to control the discharge level of nh4 n after wastewater treatments preisner et al 2020 currently biological processes are the most conventional method to remove nh4 n from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless the nh4 n removal efficiency of biological processes is usually limited in low carbon source wastewaters carrera et al 2004 to meet the discharge standard of nh4 n the addition of carbon

adjusting the ph of the wastewater by chemical addition ro requires a high pressure pump as a driving force and ion removal is not selective to nh4 n these drawbacks hinder the application of these

al 2017 the results from cdi experiments showed that nihcf electrodes can selectively remove monovalent cations over divalent cations from mixed salt solution singh et al 2020 besli et al 2021 until recently few studies have utilized mhcfs as electrodes to remove nh4 from wastewater due to the small hydrated radius of nh4 3 31 å kim et al 2018 gao et al 2021 the cuhcf electrode has been found to

utilized for selective nh4 removal from methanol containing industrial wastewater by using a three electrode electrochemical cell gao et al 2021 note that nihcf has a lattice structure similar to that of cuhcf and exhibits more stable deionization performance than cuhcf over a wide ph range shi et al 2021 nevertheless few studies have investigated the removal selectivity of nh4 over cations by using cdi with nihcf electrodes furthermore more research is required to evaluate the competition effect of multiple cations on the nh4 removal performance of nihcf electrodes and to study the feasibility of using nihcf electrodes to selectively remove nh4 from real wastewaters this study aimed for the first time to utilize a nihcf electrode in a hybrid cdi cell for the selective capture of nh4 from municipal wwtp effluent to evaluate the reactivity of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 and other cations na and ca2 cyclic voltammetry cv analysis was performed with different electrolytes to

from real wastewaters the municipal wwtp effluent was treated by the hybrid cdi cell to study the competitive intercalation behaviors between nh4 and other cations during the operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode material preparation the synthesis of nihcf was modified from the coprecipitation method wessells et al 2011 as shown in fig s1 120 ml of 0 83 mm ni no3 2 99 sigma aldrich usa and an equal volume of a 0 42 mm k3fe cn 6 solution 99 sigma aldrich usa were added dropwise to a glass flask with 60 ml of di water by using a peristaltic pump and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h to form a nihcf precipitate the formed precipitate was collected by centrifugation washed with di water several times by using vacuum filtration and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 and 80 for 36 h each to fabricate the nihcf electrode the dried nihcf powder was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf mw 534 000 sigma aldrich usa in a weight ratio of 9 1 and then suspended in the solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp duksan pure chemicals co ltd to obtain a uniform slurry the electrode slurry was spread onto the titanium current collector by using a doctor blade and the solvent was evaporated from the electrodes at 80 for 2 h in a vacuum oven the activated carbon ac electrode was fabricated by means of the same procedure as that of the nihcf electrode with ac acs20 china steel chemical co taiwan the electrodes were cropped to a size of 8 8 cm2 for the nh4 removal experiments herein the masses of the nihcf and ac electrodes were approximately 0 1 and 0 8 g respectively the nihcf and ac electrodes had thicknesses of approximately 0 03 and 0 17 mm respectively 2 2 physicochemical characterization the surface morphologies and structures of the nihcf and ac electrodes were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem the elemental analysis of the electrode surface was characterized by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the nihcf and ac powders was obtained from the data of nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms by using an asap 2020 m instrument micromeritics inc usa and the pore size distribution was calculated by using the barrett joyner halenda bjh model according to the data of the adsorption branch of the isotherm the crystallinity of the nihcf electrode was measured by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku co japan with cu kα radiation for diffraction angles in the range of 10 2θ 70 2 3 electrochemical characterization the cyclic voltammetry cv and galvanostatic charge discharge gc measurements were carried out in a three electrode cell by using a potentiostat chi 6273d ch instruments inc nihcf and ac electrodes were selected as the symmetric working and counter electrodes with a size of 1 1 cm2 on the graphite current collectors and an ag agcl electrode in 3 m kcl bas model re 1 bioanalytical systems inc was chosen as the reference electrode to compare the electrochemical characteristics in different electrolytes electrochemical measurements were conducted in either 1 m nacl or 1 m nh4cl or a 0 5 m cacl2 solution the specific capacitance cs f g of the electrodes was derived from the current data of the cv measurements according to the following equation 1 c s f g v a v c i d v 2 m v v c v a where v a and v c are the cutoffs of the voltage window i is the response current a and m and v are the mass of the electrode material g and scan rate v s respectively 2 4 operation of the hybrid cdi system the hybrid cdi cell consists of nihcf and ac electrodes as well as a nonconductive mesh separator placed between the electrodes as shown in fig s2 a the setup for nh4 removal experiments consisted of a peristaltic pump l s easy load pump masterflex usa a cdi cell a conductivity ph multimeter orion star a215 thermo fisher scientific inc usa and a potentiostat chi 1127c ch instruments inc usa the effluent stream of the hybrid cdi cell was collected for the measurement of ion concentration by using ion chromatography ic aquion thermo inc usa the nh4 removal experiments were conducted by operating the abovementioned asymmetric two electrode system in single pass mode as shown in fig s2 c the operation of this hybrid cdi setup requires two steps including charging and discharging during the charging step a constant voltage was applied to the cdi cell and the negatively charged nihcf electrode intercalated cations into its interstitial site during the discharging step a reversed voltage was applied to the cdi cell and the positively charged nihcf electrode deintercalated cations from its interstitial site a complete charging or discharging period was switched after the effluent conductivity returned to the approximate value of the initial conductivity to evaluate the optimized operating voltage the cdi cell was operated with single salt solutions 10 mm nh4cl at different constant voltages 0 1 0 4 0 8 1 2 v at a flow rate of 9 ml min to assess the selectivity coefficient of nh4 over other cations using the nihcf electrode the cdi cell was run with binary salt solutions containing 5 mm nh4cl with either 5 mm nacl or 5 mm cacl2 a multisalt solution containing 5 mm nh4cl with both 5 mm nacl and cacl2 and real wastewater from the effluent of a municipal wwtp for all the nh4 removal experiments with mixed salt solutions the cdi cell was operated at 0 8 v ac as the positive electrode and 0 8 v ac as the negative electrode during the charging and discharging periods respectively at a flow rate of 9 ml min in single pass mode the experimental results were presented from the cdi operation cycles close to dynamic steady state the effluent conductivity curve of a charging discharging cycle had less than 10 variation compared with that of the previous cycle to assess the deionization performance of the nihcf electrode the salt adsorption capacity sac and average salt adsorption rate asar were calculated as follows 2 sac mmol g φ 0 t c c 0 c t d t m 3 asar mmol g min sac t c where φ m and t c represent the flow rate l min mass of the electrode material g and charging time min respectively c 0 and c t represent the ion concentrations mm at the initial time and at time t during the charging stage respectively on the other hand the energy performance of the nihcf electrode including volumetric energy consumption e v and molar energy consumption e m was calculated as follows 4 e v kwh m 3 0 t c i v d t v c 5 e m kwh mol 0 t c i v d t φ 0 t c c i c t d t c where v c is the volume of water treated by the cdi cell during the charging stage in one cycle i is the current response a detected from the cdi cell and v is the applied voltage v finally the selectivity coefficient of the target ion over other species was derived from the following equation tsai et al 2021 6 s i j 0 t c φ c i 0 c i t d t c i 0 0 t c φ c j 0 c j t d t c j 0 where the numerator and the denominator represent the ion removal of species i and j normalized to their initial concentration in this study i and j represent nh4 and other cations na and ca2 respectively a value of s i j greater than 1 indicates that nh4 is more preferentially intercalated into the nihcf electrode than other cations 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphology of the nihcf electrode observed by fesem exhibited aggregates of nanoparticles with sizes in the range from 20 70 nm as shown in fig 1 a as shown in table s1 the specific surface area of the nihcf nanoparticles derived from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig s3 was 470 m2 g with a mesopore volume of 72 the porous structure of the nihcf electrode is beneficial for creating channels for ion transport the elemental analysis via eds mapping indicated that the nihcf electrode consisted of c fe ni n and o in decreasing order within its crystal lattices as shown in fig 1 b as shown in fig 1 c the crystalline properties of the nihcf electrode were investigated by xrd spectra and the diffraction peaks of the material could be indexed as cubic nihcf space group f 43 m structures which were consistent with the values of the standard card jcpds no 82 2283 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2017 these results demonstrated that the nihcf electrode was successfully fabricated and exhibited suitable physical properties such as meso porosity elemental composition and cubic crystalline structure fig 2 shows the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials used in this study as shown in fig 2 a the cv curve of the nihcf electrode exhibited a significantly higher current density response than that of the ac electrode at a scan rate of 5 mv s in 1 m nh4cl the pronounced reduction and oxidation peaks of nihcf were observed at 0 39 and 0 6 v vs ag agcl respectively which were attributed to reversible intercalation and deintercalation reactions as mentioned in other studies jin et al 2019 on the other hand the cv curve of the ac electrode displayed a quasi rectangular shape indicating ion storage behavior by the mechanism of edls to further characterize the redox reactivities of the nihcf electrode toward different cations cv analysis was conducted in different electrolyte solutions nh4cl nacl and cacl2 with the same equivalent concentration of 1 m in fig 2 b the reduction potentials with cations followed the order of ca2 0 05 v na 0 29 v and nh4 0 39 v with current density peaks of 1 24 2 43 and 3 07 a g respectively this trend is similar to the results obtained from cuhcf where the intercalation of cations with larger hydrated radii occurs at lower potentials kim et al 2018 in fig 2 c the specific capacitances of the nihcf electrode in cacl2 nacl and nh4cl solutions were 69 136 and 183 f g respectively showing the same trend as the current density peak values for comparison purposes the specific capacitances of ac electrode in different electrolyte solutions were analyzed the specific capacitance of ac electrode followed a different order of na ca2 nh4 as shown in fig s4 the results of cv analysis suggested that the nihcf electrode had significantly higher selectivity toward nh4 than the ac electrode fig 2 d shows the gc profiles of the nihcf electrode in the abovementioned electrolyte solutions at 0 1 a g within the potential range of 0 1 0 v all of the gc curves of nihcf showed symmetrical and reversible properties during charging and discharging and the plateau regions of the curves are ascribed to the intercalation deintercalation reactions the voltage range of the plateau region in the gc curve reflects the redox potential window of nihcf toward specific cations consistent with the corresponding redox peak in the cv curve according to these electrochemical characterizations the nihcf electrode manifested preferential intercalation properties toward cations in the order of nh4 na ca2 note that this preferential intercalation order of cations has also been observed for cuhcf electrodes due to size based sieving of their crystal lattices kim et al 2018 gao et al 2021 our electrochemical characterization results suggest that the nihcf electrode has great potential as a selective electrode for capturing nh4 3 2 optimized voltage for ammonium removal with single salt solutions to elucidate the optimized performance of the nihcf electrode for nh4 removal the hybrid cdi cell was operated at different operating voltages with a 10 mm nh4cl solution as shown in fig s5 a the effluent concentration of nh4 decreased as a voltage was applied to the nihcf electrode and the concentration of nh4 increased when a reversed voltage was applied to the electrode the effluent nh4 concentration decreased as the applied voltage was increased from 0 1 0 8 v and the concentration change at 1 2 v was less than those at 0 4 v and 0 8 v as shown in fig 3 a the sacs of the nihcf electrode ranged from 19 5 to 51 2 mg g as the voltages increased from 0 1 to 0 8 v and the sac of nihcf at 1 2 v 36 2 mg g was lower than that at 0 4 and 0 8 v on the other hand the charge efficiency of the cdi cell decreased as the applied voltage increased notably the uneven potential distribution of the cathode and anode has been observed in many two electrode cdi systems omosebi et al 2017 zornitta et al 2018 torkamanzadeh et al 2020 and the intercalation performance of nihcf was affected by the potential distribution the highest nh4 removal performance at 0 8 v indicated that the potential of nihcf in this two electrode system might approach the reduction potential of nh4 intercalation 0 39 v vs ag agcl fig 3 b shows that the effluent ph of the cdi cell fluctuated as a function of the applied voltage the lowest ph of the effluent solution was observed at 1 2 v indicating that the strongest anodic side reactions such as carbon oxidation maass et al 2008 and cl oxidation jung et al 2010 might occur on the ac electrode when the ph decreased more protons could outcompete other cations to the interstitial sites in the nihcf due to their smaller hydrated size 2 82 å for h3o and faster diffusion rate shi et al 2021 the competitive intercalation between protons and cations at lower ph could reduce sac at 1 2 v additionally a higher total current and leakage current were observed at 1 2 v than under other conditions as shown in fig s5 b and c respectively note that less nh4 was removed at 1 2 v than at 0 8 v fig s5 a the higher current response at 1 2 v than 0 8 v this result could be ascribed to the anodic side reactions in fig 3 c the molar energy consumption of the cdi cell at 1 2 v was approximately 1 7 times of that at 0 8 v suggesting that the high overpotential led to energy loss in strong anodic side reactions to further analyze the nh4 removal performance of the nihcf electrode at different voltages the sac and asar were displayed by using a cdi ragone plot kim and yoon 2015 fig 3 d shows that the nihcf electrode exhibited optimal performance in terms of sac and asar at 0 8 v compared to that at other voltages the asar of the nihcf at 0 8 v was between 2 and 3 9 mg g min which was highly superior to that at 1 2 v 1 3 to 1 8 mg g min although the asar of the nihcf at 0 4 v was close to that at 0 8 v the sac at 0 4 v 45 6 mg g was approximately 13 lower than that at 0 8 v therefore 0 8 v was chosen as the operating voltage for this hybrid nihcf ac cdi in the subsequent nh4 removal experiments with mixed salt solutions 3 3 intercalation selectivity of ammonium with mixed salt solutions to study the effect of competitive intercalation using the nihcf electrode on nh4 removal the cdi cell was run with binary salt and multisalt solutions in single pass mode at 0 8 v 0 8 v fig 4 shows the different patterns of competitive intercalation between nh4 and cations during the charging and discharging periods of the cdi operation almost identical ph fluctuations and current responses were observed in the experiments with different mixed salt solutions as shown in fig s6 in fig 4 a a two stage competition process was observed between nh4 and ca2 during the charging period in the early charging stage nh4 and ca2 were simultaneously intercalated into the nihcf electrode afterward the concentration of ca2 in the effluent gradually increased above the initial concentration while the concentration of nh4 still decreased and remained below its initial value in the late charging stage the repulsion peak of ca2 indicated that the ca2 ions intercalated in the nihcf were substituted by nh4 ions in the discharging period the concentration of nh4 increased instantly when the polarity was reversed notably an approximately 6 reduction in the ca2 concentration was observed implying that the ca2 ions from nihcf and the flow channel were electrosorbed onto the ac electrode due to the ping pong effect hatzell and hatzell 2018 by applying an asymmetric design using nihcf and ac electrodes the nh4 ions can be effectively recovered during the discharging period which was likely caused by the different preferences of ac toward cations fig 4 b shows the same phenomenon of preferential intercalation toward nh4 over na and an accompanying repulsion peak of na was also observed in the charging period compared with the ca2 nh4 mixed solution as shown in fig 4 c the intercalation preference of cations was nh4 na ca2 in the multisalt solution demonstrating that the nihcf electrode exhibited a high selectivity to nh4 against other background cations the sacs of cations and the selectivity coefficients obtained in the experiments with mixed salt solutions were further analyzed as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a to c the sacs of nh4 were in the range of 1 72 to 2 01 mmol g in different mixed solutions and were significantly higher than those of other cations in each solution in fig 5 d the selectivity coefficients of nh4 were 4 9 and 9 5 when competing with na and ca2 in the binary salt solutions respectively moreover the selectivity of nh4 over na 2 9 was lower than that of nh4 over ca2 15 3 when these three types of cations existed in equal amounts demonstrating that the selectivity value of nh4 over different cations could be affected by the ratios of nh4 and other cations nevertheless the order of the preferential intercalation toward cations was nh4 na ca2 in the multisalt solution this intercalation preference in the single pass cdi operation was also in excellent agreement with the strength of the redox current densities in the cv curves with different cations fig 2 b moreover nh4 was efficiently recovered 99 from the nihcf electrode during the discharging period even though the composition of salt solutions was varied as shown in fig s7 on the other hand ca2 and na were captured by the ac electrode during the discharging period resulting in the amount of desorbed cations fig s7 being less than that of electroadsorbed cations fig 5 a c this asymmetric design of cdi with nihcf and ac electrodes is beneficial for selectively enriching nh4 from wastewater for potential applications in nutrient recovery the abovementioned results of competitive intercalation using nihcf electrodes were compared with those of other studies utilizing mhcf electrodes as shown in table 1 despite different operating conditions in other studies the same relationships of preferential intercalation including nh4 over na kim et al 2018 and na over ca2 singh et al 2020 were disclosed in the batch operation of different electrochemical cells by using cuhcf and nihcf electrodes respectively these results demonstrated that the selectivity trend toward cations using the nihcf electrode in this work was comparable to that in other studies using different mhcf electrodes in general cations with higher hydrated radii usually require more energy for hydration and dehydration as shown in table 2 cations must be partially dehydrated to intercalate into the lattices of mhcfs wang et al 2015 therefore cations with lower hydration energies tend to be intercalated in mhcf electrodes in our case intercalation of ca2 into the nihcf electrode was less thermodynamically favorable than that of monovalent cations and capture of nh4 was more favorable than that of na additionally the energy barrier entropy for intercalation of divalent cations is likely higher than that for monovalent cations since twice as many fe3 centers in the nihcf lattices are simultaneously reduced in comparison with the intercalation of monovalent cations singh et al 2020 the hydrated size de hydration energy of cations and energy barrier for the intercalation reaction could explain the preferential intercalation behavior of nh4 over other cations during the charging periods in single pass mode cdi operation as shown in fig 4 3 4 selective capture of ammonium from real wastewater to further examine the selectivity of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 in real wastewater the municipal wwtp effluent table s2 was tested by using the hybrid nihcf ac cdi cell at 0 8 v 0 8 v fig 6 a displays the concentration changes in cations of 3 consecutive cycles of single pass cdi operation obviously monovalent cations were more preferentially captured by the nihcf electrode during the charging periods in comparison with divalent cations notably the initial concentration of nh4 was 0 76 mm which was 3 4 and 2 4 times lower than the initial concentrations of na and ca2 respectively nevertheless nh4 exhibited the highest average changes in both the charging and discharging periods among monovalent cations indicating that nh4 was highly preferentially intercalated and deintercalated by the nihcf electrode on the other hand na showed the greatest removal in the early charging period compared with other monovalent cations and the subsequent repulsion peak during the late charging period indicated that the intercalated na ions might be outcompeted from the crystal lattices of nihcf and likely substituted by other cations this competitive repulsion effect of na was the same as that observed in mixed salt solutions fig 4 k and nh4 underwent similar concentration changes which is likely due to their similar hydrated radii and de hydration energies in contrast to monovalent cations divalent cations including ca2 and mg2 were barely intercalated by the nihcf electrode during the charging period only a few divalent cations were captured by the nihcf electrode in the early charging period within the first 15 min and then most of the captured divalent cations were repelled from the lattices of the electrode to form the abovementioned repulsion peak fig 4 this result implied that divalent cations were unfavorable for intercalation by the nihcf electrode even though their initial concentrations were on average higher than those of other monovalent cations fig 6 b displays the sacs of cations obtained from the operation of the hybrid cdi during charging periods only the monovalent cations were captured by the nihcf electrode and the sacs of nh4 na and k were 0 62 0 35 and 0 21 mmol g respectively note that the ca2 and mg2 ions were repelled from the lattice of the nihcf electrode fig 6 a and negative values of sacs approximately 0 05 mmol g were obtained the preferential intercalation of cations using the nihcf electrode was again displayed in the case of real wastewater showing good agreement with the results obtained using mixed salt solutions the preferential intercalation order for cations in real wastewater using the nihcf electrode was nh4 k na ca2 mg2 which still followed the order of hydrated radii and hydration energy as shown in table 2 ca2 and mg2 were not captured by the electrode but the selectivity coefficients of nh4 over na and nh4 over k using the nihcf electrode were approximately 7 5 and 1 3 respectively noticeably nh4 could effectively outcompete na by using the nihcf electrode nevertheless selectively separating nh4 from k in water will be a challenge in the future due to their similar hydration properties furthermore a decrease in the cation and anion concentrations fig 6 a and fig s9 as well as changes in conductivity fig s8 a between each cycle were observed which reflected the decreasing intercalation capacity of the nihcf electrode during charging and discharging respectively fig 6 a lattice structural distortion substitution of ni2 and o2 evolution side reactions could lead to loss of intercalation capacity wang et al 2020 shrivastava et al 2019 additionally some studies have pointed out that a more basic surrounding ph tends to cause the dissolution of ni2 and thus reduce the intercalation capacity of the nihcf electrode shi et al 2021 the near neutral ph of real wastewater 7 5 7 9 as shown in fig s8 b might cause this slightly reduced capacity of nihcf for cations our study shows that nihcf has excellent selectivity toward nh4 over conventional cations in both mixed salt solutions and real wastewater improving the stability of the electrode will be a future topic for real applications of nutrient recovery and removal from wastewater 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that a nihcf electrode in a hybrid cdi system exhibited excellent selectivity toward nh4 over other conventional cations na and ca2 in terms of electrochemical reactivity and removal performance a higher current response of the nihcf electrode was observed when the electrolyte contained nh4 than when it contained na or ca2 in the single pass nh4 removal experiments 0 8 v was found to be the optimal voltage for the hybrid nihcf ac cdi cell nh4 removal experiments revealed the competitive intercalation of nh4 with other cations our results showed that nh4 ions tended to replace the intercalated ca2 and na ions in the nihcf lattices during the late charging period of the single pass operation these findings indicated that cations with smaller hydrated radii and lower de hydration energies are more favorably intercalated into the crystal lattices of the nihcf electrode importantly this preferential intercalation effect of the nihcf electrode was validated by testing with a real municipal wwtp effluent and the preferential intercalation order of the nihcf electrode toward cations was nh4 k na ca2 mg2 our work proves that nihcf has excellent potential to serve as an nh4 selective electrode for applications in nutrient removal and recovery from

15761,currently intercalation materials such as prussian blue analogs have attracted considerable attention in water treatment applications due to their excellent size based selectivity toward cations this study aimed to explore the feasibility of using a nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf electrode for selective nh4 capture from effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant to assess the competitive intercalation between nh4 and other common cations na ca2 a nihcf activated carbon ac hybrid capacitive deionization cdi cell was established to treat mixed salt solutions the results of cyclic voltammetry cv analysis showed a higher current response of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 ions than toward na and ca2 ions in a single salt solution with nh4 the optimized operating voltage of the hybrid cdi cell was 0 8 v with a higher salt adsorption capacity 51 2 mg g than those obtained at other voltages 0 1 0 4 1 2 v in a multisalt solution containing nh4 na and ca2 ions the

abstract keywords ammonium removal capacitive deionization intercalation material ion selectivity municipal wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with increasing human population growth and the rapid development of industrial activities the growing use of anthropogenic ammonia has resulted in excess emissions of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to the aquatic environment le et al 2010 fowler et al 2013 a high concentration of nh4 n tends to cause acidification and eutrophication of water and those effects usually damage ecosystems and lead to economic losses dodds et al 2009 stevens 2019 in many countries nh4 n is regarded as one of the major contaminants in wastewaters and thus stricter regulations have been implemented to control the discharge level of nh4 n after wastewater treatments preisner et al 2020 currently biological processes are the most conventional method to remove nh4 n from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless the nh4 n removal efficiency of biological processes is usually limited in low carbon source wastewaters carrera et al 2004 to meet the discharge standard of nh4 n the addition of carbon

precipitation huang et al 2014 and reverse osmosis ro bodalo et al 2005 are feasible for the removal or recovery of nh4 n from wastewater however ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation require adjusting the ph of the wastewater by chemical addition ro requires a high pressure pump as a driving force and ion removal is not selective to nh4 n these drawbacks hinder the application of these

lattice by maintaining the charge neutrality of the iron center according to the following redox equation jin et al 2019 a x m y f e i i i cn 6 z z a z e a x z m y f e i i cn 6 z in general cations with smaller hydrated radii are preferentially intercalated into the lattices of mhcfs bocarsly and sinha 1982 singh et al 2020 note that the hydrated radii of common cations including na k ca2 and mg2 were estimated to be 3 58 3 31 4 12 and 4 28 å respectively nightingale 1959 the preferential capture of k over na was observed in an electrochemical cell by using a nihcf flow electrode porada et al 2017 the results from cdi experiments showed that nihcf electrodes can selectively remove monovalent cations over divalent cations from mixed salt solution singh et al 2020 besli et al 2021 until recently few studies have utilized mhcfs as electrodes to remove nh4 from wastewater due to the small hydrated radius of nh4 3 31 å kim et al 2018 gao et al 2021 the cuhcf electrode has been found to show high removal selectivity toward nh4 over other cations k ca2 and mg2 by applying a low voltage 0 1 0 3 v in a two electrode electrochemical cell kim et al 2018 the cuhcf electrode has been utilized for selective nh4 removal from methanol containing industrial wastewater by using a three electrode electrochemical cell gao et al 2021 note that nihcf has a lattice structure similar to that of cuhcf and exhibits more stable deionization performance than cuhcf over a wide ph range shi et al 2021 nevertheless few studies have investigated the removal selectivity of nh4 over cations by using cdi with nihcf electrodes furthermore more research is required to evaluate the competition effect of multiple cations on the nh4 removal performance of nihcf electrodes and to study the feasibility of using nihcf electrodes to selectively remove nh4 from real wastewaters this study aimed for the first time to utilize a nihcf electrode in a hybrid cdi cell for the selective capture of nh4 from municipal wwtp effluent to evaluate the reactivity of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 and other cations na and ca2 cyclic voltammetry cv analysis was performed with different electrolytes to assess the optimized operating voltage of the nihcf electrode for nh4 removal in cdi single pass nh4 removal experiments were carried out by using a nihcf activated carbon ac hybrid cdi cell with single salt solutions nh4cl under various voltages from 0 1 1 2 v the selectivity of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 over other cations was investigated by performing nh4 removal experiments by using a hybrid cdi cell with mixed salt solutions nh4cl nacl nh4cl na2so4 nh4cl nacl na2so4 in single pass mode last this study evaluated the feasibility of using the nihcf electrode for selective nh4 capture from real wastewaters the municipal wwtp effluent was treated by the hybrid cdi cell to study the competitive intercalation behaviors between nh4 and other cations during the operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode material preparation the synthesis of nihcf was modified from the coprecipitation method wessells et al 2011 as shown in fig s1 120 ml of 0 83 mm ni no3 2 99 sigma aldrich usa and an equal volume of a 0 42 mm k3fe cn 6 solution 99 sigma aldrich usa were added dropwise to a glass flask with 60 ml of di water by using a peristaltic pump and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h to form a nihcf precipitate the formed precipitate was collected by centrifugation washed with di water several times by using vacuum filtration and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 and 80 for 36 h each to fabricate the nihcf electrode the dried nihcf powder was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf mw 534 000 sigma aldrich usa in a weight ratio of 9 1 and then suspended in the solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp duksan pure chemicals co ltd to obtain a uniform slurry the electrode slurry was spread onto the titanium current collector by using a doctor blade and the solvent was evaporated from the electrodes at 80 for 2 h in a vacuum oven the activated carbon ac electrode was fabricated by means of the same procedure as that of the nihcf electrode with ac acs20 china steel chemical co taiwan the electrodes were cropped to a size of 8 8 cm2 for the nh4 removal experiments herein the masses of the nihcf and ac electrodes were approximately 0 1 and 0 8 g respectively the nihcf and ac electrodes had thicknesses of approximately 0 03 and 0 17 mm respectively 2 2 physicochemical characterization the surface morphologies and structures of the nihcf and ac electrodes were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem the elemental analysis of the electrode surface was characterized by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the nihcf and ac powders was obtained from the data of nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms by using an asap 2020 m instrument micromeritics inc usa and the pore size distribution was calculated by using the barrett joyner halenda bjh model according to the data of the adsorption branch of the isotherm the crystallinity of the nihcf electrode was measured by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku co japan with cu kα radiation for diffraction angles in the range of 10 2θ 70 2 3 electrochemical characterization the cyclic voltammetry cv and galvanostatic charge discharge gc measurements were carried out in a three electrode cell by using a potentiostat chi 6273d ch instruments inc nihcf and ac electrodes were selected as the symmetric working and counter electrodes with a size of 1 1 cm2 on the graphite current collectors and an ag agcl electrode in 3 m kcl bas model re 1 bioanalytical systems inc was chosen as the reference electrode to compare the electrochemical characteristics in different electrolytes electrochemical measurements were conducted in either 1 m nacl or 1 m nh4cl or a 0 5 m cacl2 solution the specific capacitance cs f g of the electrodes was derived from the current data of the cv measurements according to the following equation 1 c s f g v a v c i d v 2 m v v c v a where v a and v c are the cutoffs of the voltage window i is the response current a and m and v are the mass of the electrode material g and scan rate v s respectively 2 4 operation of the hybrid cdi system the hybrid cdi cell consists of nihcf and ac electrodes as well as a nonconductive mesh separator placed between the electrodes as shown in fig s2 a the setup for nh4 removal experiments consisted of a peristaltic pump l s easy load pump masterflex usa a cdi cell a conductivity ph multimeter orion star a215 thermo fisher scientific inc usa and a potentiostat chi 1127c ch instruments inc usa the effluent stream of the hybrid cdi cell was collected for the measurement of ion concentration by using ion chromatography ic aquion thermo inc usa the nh4 removal experiments were conducted by operating the abovementioned asymmetric two electrode system in single pass mode as shown in fig s2 c the operation of this hybrid cdi setup requires two steps including charging and discharging during the charging step a constant voltage was applied to the cdi cell and the negatively charged nihcf electrode intercalated cations into its interstitial site during the discharging step a reversed voltage was applied to the cdi cell and the positively charged nihcf electrode deintercalated cations from its interstitial site a complete charging or discharging period was switched after the effluent conductivity returned to the approximate value of the initial conductivity to evaluate the optimized operating voltage the cdi cell was operated with single salt solutions 10 mm nh4cl at different constant voltages 0 1 0 4 0 8 1 2 v at a flow rate of 9 ml min to assess the selectivity coefficient of nh4 over other cations using the nihcf electrode the cdi cell was run with binary salt solutions containing 5 mm nh4cl with either 5 mm nacl or 5 mm cacl2 a multisalt solution containing 5 mm nh4cl with both 5 mm nacl and cacl2 and real wastewater from the effluent of a municipal wwtp for all the nh4 removal experiments with mixed salt solutions the cdi cell was operated at 0 8 v ac as the positive electrode and 0 8 v ac as the negative electrode during the charging and discharging periods respectively at a flow rate of 9 ml min in single pass mode the experimental results were presented from the cdi operation cycles close to dynamic steady state the effluent conductivity curve of a charging discharging cycle had less than 10 variation compared with that of the previous cycle to assess the deionization performance of the nihcf electrode the salt adsorption capacity sac and average salt adsorption rate asar were calculated as follows 2 sac mmol g φ 0 t c c 0 c t d t m 3 asar mmol g min sac t c where φ m and t c represent the flow rate l min mass of the electrode material g and charging time min respectively c 0 and c t represent the ion concentrations mm at the initial time and at time t during the charging stage respectively on the other hand the energy performance of the nihcf electrode including volumetric energy consumption e v and molar energy consumption e m was calculated as follows 4 e v kwh m 3 0 t c i v d t v c 5 e m kwh mol 0 t c i v d t φ 0 t c c i c t d t c where v c is the volume of water treated by the cdi cell during the charging stage in one cycle i is the current response a detected from the cdi cell and v is the applied voltage v finally the selectivity coefficient of the target ion over other species was derived from the following equation tsai et al 2021 6 s i j 0 t c φ c i 0 c i t d t c i 0 0 t c φ c j 0 c j t d t c j 0 where the numerator and the denominator represent the ion removal of species i and j normalized to their initial concentration in this study i and j represent nh4 and other cations na and ca2 respectively a value of s i j greater than 1 indicates that nh4 is more preferentially intercalated into the nihcf electrode than other cations 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphology of the nihcf electrode observed by fesem exhibited aggregates of nanoparticles with sizes in the range from 20 70 nm as shown in fig 1 a as shown in table s1 the specific surface area of the nihcf nanoparticles derived from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig s3 was 470 m2 g with a mesopore volume of 72 the porous structure of the nihcf electrode is beneficial for creating channels for ion transport the elemental analysis via eds mapping indicated that the nihcf electrode consisted of c fe ni n and o in decreasing order within its crystal lattices as shown in fig 1 b as shown in fig 1 c the crystalline properties of the nihcf electrode were investigated by xrd spectra and the diffraction peaks of the material could be indexed as cubic nihcf space group f 43 m structures which were consistent with the values of the standard card jcpds no 82 2283 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2017 these results demonstrated that the nihcf electrode was successfully fabricated and exhibited suitable physical properties such as meso porosity elemental composition and cubic crystalline structure fig 2 shows the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials used in this study as shown in fig 2 a the cv curve of the nihcf electrode exhibited a significantly higher current density response than that of the ac electrode at a scan rate of 5 mv s in 1 m nh4cl the pronounced reduction and oxidation peaks of nihcf were observed at 0 39 and 0 6 v vs ag agcl respectively which were attributed to reversible intercalation and deintercalation reactions as mentioned in other studies jin et al 2019 on the other hand the cv curve of the ac electrode displayed a quasi rectangular shape indicating ion storage behavior by the mechanism of edls to further characterize the redox reactivities of the nihcf electrode toward different cations cv analysis was conducted in different electrolyte solutions nh4cl nacl and cacl2 with the same equivalent concentration of 1 m in fig 2 b the reduction potentials with cations followed the order of ca2 0 05 v na 0 29 v and nh4 0 39 v with current density peaks of 1 24 2 43 and 3 07 a g respectively this trend is similar to the results obtained from cuhcf where the intercalation of cations with larger hydrated radii occurs at lower potentials kim et al 2018 in fig 2 c the specific capacitances of the nihcf electrode in cacl2 nacl and nh4cl solutions were 69 136 and 183 f g respectively showing the same trend as the current density peak values for comparison purposes the specific capacitances of ac electrode in different electrolyte solutions were analyzed the specific capacitance of ac electrode followed a different order of na ca2 nh4 as shown in fig s4 the results of cv analysis suggested that the nihcf electrode had significantly higher selectivity toward nh4 than the ac electrode fig 2 d shows the gc profiles of the nihcf electrode in the abovementioned electrolyte solutions at 0 1 a g within the potential range of 0 1 0 v all of the gc curves of nihcf showed symmetrical and reversible properties during charging and discharging and the plateau regions of the curves are ascribed to the intercalation deintercalation reactions the voltage range of the plateau region in the gc curve reflects the redox potential window of nihcf toward specific cations consistent with the corresponding redox peak in the cv curve according to these electrochemical characterizations the nihcf electrode manifested preferential intercalation properties toward cations in the order of nh4 na ca2 note that this preferential intercalation order of cations has also been observed for cuhcf electrodes due to size based sieving of their crystal lattices kim et al 2018 gao et al 2021 our electrochemical characterization results suggest that the nihcf electrode has great potential as a selective electrode for capturing nh4 3 2 optimized voltage for ammonium removal with single salt solutions to elucidate the optimized performance of the nihcf electrode for nh4 removal the hybrid cdi cell was operated at different operating voltages with a 10 mm nh4cl solution as shown in fig s5 a the effluent concentration of nh4 decreased as a voltage was applied to the nihcf electrode and the concentration of nh4 increased when a reversed voltage was applied to the electrode the effluent nh4 concentration decreased as the applied voltage was increased from 0 1 0 8 v and the concentration change at 1 2 v was less than those at 0 4 v and 0 8 v as shown in fig 3 a the sacs of the nihcf electrode ranged from 19 5 to 51 2 mg g as the voltages increased from 0 1 to 0 8 v and the sac of nihcf at 1 2 v 36 2 mg g was lower than that at 0 4 and 0 8 v on the other hand the charge efficiency of the cdi cell decreased as the applied voltage increased notably the uneven potential distribution of the cathode and anode has been observed in many two electrode cdi systems omosebi et al 2017 zornitta et al 2018 torkamanzadeh et al 2020 and the intercalation performance of nihcf was affected by the potential distribution the highest nh4 removal performance at 0 8 v indicated that the potential of nihcf in this two electrode system might approach the reduction potential of nh4 intercalation 0 39 v vs ag agcl fig 3 b shows that the effluent ph of the cdi cell fluctuated as a function of the applied voltage the lowest ph of the effluent solution was observed at 1 2 v indicating that the strongest anodic side reactions such as carbon oxidation maass et al 2008 and cl oxidation jung et al 2010 might occur on the ac electrode when the ph decreased more protons could outcompete other cations to the interstitial sites in the nihcf due to their smaller hydrated size 2 82 å for h3o and faster diffusion rate shi et al 2021 the competitive intercalation between protons and cations at lower ph could reduce sac at 1 2 v additionally a higher total current and leakage current were observed at 1 2 v than under other conditions as shown in fig s5 b and c respectively note that less nh4 was removed at 1 2 v than at 0 8 v fig s5 a the higher current response at 1 2 v than 0 8 v this result could be ascribed to the anodic side reactions in fig 3 c the molar energy consumption of the cdi cell at 1 2 v was approximately 1 7 times of that at 0 8 v suggesting that the high overpotential led to energy loss in strong anodic side reactions to further analyze the nh4 removal performance of the nihcf electrode at different voltages the sac and asar were displayed by using a cdi ragone plot kim and yoon 2015 fig 3 d shows that the nihcf electrode exhibited optimal performance in terms of sac and asar at 0 8 v compared to that at other voltages the asar of the nihcf at 0 8 v was between 2 and 3 9 mg g min which was highly superior to that at 1 2 v 1 3 to 1 8 mg g min although the asar of the nihcf at 0 4 v was close to that at 0 8 v the sac at 0 4 v 45 6 mg g was approximately 13 lower than that at 0 8 v therefore 0 8 v was chosen as the operating voltage for this hybrid nihcf ac cdi in the subsequent nh4 removal experiments with mixed salt solutions 3 3 intercalation selectivity of ammonium with mixed salt solutions to study the effect of competitive intercalation using the nihcf electrode on nh4 removal the cdi cell was run with binary salt and multisalt solutions in single pass mode at 0 8 v 0 8 v fig 4 shows the different patterns of competitive intercalation between nh4 and cations during the charging and discharging periods of the cdi operation almost identical ph fluctuations and current responses were observed in the experiments with different mixed salt solutions as shown in fig s6 in fig 4 a a two stage competition process was observed between nh4 and ca2 during the charging period in the early charging stage nh4 and ca2 were simultaneously intercalated into the nihcf electrode afterward the concentration of ca2 in the effluent gradually increased above the initial concentration while the concentration of nh4 still decreased and remained below its initial value in the late charging stage the repulsion peak of ca2 indicated that the ca2 ions intercalated in the nihcf were substituted by nh4 ions in the discharging period the concentration of nh4 increased instantly when the polarity was reversed notably an approximately 6 reduction in the ca2 concentration was observed implying that the ca2 ions from nihcf and the flow channel were electrosorbed onto the ac electrode due to the ping pong effect hatzell and hatzell 2018 by applying an asymmetric design using nihcf and ac electrodes the nh4 ions can be effectively recovered during the discharging period which was likely caused by the different preferences of ac toward cations fig 4 b shows the same phenomenon of preferential intercalation toward nh4 over na and an accompanying repulsion peak of na was also observed in the charging period compared with the ca2 nh4 mixed solution as shown in fig 4 c the intercalation preference of cations was nh4 na ca2 in the multisalt solution demonstrating that the nihcf electrode exhibited a high selectivity to nh4 against other background cations the sacs of cations and the selectivity coefficients obtained in the experiments with mixed salt solutions were further analyzed as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a to c the sacs of nh4 were in the range of 1 72 to 2 01 mmol g in different mixed solutions and were significantly higher than those of other cations in each solution in fig 5 d the selectivity coefficients of nh4 were 4 9 and 9 5 when competing with na and ca2 in the binary salt solutions respectively moreover the selectivity of nh4 over na 2 9 was lower than that of nh4 over ca2 15 3 when these three types of cations existed in equal amounts demonstrating that the selectivity value of nh4 over different cations could be affected by the ratios of nh4 and other cations nevertheless the order of the preferential intercalation toward cations was nh4 na ca2 in the multisalt solution this intercalation preference in the single pass cdi operation was also in excellent agreement with the strength of the redox current densities in the cv curves with different cations fig 2 b moreover nh4 was efficiently recovered 99 from the nihcf electrode during the discharging period even though the composition of salt solutions was varied as shown in fig s7 on the other hand ca2 and na were captured by the ac electrode during the discharging period resulting in the amount of desorbed cations fig s7 being less than that of electroadsorbed cations fig 5 a c this asymmetric design of cdi with nihcf and ac electrodes is beneficial for selectively enriching nh4 from wastewater for potential applications in nutrient recovery the abovementioned results of competitive intercalation using nihcf electrodes were compared with those of other studies utilizing mhcf electrodes as shown in table 1 despite different operating conditions in other studies the same relationships of preferential intercalation including nh4 over na kim et al 2018 and na over ca2 singh et al 2020 were disclosed in the batch operation of different electrochemical cells by using cuhcf and nihcf electrodes respectively these results demonstrated that the selectivity trend toward cations using the nihcf electrode in this work was comparable to that in other studies using different mhcf electrodes in general cations with higher hydrated radii usually require more energy for hydration and dehydration as shown in table 2 cations must be partially dehydrated to intercalate into the lattices of mhcfs wang et al 2015 therefore cations with lower hydration energies tend to be intercalated in mhcf electrodes in our case intercalation of ca2 into the nihcf electrode was less thermodynamically favorable than that of monovalent cations and capture of nh4 was more favorable than that of na additionally the energy barrier entropy for intercalation of divalent cations is likely higher than that for monovalent cations since twice as many fe3 centers in the nihcf lattices are simultaneously reduced in comparison with the intercalation of monovalent cations singh et al 2020 the hydrated size de hydration energy of cations and energy barrier for the intercalation reaction could explain the preferential intercalation behavior of nh4 over other cations during the charging periods in single pass mode cdi operation as shown in fig 4 3 4 selective capture of ammonium from real wastewater to further examine the selectivity of the nihcf electrode toward nh4 in real wastewater the municipal wwtp effluent table s2 was tested by using the hybrid nihcf ac cdi cell at 0 8 v 0 8 v fig 6 a displays the concentration changes in cations of 3 consecutive cycles of single pass cdi operation obviously monovalent cations were more preferentially captured by the nihcf electrode during the charging periods in comparison with divalent cations notably the initial concentration of nh4 was 0 76 mm which was 3 4 and 2 4 times lower than the initial concentrations of na and ca2 respectively nevertheless nh4 exhibited the highest average changes in both the charging and discharging periods among monovalent cations indicating that nh4 was highly preferentially intercalated and deintercalated by the nihcf electrode on the other hand na showed the greatest removal in the early charging period compared with other monovalent cations and the subsequent repulsion peak during the late charging period indicated that the intercalated na ions might be outcompeted from the crystal lattices of nihcf and likely substituted by other cations this competitive repulsion effect of na was the same as that observed in mixed salt solutions fig 4 k and nh4 underwent similar concentration changes which is likely due to their similar hydrated radii and de hydration energies in contrast to monovalent cations divalent cations including ca2 and mg2 were barely intercalated by the nihcf electrode during the charging period only a few divalent cations were captured by the nihcf electrode in the early charging period within the first 15 min and then most of the captured divalent cations were repelled from the lattices of the electrode to form the abovementioned repulsion peak fig 4 this result implied that divalent cations were unfavorable for intercalation by the nihcf electrode even though their initial concentrations were on average higher than those of other monovalent cations fig 6 b displays the sacs of cations obtained from the operation of the hybrid cdi during charging periods only the monovalent cations were captured by the nihcf electrode and the sacs of nh4 na and k were 0 62 0 35 and 0 21 mmol g respectively note that the ca2 and mg2 ions were repelled from the lattice of the nihcf electrode fig 6 a and negative values of sacs approximately 0 05 mmol g were obtained the preferential intercalation of cations using the nihcf electrode was again displayed in the case of real wastewater showing good agreement with the results obtained using mixed salt solutions the preferential intercalation order for cations in real wastewater using the nihcf electrode was nh4 k na ca2 mg2 which still followed the order of hydrated radii and hydration energy as shown in table 2 ca2 and mg2 were not captured by the electrode but the selectivity coefficients of nh4 over na and nh4 over k using the nihcf electrode were approximately 7 5 and 1 3 respectively noticeably nh4 could effectively outcompete na by using the nihcf electrode nevertheless selectively separating nh4 from k in water will be a challenge in the future due to their similar hydration properties furthermore a decrease in the cation and anion concentrations fig 6 a and fig s9 as well as changes in conductivity fig s8 a between each cycle were observed which reflected the decreasing intercalation capacity of the nihcf electrode during charging and discharging respectively fig 6 a lattice structural distortion substitution of ni2 and o2 evolution side reactions could lead to loss of intercalation capacity wang et al 2020 shrivastava et al 2019 additionally some studies have pointed out that a more basic surrounding ph tends to cause the dissolution of ni2 and thus reduce the intercalation capacity of the nihcf electrode shi et al 2021 the near neutral ph of real wastewater 7 5 7 9 as shown in fig s8 b might cause this slightly reduced capacity of nihcf for cations our study shows that nihcf has excellent selectivity toward nh4 over conventional cations in both mixed salt solutions and real wastewater improving the stability of the electrode will be a future topic for real applications of nutrient recovery and removal from wastewater 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that a nihcf electrode in a hybrid cdi system exhibited excellent selectivity toward nh4 over other conventional cations na and ca2 in terms of electrochemical reactivity and removal performance a higher current response of the nihcf electrode was observed when the electrolyte contained nh4 than when it contained na or ca2 in the single pass nh4 removal experiments 0 8 v was found to be the optimal voltage for the hybrid nihcf ac cdi cell nh4 removal experiments revealed the competitive intercalation of nh4 with other cations our results showed that nh4 ions tended to replace the intercalated ca2 and na ions in the nihcf lattices during the late charging period of the single pass operation these findings indicated that cations with smaller hydrated radii and lower de hydration energies are more favorably intercalated into the crystal lattices of the nihcf electrode importantly this preferential intercalation effect of the nihcf electrode was validated by testing with a real municipal wwtp effluent and the preferential intercalation order of the nihcf electrode toward cations was nh4 k na ca2 mg2 our work proves that nihcf has excellent potential to serve as an nh4 selective electrode for applications in nutrient removal and recovery from

15762,reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic pollutants cops by fe ii occurs in natural environments and engineered systems fe ii ions undergo hydroxylation in aqueous solutions to form ferrous hydroxyl complex fhc which plays an essential role in fe ii mediated reductive dechlorination however how hydroxyl groups of fhc bridge the electron transfer from fe ii to cops is still not fully understood this work shows that the rate of reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride ct by fhc increased with increasing oh dosage xrd data shows the increase of oh dosage transform fhc from fe2 oh 3cl to fe oh 2 which leads to increased reductive strength of fhc more non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups coordinate with fe ii in fhc with increasing the oh dosage which stabilizes the octahedral structure of fe ii as shown by mössbauer data electrochemical analysis reveals that the increase of oh dosage enhances the reductive activity of fhc which is also confirmed by the decreased homo lumo gap it was found that fhc dechlorinated ct to methane which was attributed to the stabilization of trichlorocarbene anion ccl3 by surface o fe ii oh this work deepens our understanding on the bridge effect of hydroxyl groups on the electron transfer from fe ii to cops and provides a theoretical foundation for the reductive dechlorination of cops in both natural environments and engineered systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electron transfer fe ii hydroxide complex hydroxyl groups reductive dechlorination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbon tetrachloride ccl4 ct is widely used in industry and is an abundant pollutant in sediments and groundwater bae and lee 2012 tang et al 2020 ct is a persistent chlorinated organic pollutant cops at oxic conditions elsner et al 2004 but many studies have reported the reductive dehalogenation of ct in anoxic sediments and groundwater gorby et al 1994 hou and liang 2022 ramanand et al 1993 the dehalogenation pathways of ct include hydrogenolysis radical addition radical coupling and carbene hydrolysis mccormick and adriaens 2004 the dechlorination products of ct mainly include chloroform cf dichloromethane dcm methane ch4 carbon monoxide co formate hcoo and so on although some non chlorinated products are relatively harmless the toxicity of lesser chlorinated products is more worrying than ct itself for example cf is more toxic and difficult to degrade than ct therefore it is of great significance to reveal the complex transformation mechanism and influencing factors of ct in an anaerobic environment for evaluating its natural attenuation and designing clean up techniques in the natural environment fe ii exists in the forms of aqueous fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii ligand complexed fe ii and structural fe ii chen et al 2016 latta et al 2015 neumann et al 2015 due to the electron donating ability of fe ii these fe ii species can reduce oxidant pollutants in groundwater and sediments hu et al 2021 li et al 2019 strathmann and stone 2002 butler and hayes 1998 showed that dechlorination of hexachloroethane by mackinawite increased with ph from ph 7 to 9 5 which stem from the increased amount of feoh2 and feoh schultz and grundl 2000 demonstrated that the concentration of feoh increased as the ph value increased above 7 5 and feoh was the main reductive species in fe ii treated montmorillonite fe ii adsorbed by goethite can convert ct to cf and the dechlorination reaction was faster at ph 7 than at ph 7 the increase of reaction rate is attributed to the formation of new surface sites such as fe oh 2 by fe ii adsorption and coprecipitation amonette et al 2000 similarly the reduction rate of ct was increased by the formation of reactive adsorbed fe ii surface complex on magnetite at ph 6 10 danielsen and hayes 2004 the reductive strength of aqueous fe ii is relatively weak and hydroxylated fe ii at neutral or alkaline conditions i e fe ii hydroxyl complex fhc fe oh n 2 n where n is related to ph martell and hancock 1996 is responsible for the reductive activities of various fe ii species although previous studies group these fe ii species into different categories huang et al 2021 hydroxyl groups usually form a first coordination sphere around the central fe ii in these species which could be regarded as a fhc structure nevertheless fhc and its deprotonated structures are speculated to be the active sites in the fe ii involved reductive dechlorination since ph determines the reductive activity of various types of fe ii species some researchers believe hydroxyl groups act as a bridging ligand for the electron transfer between fe ii and redox active species boyanov et al 2007 haim 1983 neumann et al 2013 welch et al 2003 hydroxyl groups as the first coordination sphere exert the most decisive influence on the electron configuration of the central fe ii of the above mentioned fe ii species which ultimately influence the electron donating capability of fe ii studies show that the electron density of the surface fe ii could be increased after coordinating with hydroxyl groups which leads to the increase of electron donating capability of fe ii fallab 1967 however the explanation is relatively rough and direct evidence on the increased electron density is lacking the first oh coordinative arrangement around fe ii center and the second coordination sphere are also correlated to the reductive reactivity of fe ii wehrli et al 1989 which is demonstrated by the reactivity difference between fe ii hydroxide green rust gr and magnetite culpepper et al 2018 yin et al 2018 however the influence of fe ii ohx coordination geometry on the reductive reactivity of fe ii is still not fully understood the key to understanding the structure activity relationships for fhc involved reductive dechlorination is the bridging effect of hydroxyl groups on electron transfer still this essential process has been scarcely investigated systematically in this work oh fe ii ratios effects of fe ii dosage and oxidation degree of fe ii on the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc have been investigated the influence of common anions and cations in the groundwater environment on the dechlorination of ct was also studied density functional theory dft calculations solid state characterizations and electrochemical analysis of fhc were performed to reveal the physical and chemical properties for fhc s dechlorination activity under different oh fe ii ratios the structure activity relationship of the fhc is comprehensively elaborated which provides theoretical guidance for revealing the reactivity differences of fe ii species under various environmental conditions 2

results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fhc the main component of the synthesized fhc changed from hibingite fe2cl oh 3 to fe oh 2 with the increase of oh fe ii ratio fig 1 a leading to an increased diffraction intensity for the characteristic peak of fe oh 2 at 18 776 fe oh 2 is the only formed phase when r oh cl naoh 2 fecl2 0 75 fe2cl oh 3 starts to appear when naoh 2 fecl2 0 71 and fe2cl oh 3 is the only formed phase when naoh 2 fecl2 0 44 fig s1 re mazeilles and refait 2008 based on the surface complexation models in previous studies elsner et al 2004 liger et al 1999 the formation processes of fhc with different oh dosage are proposed 1 2fe ii aq 3oh cl fe2 oh 3cl s 2 fe ii aq 2oh fe oh 2 s 3 surface o h fe ii aq surface o fe ii h the precipitated solid fe ii phase transform from fe2 oh 3cl s to fe oh 2 s with the increase of oh dosage reaction 1 2 the zeta potentials of fhc was all positive regardless of the oh fe ii ratios fig 1c demonstrating that the surface of fhc are positively charged reaction 3 fhcs have a sheet like structure fig 1d f and the morphology of fhcs changed from circular flakes to regular hexagonal flakes as the oh fe ii ratio gradually increased at the same time the fhc flakes become thinner and smaller indicating an increased number of possible active sites in fhc with the increase of the oh fe ii ratio previous studies have shown that the shape of fhc is amorphous when oh fe ii 1 2 while porous and irregular flocs when oh fe ii 1 2 wu et al 2015 our observation is different from previous studies which may be resulted from the strict o2 free conditions applied throughout our experiments fhc 0 5 1 has only one fe ii doublet in mössbauer spectra taken at 77 k fig 1j whereas the fhc 3 1 has one fe ii doublet and one fe iii doublet fig 1k this may be caused by partial oxidation of the highly reactive fhc 3 1 during sample preparation fe ii components in fhc 0 5 1 and fhc 3 1 have the same center shift table s1 indicating that the coordination of fe ii in the two compounds is very similar fe ii in fhc is located in an octahedral coordination murad and cashion 2004 but the octahedral symmetry is usually distorted such as jahn teller distortion the five 3d orbitals of fe ii has four unpaired electrons and a lone pair of electrons this asymmetric charge distribution leads to a distorted fe ii polyhedron which is reflected by the value of quadrupole splitting zhe and grave 1998 for six coordinated fe ii species the chemical shift and quadrupole splitting decrease with increasing distortion from an octahedral symmetry g m bancroft et al 1968 although there is no difference in the chemical shifts of the two the quadrupole splitting δe q of fhc 3 1 was significantly larger than fhc 0 5 1 according to the jahn taller effect pearson 1975 the spatial distribution of the d shell electron cloud of six coordinated fe ii does not conform to oh symmetry so fe ii is unstable in the octahedral coordination position the further splitting of d orbit makes the coordination position deviate from oh symmetry and the degeneracy is reduced which improve the degree of stability because the symmetry of the d electron cloud distribution is not coordinated with the geometry of the ligand the latter is distorted and the degeneracy of the d orbital of the fe ii is reduced to improve the degree of stabilization thus the stable octahedral structure of fe ii could improve the reductive reactivity of fe oh 2 figure 11 shows the ftir spectra of fhc with different oh fe ii ratios the peak at 485 cm 1 accounted for the metal hydroxide stretching vibration a sharp absorption band at 3633 cm 1 is attributed to oh stretching vibration ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in contrast a broad band with a peak maximum at 3470 cm 1 and a weak absorption at 1610 cm 1 can be attributed to the respective oh stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups from incorporated or adsorbed water molecules kanters et al 1969 oliva et al 1982 the ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups becomes stronger with the increase of oh dosage which indicates the added oh is mainly complexed with fe ii 3 2 ct degradation by fhc with various oh fe ii ratios fhc 1 5 1 reduced ct to cf dcm and ch4 during 90 min of reaction while dissolved fe ii shows no reactivity towards ct reduction fig s2a fe ii cations form hexacoordinated aquo complexes fe oh2 6 2 in water both the h2o and oh ligands could act as electron transfer bridges haim 1983 the electron transfer bridging capability of h2o is much lower than oh henderson 1995 and the hydroxylation of fe ii is essential for the electron transfer from fe ii to ct to explore the effect of hydroxylation of fe ii on dechlorination ct dechlorination by fhc with different oh fe ii ratios was investigated fig s2 the results showed that ct was converted entirely into cf dcm and ch4 in 5 min when oh fe ii is higher than 2 1 the amount of dcm and ch4 increased with the increase of oh fe ii from 0 1 to 3 1 showing that the oh fe ii ratios determine the reductive activity of fhc as the proportion continued to increase from 3 1 to 4 1 there was no significant difference in the ct reduction and products distribution fig 2 a the reductive dechlorination rate of ct increases with the increase of od fe ii ratios fig s3 the pseudo first order kinetics can be used to describe the kinetics of ct removal by fhc and fdc with different molar ratios fig s4 table s2 text s8 the rate constants of ct reduction by fhc increases with increasing the oh fe ii ratio from 0 1 to 4 1 it can be explained that more oh groups are coordinated with fe ii with the increase of oh dosage however there is a great difference in reductive activities between fdc and fhc fig 2b peaks at 2540 cm 1 and 2650 cm 1 were hydrogen bonds od on the surface of fdc tanaka et al 2017 and peak at 1410 cm 1 is attributed to the deformation of d2o molecules fig s5 the energy states are the reason for the different reduction activity between fhc and fdc this is mainly due to the difference in the velocity of electrons passing through the barrier and the possibility for non classical penetration of the energy tunneling caused by the mass difference between h and d balzani 2001 hadjiivanov 2014 thus oh could be regarded as a bridge for the electron transfer during the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc thermodynamic calculations show that the electron donating oh ligand stabilizes fe iii and makes fe ii complex a more active reductant wehrli 1990 this further indicates that the high content of fe oh 2 plays an important role in controlling its dechlorination reactivity with the increase of oh the crystallinity of 001 plane of fe oh 2 is higher fig 1a the higher the crystallinity of 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the higher the reductive dechlorination activity of fe oh 2 fig 2c this suggests that the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 is of considerable importance in reductive dechlorination fhc is gradually transformed into gr after the reaction fhc with an oh fe ii ratio of 3 1 was converted to a mixed iron mineral dominated by magnetite after reaction fig 1b the reaction rate can affect the structural transformation of fhc during its interaction with ct fig s1 which is similar to the previous observations for the structural transformation of gr inoue et al 2007 ruby et al 2010 wang et al 2013 in addition the morphology of particles after reaction conforms with that of green rust and magnetite fig 1g i the main products of ct reduction are chcl3 dcm ch4 when the ratio of oh fe ii increased from 0 1 to 4 1 the cf increased from 0 to 63 8 also dcm and ch4 increased from 0 to 13 2 and 4 respectively fig 2a the increase of oh also favored the formation of other products such as co and hcoo figure s6a the percentage of other products is 19 fig s6b of which the percentage of co hcoo and chlorinated carbine intermediates is about 10 6 2 1 and 6 3 respectively hydrolysis of dichlorocarbene ccl2 is easy to form co pliego and almeida 1996 robinson 1961 which can be further converted to hcoo after reacting with oh these results indicate that the increase of oh not only promotes hydrogenolysis but also promotes carbene hydrolysis the dechlorination of ct by fhc is different from the previous studies on fe ii adsorbed on goethite magnetite gr fes and so on most of the previous studies show that the main dechlorination products of ct by various types of fe ii are cf co and hcoo but fewer studies have reported ch4 as the dechlorination product fe oh 2 alone can produce hydrogen via the schikorr reaction 3fe oh 2 fe3o4 2h2o h2 fig 2d schikorr 1933 thus the input electrons may be consumed by ct reduction ep and schikorr reaction ei fig 2d the calculated values of ep e0 and ei are 1 1 1022 1 3 1022 and 0 2 1022 respectively according to equation 4 6 in test s9 es 85 results shows that e0 is the sum of ep and ei demonstrating the electrons donated by fe ii were consumed by ct reduction ep and schikorr reaction ei fig 2d also the increase of oh fe ii resulted in the decreased of eh and increase of ph fig 2e this phenomenon indicated that the increase of hydroxyl groups provided a more powerful reductive environment which demonstrates the bridging effect of hydroxyl groups in fhc on the electron transfer from fe ii to ct the ph is basically unchanged before and after the reaction fig 2f although the h could be produced by eqs 3 with the increase of oh it could be consumed by excessive oh thus the concentration of h did not increase and the effect of possible h production on the reduction activity of fhc can be ignored 3 3 effect of fe ii dosage on dechlorination reactivity the reduction rate of ct increased with the fe ii dosage from 0 to 20 mm and then became level off fig s7 and fig 3 the percentage of cf increased from 18 8 to 73 4 when fe ii dosage increased from 0 to 15 mm and then decreased to 58 7 when the fe ii dosage was 20 mm however the percentage of cf was increased to 69 8 when fe ii dosage was 30 mm the percentage of dcm gradually increased from 0 to 0 73 and the percentage of ch4 is unchanged with the increase of fe ii dosage fig 3 the percentage of other products such as co and formate increased with the increase of fe ii dosage this indicated that the increase of fe ii dosage promoted the hydrolysis processes of ct and cf also when the concentration of fhc exceeded 20 mm the particle agglomeration may result in less reactive sites for stabilizing dichlorocarbene intermediate amonette et al 2000 3 4 effect of oxidation extent the fe ii in fhc is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen and other oxidized substances in the environment in the absence of oxygen a small amount of fe ii in the solution may also be oxidized by h2o to form fe iii huang et al 2021 jones et al 2014 in this work oxidation extent was controlled by keeping the total iron unchanged and changing the ratio of fe ii to fe iii with the increase of oxidation degree the dechlorination of ct by fhc was inhibited fig s8 the transformation of fe ii to fe iii hindered the generation of cf and dcm but promoted the generation of ch4 fig 4 a the main component of the synthesized fhc 1 5 1 is fe oh 2 according to the xrd analysis fig 4b with the increase of fe iii fhc 1 5 1 was transformed into gr when the concentration of fe iii exceeds 5 mm i e fe iii fe ii 1 3 fhc was transformed to magnetite fig 4b according to the previous studies butler and hayes 1998 danielsen and hayes 2004 elsner et al 2004 the reductive active species of mackinawite are feoh and feoh2 and the reducing active species of fe ii adsorbed on the surface of magnetite hematite and goethite are feiiiofeii and feiiiofeiioh0 different degrees of oxidation changes the crystal phase of fhc which may stabilize trichloromethylcarbene anion and promote the further reduction of dichlorocarbene danielsen and hayes 2004 3 5 effect of background ions on ct degradation by fhc figs s9 s14 shows the effect of common inorganic anions on the degradation of ct by fhc 1 1 5 the ct reduction was inhibited in the presence of common inorganic anions except for sio3 2 and cl fig 5 also results of the influence of background ions on reactivity demonstrates that the reductive dechlorination reactivity of fe oh 2 decreases or even diminished once the intensity of the 001 crystal plane decreases or disappears in general the higher the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the higher the dechlorination activity of fhc 1 5 1 fig 5b therefore the relationship between the reactivity under different conditions and the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane is plotted fig 5 the presence of co3 2 inhibited the ct reduction this may be due to the fact that the formation of amorphous fe ii carbonate not only inhibits the formation of fe oh 2 figs 5 and 6 b but also may cover the surface active site of fe oh 2 the presence of po4 3 may reduce the number of oh in fhc and increase the particle size of fhc châtellier et al 2013 po4 3 and fe ii form a stable insoluble product fe3 po4 2 pksp fe3 po4 2 33 inhibiting the formation of fe oh 2 no3 can oxidize structural fe ii in fhc leading to a weakened reduction reactivity of fhc fig 6b it was observed that the presence of no3 could turn fhc suspensions from milky white to green and the color gradually deepened with the increase of no3 no3 ion can oxidize part of fe ii in fhc to form gr fig 6b and the rate constants for the reduction of ct by gr 0 0012 min m 1 is much lower than that by fhc 0 0042 min m 1 under the same conditions yin et al 2018 also wu et al 2012 have shown that the presence of no3 during the synthesis of fhc unfavored the reduction of nitrobenzene by fhc the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 becomes broad in the presence of so4 2 and the decreased crystallinity of fhc may lead to its weakened reductive strength sio3 2 is the only ion in the upper right corner fig 5a b however when the concentration of sio3 2 increased to 10 mm the 18 776 characteristic peak disappears resulting in a strong inhibitory effect on ct reduction fig 5c when the concentration of si was lower than 1 mm k1 increased slightly from 0 084 min 1 to 0 12 min 1 in the presence of si it is mainly due to the addition of low concentration of si can improve the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 fig 5 previous studies have shown that phyllosilicate can be formed by co precipitation of si and fe ii francisco et al 2020 however the electronic structure and reduction activity of the si fe ii co precipitates was scarcely studied on the other hand more amount of sio2 with poor crystallinity may be formed when the concentration of si was higher than 1 mm the adsorption of sio2 on the surface of fe ii hydroxide can inhibit its reductive reactivity towards ct yin et al 2018 therefore the high amount of produced sio2 can block the reductive active sites of fhc inhibiting its activity also the presence of cl slightly decreases the crystallinity of fhc as well as its reduction activity figs s15 s19 show the effect of organic acid ions on the ct reduction by fhc 1 5 1 when the c2o4 2 concentration was 0 1 mm the presence of c2o4 2 promoted the ct dechlorination k1 increased from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 1671 min 1 fig 6c however the k1 decreased to 0 0162 min 1 when the c2o4 2 concentration was 10 mm the fe ii reacts with c2o4 2 to form a yellowish fe ii oxalate inhibiting the formation of fhc the standard single electron redox potential of oxalate complexed fe ii is higher than fe ii oh huang et al 2021 therefore the formed fe ii oxalate complexes inhibited the dechlorination of ct with the change of oxalate concentration three active species of fel0 fel2 2 and fel3 4 were formed in the reaction system fel0 and fel2 2 played a promoting role in ct reduction at low oxalate concentrations while fel3 4 played an inhibitory effect on ct reduction at high oxalate concentrations strathmann and stone 2002 the presence of choo with a concentration lower than 1 mm has little influence on the reduction of ct by fhc however the presence of choo with a concentration of 10 mm decreased the rate constants k1 from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 044 min 1 fig 6c some studies have shown that dissolved organic matter may inhibit the formation of reactive fe ii surface complexes resulting in a slow reductive transformation of pollutants in fe ii dissolved organic matter media hakala et al 2007 in contrast the influence of ch3coo on ct dechlorination is different from c2o4 2 and choo for the mono carboxylate ligand the formation of a single monodentate complex fe ii l can act as a reactive species to speed up dechlorination reaction strathmann and stone 2002 however the reaction activity of fhc increased significantly from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 406 min 1 with the increase of the c3h5o3 concentration fig 6c and table s3 anionic oxygen containing ligands such as carboxylic acids and hydroxylated organic compounds can facilitate fe ii oxidation these oxygen containing ligands can pump electron density from oxygen to fe ii to enhance the basicity of the fe ii atom and stabilize the formed fe iii luther et al 1992 lactic acid contains a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group speeding up the reaction when the concentration of ha gradually increased k1 increased from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 159 min 1 previous studies have shown that the presence of ha promotes reductive dehalogenation of hexachloroethane ct and bromoform by fe ii at ph 7 2 curtis and reinhard 1994 ha alone can reduce halogenated compounds with reduced quinone groups as the main reductive species scott et al 1998 however there is no clear relationship between the promotion effect of organic acid ions and the increase of diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 fig 5 the presence of cations ca2 mg2 nh4 and fe3 lower the reactive activity of fhc towards ct figs s20 s23 and the diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 decreases fig 5 ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 precipitate under alkaline conditions which could be rapidly adsorbed on the surface of fhc and hindered the electron transfer between fhc and ct fig 6e the presence of nh4 can inhibit the reductive dechlorination of ct due to the competition between nh4 and fhc for oh with the increase of fe iii concentration the competition between fe iii and fe ii for oh becomes more intense the reduction rate of ct decreases with the increase of fe iii table s3 and fhc is converted to gr or magnetite with a lower dechlorination reactivity than fhc fig 5f the inhibition effect of cations on the reduction activity of fhc is correlated to the decreased diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 which is the same as that of inorganic anions the transfer of the first electron from fhc to ct and the followed c cl bond cleavage is speculated to be the rate limiting step bakac and espenson 1986 castro and w c kray 1966 andrieux et al 1986 guy glod et al 1997 wade and castro 1973 and the subsequent dechlorination pathways determine the product distribution of fhc induced ct reduction danielsen and hayes 2004 when the concentration of background inorganic anions co3 2 po4 3 no3 and so4 2 increased from 0 to 10mm the produced cf decreased from 57 8 to 9 9 9 2 24 6 and 44 8 respectively po4 3 and so4 2 increased the dcm production from 0 6 to 1 4 and 1 respectively the ch4 production reduced from 0 6 to 0 in the presence of inorganic anions co3 2 po4 3 no3 and so4 2 however ch4 increased from 1 3 to 8 2 in the presence of 10 mm sio3 2 fig 6a on the other hand cl has little effect on the distribution of the products the presence of 10 mm nh4 increased the production of dcm from 0 57 to 1 22 and ch4 from 1 3 to 17 5 fig 6e the presence of fe iii inhibited the production of cf and dcm but increased the ch4 production from 1 3 to 9 7 fig 6e overall the effect of background ions on product distribution is associated with the type of ions and closely associated with the concentration especially for organic ions 3 6 electrochemical characterization the open circuit potentials of fhcs become more negative with the increase of hydroxyl groups the open circuit potentials are the lowest for fhc 3 1 indicating that fhcs become less stable with the increasing of oh fe ii ratios fig 7 a the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis decreases gradually with the increase of hydroxyl groups fig 7b the smallest arc radius in the eis of fhc 3 1 indicates that the interface electron transfer rate of the fhc 3 1 surface is the fastest zhang et al 2019 the corrosion current can be obtained by fitting the tafel curve fig 7c and table s3 the corrosion current of fhc 3 1 is the highest 9 931 10 5a among the fhc samples which demonstrates that fhc 3 1 has the highest electron donating ability the cvs of fhcs show two oxidation peaks 1 and 3 and two reduction peaks 2 and 4 fig 7d the intensities of redox peaks become weaker with the increase of oh dosage showing fhcs with more hydroxyl groups are less stable 3 7 mechanisms fhc can reduce cf to dcm and ch4 and reduce dcm to ch4 fig s24 however the reduction of neither cf nor dcm was observed at the beginning of the reaction and the dechlorination products were only detected after 45 minutes of reaction on the other hand fhc reduces ct to ch4 at the beginning of the reaction this indicates that cf is not the only precursor for ch4 formation therefore the dechlorination of ccl4 by fhc 1 5 1 may undergo three possible ways hydrogenolysis carbene reduction and carbene hydrolysis fig 8 a the first pathway is the formation of trichloromethyl radical ccl3 via dissociation electron transfer of ct fig s25a the ccl3 radical can be hydrodechlorinated to form chcl3 via hydrogenolysis mccormick and adriaens 2004 if ccl3 is further reduced to ccl3 as a relatively stable surface species elsner et al 2004 another pathway for the formation of chcl3 occurs the ccl3 may release into the solution and quickly undergo proton extraction to form chcl3 the formation of cf in this work confirmed that hydrogenolysis occurs during the fhc mediated ct dechlorination the production of dcm and ch4 demonstrate that hydrogenolysis continues after cf is generated theoretically ch4 can be formed by sequential hydrolysis of ct it is known that the halogenated radical intermediates can undergo electron addition to form halogenated carbine anion species mccormick and adriaens 2004 since the electron donor of fhc is fe ii electrostatic attraction contributes to the complexation of any possible carbene anions on the surface because carbanions could be stabilized by halogen substituents march 1992 the most stable carbanion intermediates could be ccl3 this relative stable ccl3 has a much higher possibility to be protonated than other potential carbanion intermediates resulting in the formation of cf the reductivity of fe oh 2 from 200 to 300 mv is theoretically un adequate to induce the reductive dichlorination of ch3cl 725 mv totten and roberts 2001 therefore ch4 cannot be produced via hydrogenolysis because the instability of the less chlorinated carbene anion intermediates e g chcl2 and ch2cl may hinder the protonation process α elimination is preferred the stability of carbene products is improved if they are adsorbed on the material surface danielsen and hayes 2004 this increased stability hinders the transformation of carbene products to less chlorinated carbene anion intermediates and is beneficial for the formation of surface carbenoids and radical intermediates regardless of the nature of these surface bound intermediates such a series of sequential hydrogenations reductions would ultimately result in the formation of methlyene ch2 and finally ch4 mccormick and adriaens 2004 dichlorocarbene ccl2 readily undergoes hydrolysis in an aqueous solution to form co which is followed by a slower reaction with the hydroxide to form formate hcoo pliego and almeida 1996 robinson 1961 the observation of hcoo and co in our work indicated the existence of ccl2 intermediate fig s6 also fig s25 confirms the formation of ccl3 radical and ccl2 intermediates during the reductive dechlorination of ct fig 8b shows the distributions of different fe ii species under different phs fe ii complex with more oh with the increase of ph mainly in the forms of fe2 feoh fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 our results show the surface of fhcs was all positively charged regardless of ph which may be due to the presence of surface o fe ii it is speculated that the positively charged surface stabilizes the trichlorocarbene anions resulting in the production of ch4 the surface active species change from fe2 oh 3cl s o fe ii to fe oh 2 o fe ii with the increase of oh increasing dechlorination rate fig 2a the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the increase of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in fhc fig 1l and the layered octahedral structure of fe ii in fhc fig 1j 1k all play an important role in the ct reduction by fhc the conformations of fe oh 2 1 and fe oh 2 2 and fe oh 2 3 and fe oh 2 4 were optimized by dft fig 9 a the cell units of fe oh 2 n are all fe oh 2 so the nbo charge of fe oh 2 n is always 0 000 it can be seen from fig 9b that the corresponding homo lumo gap decreases with the increase of the number of fe oh 2 cell units the larger the homo lumo gap the higher the stability after the interaction between ccl4 and fe oh 2 4 oh acts as a bridge for electron transfer from fe ii to ct which is demonstrated by the flow of electrons from the blue region to the green region fig 9c in a sense the high stability of the molecule reflects its low reactivity to chemical reactions zhou and parr 1990 thus the low homo lumo gap of fhc results in its high electron donating ability sun et al 2014 zhou and parr 1990 which is consistent with the electrochemical characterization fig 7 4 environmental significance iron is abundant in underground sedimentary rocks 5 6 w t and 3 5 1012 mol year of fe is involved in the fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the environment stumm and sulzberger 1992 fe ii species including aqueous fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii ligand complexed fe ii and structural fe ii play an essential role in the reductive transformation of different oxidant pollutants huang et al 2021 regardless of the types of various fe ii species hydroxide ions resulted from the dissociation of water coordinate to the fe ii on surface or in a crystal structure hydroxyl groups as the first coordination sphere determine the electron configuration of the central fe ii which ultimately influences the electron donating capability and reductive reactivity of fe ii species this work shows fhc has the highest reductive reactivity towards ct reduction compared with the previously reported fe ii species table s5 in general fhc is unstable and readily undergoes a transformation in complex environmental matrices the high electron donating ability of fe ii corresponds to the abundance of fe oh 2 and non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups which demonstrate that hydroxyl groups act as bridges for the electron transfer from fe ii to oxidant pollutants in bulk solution understanding the electron bridging effect of hydroxyl groups on the fe ii fe iii redox cycle is essential to reveal the transformation of redox active substances in subsurface environments 5 conclusion the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc follows pseudo first order kinetics and the reaction rate constant increases with increasing oh dosage xrd characterizations show that the synthesized fhc changed from hibingite fe2cl oh 3 to fe oh 2 with increasing oh dosage non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in fhc increase with increasing oh dosage mössbauer results show that the increase of oh dosage leads to a more symmetric octahedral structure of fe ii in fhc electrochemical characterization confirms that the reductive strength of fhc increases with the increase of oh which is in line with the dft calculation of the homo lumo gap the presence of inorganic anions except for sio3 2 and cl and cations during fhc synthesis resulted in a decreased crystallinity of fe oh 2 in fhc leading to a decreased reductive activity of fhc however the presence of organic acid ions did not result in a decreased crystallinity of fe oh 2 in fhc the hydrogenolysis in the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc continues after the formation of cf the existence of positively charged surface active species surface o fe ii stabilizes trichlorocarbene anions and promotes the formation of dichlorocarbene resulting in carbene reduction and carbene hydrolysis declaration of competing

15762,reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic pollutants cops by fe ii occurs in natural environments and engineered systems fe ii ions undergo hydroxylation in aqueous solutions to form ferrous hydroxyl complex fhc which plays an essential role in fe ii mediated reductive dechlorination however how hydroxyl groups of fhc bridge the electron transfer from fe ii to cops is still not fully understood this work shows that the rate of reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride ct by fhc increased with increasing oh dosage xrd data shows the increase of oh dosage transform fhc from fe2 oh 3cl to fe oh 2 which leads to increased reductive strength of fhc more non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups coordinate with fe ii in fhc with increasing the oh dosage which stabilizes the octahedral structure of fe ii as shown by mössbauer data electrochemical analysis reveals that the increase of oh dosage enhances the reductive activity of fhc which is also confirmed by the decreased homo lumo gap it was found that fhc dechlorinated ct to methane which was attributed to the stabilization of trichlorocarbene anion ccl3 by surface o fe ii oh this work deepens our understanding on the bridge effect of hydroxyl groups on the electron transfer from fe ii to cops and provides a theoretical foundation for the reductive dechlorination of cops in both natural environments and

chlorinated organic pollutant cops at oxic conditions elsner et al 2004 but many studies have reported the reductive dehalogenation of ct in anoxic sediments and groundwater gorby et al 1994 hou and liang 2022 ramanand et al 1993 the dehalogenation pathways of ct include hydrogenolysis radical addition radical coupling and carbene hydrolysis mccormick and adriaens 2004 the dechlorination products of ct mainly include chloroform cf dichloromethane dcm methane ch4 carbon monoxide co formate hcoo and so on although some non chlorinated products are relatively harmless the toxicity of lesser chlorinated products is more worrying than ct itself for example cf is more toxic and difficult to degrade than ct therefore it is of great significance to reveal the complex transformation mechanism and influencing factors of ct in an anaerobic environment for evaluating its natural attenuation and designing clean up techniques in the natural environment fe ii exists in the forms of aqueous fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii ligand complexed fe ii and structural fe ii chen et al 2016 latta et al 2015 neumann et al 2015 due to the electron donating ability of fe ii these fe ii species can reduce oxidant pollutants in groundwater and sediments hu et al 2021 li et al 2019 strathmann and stone 2002 butler and hayes 1998 showed that dechlorination of hexachloroethane by mackinawite increased with ph from ph 7 to 9 5 which stem from the increased amount of feoh2 and feoh schultz and grundl 2000 demonstrated that the concentration of feoh increased as the ph value increased above 7 5 and feoh was the main reductive species in fe ii treated montmorillonite fe ii adsorbed by goethite can convert ct to cf and the dechlorination reaction was faster at ph 7 than at ph 7 the increase of reaction rate is attributed to the formation of new surface sites such as fe oh 2 by fe ii adsorption and coprecipitation amonette et al 2000 similarly the reduction rate of ct was increased by the formation of reactive adsorbed fe ii surface complex on magnetite at ph 6 10 danielsen and hayes 2004 the reductive strength of aqueous fe ii is relatively weak and hydroxylated fe ii at neutral or alkaline conditions i e fe ii hydroxyl complex fhc fe oh n 2 n where n is related to ph martell and hancock 1996 is responsible for the reductive activities of various fe ii species although previous studies group these fe ii species into different categories huang et al 2021 hydroxyl groups usually form a first coordination sphere around the central fe ii in these species which could be regarded as a fhc structure nevertheless fhc and its deprotonated structures are speculated to be the active sites in the fe ii involved reductive dechlorination since ph determines the reductive activity of various types of fe ii species some researchers believe hydroxyl groups act as a bridging ligand for the electron transfer between fe ii and redox active species boyanov et al 2007 haim 1983 neumann et al 2013 welch et al 2003 hydroxyl groups as the first coordination sphere exert the most decisive influence on the electron configuration of the central fe ii of the above mentioned fe ii species which ultimately influence the electron donating capability of fe ii studies show that the electron density of the surface fe ii could be increased after coordinating with hydroxyl groups which leads to the increase of electron donating capability of fe ii fallab 1967 however the explanation is relatively rough and direct evidence on the increased electron density is lacking the first oh coordinative arrangement around fe ii center and the second coordination sphere are also correlated to the reductive reactivity of fe ii wehrli et al 1989 which is demonstrated by the reactivity difference between fe ii hydroxide green rust gr and magnetite culpepper et al 2018 yin et al 2018 however the influence of fe ii ohx coordination geometry on the reductive reactivity of fe ii is still not fully understood the key to understanding the structure activity relationships for fhc involved reductive dechlorination is the bridging effect of hydroxyl groups on electron transfer still this essential process has been scarcely investigated systematically in this work oh fe ii ratios effects of fe ii dosage and oxidation degree of fe ii on the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc have been investigated the influence of common anions and cations in the groundwater environment on the dechlorination of ct was also studied density functional theory dft calculations solid state characterizations and electrochemical analysis of fhc were performed to reveal the physical and chemical properties for fhc s dechlorination activity under different oh fe ii ratios the structure activity relationship of the fhc is comprehensively elaborated which provides theoretical guidance for revealing the reactivity differences of fe ii species under various environmental conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals details information of all chemicals can be found in text s1 the preparation of the fe ii solution is described in text s2 fhc x 1 represents fhc synthesized with a

results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fhc the main component of the synthesized fhc changed from hibingite fe2cl oh 3 to fe oh 2 with the increase of oh fe ii ratio fig 1 a leading to an increased diffraction intensity for the characteristic peak of fe oh 2 at 18 776 fe oh 2 is the only formed phase when r oh cl naoh 2 fecl2 0 75 fe2cl oh 3 starts to appear when naoh 2 fecl2 0 71 and fe2cl oh 3 is the only formed phase when naoh 2 fecl2 0 44 fig s1 re mazeilles and refait 2008 based on the surface complexation models in previous studies elsner et al 2004 liger et al 1999 the formation processes of fhc with different oh dosage are proposed 1 2fe ii aq 3oh cl fe2 oh 3cl s 2 fe ii aq 2oh fe oh 2 s 3 surface o h fe ii aq surface o fe ii h the precipitated solid fe ii phase transform from fe2 oh 3cl s to fe oh 2 s with the increase of oh dosage reaction 1 2 the zeta potentials of fhc was all positive regardless of the oh fe ii ratios fig 1c demonstrating that the surface of fhc are positively charged reaction 3 fhcs have a sheet like structure fig 1d f and the morphology of fhcs changed from circular flakes to regular hexagonal flakes as the oh fe ii ratio gradually increased at the same time the fhc flakes become thinner and smaller indicating an increased number of possible active sites in fhc with the increase of the oh fe ii ratio previous studies have shown that the shape of fhc is amorphous when oh fe ii 1 2 while porous and irregular flocs when oh fe ii 1 2 wu et al 2015 our observation is different from previous studies which may be resulted from the strict o2 free conditions applied throughout our experiments fhc 0 5 1 has only one fe ii doublet in mössbauer spectra taken at 77 k fig 1j whereas the fhc 3 1 has one fe ii doublet and one fe iii doublet fig 1k this may be caused by partial oxidation of the highly reactive fhc 3 1 during sample preparation fe ii components in fhc 0 5 1 and fhc 3 1 have the same center shift table s1 indicating that the coordination of fe ii in the two compounds is very similar fe ii in fhc is located in an octahedral coordination murad and cashion 2004 but the octahedral symmetry is usually distorted such as jahn teller distortion the five 3d orbitals of fe ii has four unpaired electrons and a lone pair of electrons this asymmetric charge distribution leads to a distorted fe ii polyhedron which is reflected by the value of quadrupole splitting zhe and grave 1998 for six coordinated fe ii species the chemical shift and quadrupole splitting decrease with increasing distortion from an octahedral symmetry g m bancroft et al 1968 although there is no difference in the chemical shifts of the two the quadrupole splitting δe q of fhc 3 1 was significantly larger than fhc 0 5 1 according to the jahn taller effect pearson 1975 the spatial distribution of the d shell electron cloud of six coordinated fe ii does not conform to oh symmetry so fe ii is unstable in the octahedral coordination position the further splitting of d orbit makes the coordination position deviate from oh symmetry and the degeneracy is reduced which improve the degree of stability because the symmetry of the d electron cloud distribution is not coordinated with the geometry of the ligand the latter is distorted and the degeneracy of the d orbital of the fe ii is reduced to improve the degree of stabilization thus the stable octahedral structure of fe ii could improve the reductive reactivity of fe oh 2 figure 11 shows the ftir spectra of fhc with different oh fe ii ratios the peak at 485 cm 1 accounted for the metal hydroxide stretching vibration a sharp absorption band at 3633 cm 1 is attributed to oh stretching vibration ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in contrast a broad band with a peak maximum at 3470 cm 1 and a weak absorption at 1610 cm 1 can be attributed to the respective oh stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups from incorporated or adsorbed water molecules kanters et al 1969 oliva et al 1982 the ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups becomes stronger with the increase of oh dosage which indicates the added oh is mainly complexed with fe ii 3 2 ct degradation by fhc with various oh fe ii ratios fhc 1 5 1 reduced ct to cf dcm and ch4 during 90 min of reaction while dissolved fe ii shows no reactivity towards ct reduction fig s2a fe ii cations form hexacoordinated aquo complexes fe oh2 6 2 in water both the h2o and oh ligands could act as electron transfer bridges haim 1983 the electron transfer bridging capability of h2o is much lower than oh henderson 1995 and the hydroxylation of fe ii is essential for the electron transfer from fe ii to ct to explore the effect of hydroxylation of fe ii on dechlorination ct dechlorination by fhc with different oh fe ii ratios was investigated fig s2 the results showed that ct was converted entirely into cf dcm and ch4 in 5 min when oh fe ii is higher than 2 1 the amount of dcm and ch4 increased with the increase of oh fe ii from 0 1 to 3 1 showing that the oh fe ii ratios determine the reductive activity of fhc as the proportion continued to increase from 3 1 to 4 1 there was no significant difference in the ct reduction and products distribution fig 2 a the reductive dechlorination rate of ct increases with the increase of od fe ii ratios fig s3 the pseudo first order kinetics can be used to describe the kinetics of ct removal by fhc and fdc with different molar ratios fig s4 table s2 text s8 the rate constants of ct reduction by fhc increases with increasing the oh fe ii ratio from 0 1 to 4 1 it can be explained that more oh groups are coordinated with fe ii with the increase of oh dosage however there is a great difference in reductive activities between fdc and fhc fig 2b peaks at 2540 cm 1 and 2650 cm 1 were hydrogen bonds od on the surface of fdc tanaka et al 2017 and peak at 1410 cm 1 is attributed to the deformation of d2o molecules fig s5 the energy states are the reason for the different reduction activity between fhc and fdc this is mainly due to the difference in the velocity of electrons passing through the barrier and the possibility for non classical penetration of the energy tunneling caused by the mass difference between h and d balzani 2001 hadjiivanov 2014 thus oh could be regarded as a bridge for the electron transfer during the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc thermodynamic calculations show that the electron donating oh ligand stabilizes fe iii and makes fe ii complex a more active reductant wehrli 1990 this further indicates that the high content of fe oh 2 plays an important role in controlling its dechlorination reactivity with the increase of oh the crystallinity of 001 plane of fe oh 2 is higher fig 1a the higher the crystallinity of 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the higher the reductive dechlorination activity of fe oh 2 fig 2c this suggests that the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 is of considerable importance in reductive dechlorination fhc is gradually transformed into gr after the reaction fhc with an oh fe ii ratio of 3 1 was converted to a mixed iron mineral dominated by magnetite after reaction fig 1b the reaction rate can affect the structural transformation of fhc during its interaction with ct fig s1 which is similar to the previous observations for the structural transformation of gr inoue et al 2007 ruby et al 2010 wang et al 2013 in addition the morphology of particles after reaction conforms with that of green rust and magnetite fig 1g i the main products of ct reduction are chcl3 dcm ch4 when the ratio of oh fe ii increased from 0 1 to 4 1 the cf increased from 0 to 63 8 also dcm and ch4 increased from 0 to 13 2 and 4 respectively fig 2a the increase of oh also favored the formation of other products such as co and hcoo figure s6a the percentage of other products is 19 fig s6b of which the percentage of co hcoo and chlorinated carbine intermediates is about 10 6 2 1 and 6 3 respectively hydrolysis of dichlorocarbene ccl2 is easy to form co pliego and almeida 1996 robinson 1961 which can be further converted to hcoo after reacting with oh these results indicate that the increase of oh not only promotes hydrogenolysis but also promotes carbene hydrolysis the dechlorination of ct by fhc is different from the previous studies on fe ii adsorbed on goethite magnetite gr fes and so on most of the previous studies show that the main dechlorination products of ct by various types of fe ii are cf co and hcoo but fewer studies have reported ch4 as the dechlorination product fe oh 2 alone can produce hydrogen via the schikorr reaction 3fe oh 2 fe3o4 2h2o h2 fig 2d schikorr 1933 thus the input electrons may be consumed by ct reduction ep and schikorr reaction ei fig 2d the calculated values of ep e0 and ei are 1 1 1022 1 3 1022 and 0 2 1022 respectively according to equation 4 6 in test s9 es 85 results shows that e0 is the sum of ep and ei demonstrating the electrons donated by fe ii were consumed by ct reduction ep and schikorr reaction ei fig 2d also the increase of oh fe ii resulted in the decreased of eh and increase of ph fig 2e this phenomenon indicated that the increase of hydroxyl groups provided a more powerful reductive environment which demonstrates the bridging effect of hydroxyl groups in fhc on the electron transfer from fe ii to ct the ph is basically unchanged before and after the reaction fig 2f although the h could be produced by eqs 3 with the increase of oh it could be consumed by excessive oh thus the concentration of h did not increase and the effect of possible h production on the reduction activity of fhc can be ignored 3 3 effect of fe ii dosage on dechlorination reactivity the reduction rate of ct increased with the fe ii dosage from 0 to 20 mm and then became level off fig s7 and fig 3 the percentage of cf increased from 18 8 to 73 4 when fe ii dosage increased from 0 to 15 mm and then decreased to 58 7 when the fe ii dosage was 20 mm however the percentage of cf was increased to 69 8 when fe ii dosage was 30 mm the percentage of dcm gradually increased from 0 to 0 73 and the percentage of ch4 is unchanged with the increase of fe ii dosage fig 3 the percentage of other products such as co and formate increased with the increase of fe ii dosage this indicated that the increase of fe ii dosage promoted the hydrolysis processes of ct and cf also when the concentration of fhc exceeded 20 mm the particle agglomeration may result in less reactive sites for stabilizing dichlorocarbene intermediate amonette et al 2000 3 4 effect of oxidation extent the fe ii in fhc is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen and other oxidized substances in the environment in the absence of oxygen a small amount of fe ii in the solution may also be oxidized by h2o to form fe iii huang et al 2021 jones et al 2014 in this work oxidation extent was controlled by keeping the total iron unchanged and changing the ratio of fe ii to fe iii with the increase of oxidation degree the dechlorination of ct by fhc was inhibited fig s8 the transformation of fe ii to fe iii hindered the generation of cf and dcm but promoted the generation of ch4 fig 4 a the main component of the synthesized fhc 1 5 1 is fe oh 2 according to the xrd analysis fig 4b with the increase of fe iii fhc 1 5 1 was transformed into gr when the concentration of fe iii exceeds 5 mm i e fe iii fe ii 1 3 fhc was transformed to magnetite fig 4b according to the previous studies butler and hayes 1998 danielsen and hayes 2004 elsner et al 2004 the reductive active species of mackinawite are feoh and feoh2 and the reducing active species of fe ii adsorbed on the surface of magnetite hematite and goethite are feiiiofeii and feiiiofeiioh0 different degrees of oxidation changes the crystal phase of fhc which may stabilize trichloromethylcarbene anion and promote the further reduction of dichlorocarbene danielsen and hayes 2004 3 5 effect of background ions on ct degradation by fhc figs s9 s14 shows the effect of common inorganic anions on the degradation of ct by fhc 1 1 5 the ct reduction was inhibited in the presence of common inorganic anions except for sio3 2 and cl fig 5 also results of the influence of background ions on reactivity demonstrates that the reductive dechlorination reactivity of fe oh 2 decreases or even diminished once the intensity of the 001 crystal plane decreases or disappears in general the higher the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the higher the dechlorination activity of fhc 1 5 1 fig 5b therefore the relationship between the reactivity under different conditions and the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane is plotted fig 5 the presence of co3 2 inhibited the ct reduction this may be due to the fact that the formation of amorphous fe ii carbonate not only inhibits the formation of fe oh 2 figs 5 and 6 b but also may cover the surface active site of fe oh 2 the presence of po4 3 may reduce the number of oh in fhc and increase the particle size of fhc châtellier et al 2013 po4 3 and fe ii form a stable insoluble product fe3 po4 2 pksp fe3 po4 2 33 inhibiting the formation of fe oh 2 no3 can oxidize structural fe ii in fhc leading to a weakened reduction reactivity of fhc fig 6b it was observed that the presence of no3 could turn fhc suspensions from milky white to green and the color gradually deepened with the increase of no3 no3 ion can oxidize part of fe ii in fhc to form gr fig 6b and the rate constants for the reduction of ct by gr 0 0012 min m 1 is much lower than that by fhc 0 0042 min m 1 under the same conditions yin et al 2018 also wu et al 2012 have shown that the presence of no3 during the synthesis of fhc unfavored the reduction of nitrobenzene by fhc the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 becomes broad in the presence of so4 2 and the decreased crystallinity of fhc may lead to its weakened reductive strength sio3 2 is the only ion in the upper right corner fig 5a b however when the concentration of sio3 2 increased to 10 mm the 18 776 characteristic peak disappears resulting in a strong inhibitory effect on ct reduction fig 5c when the concentration of si was lower than 1 mm k1 increased slightly from 0 084 min 1 to 0 12 min 1 in the presence of si it is mainly due to the addition of low concentration of si can improve the crystallinity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 fig 5 previous studies have shown that phyllosilicate can be formed by co precipitation of si and fe ii francisco et al 2020 however the electronic structure and reduction activity of the si fe ii co precipitates was scarcely studied on the other hand more amount of sio2 with poor crystallinity may be formed when the concentration of si was higher than 1 mm the adsorption of sio2 on the surface of fe ii hydroxide can inhibit its reductive reactivity towards ct yin et al 2018 therefore the high amount of produced sio2 can block the reductive active sites of fhc inhibiting its activity also the presence of cl slightly decreases the crystallinity of fhc as well as its reduction activity figs s15 s19 show the effect of organic acid ions on the ct reduction by fhc 1 5 1 when the c2o4 2 concentration was 0 1 mm the presence of c2o4 2 promoted the ct dechlorination k1 increased from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 1671 min 1 fig 6c however the k1 decreased to 0 0162 min 1 when the c2o4 2 concentration was 10 mm the fe ii reacts with c2o4 2 to form a yellowish fe ii oxalate inhibiting the formation of fhc the standard single electron redox potential of oxalate complexed fe ii is higher than fe ii oh huang et al 2021 therefore the formed fe ii oxalate complexes inhibited the dechlorination of ct with the change of oxalate concentration three active species of fel0 fel2 2 and fel3 4 were formed in the reaction system fel0 and fel2 2 played a promoting role in ct reduction at low oxalate concentrations while fel3 4 played an inhibitory effect on ct reduction at high oxalate concentrations strathmann and stone 2002 the presence of choo with a concentration lower than 1 mm has little influence on the reduction of ct by fhc however the presence of choo with a concentration of 10 mm decreased the rate constants k1 from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 044 min 1 fig 6c some studies have shown that dissolved organic matter may inhibit the formation of reactive fe ii surface complexes resulting in a slow reductive transformation of pollutants in fe ii dissolved organic matter media hakala et al 2007 in contrast the influence of ch3coo on ct dechlorination is different from c2o4 2 and choo for the mono carboxylate ligand the formation of a single monodentate complex fe ii l can act as a reactive species to speed up dechlorination reaction strathmann and stone 2002 however the reaction activity of fhc increased significantly from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 406 min 1 with the increase of the c3h5o3 concentration fig 6c and table s3 anionic oxygen containing ligands such as carboxylic acids and hydroxylated organic compounds can facilitate fe ii oxidation these oxygen containing ligands can pump electron density from oxygen to fe ii to enhance the basicity of the fe ii atom and stabilize the formed fe iii luther et al 1992 lactic acid contains a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group speeding up the reaction when the concentration of ha gradually increased k1 increased from 0 08438 min 1 to 0 159 min 1 previous studies have shown that the presence of ha promotes reductive dehalogenation of hexachloroethane ct and bromoform by fe ii at ph 7 2 curtis and reinhard 1994 ha alone can reduce halogenated compounds with reduced quinone groups as the main reductive species scott et al 1998 however there is no clear relationship between the promotion effect of organic acid ions and the increase of diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 fig 5 the presence of cations ca2 mg2 nh4 and fe3 lower the reactive activity of fhc towards ct figs s20 s23 and the diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 decreases fig 5 ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 precipitate under alkaline conditions which could be rapidly adsorbed on the surface of fhc and hindered the electron transfer between fhc and ct fig 6e the presence of nh4 can inhibit the reductive dechlorination of ct due to the competition between nh4 and fhc for oh with the increase of fe iii concentration the competition between fe iii and fe ii for oh becomes more intense the reduction rate of ct decreases with the increase of fe iii table s3 and fhc is converted to gr or magnetite with a lower dechlorination reactivity than fhc fig 5f the inhibition effect of cations on the reduction activity of fhc is correlated to the decreased diffraction intensity of the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 which is the same as that of inorganic anions the transfer of the first electron from fhc to ct and the followed c cl bond cleavage is speculated to be the rate limiting step bakac and espenson 1986 castro and w c kray 1966 andrieux et al 1986 guy glod et al 1997 wade and castro 1973 and the subsequent dechlorination pathways determine the product distribution of fhc induced ct reduction danielsen and hayes 2004 when the concentration of background inorganic anions co3 2 po4 3 no3 and so4 2 increased from 0 to 10mm the produced cf decreased from 57 8 to 9 9 9 2 24 6 and 44 8 respectively po4 3 and so4 2 increased the dcm production from 0 6 to 1 4 and 1 respectively the ch4 production reduced from 0 6 to 0 in the presence of inorganic anions co3 2 po4 3 no3 and so4 2 however ch4 increased from 1 3 to 8 2 in the presence of 10 mm sio3 2 fig 6a on the other hand cl has little effect on the distribution of the products the presence of 10 mm nh4 increased the production of dcm from 0 57 to 1 22 and ch4 from 1 3 to 17 5 fig 6e the presence of fe iii inhibited the production of cf and dcm but increased the ch4 production from 1 3 to 9 7 fig 6e overall the effect of background ions on product distribution is associated with the type of ions and closely associated with the concentration especially for organic ions 3 6 electrochemical characterization the open circuit potentials of fhcs become more negative with the increase of hydroxyl groups the open circuit potentials are the lowest for fhc 3 1 indicating that fhcs become less stable with the increasing of oh fe ii ratios fig 7 a the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis decreases gradually with the increase of hydroxyl groups fig 7b the smallest arc radius in the eis of fhc 3 1 indicates that the interface electron transfer rate of the fhc 3 1 surface is the fastest zhang et al 2019 the corrosion current can be obtained by fitting the tafel curve fig 7c and table s3 the corrosion current of fhc 3 1 is the highest 9 931 10 5a among the fhc samples which demonstrates that fhc 3 1 has the highest electron donating ability the cvs of fhcs show two oxidation peaks 1 and 3 and two reduction peaks 2 and 4 fig 7d the intensities of redox peaks become weaker with the increase of oh dosage showing fhcs with more hydroxyl groups are less stable 3 7 mechanisms fhc can reduce cf to dcm and ch4 and reduce dcm to ch4 fig s24 however the reduction of neither cf nor dcm was observed at the beginning of the reaction and the dechlorination products were only detected after 45 minutes of reaction on the other hand fhc reduces ct to ch4 at the beginning of the reaction this indicates that cf is not the only precursor for ch4 formation therefore the dechlorination of ccl4 by fhc 1 5 1 may undergo three possible ways hydrogenolysis carbene reduction and carbene hydrolysis fig 8 a the first pathway is the formation of trichloromethyl radical ccl3 via dissociation electron transfer of ct fig s25a the ccl3 radical can be hydrodechlorinated to form chcl3 via hydrogenolysis mccormick and adriaens 2004 if ccl3 is further reduced to ccl3 as a relatively stable surface species elsner et al 2004 another pathway for the formation of chcl3 occurs the ccl3 may release into the solution and quickly undergo proton extraction to form chcl3 the formation of cf in this work confirmed that hydrogenolysis occurs during the fhc mediated ct dechlorination the production of dcm and ch4 demonstrate that hydrogenolysis continues after cf is generated theoretically ch4 can be formed by sequential hydrolysis of ct it is known that the halogenated radical intermediates can undergo electron addition to form halogenated carbine anion species mccormick and adriaens 2004 since the electron donor of fhc is fe ii electrostatic attraction contributes to the complexation of any possible carbene anions on the surface because carbanions could be stabilized by halogen substituents march 1992 the most stable carbanion intermediates could be ccl3 this relative stable ccl3 has a much higher possibility to be protonated than other potential carbanion intermediates resulting in the formation of cf the reductivity of fe oh 2 from 200 to 300 mv is theoretically un adequate to induce the reductive dichlorination of ch3cl 725 mv totten and roberts 2001 therefore ch4 cannot be produced via hydrogenolysis because the instability of the less chlorinated carbene anion intermediates e g chcl2 and ch2cl may hinder the protonation process α elimination is preferred the stability of carbene products is improved if they are adsorbed on the material surface danielsen and hayes 2004 this increased stability hinders the transformation of carbene products to less chlorinated carbene anion intermediates and is beneficial for the formation of surface carbenoids and radical intermediates regardless of the nature of these surface bound intermediates such a series of sequential hydrogenations reductions would ultimately result in the formation of methlyene ch2 and finally ch4 mccormick and adriaens 2004 dichlorocarbene ccl2 readily undergoes hydrolysis in an aqueous solution to form co which is followed by a slower reaction with the hydroxide to form formate hcoo pliego and almeida 1996 robinson 1961 the observation of hcoo and co in our work indicated the existence of ccl2 intermediate fig s6 also fig s25 confirms the formation of ccl3 radical and ccl2 intermediates during the reductive dechlorination of ct fig 8b shows the distributions of different fe ii species under different phs fe ii complex with more oh with the increase of ph mainly in the forms of fe2 feoh fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 our results show the surface of fhcs was all positively charged regardless of ph which may be due to the presence of surface o fe ii it is speculated that the positively charged surface stabilizes the trichlorocarbene anions resulting in the production of ch4 the surface active species change from fe2 oh 3cl s o fe ii to fe oh 2 o fe ii with the increase of oh increasing dechlorination rate fig 2a the 001 crystal plane of fe oh 2 the increase of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in fhc fig 1l and the layered octahedral structure of fe ii in fhc fig 1j 1k all play an important role in the ct reduction by fhc the conformations of fe oh 2 1 and fe oh 2 2 and fe oh 2 3 and fe oh 2 4 were optimized by dft fig 9 a the cell units of fe oh 2 n are all fe oh 2 so the nbo charge of fe oh 2 n is always 0 000 it can be seen from fig 9b that the corresponding homo lumo gap decreases with the increase of the number of fe oh 2 cell units the larger the homo lumo gap the higher the stability after the interaction between ccl4 and fe oh 2 4 oh acts as a bridge for electron transfer from fe ii to ct which is demonstrated by the flow of electrons from the blue region to the green region fig 9c in a sense the high stability of the molecule reflects its low reactivity to chemical reactions zhou and parr 1990 thus the low homo lumo gap of fhc results in its high electron donating ability sun et al 2014 zhou and parr 1990 which is consistent with the electrochemical characterization fig 7 4 environmental significance iron is abundant in underground sedimentary rocks 5 6 w t and 3 5 1012 mol year of fe is involved in the fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the environment stumm and sulzberger 1992 fe ii species including aqueous fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii ligand complexed fe ii and structural fe ii play an essential role in the reductive transformation of different oxidant pollutants huang et al 2021 regardless of the types of various fe ii species hydroxide ions resulted from the dissociation of water coordinate to the fe ii on surface or in a crystal structure hydroxyl groups as the first coordination sphere determine the electron configuration of the central fe ii which ultimately influences the electron donating capability and reductive reactivity of fe ii species this work shows fhc has the highest reductive reactivity towards ct reduction compared with the previously reported fe ii species table s5 in general fhc is unstable and readily undergoes a transformation in complex environmental matrices the high electron donating ability of fe ii corresponds to the abundance of fe oh 2 and non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups which demonstrate that hydroxyl groups act as bridges for the electron transfer from fe ii to oxidant pollutants in bulk solution understanding the electron bridging effect of hydroxyl groups on the fe ii fe iii redox cycle is essential to reveal the transformation of redox active substances in subsurface environments 5 conclusion the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc follows pseudo first order kinetics and the reaction rate constant increases with increasing oh dosage xrd characterizations show that the synthesized fhc changed from hibingite fe2cl oh 3 to fe oh 2 with increasing oh dosage non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in fhc increase with increasing oh dosage mössbauer results show that the increase of oh dosage leads to a more symmetric octahedral structure of fe ii in fhc electrochemical characterization confirms that the reductive strength of fhc increases with the increase of oh which is in line with the dft calculation of the homo lumo gap the presence of inorganic anions except for sio3 2 and cl and cations during fhc synthesis resulted in a decreased crystallinity of fe oh 2 in fhc leading to a decreased reductive activity of fhc however the presence of organic acid ions did not result in a decreased crystallinity of fe oh 2 in fhc the hydrogenolysis in the reductive dechlorination of ct by fhc continues after the formation of cf the existence of positively charged surface active species surface o fe ii stabilizes trichlorocarbene anions and promotes the formation of dichlorocarbene resulting in carbene reduction and carbene hydrolysis declaration of competing

15763,disinfection is known to greatly alter bacterial characteristics in water and high horizontal gene transfer hgt frequency occurs in eutrophic conditions interestingly these two seemingly irrelevant phenomena were closely linked by a lagging response of the increased conjugation frequency probably via daily water disinfection in this study three disinfection methods uv chlorine and uv chlorine were selected to investigate the increased frequency of conjugation of args during the stage of continuing culture after disinfection the results showed that the conjugative transfer frequency was inhibited for all disinfection treatments after 24 h of co incubation unexpectedly after 3 7 days of co cultivation the hgt frequencies were increased by 2 71 5 61 fold and 5 46 13 96 fold in chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min groups compared to the control but not in uv irradiated groups a neglected lagging response was found for the first time i e oxidative disinfection induced dormancy promotes conjugative transfer of args furthermore mechanistic insights were gained from 1 membrane permeability 2 conjugation regulated system 3 efflux pump system and 4 oxidative stress system suggesting the critical role of enhancing efflux and oxidative stress in the propagation of args finally the known instantaneous effect of oxidation disinfection was compared to address the controversial debate in this research field proposing that the dormancy level of donor bacteria is the key to evaluating whether it can promote the hgt process this study has important environmental implications for elucidating the transmission of args after oxidation disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative disinfection bacterial dormancy antibiotic resistance horizontal gene transfer hgt lagging response data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial antimicrobial resistance attributable to 4 95 million associated deaths in 2019 has been emerged as one of the largest public health threats around the world groussin et al 2021 lu and guo 2021 murray et al 2022 owing to the infections of antibiotic resistant bacteria it is estimated that 10 million annual human deaths will occur by 2050 if no measure is implemented lu and guo 2021 yu et al 2021 antibiotic resistance genes args have been detected in environmental water circulation systems including natural reservoirs and wastewater reclamation systems and they constitute the source of environmental antibiotic resistance chen et al 2019 yu et al 2020 genetic mutation horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt constitute three known pathways in enriching antibiotic resistance for its widespread propagation in environmental matrices and the human gut che et al 2021 san millan 2018 zhang et al 2021 in particular hgt mediated by conjugation transformation and transduction has been recognized as the most important strategy of bacteria in acquiring args groussin et al 2021 rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 it is widely acknowledged that the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections of humans and livestock contributed to the leading cause responsible for the hgt of args che et al 2021 groussin et al 2021 the related mechanisms were revealed as the oxidative stress triggered overexpression of conjugation related regulatory genes with the promoted hgt frequency within and across bacterial genera rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 san millan 2018 furthermore increasing evidence suggested that non antibiotic chemicals such as artificial sweeteners nanomaterials ionic liquids and disinfectants could also markedly accelerate the hgt process for global assimilation and transmission of args lu et al 2020 lu and guo 2021 qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 mechanistic insights indicated that these environmental stimuli induced direct formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros followed by cell membrane damage induction of sos response and the enhanced expression of conjugation related genes feng et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 as a final procedure of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants disinfection plays a vital role in inactivating various pathogenic microorganisms for sustainable water safety cai et al 2021b 2021a lu and guo 2021 among the treatment technologies chlorine uv and their combination i e uv chlorine have been widely applied and investigated due to their high disinfection efficiency cai et al 2021b guo et al 2022 lin et al 2016 however the emergency of disinfection associated microbial risks has been recently highlighted because of the induction of resistant viable but non culturable vbnc bacteria and the limited elimination of args by these treatment strategies cai et al 2021b 2021a lin et al 2017 in terms of the hgt process chlorine disinfection has been closely linked to the enhanced natural transformation frequency of args owing to the intermediate oxidative stress jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however controversial debates exist regarding the impact of disinfection on the conjugative transfer of args within and across bacterial genera guo et al 2015 reported that low uv doses 8 mj cm2 posed little influence on the conjugation related hgt process while low chlorine doses 50 mg cl min l significantly accelerated the transfer frequency of args by 2 5 fold our recent study showed that both uv irradiation and low level chlorination could reduce the plasmid rp4 mediated conjugative transfer rates lin et al 2016 subsequently zhang et al 2017 found that disinfection via chlorine chloramine and h2o2 at sub inhibitory concentrations led to the conjugative transfer promotion of multidrug resistance genes therefore further systematical efforts need to be devoted to clarifying and deciphering the distinguished results and associated mechanisms more importantly the unexpected high hgt frequency was recently revealed in the human gut microbiome which may trigger potentially adverse effects on human health particularly with the presence of pathogenic bacteria groussin et al 2021 generally the residual chlorine in the supplied drinking water could be quenched after entering the human body all previous studies have only focused on the instant bacterial responses on hgt of args after disinfection guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2021 whereas the subsequent or lagging effect on this process is currently seldom explored this study presents for the first time that the dormancy induced by the lagging oxidative damage via chlorine based disinfection could significantly promote the conjugative transfer frequency of args within bacterial genera the main objective of this work is to unveil the previously overlooked lagging responses of disinfection on the propagation of antibiotic resistance and the underlying regulatory mechanisms three different disinfection treatments including uv irradiation chlorination and uv chlorine were selected for comparison mechanistic insights were revealed by performing multiple molecular assays such as gel electrophoresis reverse transcription real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr flow cytometry fcm transmission electron microscopy tem and reversed confirmation by conjugation frequency assay under anaerobic conditions the findings of this investigation have significant environmental implications in terms of the spread of args after oxidation disinfection which may pose potentially greater threats to public health than known before 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bacterial strains the donor was escherichia coli dh5α e coli dh5α containing the rp4 plasmid which carries three types of antibiotic resistance including ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline the culture used the luria bertani lb broth system containing 100 0 mg l ampicillin 60 0 mg l kanamycin and 10 0 mg l tetracycline which was shaken at 37 c and 180 0 rpm min for 12 h e coli hb101 was selected as the recipient carrying streptomycin resistance which was cultured in the lb broth system containing 30 0 mg l streptomycin under the same conditions donor bacteria were washed twice with 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution pbs and used for subsequent disinfection treatments recipient bacteria were washed twice with 0 01 m pbs and then suspended and diluted with lb broth for the following experiments ampicillin and kanamycin were purchased from solarbio life sciences beijing china tetracycline and streptomycin were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china and macklin inc shanghai china respectively 2 2 conjugative transfer system and conjugative frequency analysis the model conjugation system was established to evaluate whether the disinfection induced dormancy could facilitate the spread of args through conjugation specifically a 20 0 ml conjugation system with the recipient bacteria 10 0 ml 1 1 108 cfu ml and donor bacteria 10 0 ml 8 2 107 cfu ml was established prior to the construction of the model system the donor bacteria were disinfected and pretreated in quartz containers wang et al 2021 ye et al 2022 and the cultivability of the tested bacteria has been lost at this dose of disinfection i e the disinfectant dose is sufficient to control microbial safety in brief 250 0 ml of donor bacteria was added to a solution of 1 0 mg l final concentration sodium hypochlorite naocl 5 sigma usa which was maintained or simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation of 15 w and 254 nm philips netherlands treated donor bacteria were collected at 1 3 5 10 and 30 min respectively sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was used as a quencher at a thiosulfate to chlorine molar ratio of 2 1 fig s1 in the experimental system the mixture of donor and recipient was incubated at 37 c for 1 3 and 7 days the colony number of transconjugants was determined by taking the suspensions at different dilutions and coating them on the selective lb plates containing 100 0 mg l ampicillin 60 0 mg l kanamycin 10 0 mg l tetracycline and 30 0 mg l streptomycin and incubated at 37 c for 24 h in addition the total number of recipients was determined by applying a mixed suspension to the lb plate with 30 0 mg l streptomycin under the same culture condition the conjugation frequency was calculated by normalizing the total number of transconjugants to the total number of recipients specifically the number of transconjugants in all treatment groups was divided by the mean of the transconjugants in a control group to obtain the proportion of transconjugants which was called a both the treatment methods for recipients were identical and the normalized data were obtained which was called b finally the normalized conjugative frequency was obtained by dividing a by b 2 3 plasmid extraction pcr and gel electrophoresis colonies of transconjugants from different disinfection treatment groups were randomly selected and their plasmids were extracted with plasmid mini kit tiangen china the extracted plasmid was used as the pcr template and the teta gene carried by rp4 plasmid was used as the target fragment for pcr amplification at an annealing temperature of 62 table s1 each 50 0 μl pcr reaction consisted of 25 0 μl of 2x easytaq pcr supermix transgen biotech china 1 0 μl of forward and reverse primers 10 0 μm 1 0 μl of dna template and 22 0 μl of ddh2o the amplification products were verified using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the observation of positive amplification products indicated the presence of rp4 plasmids in each colony of transconjugants 2 4 rna extraction reverse transcription and real time qpcr the total rna was extracted from the conjugation system after 7 days of co cultivation using the bacterial rna extraction kit tiangen china followed by an immediate reverse transcription step for cdna synthesis dna template transgen biotech china the expression of selected functional genes was detected by a real time qpcr system briefly each 20 0 μl qpcr reaction contained 10 0 μl of sybr green master mix 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 10 0 μm 1 0 μl of dna template and 8 2 μl of ddh2o thermofisher scientific inc usa the qpcr procedure involved denaturation at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 94 c for 20 s and 30 s of annealing steps applied biosystems q3 singapore negative control samples were determined with the ddh2o template each treatment was prepared in triplicate all primers and annealing temperatures are detailed in table s2 the 2 ct method was used to analyze fold change relative expression level of selected genes in this study specifically the formula of the 2 ct method 2 ctb1 cta1 ctb0 cta0 ctb1 and ctb0 refer to the ct values of the target gene in treatment groups and control group respectively cta1 and cta0 refer to the ct values of the reference gene in treatment groups and control group respectively 2 5 detection of ros cell membrane permeability respiratory activity and esterase activity the intracellular ros production solarbio china cell membrane permeability thermofisher scientific usa respiratory activity thermofisher scientific usa and esterase activity thermofisher scientific usa of the donor e coli dh5α were measured using a guava flow cytometer luminex guava easycyte usa following the manufacturer s instructions 2 6 transmission electron microscopy tem the tem analysis was used to measure the cell morphology of donor e coli dh5α and observe the recovery of the cell membrane according to the method described previously zhang et al 2021 the donor bacteria were immobilized in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h and prepared for visualization 2 7 conjugative assay under anaerobic conditions the conjugation model system was also tested under anaerobic conditions this experiment was designed to verify whether ros formation was involved in the conjugative transfer process of args anaerobic conjugation assay was performed under the same condition as described above for the aerobic conditions except that the oxygen in the lb broth was depleted i e the tests were performed in a serum flask pre filled with nitrogen 2 8 statistical analysis the data were plotted in prism 8 0 expressed as means standard deviation and analyzed using spss 16 0 software one way analysis of variance with an independent sample t test was used to evaluate the statistical difference the significance levels were considered as padj 0 05 and padj 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of disinfection on the conjugative transfer frequency of args in this study three different disinfection technologies i e uv irradiation chlorine and uv chlorine were individually exploited to treat the donor bacteria e coli dh5α after co incubation with the recipient bacteria e coli hb101 for 24 h in lb broth the conjugative transfer frequency was greatly inhibited for all three disinfection treatments fig 1 a it is interesting to observe that the significant induction p 0 05 in conjugative transfer frequency of certain treatments with chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min after 3 days of co cultivation fig 1b the average enhancements were recorded at 2 71 fold and 5 46 fold in relation to the control these phenomena were maintained for one week with the corresponding promotion of 5 61 fold and 13 96 fold p 0 01 for chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min comparatively no such results were noted for the treatments with 30 min of uv irradiation figs 1b and c additionally oxidative disinfection can potentially lead to enhanced cell membrane permeability or even cell rupture jin et al 2020 ye et al 2020 and the plasmid may be dissolved that is the naked plasmid may directly enter the recipient bacteria through transformation therefore it is necessary to explore the influence of natural transformation on the promoted hgt rates in this study rp4 plasmids were extracted from donor bacteria at the same concentration as the conjugation system and then mixed with the recipient bacteria for co cultivation the natural transformation did not occur throughout all culturing days figs s2 these results were consistent with previous studies which suggested that rp4 had very low natural transformation efficiency as a conjugated giant plasmid heß et al 2021 wang et al 2015 additionally on the 1st day the absolute amounts of the oxidative disinfection treatment groups e g 30 min of chlorine and 1 min of uv chlorine were 3 logs lower than those of the control group however the hgt frequency of the above oxidative disinfection treatment groups was significantly elevated on the 3rd and 7th day table s3 the comparison the two groups implied that vgt contributed little to the transconjugant concentrations therefore it is believed that oxidative disinfection promoted the transmission of plasmid rp4 only through conjugation to investigate the possible existence of rp4 plasmids in transconjugants the related colonies from different disinfection treatments were randomly collected for plasmid extraction and amplification this was performed only to qualitatively confirm the success of the conjugative transfer the gel electrophoresis analysis suggested the presence of the rp4 plasmid carried teta gene in all groups after 3 and 7 days fig 1d and e demonstrating the occurrence of the conjugative transfer process of args these results unveiled the lagging hgt risks after oxidative disinfection i e chlorine and uv chlorine as a novel but alarming phenomenon which has been completely overlooked by previous studies there is the environmental significance that bacteria in water may still acquire args via conjugation under nutrient rich conditions similar to our lb broth possibly posing detrimental risks to human health moreover the nutrient levels in the human gut are also very high bacteria have access to abundant nutrients to support their growth so we suspect that a similar process could occur in the human gut however since the gut is a slightly acidic and anaerobic environment further studies are needed to confirm this claim 3 2 hypothesis the increased conjugation is related to bacterial recovery in the present study the culturability of bacteria after disinfection treatments was explored low culturability was clearly observed after co incubation for 24 h and 3 days fig 1a and b for the two treatments with the most significant conjugative transfer rates i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min by converting the fcm count to the number of culturable bacteria lin et al 2017 the concentrations of bacteria at the viable but not culturable vbnc state reached 1 65 108 cfu ml and 1 58 108 cfu ml respectively these values had the same magnitude as the total level of culturable bacteria i e 2 35 108 cfu ml however after 7 days of co incubation the culturability of different treatment groups was elevated with the most significant recovery for the ones with high conjugative transfer frequencies fig 1c this proposed the hypothesis of whether the accelerated hgt processes were attributed to the recovered physiological status of bacteria resulting from the improved culturability or the increased amounts of rp4 plasmids to investigate this hypothesis three sets of experiments were designed as follows 3 2 1 evaluation of the physiological state of bacteria in the conjugated system two different biomarkers i e respiratory activity ctc assay chen et al 2018 and esterase activity cfda assay zhang et al 2020 were measured to evaluate the physiological state of bacteria after 7 days of co incubation the positive areas were divided into three different degrees in which represented the highest activity the results demonstrated the extremely low respiratory activity of the treatments i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the elevated hgt frequency fig 2 a in particular the ctc level was recorded with only positive intensity red column for the latter treatment in terms of esterase activity significant inhibition of these two treatments was also observed by comparison with the control as denoted by the diminished levels of cfda gray column fig 2b all these phenomena indicated that the bacteria remained in a dormant state with limited physiological activity 3 2 2 the amounts of plasmids for increased hgt frequency the absolute copy numbers of teta a specific gene carried by rp4 plasmids in unit bacteria were quantified using the qpcr analysis the quantitative data showed that its copy numbers in two specific treatments i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the increased hgt rates were in the range of 0 01 1 90 copies cells fig s3 these values were much lower than that of the control group i e 4 38 4 60 copies cells suggesting the transconjugants formation hgt occurrence did not depend on the absolute abundance of rp4 plasmids 3 2 3 the mrna expression levels of dormancy related genes two specific regulatory genes i e rpos hengge aronis et al 2002 and ygfa maisonneuve et al 2011 were selected as the biomarkers of dormant bacteria for this experiment generally the relative mrna expression levels of these two genes could be significantly elevated in responding to harmful environmental factors lin et al 2017 as illustrated in fig s4 compared to the control group much higher gene expression levels were recorded in treatments of chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the promoted hgt rates the increased fold changes of rpos and ygfa reached 3 41 and 21 54 in chlorine treatment for 30 min respectively according to the results from the three above verification experiments the hypothesis that increased conjugation is related to bacterial recovery or regrowth was ruled out it can thus be inferred that dormant bacteria after disinfection induced oxidative damage could enhance the conjugative transfer frequency of args which has been previously overlooked 3 3 deciphering mechanisms on the dormancy facilitated conjugation of args 3 3 1 cell membrane permeability recent studies have demonstrated that the increased conjugation rate of args by environmental stimuli was highly related to the cell membrane permeability li et al 2020 wang et al 2015 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 based on the fcm analysis the bacterial membrane pre treated by propidium iodide dye exhibited significantly increased permeability p 0 05 or p 0 01 within 24 h after disinfection using chlorine and uv chlorine fig 3 a comparatively no change in cell membrane permeability was found for uv treatment except for the extended irradiation at 30 min interestingly cell membrane permeability was not significantly altered in all treatments after co incubation for 3 and 7 days fig 3b and c this phenomenon implied the self repairing process of donor bacteria after disinfection additional evidence was obtained by tem images of test bacteria after 24 h of co cultivation the interior of the cell slices in the chlorine and uv chlorine based treatment systems was obviously inhomogeneous and the cell membrane was also uneven fig 3g these observations suggested that the enhanced permeability of bacterial cells was caused by oxidative disinfection however after 7 days of co cultivation some bacteria in the treatment systems had recovered to a state similar to the control group specifically the internal texture of the cell slices became uniform with the relatively smooth and intact cell membrane and relatively regular cell morphology further confirmation was performed by analyzing the relative mrna expression of dna integration repair genes i e nuva nuvb and nuvc iwanejko et al 1996 their significantly high expression p 0 05 or p 0 01 by different disinfection treatments after 7 days of co incubation demonstrated the self repairing process of bacteria fig s5 additionally the porin modulated by ompa ompc and ompf genes was recognized as the important outer membrane protein responsible for the uptake and transfer of xenobiotics wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 it was found in our study that only the expression of ompa presented an up regulated trend fig 3d while the expression of ompc and ompf showed no significant difference compared with the control group fig 3e and f overall the cell membrane permeability of bacteria was not enhanced for the treatments of chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min after 3 and 7 days of co incubation in the meantime the corresponding expression trends of porin related genes were not completely uniform therefore it can be deduced that these two factors were not the main reasons for the increase in conjugative transfer frequency of args 3 3 2 efflux pump related and conjugation regulated genes in the present study the relative mrna expressions of four typical efflux pump related genes i e tolc acrd maca and erma were evaluated the significantly enhanced expressions of all four genes p 0 05 or p 0 01 were observed after three disinfection treatments fig 4 in particular the highest promoted expressions matched well with the groups of chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min with the highest conjugation frequency taking tolc as an example the gene expressions of these two treatments were individually 4 80 fold and 4 08 fold as compared to the control which were significantly higher than that of 30 min of uv irradiation i e 1 78 fold fig 4a the relative trend was also observed in three other efflux pump related genes including acrd maca and erma fig 4b d alav et al 2018 fitzpatrick et al greene et al 2018 2017 pu et al 2016 hence the enhanced efflux was most likely one of the main contributors to hgt acceleration there are two major ways to increase intracellular material transportation namely by expressing more pore channels and by enhancing the efflux pump expression pu et al 2016 in our study the porin gene ompa was upregulated in uv chlorine treatment groups fig 3 such increased expression of the porin gene would amplify channels and may enhance nucleic acid and plasmid transport jeff et al 2010 lin et al 2016 additionally the expression of the active efflux gene tolc was upregulated in the oxidation disinfection treatment groups fig 4 misra and reeves 1987 showed that the tolc protein might exert its effect on the ompf promoter area or the terminal end of the ompf gene to regulate gene expression previous studies have also confirmed that down regulation of tolc leads to decreased expression of ompf morona and reeves 1982 therefore the up regulation of tolc may lead to high expression of ompf and thus promote the hgt process the in depth underlying mechanisms for the ompf regulation in oxidation disinfection treatment groups remain unclear from the existing literature however this further implies the significant role of efflux pumps in bacterial hgt additionally five more conjugation associated genes including two global regulator genes grg as kora and korb barth et al 1984 theophilus et al 1985 two dna vertical transfer system vts genes as kila and kilb barth et al 1984 schreiner et al 1985 and one dna horizontal transfer replication dtr system gene as traf wang et al 2015 were explored for their possible involvement in the dormancy facilitated hgt process it is generally reported that the down regulation of grg and vts genes and up regulation of dtr genes are responsible for non antibiotic factors in the increased conjugative transfer rates of args jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 similar results were also observed in this study with statistically significant differences p 0 05 or p 0 01 for all three disinfection treatments figs s6a s6e however considering that 1 no significant difference was seen for the gene expression levels between uv treated groups and two other treatments 2 uv irradiation did not promote the conjugative transfer rates whereas two other oxidative treatments did it may be therefore concluded that overregulated expression of conjugation related genes played an auxiliary but not determining role in the hgt elevation this was further reflected and verified by the following anaerobic experiments 3 3 3 oxidative stress the intracellular ros contents of the treatment groups after 7 days were estimated by fcm analysis it was observed that the treatments using chlorine 5 min and 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min presented the highest ros concentrations i e 53 6 46 76 and 60 28 which were even higher than that of the positive control 52 44 fig 5 a l these phenomena were highly consistent with the enhanced conjugative transfer frequencies of the three above groups additional confirmation was obtained with significantly enhanced mrna expression levels p 0 05 or p 0 01 of oxidative stress related genes e g soda sodb and sodc in these groups fig 5m o bae et al 2011 zhang et al 2022 for example compared to the control group treatments with chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min resulted in increased soda expressions at 35 52 fold and 36 12 fold respectively intracellularly setr could repress the expression of activators of integrating conjugative element ice transfer john et al 2004 found that the sos response to dna damage alleviated this repression increasing the expression of genes necessary for ice transfer and enhancing the conjugative transfer frequency ros can directly damage dna and then induce the sos response which is a global regulatory response protecting the cells from dna damage john et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 in our manuscript dna damage was also confirmed in the oxidative disinfection treatment groups fig s5 therefore we suggest that the lagging response caused by oxidative disinfection may promote the frequency of hgt through the ros and sos response pathways taken together these data implied that the induction of oxidative stress was the second leading cause for the promoted conjugation after oxidative disinfection 3 3 4 anaerobic experiments as mentioned above the enhanced efflux and excessive ros formation were two dominant contributors to hgt elevation given the involvement and necessity of molecular oxygen by both processes anaerobic experiments were performed to further validate the reliability of the proposed mechanisms as shown in fig 6 the disinfection induced enhancement in conjugative transfer rates of args disappeared under anaerobic conditions subsequently mrna expression of associated genes was also evaluated without oxygen it is interesting to find no significant difference in the related expression of soda nuva and tolc which were otherwise significantly enhanced under aerobic conditions fig 6e g these observations were in good accordance with the two above mechanisms however the same expression trends of grg vts and dtr genes were noted with and without oxygen fig 6b d indicating their minor contributions in the accelerated frequency of the conjugative transfer process of args the reversed confirmation experiments further demonstrated that the lagging oxidative damage induced dormancy facilitated the conjugation of args probably via the enhanced efflux and oxidative stress 3 4 commonality of oxidative disinfection promoted hgt for the controversial debates of hgt caused by oxidative disinfection further systematical efforts need to be devoted to clarifying and deciphering the distinguished results the lagging response induced by oxidative disinfection may explain the controversy we found that the instantaneous effect of oxidative disinfection would reduce the conjugation transfer frequency which was consistent with the results of lin et al 2016 however another study showed that oxidative disinfection would enhance the hgt of rp4 plasmid within and across genera bae et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 these two results seemed to be contradictory which was intrinsically not as shown in fig 7 the reason for this difference may represent different stages of bacteria against oxidative disinfection specifically when the degree of oxidative disinfection is low e g sub lethal concentration or high concentration of bacteria the bacteria can immediately produce environmental stress response and enhance the hgt process through sos and ros response in combination with molecular regulation via mating pair formation mpf dtr and grg systems fig 7b however when the intensity of oxidative disinfection is high i e the bacteria are damaged or enter the dormancy state the dtr system flagellar gene and porin genes were inhibited and fewer pili appeared on cells causing plasmids to conjugate less frequently lin et al 2016 after a period of repair e g enhanced dna repair system membrane permeability repair etc the bacterial cells will restart the sos and ros response the overexpression of the atp binding active efflux system can also result in a higher hgt process i e lagging response fig 7a therefore whether oxidative disinfection promotes the hgt process depends on the ros production or whether the bacteria are in the appropriate dormancy stage only the donor bacteria in the appropriate dormancy stage can increase the horizontal transfer of conjugative plasmid bacteria are more prone to dormancy during the disinfection process in the water system and the lagging response will occur in the subsequent eutrophic environments however there is still no quantitative and well recognized criterion at this research stage to accurately differentiate and determine the dormancy levels of donor bacteria but the bacteria from the disinfection treatment groups with the enhanced conjugative transfer frequencies are probably inclined to possess the general characteristics of cell membrane integrity and high resuscitation potentials therefore it would be desirable and recommended to pay more attention to the regrowth risks of bacteria in evaluating the microbiological stability after disinfection processes in summary this study has great significance for both environment and engineering 1 the assimilation of args to pose potentially detrimental health effects by the lagging response via the water disinfection and 2 the necessity of technological development of emerging disinfection strategies for sustainable and healthier water purification 4 conclusions for the first time the present study reported a previously overlooked but important phenomenon i e oxidative disinfection could trigger the lagging responses of bacteria in remarkably

15763,disinfection is known to greatly alter bacterial characteristics in water and high horizontal gene transfer hgt frequency occurs in eutrophic conditions interestingly these two seemingly irrelevant phenomena were closely linked by a lagging response of the increased conjugation frequency probably via daily water disinfection in this study three disinfection methods uv chlorine and uv chlorine were selected to investigate the increased frequency of conjugation of args during the stage of continuing culture after disinfection the results showed that the conjugative transfer frequency was inhibited for all disinfection treatments after 24 h of co incubation unexpectedly after 3 7 days of co cultivation the hgt frequencies were increased by 2 71 5 61 fold and 5 46 13 96 fold in chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min groups compared to the control but not in uv irradiated groups a neglected lagging response was found for the first time i e oxidative disinfection induced dormancy promotes conjugative transfer of args furthermore mechanistic insights were gained from 1 membrane permeability 2 conjugation regulated system 3 efflux pump system and 4 oxidative stress system suggesting the critical role of enhancing efflux and oxidative stress in the propagation of args finally the known instantaneous effect of oxidation disinfection was compared to address the controversial debate in this research field proposing that the dormancy level of donor bacteria is the key to evaluating whether it can promote the hgt process this study has important environmental implications for elucidating the transmission of args after oxidation disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative disinfection bacterial dormancy antibiotic resistance horizontal gene transfer hgt lagging response data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial antimicrobial resistance attributable to 4 95 million associated deaths in 2019 has been emerged as one of the largest public health threats around the world groussin et al 2021 lu and guo 2021 murray et al 2022 owing to the infections of antibiotic resistant bacteria it is estimated that 10 million annual human deaths will occur by 2050 if no measure is implemented lu and guo 2021 yu et al 2021 antibiotic resistance genes args have been detected in environmental water circulation systems including natural reservoirs and wastewater reclamation systems and they constitute the source of environmental antibiotic resistance chen et al 2019 yu et al 2020 genetic mutation horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt constitute three known pathways in enriching antibiotic resistance for its widespread propagation in environmental matrices and the human gut che et al 2021 san millan 2018 zhang et al 2021 in particular hgt mediated by conjugation transformation and transduction has been recognized as the most important strategy of bacteria in acquiring args groussin et al 2021 rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 it is widely acknowledged that the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections of humans and livestock contributed to the leading cause responsible for the hgt of args che et al 2021 groussin et al 2021 the related mechanisms were revealed as the oxidative stress triggered overexpression of conjugation related regulatory genes with the promoted hgt frequency within and across bacterial genera rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 san millan 2018 furthermore increasing evidence suggested that non antibiotic chemicals such as artificial sweeteners nanomaterials ionic liquids and disinfectants could also markedly accelerate the hgt process for global assimilation and transmission of args lu et al 2020 lu and guo 2021 qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 mechanistic insights indicated that these environmental stimuli induced direct formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros followed by cell membrane damage induction of sos response and the enhanced expression of conjugation related genes feng et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 as a final procedure of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants disinfection plays a vital role in inactivating various pathogenic microorganisms for sustainable water safety cai et al 2021b 2021a lu and guo 2021 among the treatment technologies chlorine uv and their combination i e uv chlorine have been widely applied and investigated due to their high disinfection efficiency cai et al 2021b guo et al 2022 lin et al 2016 however the emergency of disinfection associated microbial risks has been recently highlighted because of the induction of resistant viable but non culturable vbnc bacteria and the limited elimination of args by these treatment strategies cai et al 2021b 2021a lin et al 2017 in terms of the hgt process chlorine disinfection has been closely linked to the enhanced natural transformation frequency of args owing to the intermediate oxidative stress jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however controversial debates exist regarding the impact of disinfection on the conjugative transfer of args within and across bacterial genera guo et al 2015 reported that low uv doses 8 mj cm2 posed little influence on the conjugation related hgt process while low chlorine doses 50 mg cl min l significantly accelerated the transfer frequency of args by 2 5 fold our recent study showed that both uv irradiation and low level chlorination could reduce the plasmid rp4 mediated conjugative transfer rates lin et al 2016 subsequently zhang et al 2017 found that disinfection via chlorine chloramine and h2o2 at sub inhibitory concentrations led to the conjugative transfer promotion of multidrug resistance genes therefore further systematical efforts need to be devoted to clarifying and deciphering the distinguished results and associated mechanisms more importantly the unexpected high hgt frequency was recently revealed in the human gut microbiome which may trigger potentially adverse effects on human health particularly with the presence of pathogenic bacteria groussin et al 2021 generally the residual chlorine in the supplied drinking water could be quenched after entering the human body all previous studies have only focused on the instant bacterial responses on hgt of args after disinfection guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2021 whereas the subsequent or lagging effect on this process is currently seldom explored this study presents for the first time that the dormancy induced by the lagging oxidative damage via chlorine based disinfection could significantly promote the conjugative transfer frequency of args within bacterial genera the main objective of this work is to unveil the previously overlooked lagging responses of disinfection on the propagation of antibiotic resistance and the underlying regulatory mechanisms three different disinfection treatments including uv irradiation chlorination and uv chlorine were selected for comparison mechanistic insights were revealed by performing multiple molecular assays such as gel electrophoresis reverse transcription real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr flow cytometry fcm transmission electron microscopy tem and reversed confirmation by conjugation frequency assay under anaerobic conditions the findings of this investigation have significant environmental implications in terms of the spread of args after oxidation disinfection which may pose potentially greater threats to public health than known before 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bacterial strains the donor was escherichia coli dh5α e coli dh5α containing the rp4 plasmid which carries three types of antibiotic resistance including ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline the culture used the luria bertani lb broth system containing 100 0 mg l ampicillin 60 0 mg l kanamycin and 10 0 mg l tetracycline which was shaken at 37 c and 180 0 rpm min for 12 h e coli hb101 was selected as the recipient carrying streptomycin resistance which was cultured in the lb broth system containing 30 0 mg l streptomycin under the same conditions donor bacteria were washed twice with 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution pbs and used for subsequent disinfection treatments recipient bacteria were washed twice with 0 01 m pbs and then suspended and diluted with lb broth for the following experiments ampicillin and kanamycin were purchased from solarbio life sciences beijing china tetracycline and streptomycin were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china and macklin inc shanghai china respectively 2 2 conjugative transfer system and conjugative frequency analysis the model conjugation system was established to evaluate whether the disinfection induced dormancy could facilitate the spread of args through conjugation specifically a 20 0 ml conjugation system with the recipient bacteria 10 0 ml 1 1 108 cfu ml and donor bacteria 10 0 ml 8 2 107 cfu ml was established prior to the construction of the model system the donor bacteria were disinfected and pretreated in quartz containers wang et al 2021 ye et al 2022 and the cultivability of the tested bacteria has been lost at this dose of disinfection i e the disinfectant dose is sufficient to control microbial safety in brief 250 0 ml of donor bacteria was added to a solution of 1 0 mg l final concentration sodium hypochlorite naocl 5 sigma usa which was maintained or simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation of 15 w and 254 nm philips netherlands treated donor bacteria were collected at 1 3 5 10 and 30 min respectively sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was used as a quencher at a thiosulfate to chlorine molar ratio of 2 1 fig s1 in the experimental system the mixture of donor and recipient was incubated at 37 c for 1 3 and 7 days the colony number of transconjugants was determined by taking the suspensions at different dilutions and coating them on the selective lb plates containing 100 0 mg l ampicillin 60 0 mg l kanamycin 10 0 mg l tetracycline and 30 0 mg l streptomycin and incubated at 37 c for 24 h in addition the total number of recipients was determined by applying a mixed suspension to the lb plate with 30 0 mg l streptomycin under the same culture condition the conjugation frequency was calculated by normalizing the total number of transconjugants to the total number of recipients specifically the number of transconjugants in all treatment groups was divided by the mean of the transconjugants in a control group to obtain the proportion of transconjugants which was called a both the treatment methods for recipients were identical and the normalized data were obtained which was called b finally the normalized conjugative frequency was obtained by dividing a by b 2 3 plasmid extraction pcr and gel electrophoresis colonies of transconjugants from different disinfection treatment groups were randomly selected and their plasmids were extracted with plasmid mini kit tiangen china the extracted plasmid was used as the pcr template and the teta gene carried by rp4 plasmid was used as the target fragment for pcr amplification at an annealing temperature of 62 table s1 each 50 0 μl pcr reaction consisted of 25 0 μl of 2x easytaq pcr supermix transgen biotech china 1 0 μl of forward and reverse primers 10 0 μm 1 0 μl of dna template and 22 0 μl of ddh2o the amplification products were verified using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the observation of positive amplification products indicated the presence of rp4 plasmids in each colony of transconjugants 2 4 rna extraction reverse transcription and real time qpcr the total rna was extracted from the conjugation system after 7 days of co cultivation using the bacterial rna extraction kit tiangen china followed by an immediate reverse transcription step for cdna synthesis dna template transgen biotech china the expression of selected functional genes was detected by a real time qpcr system briefly each 20 0 μl qpcr reaction contained 10 0 μl of sybr green master mix 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 10 0 μm 1 0 μl of dna template and 8 2 μl of ddh2o thermofisher scientific inc usa the qpcr procedure involved denaturation at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 94 c for 20 s and 30 s of annealing steps applied biosystems q3 singapore negative control samples were determined with the ddh2o template each treatment was prepared in triplicate all primers and annealing temperatures are detailed in table s2 the 2 ct method was used to analyze fold change relative expression level of selected genes in this study specifically the formula of the 2 ct method 2 ctb1 cta1 ctb0 cta0 ctb1 and ctb0 refer to the ct values of the target gene in treatment groups and control group respectively cta1 and cta0 refer to the ct values of the reference gene in treatment groups and control group respectively 2 5 detection of ros cell membrane permeability respiratory activity and esterase activity the intracellular ros production solarbio china cell membrane permeability thermofisher scientific usa respiratory activity thermofisher scientific usa and esterase activity thermofisher scientific usa of the donor e coli dh5α were measured using a guava flow cytometer luminex guava easycyte usa following the manufacturer s instructions 2 6 transmission electron microscopy tem the tem analysis was used to measure the cell morphology of donor e coli dh5α and observe the recovery of the cell membrane according to the method described previously zhang et al 2021 the donor bacteria were immobilized in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h and prepared for visualization 2 7 conjugative assay under anaerobic conditions the conjugation model system was also tested under anaerobic conditions this experiment was designed to verify whether ros formation was involved in the conjugative transfer process of args anaerobic conjugation assay was performed under the same condition as described above for the aerobic conditions except that the oxygen in the lb broth was depleted i e the tests were performed in a serum flask pre filled with nitrogen 2 8 statistical analysis the data were plotted in prism 8 0 expressed as means standard deviation and analyzed using spss 16 0 software one way analysis of variance with an independent sample t test was used to evaluate the statistical difference the significance levels were considered as padj 0 05 and padj 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of disinfection on the conjugative transfer frequency of args in this study three different disinfection technologies i e uv irradiation chlorine and uv chlorine were individually exploited to treat the donor bacteria e coli dh5α after co incubation with the recipient bacteria e coli hb101 for 24 h in lb broth the conjugative transfer frequency was greatly inhibited for all three disinfection treatments fig 1 a it is interesting to observe that the significant induction p 0 05 in conjugative transfer frequency of certain treatments with chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min after 3 days of co cultivation fig 1b the average enhancements were recorded at 2 71 fold and 5 46 fold in relation to the control these phenomena were maintained for one week with the corresponding promotion of 5 61 fold and 13 96 fold p 0 01 for chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min comparatively no such results were noted for the treatments with 30 min of uv irradiation figs 1b and c additionally oxidative disinfection can potentially lead to enhanced cell membrane permeability or even cell rupture jin et al 2020 ye et al 2020 and the plasmid may be dissolved that is the naked plasmid may directly enter the recipient bacteria through transformation therefore it is necessary to explore the influence of natural transformation on the promoted hgt rates in this study rp4 plasmids were extracted from donor bacteria at the same concentration as the conjugation system and then mixed with the recipient bacteria for co cultivation the natural transformation did not occur throughout all culturing days figs s2 these results were consistent with previous studies which suggested that rp4 had very low natural transformation efficiency as a conjugated giant plasmid heß et al 2021 wang et al 2015 additionally on the 1st day the absolute amounts of the oxidative disinfection treatment groups e g 30 min of chlorine and 1 min of uv chlorine were 3 logs lower than those of the control group however the hgt frequency of the above oxidative disinfection treatment groups was significantly elevated on the 3rd and 7th day table s3 the comparison the two groups implied that vgt contributed little to the transconjugant concentrations therefore it is believed that oxidative disinfection promoted the transmission of plasmid rp4 only through conjugation to investigate the possible existence of rp4 plasmids in transconjugants the related colonies from different disinfection treatments were randomly collected for plasmid extraction and amplification this was performed only to qualitatively confirm the success of the conjugative transfer the gel electrophoresis analysis suggested the presence of the rp4 plasmid carried teta gene in all groups after 3 and 7 days fig 1d and e demonstrating the occurrence of the conjugative transfer process of args these results unveiled the lagging hgt risks after oxidative disinfection i e chlorine and uv chlorine as a novel but alarming phenomenon which has been completely overlooked by previous studies there is the environmental significance that bacteria in water may still acquire args via conjugation under nutrient rich conditions similar to our lb broth possibly posing detrimental risks to human health moreover the nutrient levels in the human gut are also very high bacteria have access to abundant nutrients to support their growth so we suspect that a similar process could occur in the human gut however since the gut is a slightly acidic and anaerobic environment further studies are needed to confirm this claim 3 2 hypothesis the increased conjugation is related to bacterial recovery in the present study the culturability of bacteria after disinfection treatments was explored low culturability was clearly observed after co incubation for 24 h and 3 days fig 1a and b for the two treatments with the most significant conjugative transfer rates i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min by converting the fcm count to the number of culturable bacteria lin et al 2017 the concentrations of bacteria at the viable but not culturable vbnc state reached 1 65 108 cfu ml and 1 58 108 cfu ml respectively these values had the same magnitude as the total level of culturable bacteria i e 2 35 108 cfu ml however after 7 days of co incubation the culturability of different treatment groups was elevated with the most significant recovery for the ones with high conjugative transfer frequencies fig 1c this proposed the hypothesis of whether the accelerated hgt processes were attributed to the recovered physiological status of bacteria resulting from the improved culturability or the increased amounts of rp4 plasmids to investigate this hypothesis three sets of experiments were designed as follows 3 2 1 evaluation of the physiological state of bacteria in the conjugated system two different biomarkers i e respiratory activity ctc assay chen et al 2018 and esterase activity cfda assay zhang et al 2020 were measured to evaluate the physiological state of bacteria after 7 days of co incubation the positive areas were divided into three different degrees in which represented the highest activity the results demonstrated the extremely low respiratory activity of the treatments i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the elevated hgt frequency fig 2 a in particular the ctc level was recorded with only positive intensity red column for the latter treatment in terms of esterase activity significant inhibition of these two treatments was also observed by comparison with the control as denoted by the diminished levels of cfda gray column fig 2b all these phenomena indicated that the bacteria remained in a dormant state with limited physiological activity 3 2 2 the amounts of plasmids for increased hgt frequency the absolute copy numbers of teta a specific gene carried by rp4 plasmids in unit bacteria were quantified using the qpcr analysis the quantitative data showed that its copy numbers in two specific treatments i e chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the increased hgt rates were in the range of 0 01 1 90 copies cells fig s3 these values were much lower than that of the control group i e 4 38 4 60 copies cells suggesting the transconjugants formation hgt occurrence did not depend on the absolute abundance of rp4 plasmids 3 2 3 the mrna expression levels of dormancy related genes two specific regulatory genes i e rpos hengge aronis et al 2002 and ygfa maisonneuve et al 2011 were selected as the biomarkers of dormant bacteria for this experiment generally the relative mrna expression levels of these two genes could be significantly elevated in responding to harmful environmental factors lin et al 2017 as illustrated in fig s4 compared to the control group much higher gene expression levels were recorded in treatments of chlorine for 30 min and uv chlorine for 1 min with the promoted hgt rates the increased fold changes of rpos and ygfa reached 3 41 and 21 54 in chlorine treatment for 30 min respectively according to the results from the three above verification experiments the hypothesis that increased conjugation is related to bacterial recovery or regrowth was ruled out it can thus be inferred that dormant bacteria after disinfection induced oxidative damage could enhance the conjugative transfer frequency of args which has been previously overlooked 3 3 deciphering mechanisms on the dormancy facilitated conjugation of args 3 3 1 cell membrane permeability recent studies have demonstrated that the increased conjugation rate of args by environmental stimuli was highly related to the cell membrane permeability li et al 2020 wang et al 2015 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 based on the fcm analysis the bacterial membrane pre treated by propidium iodide dye exhibited significantly increased permeability p 0 05 or p 0 01 within 24 h after disinfection using chlorine and uv chlorine fig 3 a comparatively no change in cell membrane permeability was found for uv treatment except for the extended irradiation at 30 min interestingly cell membrane permeability was not significantly altered in all treatments after co incubation for 3 and 7 days fig 3b and c this phenomenon implied the self repairing process of donor bacteria after disinfection additional evidence was obtained by tem images of test bacteria after 24 h of co cultivation the interior of the cell slices in the chlorine and uv chlorine based treatment systems was obviously inhomogeneous and the cell membrane was also uneven fig 3g these observations suggested that the enhanced permeability of bacterial cells was caused by oxidative disinfection however after 7 days of co cultivation some bacteria in the treatment systems had recovered to a state similar to the control group specifically the internal texture of the cell slices became uniform with the relatively smooth and intact cell membrane and relatively regular cell morphology further confirmation was performed by analyzing the relative mrna expression of dna integration repair genes i e nuva nuvb and nuvc iwanejko et al 1996 their significantly high expression p 0 05 or p 0 01 by different disinfection treatments after 7 days of co incubation demonstrated the self repairing process of bacteria fig s5 additionally the porin modulated by ompa ompc and ompf genes was recognized as the important outer membrane protein responsible for the uptake and transfer of xenobiotics wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 it was found in our study that only the expression of ompa presented an up regulated trend fig 3d while the expression of ompc and ompf showed no significant difference compared with the control group fig 3e and f overall the cell membrane permeability of bacteria was not enhanced for the treatments of chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min after 3 and 7 days of co incubation in the meantime the corresponding expression trends of porin related genes were not completely uniform therefore it can be deduced that these two factors were not the main reasons for the increase in conjugative transfer frequency of args 3 3 2 efflux pump related and conjugation regulated genes in the present study the relative mrna expressions of four typical efflux pump related genes i e tolc acrd maca and erma were evaluated the significantly enhanced expressions of all four genes p 0 05 or p 0 01 were observed after three disinfection treatments fig 4 in particular the highest promoted expressions matched well with the groups of chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min with the highest conjugation frequency taking tolc as an example the gene expressions of these two treatments were individually 4 80 fold and 4 08 fold as compared to the control which were significantly higher than that of 30 min of uv irradiation i e 1 78 fold fig 4a the relative trend was also observed in three other efflux pump related genes including acrd maca and erma fig 4b d alav et al 2018 fitzpatrick et al greene et al 2018 2017 pu et al 2016 hence the enhanced efflux was most likely one of the main contributors to hgt acceleration there are two major ways to increase intracellular material transportation namely by expressing more pore channels and by enhancing the efflux pump expression pu et al 2016 in our study the porin gene ompa was upregulated in uv chlorine treatment groups fig 3 such increased expression of the porin gene would amplify channels and may enhance nucleic acid and plasmid transport jeff et al 2010 lin et al 2016 additionally the expression of the active efflux gene tolc was upregulated in the oxidation disinfection treatment groups fig 4 misra and reeves 1987 showed that the tolc protein might exert its effect on the ompf promoter area or the terminal end of the ompf gene to regulate gene expression previous studies have also confirmed that down regulation of tolc leads to decreased expression of ompf morona and reeves 1982 therefore the up regulation of tolc may lead to high expression of ompf and thus promote the hgt process the in depth underlying mechanisms for the ompf regulation in oxidation disinfection treatment groups remain unclear from the existing literature however this further implies the significant role of efflux pumps in bacterial hgt additionally five more conjugation associated genes including two global regulator genes grg as kora and korb barth et al 1984 theophilus et al 1985 two dna vertical transfer system vts genes as kila and kilb barth et al 1984 schreiner et al 1985 and one dna horizontal transfer replication dtr system gene as traf wang et al 2015 were explored for their possible involvement in the dormancy facilitated hgt process it is generally reported that the down regulation of grg and vts genes and up regulation of dtr genes are responsible for non antibiotic factors in the increased conjugative transfer rates of args jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 similar results were also observed in this study with statistically significant differences p 0 05 or p 0 01 for all three disinfection treatments figs s6a s6e however considering that 1 no significant difference was seen for the gene expression levels between uv treated groups and two other treatments 2 uv irradiation did not promote the conjugative transfer rates whereas two other oxidative treatments did it may be therefore concluded that overregulated expression of conjugation related genes played an auxiliary but not determining role in the hgt elevation this was further reflected and verified by the following anaerobic experiments 3 3 3 oxidative stress the intracellular ros contents of the treatment groups after 7 days were estimated by fcm analysis it was observed that the treatments using chlorine 5 min and 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min presented the highest ros concentrations i e 53 6 46 76 and 60 28 which were even higher than that of the positive control 52 44 fig 5 a l these phenomena were highly consistent with the enhanced conjugative transfer frequencies of the three above groups additional confirmation was obtained with significantly enhanced mrna expression levels p 0 05 or p 0 01 of oxidative stress related genes e g soda sodb and sodc in these groups fig 5m o bae et al 2011 zhang et al 2022 for example compared to the control group treatments with chlorine 30 min and uv chlorine 1 min resulted in increased soda expressions at 35 52 fold and 36 12 fold respectively intracellularly setr could repress the expression of activators of integrating conjugative element ice transfer john et al 2004 found that the sos response to dna damage alleviated this repression increasing the expression of genes necessary for ice transfer and enhancing the conjugative transfer frequency ros can directly damage dna and then induce the sos response which is a global regulatory response protecting the cells from dna damage john et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 in our manuscript dna damage was also confirmed in the oxidative disinfection treatment groups fig s5 therefore we suggest that the lagging response caused by oxidative disinfection may promote the frequency of hgt through the ros and sos response pathways taken together these data implied that the induction of oxidative stress was the second leading cause for the promoted conjugation after oxidative disinfection 3 3 4 anaerobic experiments as mentioned above the enhanced efflux and excessive ros formation were two dominant contributors to hgt elevation given the involvement and necessity of molecular oxygen by both processes anaerobic experiments were performed to further validate the reliability of the proposed mechanisms as shown in fig 6 the disinfection induced enhancement in conjugative transfer rates of args disappeared under anaerobic conditions subsequently mrna expression of associated genes was also evaluated without oxygen it is interesting to find no significant difference in the related expression of soda nuva and tolc which were otherwise significantly enhanced under aerobic conditions fig 6e g these observations were in good accordance with the two above mechanisms however the same expression trends of grg vts and dtr genes were noted with and without oxygen fig 6b d indicating their minor contributions in the accelerated frequency of the conjugative transfer process of args the reversed confirmation experiments further demonstrated that the lagging oxidative damage induced dormancy facilitated the conjugation of args probably via the enhanced efflux and oxidative stress 3 4 commonality of oxidative disinfection promoted hgt for the controversial debates of hgt caused by oxidative disinfection further systematical efforts need to be devoted to clarifying and deciphering the distinguished results the lagging response induced by oxidative disinfection may explain the controversy we found that the instantaneous effect of oxidative disinfection would reduce the conjugation transfer frequency which was consistent with the results of lin et al 2016 however another study showed that oxidative disinfection would enhance the hgt of rp4 plasmid within and across genera bae et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 these two results seemed to be contradictory which was intrinsically not as shown in fig 7 the reason for this difference may represent different stages of bacteria against oxidative disinfection specifically when the degree of oxidative disinfection is low e g sub lethal concentration or high concentration of bacteria the bacteria can immediately produce environmental stress response and enhance the hgt process through sos and ros response in combination with molecular regulation via mating pair formation mpf dtr and grg systems fig 7b however when the intensity of oxidative disinfection is high i e the bacteria are damaged or enter the dormancy state the dtr system flagellar gene and porin genes were inhibited and fewer pili appeared on cells causing plasmids to conjugate less frequently lin et al 2016 after a period of repair e g enhanced dna repair system membrane permeability repair etc the bacterial cells will restart the sos and ros response the overexpression of the atp binding active efflux system can also result in a higher hgt process i e lagging response fig 7a therefore whether oxidative disinfection promotes the hgt process depends on the ros production or whether the bacteria are in the appropriate dormancy stage only the donor bacteria in the appropriate dormancy stage can increase the horizontal transfer of conjugative plasmid bacteria are more prone to dormancy during the disinfection process in the water system and the lagging response will occur in the subsequent eutrophic environments however there is still no quantitative and well recognized criterion at this research stage to accurately differentiate and determine the dormancy levels of donor bacteria but the bacteria from the disinfection treatment groups with the enhanced conjugative transfer frequencies are probably inclined to possess the general characteristics of cell membrane integrity and high resuscitation potentials therefore it would be desirable and recommended to pay more attention to the regrowth risks of bacteria in evaluating the microbiological stability after disinfection processes in summary this study has great significance for both environment and engineering 1 the assimilation of args to pose potentially detrimental health effects by the lagging response via the water disinfection and 2 the necessity of technological development of emerging disinfection strategies for sustainable and healthier water purification 4 conclusions for the first time the present study reported a previously overlooked but important phenomenon i e oxidative disinfection could trigger the lagging responses of bacteria in remarkably enhancing the conjugative transfer rates of args the main conclusions were as follows 1 oxidative disinfection induced the bacterial dormancy state and reduced the frequency of hgt in the short term but it could trigger the lagging responses of bacteria in remarkably enhancing the conjugative transfer rates of args in lb system 2 mechanistic insights suggested the critical role of enhanced efflux and oxidative stress in the propagation and transmission of args in contrast the related genes on the bacterial membrane self repair and the conjugation regulated system are not primarily involved in the regulation of lagging response 3 the dormancy level of donor bacteria is the key to evaluating whether it can promote the hgt process hence accurate division of bacterial activity level and application of disinfection dose is particularly important for the control of propagation and transmission of args in drinking water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

15764,the selective removal of hg2 from waste acids containing high concentrations of other metal cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 which are discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries is in great demand herein sulfureted fe2tio5 was developed as a regenerable magnetic sorbent to recover hg2 from waste acids for centralized control sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the capacity of 292 317 mg g 1 and the rate of 49 5 57 6 mg g 1 h 1 at ph 2 4 meanwhile it exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited the mechanism and kinetic studies indicated that the fe2 in the fes2 coated on sulfureted fe2tio5 was exchanged with hg2 adsorbed at a fe2 to hg2 mole ratio of 1 2 meanwhile most of the hg2 removed by sulfureted fe2tio5 can be thermally desorbed primarily as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which can finally be recovered as liquid hg0 for centralized control in combination with existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated for duty cycle operations with re sulfuration without a remarkable degradation of the hg2 removal performance therefore hg2 recovery using sulfureted fe2tio5 may be a promising low cost and environmentally friendly technology for the

nonferrous metal smelting data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction owing to its mobility toxicity and bioaccumulation barregard et al 1999 cooney 2009 jiang et al 2006 mercury hg pollution is becoming a significant concern the minamata convention on mercury was recently implemented to reduce emissions gionfriddo et al 2016 lamborg et al 2014 podar et al 2015 shotyk 2017 nonferrous metal smelting has been listed by the minamata convention as the second most abundant anthropogenic source of mercury after coal combustion wu et al 2016a ye et al 2015 the emissions of hg from nonferrous metal smelting are predominantly attributed to the desorption decomposition of hg species in nonferrous metal ores mainly metal sulfides during their thermal transformation to metal oxides because the hg content in metal sulfides is significantly higher than that in coal pirrone et al 2010 wu et al 2015 2012 the concentration of hg in smelting flue gas 40 mg m 3 is much higher than that in coal fired flue gas 100 μg m 3 wu et al 2016b the hg in smelting flue gas is primarily present as gaseous hg2 and hg0 wu et al 2012 and the ratio of hgp particle bound hg is exceptionally low air pollution control devices including electrostatic precipitators flue gas scrubbers special hg0 recovery devices and acid plants are generally used in modern smelters to control the emissions of high concentrations of hg and so2 see fig 1 kong et al 2018 mei et al 2020a wang et al 2020a 2020b wu et al 2015 part of the gaseous so2 so3 in smelting flue gas is transformed to a relatively high concentration of h2so4 5 20 wt in the unit of flue gas scrubbers resulting in acid scrubbing effluents i e waste acids ph 2 sun et al 2021 meanwhile gaseous hg2 generally enters the waste acids owing to its water solubility furthermore waste acids often contain high concentrations of other heavy metals such as zn2 200 mg l 1 cu2 50 mg l 1 and cd2 50 mg l 1 chai et al 2010 currently the removal of hg2 is a priority in the treatment of waste acids discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries although chemical precipitation is a widely used method to remove heavy metals from waste acids after adjusting the ph to neutral this method produces a large amount of hazardous sludge chai et al 2010 sun et al 2021 further exploitation of hazardous sludge to recover other metal resources is seriously affected by the presence of hg due to the toxicity meta stability and volatility of hg and its compounds therefore it is preferable to remove hg2 from waste acids prior to chemical precipitation adsorption is a simple effective and economical method for removing hg2 from wastewater recently a variety of sorbents such as benzoylthiourea modified mesoporous silica antochshuk et al 2003 thiol functionalized magnesium phyllosilicate lagadic et al 2001 polypyrrole reduced graphene oxide chandra and kim 2011 activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge zhang et al 2005 magnetic mesoporous silica wang et al 2012 mercapto functionalized zr mofs lin et al 2019 dithiocarbamate functionalized magnetite figueira et al 2011 and 2 mercaptobenzimidazole clay manohar et al 2002 have been developed to remove hg2 from wastewater however the removal of hg2 from waste acids via adsorption is extremely restricted for at least three reasons first most sorbents cannot efficiently adsorb hg2 from acidic wastewater although they function well when utilized at a near neutral ph second most sorbents exhibit poor selectivity for hg2 in the presence of other heavy metals therefore the adsorption of hg2 is remarkably restrained by other heavy metals third spent sorbents are difficult to regenerate for recycling and hg2 adsorbed on the sorbents cannot be recovered for centralized control therefore safe disposal of spent sorbents containing hg2 is necessary now the development of regenerable sorbents with excellent performance and selectivity to remove hg2 from acidic wastewater is urgently needed manos et al 2009 because of the strong sulfophile affinity of hg hsu kim and sedlak 2005 many metal sulfides such as pyrite fes2 behra et al 2001 ehrhardt et al 2000 zns qu et al 2014 cus hu et al 2019 mos2 jia et al 2018 mackinawite fes jeong et al 2007 and other iron sulfides gong et al 2014 exhibit excellent performance for hg2 removal even under acidic ph conditions however it is difficult to regenerate spent metal sulfides in our previous study a thin layer of fes2 was coated on titanomaghemite fe2tio5 with the sulfuration of gaseous h2s and sulfureted fe2tio5 was developed as a regenerable sorbent to recover high concentrations of gaseous hg 0 from smelting flue gas for centralized control mei et al 2020b zou et al 2017 in the current study the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 in removing hg2 from waste acids was investigated sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal under acidic conditions ph 2 4 and the fe2 in the fes2 coated on the sulfureted fe2tio5 could be exchanged by the adsorbed hgcl2 with a molar ratio of fe2 to hg2 of 1 2 meanwhile sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 adsorption that not only the coexisting metal cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 were scarcely adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited furthermore most adsorbed hg2 could be thermally desorbed as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which could finally be recovered as liquid hg0 for centralized control in combination with the existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated with re sulfuration for duty cycle operations without a remarkable degradation of its hg2 adsorption performance therefore hg2 recovery using regenerable sulfureted fe2tio5 may be a promising low cost and environmentally friendly technology for the centralized control of hg2 in waste acids discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation fe2tio5 was prepared using a co precipitation method followed by calcination at 500 c for 3 h yang et al 2011 2012 then sulfureted fe2tio5 was obtained by treating the fe2tio5 with 600 ppm h2s n2 at 300 c for 60 min mei et al 2020b wang et al 2020a zou et al 2017 2 2 characterization the bet surface areas x ray diffraction patterns xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopies xps zeta potentials and magnetizations were measured using a nitrogen adsorption desorption apparatus microtracbel belsorp max an x ray diffractometer bruker axs d8 advance an x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo escalab 250 a colloidal dynamics zeta probe analyzer anton parr litesizer tm 500 and a vibrating sample magnetometer lakeshore 735 respectively the s content in the sulfureted fe2tio5 was determined using temperature programmed oxidation so2 tpo of the s species to produce so2 in the air and the so2 concentration was determined online using a gas analyzer thermo scientific igs wang et al 2020a 2 3 hg2 removal test batch experiments for hg2 removal were performed in a glass reactor containing 200 ml of reaction solution equipped with a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm a stock solution of hg2 1 0 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving hgso4 in diluted sulfuric acid with nacl solution as the stabilizing agent the initial hg2 concentration for the batch removal experiments was 100 mg l 1 and the solution contained 10 mmol l 1 of nacl as the background electrolyte meanwhile the adsorption of coexisting heavy metal cations such as 200 mg l 1 of zn2 50 mg l 1 of cu2 and 50 mg l 1 of cd2 and their effect on hg2 removal were both investigated the initial ph of the reaction solution was 2 0 or 4 0 the reaction was initiated by the addition of sorbents and 3 ml of the reaction solution was sampled from the reactor at each sampling time followed by filtration for solid liquid separation the hg2 concentrations were determined using a cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer lumex ra 915 m after the reduction of hg2 to hg0 using a sncl2 solution and the concentrations of fe mainly fe2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma icp optical emission spectrometer perkinelmer optima 8300 the each hg2 removal test was generally performed at least twice and the error for the calculated amount of hg2 removed was generally less than 5 the thermal stability of the hg species adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 was analyzed based on the temperature programmed desorption of hg hg tpd in a fixed bed reactor in either n2 or air to investigate the replicability of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal five cycles of hg2 removal hg desorption and sorbent regeneration were performed five cycles of hg2 removal at either ph 2 0 or 4 0 were performed on a shaking table at 200 rpm 3 results 3 1 performance for hg2 removal 3 1 1 ability for hg2 removal the performances of the sulfureted fe2tio5 and fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 2 0 and 4 0 are compared in fig 2 fe2tio5 exhibited a poor ability to remove hg2 at both ph 2 0 and 4 0 and little hg2 was removed however the sulfureted fe2tio5 demonstrated an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the hg2 removal efficiency reaching 64 and 58 in 180 min at ph 2 0 and 4 0 respectively however little hg0 was observed during hg2 removal this suggests that most of the hg2 removed was adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 after 180 min of hg2 removal the ph values slightly decreased to approximately 1 8 and 3 8 for the solutions with initial ph values of 2 0 and 4 0 respectively to investigate the adsorption capacity of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal a long term removal test was performed fig 2c indicates that the capacities of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal were at least 292 and 317 mg g 1 at ph 2 0 and 4 0 respectively 3 1 2 selectivity for hg2 removal generally there are high concentrations of other heavy metals in waste acids such as zn2 cu2 and cd2 which often interfere with hg2 removal therefore the selectivity of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal was investigated fig 3 sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited a poor ability for zn2 cd2 and cu2 removal at ph 2 0 and 4 0 regardless of the presence of hg2 although hg2 removal by sulfureted fe2tio5 was restrained considerably by the presence of zn2 cd2 and cu2 in the first 30 min the efficiency decreased little overall after 180 min fig 2 this suggests that the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibits excellent selectivity for hg2 removal at ph 2 4 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 xrd and bet surface area xrd pattern of fe2tio5 fig 4 a corresponded well to the spinel structure jcpds 39 1346 yang et al 2011 xrd pattern of sulfureted fe2tio5 was similar to that of fe2tio5 suggesting that the spinel structure of fe2tio5 hardly varied after sulfuration and the sulfuration reaction may only happen on the surface the bet surface areas of fe2tio5 and sulfureted fe2tio5 were 47 1 and 41 2 m2 g 1 respectively 3 2 2 xps and so2 tpo the fe 2p binding energies for fe2tio5 were primarily centered at 712 2 and 710 6 ev fig 5 a which were assigned to fe3 bonded with hydroxyl groups and fe3 respectively yang et al 2011 after sulfuration two new binding energies appeared at 713 7 and 707 3 ev for the fe2tio5 see fig 5b which were attributed to fe2 bonded with so4 2 and fe2 in fe sulfides respectively mei et al 2020b the s 2p binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 were primarily centered at 170 0 168 8 164 8 163 8 and 162 6 ev fig 5c which were assigned to s6 in so4 2 170 0 and 168 8 ev s0 164 8 ev and s2 2 in fes2 163 8 and 162 6 ev respectively mei et al 2020b these results suggest that pyrite i e fes2 appeared on the fe2tio5 owing to the reaction between fe2tio5 and gaseous h2s zou et al 2017 the amount of s species on sulfureted fe2tio5 which calculated from the total amount of so2 formed in so2 tpo fig 4b was approximately 60 4 mg g 1 3 2 3 magnetization fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and its saturation magnetization was approximately 34 8 emu g 1 fig 4b mei et al 2020b although the saturation magnetization of fe2tio5 decreased by approximately 14 to 29 9 emu g 1 after sulfuration due to the partial conversion of the magnetic fe oxides on the surface to non magnetic fes2 as indicated by the xps analysis sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and it can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution 3 2 4 zeta potential fig 4d shows that the zero charge potential of fe2tio5 appeared at approximately ph 3 95 at ph 3 95 the fe2tio5 surface was positively charged at ph 3 95 the fe2tio5 surface was negatively charged after sulfuration the zero charge potential of fe2tio5 shifted to approximately ph 5 0 additionally the surface positive charge for sulfureted fe2tio5 was much larger than that for fe2tio5 under acidic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for hg2 removal because the performance of fe2tio5 for hg2 removal improved remarkably after sulfuration the excellent performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal may be predominantly related to the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 mei et al 2020b the hg 4f binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal show two pairs of peaks at 105 5 and 101 5 ev and 105 2 and 101 1 ev fig 5d which were assigned to hgcl2 and hgs respectively behra et al 2001 ehrhardt et al 2000 meanwhile the hg tpd profiles in n2 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal revealed two weak hg2 desorption peaks at approximately 190 and 270 c and one strong hg0 desorption peak at approximately 210 c fig 6 a the hg0 desorption is primarily attributed to the decomposition of hgs rumayor et al 2013 this further demonstrates that hgs was formed during hg2 removal using the sulfureted fe2tio5 the hg2 desorption peak is mainly attributed to the desorption of the adsorbed hgcl2 the volatilization of pure hgcl2 starts at approximately 90 c and the peak centers at approximately 138 c rumayor et al 2013 which is much lower than the desorption temperature of hgcl2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 this suggests that there is a strong interaction between the adsorbed hgcl2 and sulfureted fe2tio5 the fe 2p binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 varied little after hg2 removal fig 5e meanwhile the peak at 164 8 ev in the s 2p spectral region corresponding to s0 disappeared see fig 5f this suggests that s0 may have participated in the hg2 removal because so4 2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may dissolve during hg2 removal the s 2p binding energies at 170 0 and 168 8 ev corresponding to so4 2 almost disappeared after hg2 removal fig 5f the percentages of the fe s and hg species on the sulfureted fe2tio5 before and after hg2 removal calculated according to the xps analysis are listed in table 1 the percentage of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal calculated based on the fe 2p spectral region at 707 3 ev 0 79 was much less than that calculated using the s 2p spectral region at 163 8 and 162 6 ev 6 14 meanwhile the s 2p binding energy at approximately 162 0 ev corresponding to s2 in isolated hgs behra et al 2001 was hardly observed see fig 5f this suggests that the fe2 in fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may be substituted by hg2 because the introduced hg2 presented on the sulfureted fe2tio5 as a pyrite structure the s species in hgs still presented as s2 2 at 163 8 and 162 6 ev see fig 5f if the isomorphous substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 occurs on sulfureted fe2tio5 some fe2 cations are released to further demonstrate this isomorphous substitution the release of fe2 during hg2 removal was investigated fig 7 a and b the fe2 concentration rapidly increased to approximately 9 4 mg l 1 after the addition of sulfureted fe2tio5 to an nacl solution ph 2 0 for 5 min fig 7a which was mainly attributed to the dissolution of feso4 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 see table 1 then the fe2 concentration gradually increased to 16 8 mg l 1 in the next 175 min fig 7a fig 7a also demonstrates that little fe2 fe3 can be observed in the solution after the immersion of fe2tio5 in the nacl solution with a ph of 2 0 this suggests that the release of fe2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 in addition to the feso4 dissolution is mostly related to the acidic corrosion of fes2 behra et al 2001 after the introduction of hg2 the release of fe2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably fig 7a this suggests that the acidic corrosion of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 2 0 may be restrained substantially by hg2 therefore isomorphous substitution could not be supported by the release of fe2 during hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 2 0 because the acidic corrosion of fes2 may be alleviated significantly with an increase in the ph value the release of fe2 during hg2 removal was then investigated at ph 4 0 fig 7b also indicates that the fe2 concentration rapidly increased to approximately 4 4 mg l 1 after the addition of sulfureted fe2tio5 to an nacl solution with ph 4 0 for 15 min due to the rapid dissolution of feso4 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 then the fe2 concentration gradually decreased to approximately 3 4 mg l 1 over the next 165 min this phenomenon may be attributed to the adsorption of fe2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 4 0 because the fe2 concentration did not gradually increase after the rapid dissolution of feso4 the acidic corrosion of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may be approximately neglected at ph 4 0 fig 7b indicates that the fe2 concentration gradually increased at ph 4 0 after the rapid dissolution of feso4 in the presence of hg2 and the amount of fe2 released in the presence of hg2 was much larger than that in the absence of hg2 this demonstrates that some fe2 was released owing to hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 which supports the occurrence of isomorphous substitution of fe2 in the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 therefore the mechanism of hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 can be described as follows 1 h g 2 aq h g 2 ad 2 fe s 2 h g 2 ad f e 1 x hg s 2 x f e 2 reaction 1 is the adsorption of hg2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 and reaction 2 is the substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 adsorbed x is the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 ad to fe2 in reaction 2 4 2 kinetic analysis for hg2 removal according to reaction 2 the rates of hg2 removal and fe2 release i e δ 1 and δ 2 can be approximated as follows 3 δ 1 d h g 2 aq d t d h g 2 ad d t k h g 2 ad fe s 2 4 δ 2 d f e 2 d t x k h g 2 ad fe s 2 5 x δ 2 δ 1 where hg2 aq hg2 ad fe2 fes2 and k are the concentration of hg2 in the aqueous solution adsorbed concentration of hg2 concentration of fe2 in the aqueous solution amount of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 and kinetic constant of reaction 2 respectively if hg2 aq is high enough to keep the surface of the sulfureted fe2tio5 saturated with the adsorbed hg2 the adsorption of hg2 rapidly reaches saturation and hg2 ad can be approximately regarded as a constant if fes2 is much more abundant than the amount of hg2 exchanged the decrease in fes2 during hg2 removal can be neglected this suggests that fes2 during the initial stage of hg2 removal can be regarded as a constant according to eqs 3 and 4 δ 1 and δ 2 can be regarded as constants in the initial stage therefore the concentrations of hg2 and fe2 in the aqueous solution at reaction time t i e hg2 aq t and fe2 aq t can be approximately expressed as 6 hg 2 aq t hg 2 aq 0 hg 2 ad δ 1 t 7 fe aq t feso 4 δ 2 t where feso4 is the amount of feso4 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 to obtain the kinetic parameters kinetic tests for hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 were performed at ph 2 0 and 4 0 fig 7c and d indicate that hg2 aq t decreased at an approximate constant speed after 15 min at both ph 2 0 and 4 0 which is consistent with eq 6 fig 7c and d were fitted using eq 6 and the kinetic parameters are listed in table 2 the kinetics of fe2 release during hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 was also fitted according to eq 7 because the acidic corrosion of fes2 simultaneously occurs during hg2 removal at ph 2 0 δ 2 at ph 2 0 in table 2 should be much larger than the actual value this suggests that the actual x at ph 2 0 should be much less than 0 70 and the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 to fe2 in reaction 2 was larger than 1 1 because fe2 in aqueous solution can adsorb on sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 4 0 the kinetics of fe2 released due to the substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 was fitted with the line calculated by subtracting the fe2 concentration without hg2 from that with hg2 see fig 7b as demonstrated in table 2 the x value at ph 4 is approximately 0 46 this suggests that the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 to fe2 in reaction 2 may be 2 1 and that one fe2 in fes2 can be substituted by two hg2 ions table 2 shows that hg2 ad increased considerably with the increase in the ph value from 2 0 to 4 0 this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 i e reaction 1 was promoted with the increase in ph fig 8 demonstrates that approximately 91 of hg2 in the reaction solution at ph 2 4 was hgcl2 aq and approximately 8 was hgcl3 the electrostatic adsorption of hgcl3 onto sulfureted fe2tio5 was inhibited remarkably with the increase in the ph value because the surface positive charge for sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably fig 4d this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 onto sulfureted fe2tio5 was mainly attributed to the coordination adsorption due to the strong sulphophile affinity of hg2 meanwhile the promotion of hg2 adsorption onto fe2tio5 due to the sulfuration was mainly attributed to the promotion of the coordination adsorption due to the strong sulphophile affinity of hg2 although the electrostatic attraction of fe2tio5 to hgcl3 was enhanced remarkably after the sulfuration behra et al 2001 table 2 indicates that δ 1 decreased substantially with the increase in the ph value from 2 0 to 4 0 this suggests that the substitution of fe2 in the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 i e reaction 2 was inhibited with the increase in ph therefore the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 4 0 was slightly less than that at ph 2 0 see fig 2 fes2 did not vary with the increase in ph while hg2 ad increased as suggested by eq 3 k at ph 4 0 was much less than that at ph 2 0 table 2 demonstrates that hg2 ad at ph 2 0 and 4 0 both decreased remarkably in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that cu2 zn2 and cd2 interfered with the coordination adsorption of hg2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 significantly however δ 1 increased substantially in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that the substitution of fe2 in fes2 on sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 i e reaction 2 was promoted by the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 fes2 did not vary in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 while hg2 ad decreased significantly as indicated in eq 3 k increased drastically with the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that cu2 zn2 or cd2 may play the role of catalyst on reaction 2 4 3 application of sulfureted fe2tio5 in recovering hg2 from waste acids 4 3 1 performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 as a regenerable sorbent for hg2 removal the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited excellent performance and selectivity for hg2 removal figs 2 and 3 meanwhile it also demonstrated an excellent superparamagnetism with the saturation magnetizations of 29 9 emu g 1 fig 4c therefore the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution the recovery of the adsorbed hg and the regeneration of the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 were also investigated the hg adsorbed on sulfureted fe2tio5 was thermally desorbed fig 6 and the hg balance was analyzed see table 3 the amounts of hgt desorbed in n2 and air were approximately 92 7 and 96 7 of the amount of hg2 removed respectively this suggests that most of the hg2 adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 could be thermally desorbed with high concentrations of hg0 and hg2 hg0 accounted for approximately 93 of the hgt desorbed when thermal desorption was performed in n2 when the process was performed in air the percentage of hg0 decreased to approximately 82 and hg2 accounted for approximately 18 because an air atmosphere was readily available the thermal desorption of hg adsorbed on sulfureted fe2tio5 was performed in air at 400 c for 60 min to investigate the replicability of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal five cycles of hg2 removal thermal desorption of adsorbed hg and regeneration of the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 with re sulfuration were investigated fig 9 the hg2 removal efficiencies during the three cycles of hg2 removal at ph 2 0 were all nearly 100 and they gradually decreased to 98 2 and 95 1 for the 4th and 5th runs respectively see fig 9a this suggests that the performance of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 2 0 slightly degraded after multiple regenerations meanwhile the amount of fe2 leached during each run of hg2 removal was in the range of 125 144 mg l 1 see fig 9a suggesting that approximately 12 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 was lost during each cycle of hg2 removal at ph 2 0 only a small amount of fe2 leached approximately 14 mg l 1 was related to the exchange by hg2 and the remaining more than 100 mg l 1 resulted from the acidic corrosion of fes2 and dissolution of feso4 as the ph for hg2 removal was increased to 4 0 the acidic corrosion of fes2 was restrained considerably see fig 7a and b then the amount of fe2 leached during hg2 removal at ph 4 0 decreased to 52 58 mg l 1 see fig 9b suggesting that approximately 5 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 was leached during each cycle of hg2 removal at ph 4 0 as a result the degradation of the hg2 removal performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 after multiple regeneration cycles was significantly restrained at ph 4 0 and the hg2 removal efficiencies during the five cycles of hg2 removal were all nearly 100 therefore the ph value of the waste acids was preliminarily adjusted to ph 4 0 for hg2 removal to improve the lifetime of the sulfureted fe2tio5 although the characteristic peaks at 33 4 and 49 7 corresponding to hematite α fe2o3 jcpds 72 0469 appeared the characteristic peaks corresponding to spinel still predominated over the xrd pattern of sulfureted fe2tio5 after five cycles of hg2 recovery fig 4a the appeared α fe2o3 mainly resulted from the oxidation of fes2 on sulfureted fe2tio5 during the thermal desorption of hg although saturation magnetization of sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably to 9 5 emu g 1 after the five cycles of hg recovery due to the appearance of α fe2o3 it still exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution see the inset in fig 4c 4 3 2 technology for hg recovery from waste acids in combination with existing hg control devices the ph value of the waste acids was first adjusted to ph 4 0 sulfureted fe2tio5 was then added to the waste acids to selectively remove hg2 after the hg2 was removed the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 containing hg was recovered using magnetic separation then the waste acids without hg2 were neutralized and other metal cations such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 were precipitated finally precipitation without hg can be further exploited to recover other metal resources such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 table 3 indicates that hg0 and hg2 accounted for approximately 82 and 18 of the total hg desorbed from the sulfureted fe2tio5 in air respectively although the total hg concentration in the desorption gas 400 mg m 3 was significantly higher than that in the smelting flue gas 40 mg m 3 the flow rate of the desorption gas was several orders of magnitude lower than that of the smelting flue gas therefore it was suggested that the desorption gas was introduced back into the smelting flue gas upstream of the scrubber see fig 1 then hgcl2 in the desorption gas was converted into hg2 in the waste acids which was removed again by sulfureted fe2tio5 meanwhile the hg0 in the desorption gas was recovered as liquid hg0 using the existing hg0 recovery unit in the smelters see fig 1 finally most hg2 in waste acids was recovered as liquid hg0 by sulfureted fe2tio5 for centralized control in combination with existing hg control devices in smelters 4 4 comparison of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 recovery with other sorbents table 4 compares the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal with those of other reported sorbents under acidic conditions except for modified mos2 jia et al 2018 and s rich hydrophilic polysulfides limjuco et al 2020 the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal including the adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate was much better than those of most reported sorbents including poly 1 vinylimidazole grafted fe3o4 sio2 shan et al 2015 2 mercaptobenzimidazole impregnated clay manohar et al 2002 modified puffed rice carbon fang et al 2020 modified activated carbon from sewage sludge zhang et al 2005 nonviable bacillus sp green ruiz 2006 cofe2o4 reduced graphene oxide zhang et al 2014 2 aminoethanethiol grafted porous organic polymer ravi et al 2017 eucalyptus bark ghodbane and hamdaoui 2008 and thiol modified fe3o4 sio2 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting heavy cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited furthermore the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism which benefited the solid liquid separation of the spent sorbent moreover hg2 removed by the sulfureted fe2tio5 can be thermally desorbed at ultrahigh concentrations of gaseous hg0 and hg2 which can then be recovered as liquid hg for centralized control in combination with existing hg control devices in smelters more importantly the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 can be regenerated for recycling without a notable degradation of its hg2 removal ability these suggest that hg2 in waste acids can be selectively recovered as liquid hg for centralized control by re generable sulfureted fe2tio5 then the recovery of other metal resources from sludge which resulted from the further neutralization of waste acids would be facile in the absence of hg2 5 conclusion in this work fes2 was coated on fe2tio5 due to the sulfuration with h2s to improve its performance for the selective removal of hg2 from waste acids sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the capacity of 292 317 mg g 1 and the rate of 49 5 57 6 mg g 1 h 1 at ph 2 4 meanwhile it exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited the mechanism and kinetic studies indicated that the fe2 in the fes2 coated on sulfureted fe2tio5 can be exchanged with hg2 adsorbed at a fe2 to hg2 mole ratio of 1 2 the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be recovered using magnetic separation due to its excellent superparamagnetism meanwhile most of the hg2 removed by sulfureted fe2tio5 can be enriched as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which can finally be recovered as liquid hg for centralized control in combination with existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated for duty cycle operations with re sulfuration without a remarkable degradation of the hg2 removal performance therefore hg2 recovery using sulfureted fe2tio5

15764,the selective removal of hg2 from waste acids containing high concentrations of other metal cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 which are discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries is in great demand herein sulfureted fe2tio5 was developed as a regenerable magnetic sorbent to recover hg2 from waste acids for centralized control sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the capacity of 292 317 mg g 1 and the rate of 49 5 57 6 mg g 1 h 1 at ph 2 4 meanwhile it exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited the mechanism and kinetic studies indicated that the fe2 in the fes2 coated on sulfureted fe2tio5 was exchanged with hg2 adsorbed at a fe2 to hg2 mole ratio of 1 2 meanwhile most of the hg2 removed by sulfureted fe2tio5 can be thermally desorbed primarily as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which can finally be recovered as liquid hg0 for centralized control in combination with existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated for duty cycle operations with re sulfuration without a remarkable degradation of the hg2 removal performance therefore hg2 recovery using sulfureted fe2tio5 may be a promising low cost and environmentally friendly technology for the

nonferrous metal smelting data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction owing to its mobility toxicity and bioaccumulation barregard et al 1999 cooney 2009 jiang et al 2006 mercury hg pollution is becoming a significant concern the minamata convention on mercury was recently implemented to reduce emissions gionfriddo et al 2016 lamborg et al 2014 podar et al 2015 shotyk 2017 nonferrous metal smelting has been listed by the minamata convention as the second most abundant anthropogenic source of mercury after coal combustion wu et al 2016a ye et al 2015 the emissions of hg from nonferrous metal smelting are predominantly attributed to the desorption decomposition of hg species in nonferrous metal ores mainly metal sulfides during their thermal transformation to metal oxides because the hg content in metal sulfides is significantly higher than that in coal pirrone et al 2010 wu et al 2015 2012 the concentration of hg in smelting flue gas 40 mg m 3 is much higher than that in coal fired flue gas 100 μg m 3 wu et al 2016b the hg in smelting flue gas is primarily present as gaseous hg2 and hg0 wu et al 2012 and the ratio of hgp particle bound hg is exceptionally low air pollution control devices including electrostatic precipitators flue gas scrubbers special hg0 recovery devices and acid plants are generally used in modern smelters to control the emissions of high concentrations of hg and so2 see fig 1 kong et al 2018 mei et al 2020a wang et al 2020a 2020b wu et al 2015 part of the gaseous so2 so3 in smelting flue gas is transformed to a relatively high concentration of h2so4 5 20 wt in the unit of flue gas scrubbers resulting in acid scrubbing effluents i e waste acids ph 2 sun et al 2021 meanwhile gaseous hg2 generally enters the waste acids owing to its water solubility furthermore waste acids often contain high concentrations of other heavy metals such as zn2 200 mg l 1 cu2 50 mg l 1 and cd2 50 mg l 1 chai et al 2010 currently the removal of hg2 is a priority in the treatment of waste acids discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries although chemical precipitation is a widely used method to remove heavy metals from waste acids after adjusting the ph to neutral this method produces a large amount of hazardous sludge chai et al 2010 sun et al 2021 further exploitation of hazardous sludge to recover other metal resources is seriously affected by the presence of hg due to the toxicity meta stability and volatility of hg and its compounds therefore it is preferable to remove hg2 from waste acids prior to chemical precipitation adsorption is a simple effective and economical method for removing hg2 from wastewater recently a variety of sorbents such as benzoylthiourea modified mesoporous silica antochshuk et al 2003 thiol functionalized magnesium phyllosilicate lagadic et al 2001 polypyrrole reduced graphene oxide chandra and kim 2011 activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge zhang et al 2005 magnetic mesoporous silica wang et al 2012 mercapto functionalized zr mofs lin et al 2019 dithiocarbamate functionalized magnetite figueira et al 2011 and 2 mercaptobenzimidazole clay manohar et al 2002 have been developed to remove hg2 from wastewater however the removal of hg2 from waste acids via adsorption is extremely restricted for at least three reasons first most sorbents cannot efficiently adsorb hg2 from acidic wastewater although they function well when utilized at a near neutral ph second most sorbents exhibit poor selectivity for hg2 in the presence of other heavy metals therefore the adsorption of hg2 is remarkably restrained by other heavy metals third spent sorbents are difficult to regenerate for recycling and hg2 adsorbed on the sorbents cannot be recovered for centralized control therefore safe disposal of spent sorbents containing hg2 is necessary now the development of regenerable sorbents with excellent performance and selectivity to remove hg2 from acidic wastewater is urgently needed manos et al 2009 because of the strong sulfophile affinity of hg hsu kim and sedlak 2005 many metal sulfides such as pyrite fes2 behra et al 2001 ehrhardt et al 2000 zns qu et al 2014 cus hu et al 2019 mos2 jia et al 2018 mackinawite fes jeong et al 2007 and other iron sulfides gong et al 2014 exhibit excellent performance for hg2 removal even under acidic ph conditions however it is difficult to regenerate spent metal sulfides in our previous study a thin layer of fes2 was coated on titanomaghemite fe2tio5 with the sulfuration of gaseous h2s and sulfureted fe2tio5 was developed as a regenerable sorbent to recover high concentrations of gaseous hg 0 from smelting flue gas for centralized control mei et al 2020b zou et al 2017 in the current study the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 in removing hg2 from waste acids was investigated sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal under acidic conditions ph 2 4 and the fe2 in the fes2 coated on the sulfureted fe2tio5 could be exchanged by the adsorbed hgcl2 with a molar ratio of fe2 to hg2 of 1 2 meanwhile sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 adsorption that not only the coexisting metal cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 were scarcely adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited furthermore most adsorbed hg2 could be thermally desorbed as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which could finally be recovered as liquid hg0 for centralized control in combination with the existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated with re sulfuration for duty cycle operations without a remarkable degradation of its hg2 adsorption performance therefore hg2 recovery using regenerable sulfureted fe2tio5 may be a promising low cost and environmentally friendly technology for the centralized control of hg2 in waste acids discharged from nonferrous metal smelting industries 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation fe2tio5 was prepared using a co precipitation method followed by calcination at 500 c for 3 h yang et al 2011 2012 then sulfureted fe2tio5 was obtained by treating the fe2tio5 with 600 ppm h2s n2 at 300 c for 60 min mei et al 2020b wang et al 2020a zou et al 2017 2 2 characterization the bet surface areas x ray diffraction patterns xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopies xps zeta potentials and magnetizations were measured using a nitrogen adsorption desorption apparatus microtracbel belsorp max an x ray diffractometer bruker axs d8 advance an x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo escalab 250 a colloidal dynamics zeta probe analyzer anton parr litesizer tm 500 and a vibrating sample magnetometer lakeshore 735 respectively the s content in the sulfureted fe2tio5 was determined using temperature programmed oxidation so2 tpo of the s species to produce so2 in the air and the so2 concentration was determined online using a gas analyzer thermo scientific igs wang et al 2020a 2 3 hg2 removal test batch experiments for hg2 removal were performed in a glass reactor containing 200 ml of reaction solution equipped with a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm a stock solution of hg2 1 0 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving hgso4 in diluted sulfuric acid with nacl solution as the stabilizing agent the initial hg2 concentration for the batch removal experiments was 100 mg l 1 and the solution contained 10 mmol l 1 of nacl as the background electrolyte meanwhile the adsorption of coexisting heavy metal cations such as 200 mg l 1 of zn2 50 mg l 1 of cu2 and 50 mg l 1 of cd2 and their effect on hg2 removal were both investigated the initial ph of the reaction solution was 2 0 or 4 0 the reaction was initiated by the addition of sorbents and 3 ml of the reaction solution was sampled from the reactor at each sampling time followed by filtration for solid liquid separation the hg2 concentrations were determined using a cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer lumex ra 915 m after the reduction of hg2 to hg0 using a sncl2 solution and the concentrations of fe mainly fe2 cu2 cd2 and zn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma icp optical emission spectrometer perkinelmer optima 8300 the each hg2 removal test was generally performed at least twice and the error for the calculated amount of hg2 removed was generally less than 5 the thermal stability of the hg species adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 was analyzed based on the temperature programmed desorption of hg hg tpd in a fixed bed reactor in either n2 or air to investigate the replicability of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal five cycles of hg2 removal hg desorption and sorbent regeneration were performed five cycles of hg2 removal at either ph 2 0 or 4 0 were performed on a shaking table at 200 rpm 3 results 3 1 performance for hg2 removal 3 1 1 ability for hg2 removal the performances of the sulfureted fe2tio5 and fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 2 0 and 4 0 are compared in fig 2 fe2tio5 exhibited a poor ability to remove hg2 at both ph 2 0 and 4 0 and little hg2 was removed however the sulfureted fe2tio5 demonstrated an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the hg2 removal efficiency reaching 64 and 58 in 180 min at ph 2 0 and 4 0 respectively however little hg0 was observed during hg2 removal this suggests that most of the hg2 removed was adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 after 180 min of hg2 removal the ph values slightly decreased to approximately 1 8 and 3 8 for the solutions with initial ph values of 2 0 and 4 0 respectively to investigate the adsorption capacity of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal a long term removal test was performed fig 2c indicates that the capacities of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal were at least 292 and 317 mg g 1 at ph 2 0 and 4 0 respectively 3 1 2 selectivity for hg2 removal generally there are high concentrations of other heavy metals in waste acids such as zn2 cu2 and cd2 which often interfere with hg2 removal therefore the selectivity of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal was investigated fig 3 sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited a poor ability for zn2 cd2 and cu2 removal at ph 2 0 and 4 0 regardless of the presence of hg2 although hg2 removal by sulfureted fe2tio5 was restrained considerably by the presence of zn2 cd2 and cu2 in the first 30 min the efficiency decreased little overall after 180 min fig 2 this suggests that the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibits excellent selectivity for hg2 removal at ph 2 4 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 xrd and bet surface area xrd pattern of fe2tio5 fig 4 a corresponded well to the spinel structure jcpds 39 1346 yang et al 2011 xrd pattern of sulfureted fe2tio5 was similar to that of fe2tio5 suggesting that the spinel structure of fe2tio5 hardly varied after sulfuration and the sulfuration reaction may only happen on the surface the bet surface areas of fe2tio5 and sulfureted fe2tio5 were 47 1 and 41 2 m2 g 1 respectively 3 2 2 xps and so2 tpo the fe 2p binding energies for fe2tio5 were primarily centered at 712 2 and 710 6 ev fig 5 a which were assigned to fe3 bonded with hydroxyl groups and fe3 respectively yang et al 2011 after sulfuration two new binding energies appeared at 713 7 and 707 3 ev for the fe2tio5 see fig 5b which were attributed to fe2 bonded with so4 2 and fe2 in fe sulfides respectively mei et al 2020b the s 2p binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 were primarily centered at 170 0 168 8 164 8 163 8 and 162 6 ev fig 5c which were assigned to s6 in so4 2 170 0 and 168 8 ev s0 164 8 ev and s2 2 in fes2 163 8 and 162 6 ev respectively mei et al 2020b these results suggest that pyrite i e fes2 appeared on the fe2tio5 owing to the reaction between fe2tio5 and gaseous h2s zou et al 2017 the amount of s species on sulfureted fe2tio5 which calculated from the total amount of so2 formed in so2 tpo fig 4b was approximately 60 4 mg g 1 3 2 3 magnetization fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and its saturation magnetization was approximately 34 8 emu g 1 fig 4b mei et al 2020b although the saturation magnetization of fe2tio5 decreased by approximately 14 to 29 9 emu g 1 after sulfuration due to the partial conversion of the magnetic fe oxides on the surface to non magnetic fes2 as indicated by the xps analysis sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and it can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution 3 2 4 zeta potential fig 4d shows that the zero charge potential of fe2tio5 appeared at approximately ph 3 95 at ph 3 95 the fe2tio5 surface was positively charged at ph 3 95 the fe2tio5 surface was negatively charged after sulfuration the zero charge potential of fe2tio5 shifted to approximately ph 5 0 additionally the surface positive charge for sulfureted fe2tio5 was much larger than that for fe2tio5 under acidic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for hg2 removal because the performance of fe2tio5 for hg2 removal improved remarkably after sulfuration the excellent performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal may be predominantly related to the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 mei et al 2020b the hg 4f binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal show two pairs of peaks at 105 5 and 101 5 ev and 105 2 and 101 1 ev fig 5d which were assigned to hgcl2 and hgs respectively behra et al 2001 ehrhardt et al 2000 meanwhile the hg tpd profiles in n2 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal revealed two weak hg2 desorption peaks at approximately 190 and 270 c and one strong hg0 desorption peak at approximately 210 c fig 6 a the hg0 desorption is primarily attributed to the decomposition of hgs rumayor et al 2013 this further demonstrates that hgs was formed during hg2 removal using the sulfureted fe2tio5 the hg2 desorption peak is mainly attributed to the desorption of the adsorbed hgcl2 the volatilization of pure hgcl2 starts at approximately 90 c and the peak centers at approximately 138 c rumayor et al 2013 which is much lower than the desorption temperature of hgcl2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 this suggests that there is a strong interaction between the adsorbed hgcl2 and sulfureted fe2tio5 the fe 2p binding energies for the sulfureted fe2tio5 varied little after hg2 removal fig 5e meanwhile the peak at 164 8 ev in the s 2p spectral region corresponding to s0 disappeared see fig 5f this suggests that s0 may have participated in the hg2 removal because so4 2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may dissolve during hg2 removal the s 2p binding energies at 170 0 and 168 8 ev corresponding to so4 2 almost disappeared after hg2 removal fig 5f the percentages of the fe s and hg species on the sulfureted fe2tio5 before and after hg2 removal calculated according to the xps analysis are listed in table 1 the percentage of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 after hg2 removal calculated based on the fe 2p spectral region at 707 3 ev 0 79 was much less than that calculated using the s 2p spectral region at 163 8 and 162 6 ev 6 14 meanwhile the s 2p binding energy at approximately 162 0 ev corresponding to s2 in isolated hgs behra et al 2001 was hardly observed see fig 5f this suggests that the fe2 in fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may be substituted by hg2 because the introduced hg2 presented on the sulfureted fe2tio5 as a pyrite structure the s species in hgs still presented as s2 2 at 163 8 and 162 6 ev see fig 5f if the isomorphous substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 occurs on sulfureted fe2tio5 some fe2 cations are released to further demonstrate this isomorphous substitution the release of fe2 during hg2 removal was investigated fig 7 a and b the fe2 concentration rapidly increased to approximately 9 4 mg l 1 after the addition of sulfureted fe2tio5 to an nacl solution ph 2 0 for 5 min fig 7a which was mainly attributed to the dissolution of feso4 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 see table 1 then the fe2 concentration gradually increased to 16 8 mg l 1 in the next 175 min fig 7a fig 7a also demonstrates that little fe2 fe3 can be observed in the solution after the immersion of fe2tio5 in the nacl solution with a ph of 2 0 this suggests that the release of fe2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 in addition to the feso4 dissolution is mostly related to the acidic corrosion of fes2 behra et al 2001 after the introduction of hg2 the release of fe2 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably fig 7a this suggests that the acidic corrosion of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 2 0 may be restrained substantially by hg2 therefore isomorphous substitution could not be supported by the release of fe2 during hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 2 0 because the acidic corrosion of fes2 may be alleviated significantly with an increase in the ph value the release of fe2 during hg2 removal was then investigated at ph 4 0 fig 7b also indicates that the fe2 concentration rapidly increased to approximately 4 4 mg l 1 after the addition of sulfureted fe2tio5 to an nacl solution with ph 4 0 for 15 min due to the rapid dissolution of feso4 from the sulfureted fe2tio5 then the fe2 concentration gradually decreased to approximately 3 4 mg l 1 over the next 165 min this phenomenon may be attributed to the adsorption of fe2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 4 0 because the fe2 concentration did not gradually increase after the rapid dissolution of feso4 the acidic corrosion of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 may be approximately neglected at ph 4 0 fig 7b indicates that the fe2 concentration gradually increased at ph 4 0 after the rapid dissolution of feso4 in the presence of hg2 and the amount of fe2 released in the presence of hg2 was much larger than that in the absence of hg2 this demonstrates that some fe2 was released owing to hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 which supports the occurrence of isomorphous substitution of fe2 in the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 therefore the mechanism of hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 can be described as follows 1 h g 2 aq h g 2 ad 2 fe s 2 h g 2 ad f e 1 x hg s 2 x f e 2 reaction 1 is the adsorption of hg2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 and reaction 2 is the substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 adsorbed x is the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 ad to fe2 in reaction 2 4 2 kinetic analysis for hg2 removal according to reaction 2 the rates of hg2 removal and fe2 release i e δ 1 and δ 2 can be approximated as follows 3 δ 1 d h g 2 aq d t d h g 2 ad d t k h g 2 ad fe s 2 4 δ 2 d f e 2 d t x k h g 2 ad fe s 2 5 x δ 2 δ 1 where hg2 aq hg2 ad fe2 fes2 and k are the concentration of hg2 in the aqueous solution adsorbed concentration of hg2 concentration of fe2 in the aqueous solution amount of fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 and kinetic constant of reaction 2 respectively if hg2 aq is high enough to keep the surface of the sulfureted fe2tio5 saturated with the adsorbed hg2 the adsorption of hg2 rapidly reaches saturation and hg2 ad can be approximately regarded as a constant if fes2 is much more abundant than the amount of hg2 exchanged the decrease in fes2 during hg2 removal can be neglected this suggests that fes2 during the initial stage of hg2 removal can be regarded as a constant according to eqs 3 and 4 δ 1 and δ 2 can be regarded as constants in the initial stage therefore the concentrations of hg2 and fe2 in the aqueous solution at reaction time t i e hg2 aq t and fe2 aq t can be approximately expressed as 6 hg 2 aq t hg 2 aq 0 hg 2 ad δ 1 t 7 fe aq t feso 4 δ 2 t where feso4 is the amount of feso4 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 to obtain the kinetic parameters kinetic tests for hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 were performed at ph 2 0 and 4 0 fig 7c and d indicate that hg2 aq t decreased at an approximate constant speed after 15 min at both ph 2 0 and 4 0 which is consistent with eq 6 fig 7c and d were fitted using eq 6 and the kinetic parameters are listed in table 2 the kinetics of fe2 release during hg2 removal using sulfureted fe2tio5 was also fitted according to eq 7 because the acidic corrosion of fes2 simultaneously occurs during hg2 removal at ph 2 0 δ 2 at ph 2 0 in table 2 should be much larger than the actual value this suggests that the actual x at ph 2 0 should be much less than 0 70 and the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 to fe2 in reaction 2 was larger than 1 1 because fe2 in aqueous solution can adsorb on sulfureted fe2tio5 at ph 4 0 the kinetics of fe2 released due to the substitution of fe2 in fes2 by hg2 was fitted with the line calculated by subtracting the fe2 concentration without hg2 from that with hg2 see fig 7b as demonstrated in table 2 the x value at ph 4 is approximately 0 46 this suggests that the stoichiometric ratio of hg2 to fe2 in reaction 2 may be 2 1 and that one fe2 in fes2 can be substituted by two hg2 ions table 2 shows that hg2 ad increased considerably with the increase in the ph value from 2 0 to 4 0 this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 onto the sulfureted fe2tio5 i e reaction 1 was promoted with the increase in ph fig 8 demonstrates that approximately 91 of hg2 in the reaction solution at ph 2 4 was hgcl2 aq and approximately 8 was hgcl3 the electrostatic adsorption of hgcl3 onto sulfureted fe2tio5 was inhibited remarkably with the increase in the ph value because the surface positive charge for sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably fig 4d this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 onto sulfureted fe2tio5 was mainly attributed to the coordination adsorption due to the strong sulphophile affinity of hg2 meanwhile the promotion of hg2 adsorption onto fe2tio5 due to the sulfuration was mainly attributed to the promotion of the coordination adsorption due to the strong sulphophile affinity of hg2 although the electrostatic attraction of fe2tio5 to hgcl3 was enhanced remarkably after the sulfuration behra et al 2001 table 2 indicates that δ 1 decreased substantially with the increase in the ph value from 2 0 to 4 0 this suggests that the substitution of fe2 in the fes2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 i e reaction 2 was inhibited with the increase in ph therefore the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 4 0 was slightly less than that at ph 2 0 see fig 2 fes2 did not vary with the increase in ph while hg2 ad increased as suggested by eq 3 k at ph 4 0 was much less than that at ph 2 0 table 2 demonstrates that hg2 ad at ph 2 0 and 4 0 both decreased remarkably in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that cu2 zn2 and cd2 interfered with the coordination adsorption of hg2 on the sulfureted fe2tio5 significantly however δ 1 increased substantially in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that the substitution of fe2 in fes2 on sulfureted fe2tio5 by hg2 i e reaction 2 was promoted by the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 fes2 did not vary in the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 while hg2 ad decreased significantly as indicated in eq 3 k increased drastically with the presence of cu2 zn2 and cd2 this suggests that cu2 zn2 or cd2 may play the role of catalyst on reaction 2 4 3 application of sulfureted fe2tio5 in recovering hg2 from waste acids 4 3 1 performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 as a regenerable sorbent for hg2 removal the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited excellent performance and selectivity for hg2 removal figs 2 and 3 meanwhile it also demonstrated an excellent superparamagnetism with the saturation magnetizations of 29 9 emu g 1 fig 4c therefore the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution the recovery of the adsorbed hg and the regeneration of the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 were also investigated the hg adsorbed on sulfureted fe2tio5 was thermally desorbed fig 6 and the hg balance was analyzed see table 3 the amounts of hgt desorbed in n2 and air were approximately 92 7 and 96 7 of the amount of hg2 removed respectively this suggests that most of the hg2 adsorbed on the sulfureted fe2tio5 could be thermally desorbed with high concentrations of hg0 and hg2 hg0 accounted for approximately 93 of the hgt desorbed when thermal desorption was performed in n2 when the process was performed in air the percentage of hg0 decreased to approximately 82 and hg2 accounted for approximately 18 because an air atmosphere was readily available the thermal desorption of hg adsorbed on sulfureted fe2tio5 was performed in air at 400 c for 60 min to investigate the replicability of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal five cycles of hg2 removal thermal desorption of adsorbed hg and regeneration of the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 with re sulfuration were investigated fig 9 the hg2 removal efficiencies during the three cycles of hg2 removal at ph 2 0 were all nearly 100 and they gradually decreased to 98 2 and 95 1 for the 4th and 5th runs respectively see fig 9a this suggests that the performance of the sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal at ph 2 0 slightly degraded after multiple regenerations meanwhile the amount of fe2 leached during each run of hg2 removal was in the range of 125 144 mg l 1 see fig 9a suggesting that approximately 12 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 was lost during each cycle of hg2 removal at ph 2 0 only a small amount of fe2 leached approximately 14 mg l 1 was related to the exchange by hg2 and the remaining more than 100 mg l 1 resulted from the acidic corrosion of fes2 and dissolution of feso4 as the ph for hg2 removal was increased to 4 0 the acidic corrosion of fes2 was restrained considerably see fig 7a and b then the amount of fe2 leached during hg2 removal at ph 4 0 decreased to 52 58 mg l 1 see fig 9b suggesting that approximately 5 of the sulfureted fe2tio5 was leached during each cycle of hg2 removal at ph 4 0 as a result the degradation of the hg2 removal performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 after multiple regeneration cycles was significantly restrained at ph 4 0 and the hg2 removal efficiencies during the five cycles of hg2 removal were all nearly 100 therefore the ph value of the waste acids was preliminarily adjusted to ph 4 0 for hg2 removal to improve the lifetime of the sulfureted fe2tio5 although the characteristic peaks at 33 4 and 49 7 corresponding to hematite α fe2o3 jcpds 72 0469 appeared the characteristic peaks corresponding to spinel still predominated over the xrd pattern of sulfureted fe2tio5 after five cycles of hg2 recovery fig 4a the appeared α fe2o3 mainly resulted from the oxidation of fes2 on sulfureted fe2tio5 during the thermal desorption of hg although saturation magnetization of sulfureted fe2tio5 decreased remarkably to 9 5 emu g 1 after the five cycles of hg recovery due to the appearance of α fe2o3 it still exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism and can be easily magnetically separated from the aqueous solution see the inset in fig 4c 4 3 2 technology for hg recovery from waste acids in combination with existing hg control devices the ph value of the waste acids was first adjusted to ph 4 0 sulfureted fe2tio5 was then added to the waste acids to selectively remove hg2 after the hg2 was removed the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 containing hg was recovered using magnetic separation then the waste acids without hg2 were neutralized and other metal cations such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 were precipitated finally precipitation without hg can be further exploited to recover other metal resources such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 table 3 indicates that hg0 and hg2 accounted for approximately 82 and 18 of the total hg desorbed from the sulfureted fe2tio5 in air respectively although the total hg concentration in the desorption gas 400 mg m 3 was significantly higher than that in the smelting flue gas 40 mg m 3 the flow rate of the desorption gas was several orders of magnitude lower than that of the smelting flue gas therefore it was suggested that the desorption gas was introduced back into the smelting flue gas upstream of the scrubber see fig 1 then hgcl2 in the desorption gas was converted into hg2 in the waste acids which was removed again by sulfureted fe2tio5 meanwhile the hg0 in the desorption gas was recovered as liquid hg0 using the existing hg0 recovery unit in the smelters see fig 1 finally most hg2 in waste acids was recovered as liquid hg0 by sulfureted fe2tio5 for centralized control in combination with existing hg control devices in smelters 4 4 comparison of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 recovery with other sorbents table 4 compares the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal with those of other reported sorbents under acidic conditions except for modified mos2 jia et al 2018 and s rich hydrophilic polysulfides limjuco et al 2020 the performance of sulfureted fe2tio5 for hg2 removal including the adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate was much better than those of most reported sorbents including poly 1 vinylimidazole grafted fe3o4 sio2 shan et al 2015 2 mercaptobenzimidazole impregnated clay manohar et al 2002 modified puffed rice carbon fang et al 2020 modified activated carbon from sewage sludge zhang et al 2005 nonviable bacillus sp green ruiz 2006 cofe2o4 reduced graphene oxide zhang et al 2014 2 aminoethanethiol grafted porous organic polymer ravi et al 2017 eucalyptus bark ghodbane and hamdaoui 2008 and thiol modified fe3o4 sio2 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting heavy cations such as cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited furthermore the sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent superparamagnetism which benefited the solid liquid separation of the spent sorbent moreover hg2 removed by the sulfureted fe2tio5 can be thermally desorbed at ultrahigh concentrations of gaseous hg0 and hg2 which can then be recovered as liquid hg for centralized control in combination with existing hg control devices in smelters more importantly the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 can be regenerated for recycling without a notable degradation of its hg2 removal ability these suggest that hg2 in waste acids can be selectively recovered as liquid hg for centralized control by re generable sulfureted fe2tio5 then the recovery of other metal resources from sludge which resulted from the further neutralization of waste acids would be facile in the absence of hg2 5 conclusion in this work fes2 was coated on fe2tio5 due to the sulfuration with h2s to improve its performance for the selective removal of hg2 from waste acids sulfureted fe2tio5 exhibited an excellent ability for hg2 removal with the capacity of 292 317 mg g 1 and the rate of 49 5 57 6 mg g 1 h 1 at ph 2 4 meanwhile it exhibited an excellent selectivity for hg2 removal that not only the coexisting cu2 zn2 and cd2 can scarcely be adsorbed but also hg2 adsorption was hardly inhibited the mechanism and kinetic studies indicated that the fe2 in the fes2 coated on sulfureted fe2tio5 can be exchanged with hg2 adsorbed at a fe2 to hg2 mole ratio of 1 2 the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be recovered using magnetic separation due to its excellent superparamagnetism meanwhile most of the hg2 removed by sulfureted fe2tio5 can be enriched as ultra high concentrations of gaseous hg0 which can finally be recovered as liquid hg for centralized control in combination with existing hg0 recovery devices in smelters moreover the spent sulfureted fe2tio5 could be regenerated for duty cycle operations with re sulfuration without a remarkable degradation of the hg2 removal performance therefore hg2 recovery using sulfureted fe2tio5 may be a promising low cost and environmentally friendly technology for the centralized control of hg2 in waste acids discharged from smelters declaration of competing interest the authors declare the
