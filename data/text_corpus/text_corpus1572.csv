7860,study region the study region comprises 125 water gauges from 70 rivers covering the whole territory of poland study focus the air2stream model was used to reconstruct daily river water temperature rwt from 125 water gauges in 70 polish rivers for the period 1966 2020 55 years then the annual and seasonal warming trends of rwt and a biologically relevant metric the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c were evaluated new hydrological insights for the region the modelling results showed that the air2stream model performed well for rwt modeling the averaged root mean square error rmse values for the calibration and validation periods are 1 21 and 1 32 c and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for the two periods are 0 96 and 0 95 respectively annual averaged rwt of 121 gauges 96 8 of the 125 gauges showed clear warming trend in the past 55 years with the warming rate ranging between 0 08 and 0 44 c decade average 0 25 c decade the warming trends of river waters on the main rivers and their tributaries are spatially differentiated seasonal rwt trends showed that summer is warming fastest followed by spring and then by autumn and winter long term increases in rwt were typically correlated with increases in air temperatures for the three large rivers vistula odra and warta the biologically relevant metric the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c increased synchronously with the warming of rwt the results reported in this study will be useful to stakeholders and the reconstructed dataset will be useful to the community for the further study of river thermal dynamics and aquatic habitats in poland graphical abstract ga1 keywords river water temperature reconstruction climate change trends analysis air2stream poland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water temperature is one of the most important indicators of river ecosystem as it impacts many physical and biochemical processes within rivers poole and berman 2001 caissie 2006 and the survival of aquatic organisms trépanier et al 1996 dugdale et al 2018 armstrong et al 2021 in an era of climate change dataset of river water temperature rwt can be particularly important as water temperature is one of the most direct indicators of climate change on river ecosystem in this regard it is of great importance to have a good knowledge of rwt dynamics especially considering its continuity completeness and time horizon river water temperature has been routinely observed for a long period of time as basic dataset however in many parts of the world this dataset is not readily available some river gauges have large number of missing values while some of them only have rwt data in a short time period to get continuous and complete long term rwt dataset reconstruction was often conducted by using mathematical models e g prats et al 2007 sohrabi et al 2017 tavares et al 2020 sojka and ptak 2022 these mathematical models can generally be divided into three types 1 process based physical models e g caissie et al 2005 van vliet et al 2013 macdonald et al 2014 li et al 2015 dugdale et al 2017 2 statistical models e g st hilaire et al 2012 deweber and wagner 2014 caldwell et al 2015 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 2019 zhu and piotrowski 2020 feigl et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 and 3 hybrid models e g toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 jia et al 2021 among these models process based physical models are generally complex and need a lot of inputs to drive them e g bathymetry inflow outflow a complete set of meteorological variables which might not be available in many parts of the world statistical models are developed based on the relation between rwt and the other impacting factors which are simpler however they have no physical meanings in general hybrid models e g air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz et al 2016 physics guided deep learning models jia et al 2021 can balance model complexity and accuracy which have physical meanings as well these characteristics promote their applications in the modelling of rwt and a typical example is the air2stream model since its first release it has been well justified for the modelling of rwt e g toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 cai et al 2018 graf et al 2019 islam et al 2019 tavares et al 2020 piotrowski et al 2021 yang et al 2022 the area of poland is drained mainly by the vistula and odra rivers flowing into the baltic sea the basins of which cover almost 90 of the country s area 31 1895 km2 in total 99 7 of the territory of poland belongs to the baltic sea catchment the relatively large diversity of environmental and landscape conditions in poland translates into the nature of the rivers among which there are different types of rivers lowland dominant in the area mountainous characteristic for the southern part of poland the carpathian and sudetes mountains lake districts northern poland and coastal rivers the baltic coast some previous studies tried to reconstruct rwt for a short time period in some typical river gauges for example sojka and ptak 2022 used statistical models to reconstruct monthly rwt in the period 1987 2020 for 10 river gauges some studies employed the available datasets incomplete data series to detect patterns of changes in rwt for example graf and wrzesiński 2020 analyzed daily water temperature of 53 rivers recorded at 94 water gauges for the period 1971 2015 marszelewski and pius 2016 evaluated the course of changes of thermal regime for 14 rivers in poland over the period 1961 2010 however to the best of our knowledge there lacks a national scale study in the reconstruction of rwt over the poland which can then be used to evaluate the long term annual and seasonal trends of rwt in this study daily observed rwt data from 125 water gauges in 70 rivers and daily observed air temperature ta data from 34 nearby meteorological stations were used for this purpose the widely used air2stream model was selected as the modeling tool for rwt reconstruction since daily observed data of air temperature in majority of meteorological stations can date back to 1960 s we defined the study period as 1966 2020 after finishing rwt reconstruction we then use the dataset to analyze the annual and seasonal trends of rwt calculate an important biologically relevant metric the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area the available data and model and methods used section 2 introduces and discusses the results the primary conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the location of poland in the zone of the transitional temperate climate of central europe means that the climate has intermediate features between the maritime and continental climates increasing continentalism to the east and various air masses collide over the territory influencing the development of weather conditions the most common air masses are polar marine from the north atlantic ocean polar continental from eastern europe and asia arctic from the arctic sea subtropical marine from the azores and subtropical continental from africa the variety of air masses affects the variability of the weather and large fluctuations in the course of the seasons in subsequent years the average annual air temperature ranges from about 5 c suwałki in the east of the country no 26 in fig 1 to over 7 2 c around wrocław in south western poland no 32 in fig 1 depending on the geographic and climatic region the average annual air temperature ranges in summer between 14 c and 18 2 c and in winter between 0 7 c baltic coast no 16 and below 3 2 c suwałki no 26 rivers in poland can be divided into 5 groups based on the river thermal seasons very cold 0 0 1 0 c cold 1 1 4 0 c moderate 4 1 10 0 c warm 10 1 15 0 c and very warm 15 1 20 0 c marszelewski et al 2022 the highest average annual water temperatures 1971 2015 were found in the rivers of central and north western poland 10 c while the lowest water temperatures below 8 0 c can be found in southern poland in the mountain tributaries of the vistula and odra rivers graf and wrzesiński 2019 the studied 70 rivers with 125 river gauges and the nearby 34 meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 the detailed information about these river gauges and meteorological stations are summarized in table s1 for all the meteorological stations daily data from 1966 to 2020 is available czernecki et al 2020 https meteo imgw pl for most of the river gauges daily rwt is available from 1984 to 2014 see table s1 for details some gauges may have missing values in this time period and several gauges have daily rwt till 2020 the data used in this study comes from databases provided by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imwm nri warsaw poland 2 2 air2stream model the air2stream model is a lumped model based on energy balance which relates daily rwt with daily air temperature and flow discharge there are many model versions such as versions with 4 parameters 5 parameters 7 parameters and 8 parameters these model parameters can be estimated using the particle swarm optimization algorithm more detailed information about this model can be found in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz et al 2016 typically piccolroaz et al 2016 compared the performance of different model versions using data of 38 swiss rivers and found that the model versions with less parameters have good performances as well in this study considering that daily flow discharges of many river gauges are not available the model version with 5 parameters 5 para was used eq 1 which assumed that the effect of the discharge can be approximately retained using only a constant dimensionless discharge value 1 0 in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 to evaluate model performance two widely used metrics including the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were adopted graf et al 2019 1 d t w d t a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 4 cos 2 π t t y a 5 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n t w t m 2 3 n s e 1 i 1 n t w t m 2 i 1 n t w t w a v 2 where t w is daily observed rwt c t a is daily air temperature c t m is the modelled rwt c t wav is the average value of t w a 1 a 5 are model parameters that need to be determined during model calibration and validation t is time in days t y is the duration of one year 365 in general for most of the river gauges daily data from 1984 to 2004 was used for model calibration and daily data from 2005 to 2014 was used for model validation when the model parameters were determined from model calibration and validation the forward module with fixed model parameters was used to model the daily rwt in the other time period then complete daily rwt data can be produced for the whole period 1966 2020 finally annual and seasonal trends were analyzed based on the reconstructed dataset 2 3 rescaled adjusted partial sums raps method to detect and quantify the trends and fluctuations in annual rwt the widely used rescaled adjusted partial sums raps method garbrecht and fernandez 1994 bonacci et al 2008 bonacci and oskoruš 2010 was adopted in this study the raps method can highlight trends shifts data clustering irregular fluctuations and periodicities in the time series which can be defined by the following equation 4 r a p s i n 1 i t w t a v s t where t av is the mean value of the rwt time series s t is the standard deviation t w is the rwt value 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance for the modeling of daily river water temperature model performances rmse and nse values during the calibration and validation periods for all the river gauges are shown in fig 2 the detailed information for each gauge is summarized in table s2 fig 3 shows the mean median minimum and maximum and 25th and 75th percentiles of the rmse and nse values as seen the model performed generally well for both the calibration and validation periods the averaged rmse values for the calibration and validation periods are 1 21 and 1 32 c respectively and the 75th percentile is around 1 50 c fig 3 as for nse values the averaged values for the calibration and validation periods are 0 96 and 0 95 respectively and the 75th percentile is around 0 98 fig 3 for most of the river gauges the model performed better than that reported in sojka and ptak 2022 using statistical models average rmse 1 50 c for 10 hydrological river gauges in poland the model performance is better or at least comparable than previous studies for rwt modelling e g rmse 2 38 c in morrill et al 2005 rmse 1 57 c in st hilaire et al 2012 rmse 1 90 c in deweber and wagner 2014 rmse 1 83 c in tavares et al 2020 the general good model performance also indicated that using air temperature as the sole model input is generally acceptable for rwt modeling which has been reported in many previous studies as well e g morrill et al 2005 piccolroaz et al 2016 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 2019 sojka and ptak 2022 3 2 long term trends of rwt over the poland 3 2 1 annual trend among the 125 river gauges annual averaged rwt of 121 gauges 96 8 showed clear warming trend following the warming of annual averaged ta p 0 05 with t test fig 4 the details can be found in table s3 the warming rate of annual averaged rwt varied between 0 08 no 89 and 0 44 no 76 c decade with an average value of 0 25 c decade p 0 05 with t test as a comparison the warming rate of annual averaged ta varied between 0 29 no 10 and 0 48 no 32 c decade with an average value of 0 37 c decade p 0 05 with t test the results are comparable with the previous studies in poland for example results of sojka and ptak 2022 indicated that the course of mean annual rwt for 10 hydrological gauges in the years 1987 2020 showed a statistically significant increase from 0 18 to 0 49 c decade marszelewski and pius 2016 found that annual average temperature of fluvial waters in the central european plain poland showed a positive trend ranging from 0 17 to 0 27 c decade the results are also comparable with the other studies in europe for example orr et al 2015 found that during the 17 year period 1990 2006 annual mean rwt increased by 0 3 c per decade on average for rivers in england and wales the results of arora et al 2016 showed that annual mean rwt increased by 0 3 c per decade on average during 1985 2010 for seven river basins of germany fig 5 presented the ratio of warming rate of rwt and ta for most of the gauges 118 out of 121 the ratio is below 1 0 indicating that rwt warms slower than ta for most of the gauges the results are generally consistent with previous studies e g park et al 2017 worrall et al 2022 for example the results of park et al 2017 showed that rwt 0 16 c decade increased slower than ta 0 45 c decade over the period of 1979 2013 in the arctic terrestrial rivers the results of worrall et al 2022 showed that uk rivers are not warming faster than the local air temperature however in this study for three gauges no 76 93 122 the ratio is above 1 0 indicating that rwt warms faster than ta for these three gauges these three gauges are characterized by a low hydrological inertia and therefore a significant amplitude of flow variability due to the high heat capacity of the water and the high flow velocity of these rivers the heat loss will be lower than the flow rate which may contribute to maintaining a higher temperature in relation to the warming surrounding environment the biotic conditions of mountain rivers including the small depth of the rivers may cause their water temperature to be more susceptible to atmospheric heat fluxes and consequently a stronger relationship with the air temperature than in the case of lowland rivers o driscoll and dewalle 2006 łaszewski 2020 on the other hand the wąska river no 122 drains to the iława lake district i e a young glacial area with numerous lakes in its course it flows through several dam reservoirs e g lake okonie lake zimnochy which given the small length of the river may affect the speed of water heating for four gauges no 70 71 72 and 74 with the impact of strong anthropogenic activities annual averaged rwt showed no warming trend during the period 1966 2020 to detect and quantify the trends and fluctuations in annual rwt for these four gauges the raps values are calculated and shown in fig 6 as seen the annual rwt time series have sharp shifts during 1995 and 1996 fig 7 showed the temporal variation of annual averaged river water temperature of the four river gauges during the two sub periods it can be seen that clear warming trend can be found for all the four river gauges during the sub period 1966 1995 1996 the thermal regime sharply shifted during 1995 1996 after which a clear warming trend can also be found in three of the four river gauges some of the rivers in poland are outside the common patterns of the thermal regime which were established on the basis of many years of research on water temperature changes taking into account the influence of air temperature and large scale atmospheric circulation marszelewski and pius 2016 2021 graf and wrzesiński 2019 2020 wrzesiński and graf 2022 these include rivers under the influence of human pressure and economic use using rivers for industrial and economic purposes they mainly act as receivers of domestic and industrial wastewaters and mine water from the drainage of hard coal mines upper silesia an example is the przemsza river no 70 71 which was under the influence of human economic activity for many years it acted as a receiver of mine water discharged from the mine area in upper silesia the economic functions of przemsza were confirmed by the results of research conducted by matysik 2018 and marszelewski and pius 2021 in subsequent studies marszelewski and pius 2021 confirmed that przemsza underwent thermal renaturation in the post industrial era meaning the period after the cessation of hard coal deposits in most mines in upper silesia in the przemsza river unnaturally high water temperatures in the industrial era practically from the beginning of the 1960 s have been documented an intensive increase in water temperature was recorded in przemsza from the end of the 1980 s to 1995 from 1995 there was an intense decrease in water temperature in the river according to marszelewski and pius 2021 this is the effect of the so called thermal renaturation by improving the water and sewage management in the przemsza river catchment and in particular the reduction of mine water discharge as a result of the closure of mines 3 2 2 seasonal trend in this section seasonal trends of rwt spring mar may summer jun aug autumn sep nov winter dec feb were analyzed the detailed results are summarized in table s3 for the spring season 97 out of 125 river gauges 77 6 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt varied between 0 14 and 0 47 c decade with an average value of 0 28 c decade fig 8a this is consistent with the warming of ta during the spring season as in this season all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 23 0 45 c decade average 0 35 c decade during summer 114 out of 125 river gauges 91 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt ranged from 0 16 to 0 68 c decade with an average value of 0 34 c decade this is also consistent with the warming of ta during the summer period as in this season all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 30 0 61 c decade average 0 46 c decade see fig 8b in the autumn season 94 out of 125 river gauges 75 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt ranged from 0 12 to 0 50 c decade with an average value of 0 24 c decade fig 8c in this season ta of all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 20 0 35 c decade average 0 26 c decade for the winter season 109 out of 125 river gauges 87 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt varied between 0 11 and 0 44 c decade with an average value of 0 24 c decade fig 8d in this season ta of 27 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 29 0 60 c decade average 0 44 c decade from the average values for all the river gauges it can be found that the warming rate shows the following pattern summer is warming fastest followed by spring and then by autumn and winter fig 8 this is generally in consistent with the pattern for each river gauge see table s3 for details and an example of four river gauges is shown in fig 9 confirming the findings in previous studies e g isaak et al 2012 sojka and ptak 2022 for all the four river gauges the ratio of warming rate of rwt and ta of majorities of river gauges is below 1 0 spring 83 5 summer 87 7 autumn 67 0 winter 96 9 indicating that rwt warms slower than ta for all the seasons for most of the river gauges warming of rwt in different seasons may cause deadly consequences as water temperature greatly impacts aquatic system studies have shown that warming water will impact the living of cold water species and other organisms e g null et al 2013 devlin et al 2022 for example the study results in null et al 2013 indicated that warming of rwt will impact cold water habitat devlin et al 2022 found that winter warming negatively impacts survival of antarctica s only endemic insect the clear warming trends of different seasons in poland will inevitably cause negative impacts to the aquatic system and mitigation measures need to be implemented to reduce this effect such as the use of the shading of riparian vegetations to mitigate the impact of warming air temperature on rwt 3 3 water temperature trends on the main river and its tributaries on the odra river there are two zones with a clear trend of water warming in the middle course no 2 and 3 and the lower course no 7 and 8 where the warming rate is about 0 30 c decade compared to other water gauges on which a rate of water temperature warming below 0 20 c decade was recorded fig 10 the increase in water warming of the odra river is observed when the oława tributary is accepted for which the annual trend of water warming of 0 35 c decade has been demonstrated oława apart from its source section flows through urbanized and industrialized areas oława flows into the odra river in the city of wrocław hence its lower section due to the economic use of the river e g energy purposes water intakes sewage disposal has been transformed several times on the remaining section of the odra river up to the warta entrance point no 27 32 only barycz no 20 showed a trend of water warming above 0 28 c decade the warta river as the largest tributary of the odra river is characterized by high warming trends throughout the entire section of the course within 0 27 0 30 c decade with the exception of the upper section represented by the bóbr water gauge no 27 with a trend below 0 14 c decade the warta water region is characterized by diversified anthropopressure which is the result of the influence of various forms of economic activity on the state of water resources including land use hydrotechnical constructions sewage discharges as well as collection of surface and ground waters rzgw 2007 ilnicki et al 2015 graf et al 2018 on the warta river below sieradz no 28 there is a large jeziorsko reservoir with a dam area 42 3 km2 which was built in 1986 the reservoir is mainly used for energy and agricultural purposes the section of the middle course of the warta is subject to the strongest resultant anthropogenic pressure rzgw 2007 which is related to the exploitation activity of the lignite mine in the vicinity of konin and turek and the impact of the poznań agglomeration no 29 and 30 the manifestation of mining activities that have an impact on changes in the thermal regime of river waters in this part of the warta catchment area are inter alia changes in the characteristics of the hydrological regime accumulation of mine water in retention reservoirs as well as exploitation water intake and discharge of pollutants which leads to changes in water quality rzgw 2007 within the poznań agglomeration poznań water gauge no 30 anthropogenic pressure manifests itself mainly through the specificity of land use and as a result an increase in the urbanization index above 50 60 graf 2015 and large domestic sewage discharges the lower section of the river is characterized by a moderate resultant anthropogenic pressure no 31 and 32 the greatest pressure in this part of the warta valley is exerted by hydrotechnical buildings the main task of which is to regulate the flow and minimize the effects of flooding the impact of land use changes in gorzów wielkopolski is also significant no 32 with a trend of 0 29 c decade the odra river after taking the warta river from the gozdowice water gauge no 7 shows significantly higher trends in annual warming of waters approx 0 30 c decade which can be associated with the influence of the warta waters with increased temperature and the influence of local factors related to the use of the valley downstream of the odra river 3 4 biologically relevant metric in this section we calculated one of the most important biologically relevant metrics namely the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c d20 bartholow 2005 the 20 c threshold in this metric was chosen as representative of acute high temperatures for aquatic species e g salmonids as many river gauges have water temperatures lower than 20 c in the summer period we then focused on three large rivers with higher rwt in poland namely odra river gauge number 1 8 warta river gauge number 27 32 and vistula river gauge number 57 68 details about these three rivers can be found in table s1 the results showed that for all the river gauges of the three rivers d20 increased significantly p 0 05 with t test fig 11 for the 8 river gauges in the odra river d20 increased from 5 6 to 11 0 days decade average 7 7 days decade for the 6 river gauges in the warta river d20 increased from 2 2 to 8 0 days decade average 5 9 days decade for the 12 river gauges in the vistula river d20 increased from 3 0 to 11 9 days decade average 6 9 days decade the results indicated that with the warming of rwt for these river gauges see table s3 for details d20 increased synchronously which might lead to catastrophic consequences to aquatic habitats as indicated in bartholow 2005 4 conclusions in this study daily observed rwt data from 125 river gauges in 70 rivers and daily observed ta data from 34 nearby meteorological stations were used to reconstruct the long term rwt time series in the past 55 years 1966 2020 and then investigate the long term changing trend of rwt the results lead to the following conclusions 1 the air2stream model performed well with the averaged rmse values for the calibration and validation periods are 1 21 and 1 32 c and the nse values for the two periods are 0 96 and 0 95 respectively 2 annual averaged rwt of 121 river gauges 96 8 showed clear warming trend with the warming rate ranging between 0 08 and 0 44 c decade average 0 25 c decade 3 the warming trends of river waters on the main rivers and their tributaries are spatially differentiated 4 the seasonal rwt trends showed that summer is warming fastest followed by spring and then by autumn and winter 5 long term increases in rwt were typically correlated with increases in air temperatures 6 for the three large rivers vistula odra and warta d20 increased synchronously with the warming of rwt the clear warming trends of annual and seasonal rwt and the increase of d20 in poland will inevitably cause negative impacts to the aquatic system and mitigation measures need to be implemented to reduce the negative effects the results reported in this study

other impacting factors which are simpler however they have no physical meanings in general hybrid models e g air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz et al 2016 physics guided deep learning models jia et al 2021 can balance model complexity and accuracy which have physical meanings as well these characteristics promote their applications in the modelling of rwt and a typical example is the air2stream model since its first release it has been well justified for the modelling of rwt e g toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 cai et al 2018 graf et al 2019 islam et al 2019 tavares et al 2020 piotrowski et al 2021 yang et al 2022 the area of poland is drained mainly by the vistula and odra rivers flowing into the baltic sea the basins of which cover almost 90 of the country s area 31 1895 km2 in total 99 7 of the territory of poland belongs to the baltic sea catchment the relatively large diversity of environmental and landscape conditions in poland translates into the nature of the rivers among which there are different types of rivers lowland dominant in the area mountainous characteristic for the southern part of poland the carpathian and sudetes mountains lake districts northern poland and coastal rivers the baltic coast some previous studies tried to reconstruct rwt for a short time period in some typical river gauges for example sojka and ptak 2022 used statistical models to reconstruct monthly rwt in the period 1987 2020 for 10 river gauges some studies employed the available datasets incomplete data series to detect patterns of changes in rwt for example graf and wrzesiński 2020 analyzed daily water temperature of 53 rivers recorded at 94 water gauges for the period 1971 2015 marszelewski and pius 2016 evaluated the course of changes of thermal regime for 14 rivers in poland over the period 1961 2010 however to the best of our knowledge there lacks a national scale study in the reconstruction of rwt over the poland which can then be used to evaluate the long term annual and seasonal trends of rwt in this study daily observed rwt data from 125 water gauges in 70 rivers and daily observed air temperature ta data from 34 nearby meteorological stations were used for this purpose the widely used air2stream model was selected as the modeling tool for rwt reconstruction since daily observed data of air temperature in majority of meteorological stations can date back to 1960 s we defined the study period as 1966 2020 after finishing rwt reconstruction we then use the dataset to analyze the annual and seasonal trends of rwt calculate an important biologically relevant metric the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area the available data and model and methods used section 2 introduces and discusses the results the primary conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the location of poland in the zone of the transitional temperate climate of central europe means that the climate has intermediate features between the maritime and continental climates increasing continentalism to the east and various air masses collide over the territory influencing the development of weather conditions the most common air masses are polar marine from the north atlantic ocean polar continental from eastern europe and asia arctic from the arctic sea subtropical marine from the azores and subtropical continental from africa the variety of air masses affects the variability of the weather and large fluctuations in the course of the seasons in subsequent years the average annual air temperature ranges from about 5 c suwałki in the east of the country no 26 in fig 1 to over 7 2 c around wrocław in south western poland no 32 in fig 1 depending on the geographic and climatic region the average annual air temperature ranges in summer between 14 c and 18 2 c and in winter between 0 7 c baltic coast no 16 and below 3 2 c suwałki no 26 rivers in poland can be divided into 5 groups based on the river thermal seasons very cold 0 0 1 0 c cold 1 1 4 0 c moderate 4 1 10 0 c warm 10 1 15 0 c and very warm 15 1 20 0 c marszelewski et al 2022 the highest average annual water temperatures 1971 2015 were found in the rivers of central and north western poland 10 c while the lowest water temperatures below 8 0 c can be found in southern poland in the mountain tributaries of the vistula and odra rivers graf and wrzesiński 2019 the studied 70 rivers with 125 river gauges and the nearby 34 meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 the detailed information about these river gauges and meteorological stations are summarized in table s1 for all the meteorological stations daily data from 1966 to 2020 is available czernecki et al 2020 https meteo imgw pl for most of the river gauges daily rwt is available from 1984 to 2014 see table s1 for details some gauges may have missing values in this time period and several gauges have daily rwt till 2020 the data used in this study comes from databases provided by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imwm nri warsaw poland 2 2 air2stream model the air2stream model is a lumped model based on energy balance which relates daily rwt with daily air temperature and flow discharge there are many model versions such as versions with 4 parameters 5 parameters 7 parameters and 8 parameters these model parameters can be estimated using the particle swarm optimization algorithm more detailed information about this model can be found in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz et al 2016 typically piccolroaz et al 2016 compared the performance of different model versions using data of 38 swiss rivers and found that the model versions with less parameters have good performances as well in this study considering that daily flow discharges of many river gauges are not available the model version with 5 parameters 5 para was used eq 1 which assumed that the effect of the discharge can be approximately retained using only a constant dimensionless discharge value 1 0 in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 to evaluate model performance two widely used metrics including the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were adopted graf et al 2019 1 d t w d t a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 4 cos 2 π t t y a 5 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n t w t m 2 3 n s e 1 i 1 n t w t m 2 i 1 n t w t w a v 2 where t w is daily

validation t is time in days t y is the duration of one year 365 in general for most of the river gauges daily data from 1984 to 2004 was used for model calibration and daily data from 2005 to 2014 was used for model validation when the model parameters were determined from model calibration and validation the forward module with fixed model parameters was used to model the daily rwt in the other time period then complete daily rwt data can be produced for the whole period 1966 2020 finally annual and seasonal trends were analyzed based on the reconstructed dataset 2 3 rescaled adjusted partial sums raps method to detect and quantify the trends and fluctuations in annual rwt the widely used rescaled adjusted partial sums raps method garbrecht and fernandez 1994 bonacci et al 2008 bonacci and oskoruš 2010 was adopted in this study the raps method can highlight trends shifts data clustering irregular fluctuations and periodicities in the time series which can be defined by the following equation 4 r a p s i n 1 i t w t a v s t where t av is the mean value of the rwt time series s t is the standard deviation t w is the rwt value 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance for the modeling of daily river water temperature model performances rmse and nse values during the calibration and validation periods for all the river gauges are shown in fig 2 the detailed information for each gauge is summarized in table s2 fig 3 shows the mean median minimum and maximum and 25th and 75th percentiles of the rmse and nse values as seen the model performed generally well for both the calibration and validation periods the averaged rmse values for the calibration and validation periods are 1 21 and 1 32 c respectively and the 75th percentile is around 1 50 c fig 3 as for nse values the averaged values for the calibration and validation periods are 0 96 and 0 95 respectively and the 75th percentile is around 0 98 fig 3 for most of the river gauges the model performed better than that reported in sojka and ptak 2022 using statistical models average rmse 1 50 c for 10 hydrological river gauges in poland the model performance is better or at least comparable than previous studies for rwt modelling e g rmse 2 38 c in morrill et al 2005 rmse 1 57 c in st hilaire et al 2012 rmse 1 90 c in deweber and wagner 2014 rmse 1 83 c in tavares et al 2020 the general good model performance also indicated that using air temperature as the sole model input is generally acceptable for rwt modeling which has been reported in many previous studies as well e g morrill et al 2005 piccolroaz et al 2016 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 2019 sojka and ptak 2022 3 2 long term trends of rwt over the poland 3 2 1 annual trend among the 125 river gauges annual averaged rwt of 121 gauges 96 8 showed clear warming trend following the warming of annual averaged ta p 0 05 with t test fig 4 the details can be found in table s3 the warming rate of annual averaged rwt varied between 0 08 no 89 and 0 44 no 76 c decade with an average value of 0 25 c decade p 0 05 with t test as a comparison the warming rate of annual averaged ta varied between 0 29 no 10 and 0 48 no 32 c decade with an average value of 0 37 c decade p 0 05 with t test the results are comparable with the previous studies in poland for example results of sojka and ptak 2022 indicated that the course of mean annual rwt for 10 hydrological gauges in the years 1987 2020 showed a statistically significant increase from 0 18 to 0 49 c decade marszelewski and pius 2016 found that annual average temperature of fluvial waters in the central european plain poland showed a positive trend ranging from 0 17 to 0 27 c decade the results are also comparable with the other studies in europe for example orr et al 2015 found that during the 17 year period 1990 2006 annual mean rwt increased by 0 3 c per decade on average for rivers in england and wales the results of arora et al 2016 showed that annual mean rwt increased by 0 3 c per decade on average during 1985 2010 for seven river basins of germany fig 5 presented the ratio of warming rate of rwt and ta for most of the gauges 118 out of 121 the ratio is below 1 0 indicating that rwt warms slower than ta for most of the gauges the results are generally consistent with previous studies e g park et al 2017 worrall et al 2022 for example the results of park et al 2017 showed that rwt 0 16 c decade increased slower than ta 0 45 c decade over the period of 1979 2013 in the arctic terrestrial rivers the results of worrall et al 2022 showed that uk rivers are not warming faster than the local air temperature however in this study for three gauges no 76 93 122 the ratio is above 1 0 indicating that rwt warms faster than ta for these three gauges these three gauges are characterized by a low hydrological inertia and therefore a significant amplitude of flow variability due to the high heat capacity of the water and the high flow velocity of these rivers the heat loss will be lower than the flow rate which may contribute to maintaining a higher temperature in relation to the warming surrounding environment the biotic conditions of mountain rivers including the small depth of the rivers may cause their water temperature to be more susceptible to atmospheric heat fluxes and consequently a stronger relationship with the air temperature than in the case of lowland rivers o driscoll and dewalle 2006 łaszewski 2020 on the other hand the wąska river no 122 drains to the iława lake district i e a young glacial area with numerous lakes in its course it flows through several dam reservoirs e g lake okonie lake zimnochy which given the small length of the river may affect the speed of water heating for four gauges no 70 71 72 and 74 with the impact of strong anthropogenic activities annual averaged rwt showed no warming trend during the period 1966 2020 to detect and quantify the trends and fluctuations in annual rwt for these four gauges the raps values are calculated and shown in fig 6 as seen the annual rwt time series have sharp shifts during 1995 and 1996 fig 7 showed the temporal variation of annual averaged river water temperature of the four river gauges during the two sub periods it can be seen that clear warming trend can be found for all the four river gauges during the sub period 1966 1995 1996 the thermal regime sharply shifted during 1995 1996 after which a clear warming trend can also be found in three of the four river gauges some of the rivers in poland are outside the common patterns of the thermal regime which were established on the basis of many years of research on water temperature changes taking into account the influence of air temperature and large scale atmospheric circulation marszelewski and pius 2016 2021 graf and wrzesiński 2019 2020 wrzesiński and graf 2022 these include rivers under the influence of human pressure and economic use using rivers for industrial and economic purposes they mainly act as receivers of domestic and industrial wastewaters and mine water from the drainage of hard coal mines upper silesia an example is the przemsza river no 70 71 which was under the influence of human economic activity for many years it acted as a receiver of mine water discharged from the mine area in upper silesia the economic functions of przemsza were confirmed by the results of research conducted by matysik 2018 and marszelewski and pius 2021 in subsequent studies marszelewski and pius 2021 confirmed that przemsza underwent thermal renaturation in the post industrial era meaning the period after the cessation of hard coal deposits in most mines in upper silesia in the przemsza river unnaturally high water temperatures in the industrial era practically from the beginning of the 1960 s have been documented an intensive increase in water temperature was recorded in przemsza from the end of the 1980 s to 1995 from 1995 there was an intense decrease in water temperature in the river according to marszelewski and pius 2021 this is the effect of the so called thermal renaturation by improving the water and sewage management in the przemsza river catchment and in particular the reduction of mine water discharge as a result of the closure of mines 3 2 2 seasonal trend in this section seasonal trends of rwt spring mar may summer jun aug autumn sep nov winter dec feb were analyzed the detailed results are summarized in table s3 for the spring season 97 out of 125 river gauges 77 6 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt varied between 0 14 and 0 47 c decade with an average value of 0 28 c decade fig 8a this is consistent with the warming of ta during the spring season as in this season all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 23 0 45 c decade average 0 35 c decade during summer 114 out of 125 river gauges 91 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt ranged from 0 16 to 0 68 c decade with an average value of 0 34 c decade this is also consistent with the warming of ta during the summer period as in this season all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 30 0 61 c decade average 0 46 c decade see fig 8b in the autumn season 94 out of 125 river gauges 75 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt ranged from 0 12 to 0 50 c decade with an average value of 0 24 c decade fig 8c in this season ta of all the 34 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 20 0 35 c decade average 0 26 c decade for the winter season 109 out of 125 river gauges 87 2 showed clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test and the warming rate of rwt varied between 0 11 and 0 44 c decade with an average value of 0 24 c decade fig 8d in this season ta of 27 meteorological stations presented clear warming trend p 0 05 with t test range 0 29 0 60 c decade average 0 44 c decade from the average values for all the river gauges it can be found that the warming rate shows the following pattern summer is warming fastest followed by spring and then by autumn and winter fig 8 this is generally in consistent with the pattern for each river gauge see table s3 for details and an example of four river gauges is shown in fig 9 confirming the findings in previous studies e g isaak et al 2012 sojka and ptak 2022 for all the four river gauges the ratio of warming rate of rwt and ta of majorities of river gauges is below 1 0 spring 83 5 summer 87 7 autumn 67 0 winter 96 9 indicating that rwt warms slower than ta for all the seasons for most of the river gauges warming of rwt in different seasons may cause deadly consequences as water temperature greatly impacts aquatic system studies have shown that warming water will impact the living of cold water species and other organisms e g null et al 2013 devlin et al 2022 for example the study results in null et al 2013 indicated that warming of rwt will impact cold water habitat devlin et al 2022 found that winter warming negatively impacts survival of antarctica s only endemic insect the clear warming trends of different seasons in poland will inevitably cause negative impacts to the aquatic system and mitigation measures need to be implemented to reduce this effect such as the use of the shading of riparian vegetations to mitigate the impact of warming air temperature on rwt 3 3 water temperature trends on the main river and its tributaries on the odra river there are two zones with a clear trend of water warming in the middle course no 2 and 3 and the lower course no 7 and 8 where the warming rate is about 0 30 c decade compared to other water gauges on which a rate of water temperature warming below 0 20 c decade was recorded fig 10 the increase in water warming of the odra river is observed when the oława tributary is accepted for which the annual trend of water warming of 0 35 c decade has been demonstrated oława apart from its source section flows through urbanized and industrialized areas oława flows into the odra river in the city of wrocław hence its lower section due to the economic use of the river e g energy purposes water intakes sewage disposal has been transformed several times on the remaining section of the odra river up to the warta entrance point no 27 32 only barycz no 20 showed a trend of water warming above 0 28 c decade the warta river as the largest tributary of the odra river is characterized by high warming trends throughout the entire section of the course within 0 27 0 30 c decade with the exception of the upper section represented by the bóbr water gauge no 27 with a trend below 0 14 c decade the warta water region is characterized by diversified anthropopressure which is the result of the influence of various forms of economic activity on the state of water resources including land use hydrotechnical constructions sewage discharges as well as collection of surface and ground waters rzgw 2007 ilnicki et al 2015 graf et al 2018 on the warta river below sieradz no 28 there is a large jeziorsko reservoir with a dam area 42 3 km2 which was built in 1986 the reservoir is mainly used for energy and agricultural purposes the section of the middle course of the warta is subject to the strongest resultant anthropogenic pressure rzgw 2007 which is related to the exploitation activity of the lignite mine in the vicinity of konin and turek and the impact of the poznań agglomeration no 29 and 30 the manifestation of mining activities that have an impact on changes in the thermal regime of river waters in this part of the warta catchment area are inter alia changes in the characteristics of the hydrological regime accumulation of mine water in retention reservoirs as well as exploitation water intake and discharge of pollutants which leads to changes in water quality rzgw 2007 within the poznań agglomeration poznań water gauge no 30 anthropogenic pressure manifests itself mainly through the specificity of land use and as a result an increase in the urbanization index above 50 60 graf 2015 and large domestic sewage discharges the lower section of the river is characterized by a moderate resultant anthropogenic pressure no 31 and 32 the greatest pressure in this part of the warta valley is exerted by hydrotechnical buildings the main task of which is to regulate the flow and minimize the effects of flooding the impact of land use changes in gorzów wielkopolski is also significant no 32 with a trend of 0 29 c decade the odra river after taking the warta river from the gozdowice water gauge no 7 shows significantly higher trends in annual warming of waters approx 0 30 c decade which can be associated with the influence of the warta waters with increased temperature and the influence of local factors related to the use of the valley downstream of the odra river 3 4 biologically relevant metric in this section we calculated one of the most important biologically relevant metrics namely the annual number of days when water temperature exceeded 20 c d20 bartholow 2005 the 20 c threshold in this metric was chosen as representative of acute high temperatures for aquatic species e g salmonids as many river gauges have water temperatures lower than 20 c in the summer period we then focused on three large rivers with higher rwt in poland namely odra river gauge number 1 8 warta river gauge number 27 32 and vistula river gauge number 57 68 details about these three rivers can be found in table s1 the results showed that for all the river gauges of the three rivers d20 increased significantly p 0 05 with t test fig 11 for the 8 river gauges in the odra river d20 increased from 5 6 to 11 0 days decade average 7 7 days decade for the 6 river gauges in the warta river d20 increased from 2 2 to 8 0 days decade average 5 9 days decade for the 12 river gauges in the vistula river d20 increased from 3 0 to 11 9 days decade average 6 9 days decade the results indicated that with the warming of rwt for these river gauges see table s3 for details d20 increased synchronously which might lead to catastrophic consequences to aquatic habitats as indicated in bartholow 2005 4 conclusions in this study daily observed rwt data from 125 river gauges in 70 rivers and daily observed ta data from 34 nearby meteorological stations were used to reconstruct the long term rwt time series in the past 55 years 1966 2020 and then investigate the long term changing trend of rwt the results lead to the following conclusions 1 the air2stream model performed well with the averaged rmse values for the calibration and validation periods are 1 21 and 1 32 c and the nse values for the two periods are 0 96 and 0 95 respectively 2 annual averaged rwt of 121 river gauges 96 8 showed clear warming trend with the warming rate ranging between 0 08 and 0 44 c decade average 0 25 c decade 3 the warming trends of river waters on the main rivers and their tributaries are spatially differentiated 4 the seasonal rwt trends showed that summer is warming fastest followed by spring and then by autumn and winter 5 long term increases in rwt were typically correlated with increases in air temperatures 6 for the three large rivers vistula odra and warta d20 increased synchronously with the warming of rwt the clear warming trends of annual and seasonal rwt and the increase of d20 in poland will inevitably cause negative impacts to the aquatic system and mitigation measures need to be implemented to reduce the negative effects the results reported in this study

7861,study region tropical australia study focus streams and rivers of the australian tropics have been the subject of substantial hydrological process research spanning the last 50 years in this review we highlight initial efforts to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics and how this has been more recently followed by work in savannas of the seasonal tropics we describe recent findings from modelling and tracer studies and derive a framework of dominant hydrological processes for the region we also detail five critical knowledge gaps that will require further attention with climate change and ongoing interest in development in the region new hydrological insights for the region we outline the diversity of runoff generation mechanisms that prevail in the region and emphasise the role of connected wetlands and floodplains in catchment response we discuss the prominence of focused episodic recharge in the replenishment of groundwater stores across the region we also review how climate change and potential water resource development projects may alter the hydrology of northern australian catchments future research should focus on improving our physical understanding of key hydrological processes as well as anticipate the likely effects of development and climate change on these processes intensive and long term studies of experimental observatories which capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region will help frame sustainable water development policies in northern australia graphical abstract ga1 keywords isotopes catchment processes evapotranspiration wet tropics wet dry tropics tracer aided modelling research agenda interdisciplinary data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction stretching from the kimberley in western australia wa to the cape york peninsula in queensland qld about 25 of australia s land mass is characterised by a tropical climate fig 1 here we loosely define the australian tropics as all land north of latitude 21 s approximately corresponding to the transition between the seasonal semi arid tropics and more arid areas to the south beck et al 2018 this land which has a strong cultural value to indigenous australians is sparsely populated and has been subject to relatively limited water resource development to date less than 2 of the area is used for forestry cropping or mining with the remaining land either supporting extensive cattle grazing or reserved as conservation areas abares 2021 the relatively undisturbed landscapes of tropical australia generate a disproportionate amount of the continent s surface runoff petheram et al 2010 with many rivers in the region having retained a natural flow regime warfe et al 2011 this situation contrasts with most other tropical regions of the world that are often affected by large scale deforestation gibbs et al 2010 lambin et al 2003 and river impoundment zarfl et al 2015 the relatively intact state of northern australia combined with its diverse range of landscapes and sub climates and political stability relative to other tropical countries provides unique opportunities to develop a solid knowledge base of natural hydrological processes in the tropics further the renewed commitment from all levels of government to enable economic development in northern australia commonwealth of australia 2015 hart et al 2020 watson et al 2021 is likely to drive an expansion of primary industries across the region including irrigated agriculture ash et al 2017 aquaculture cobcroft et al 2020 and extractive industries knudsen et al 2019 there is therefore an urgent need for research that assesses the response of australian tropical catchments to projected water resource development as well as climate change while the humid tropics have been the subject of important research on fine scale hydrological process understanding since the 1970 s and 1980 s e g bonell and gilmour 1978 bonell et al 1981 cassells et al 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 the seasonal or wet dry tropics have received comparatively less attention e g cook et al 1998 even though the latter occupy a much larger area of the australian tropics fig 1 despite recent efforts to collect field data from understudied areas the research coverage has been spatially uneven and observations remain limited across much of tropical australia petheram et al 2012a the disparate nature and limited number of field studies has precluded development of a robust conceptual framework for understanding the key hydrological processes at play in the region in this article we first describe the diversity of landscapes and climates across the region section 2 we then provide a historical perspective of the work carried out to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics section 3 and outline the more recent interest in hydrological process understanding across the seasonal tropics section 4 through several recent examples we show how the collection of isotopic and other data has provided new insight into the response of these highly dynamic systems to monsoonal rainfall pulses section 5 we then draw on these examples to propose a framework of dominant processes for the region in section 6 we discuss how current hydrological functions may be affected by climate change and potential water resource development lastly we highlight some of the remaining knowledge gaps in australia s tropical hydrology in the face of future development and climate change section 7 this review synthesises the processes that control the hydrological response of catchments across the australian tropics and as such there are topics that are outside of the scope of this paper we do not review the numerous hydrological and hydrogeological assessments conducted by state agencies and research organisations since the 1950 s e g water budgets of specific regions groundwater recharge estimates etc unless these studies have expanded our understanding of key hydrological processes likewise we do not review studies that investigate other aspects of the critical zone such as aquatic biogeochemistry nutrient and sediment fluxes through rivers as each of these topics could be the focus of review papers in their own right 2 landscape and climate drivers of streamflow in the australian tropics the australian tropics are broadly made up of two bioclimatic zones the humid tropics and the seasonal or wet dry tropics the latter covering most 99 of tropical australia fig 1a the humid tropics defined here as the area that falls under climate classes af am and cfa of the köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 are a region of rugged rainforest terrain along the eastern flanks of the great dividing range fig 1b with confined valleys and narrow coastal plains that support pasture and cropland the geology of the humid tropics comprises of ancient e g palaeozoic metamorphic and granitic formations partially overlain in places by more recent e g cainozoic lava flows and ash deposits while thick colluvial and alluvial deposits extend along the coastal plains jell 2013 the seasonal tropics defined here as the area that falls under climate classes aw bsh and cwa of the köppen geiger classification comprise highly weathered landscapes of generally low topography fig 1b that support mixed savanna woodland grassland a diverse range of geological settings occur across the seasonal tropics for instance sedimentary siliciclastic rocks in much of the kimberley and top end igneous and metamorphic rocks in the headwaters of the flinders gilbert and mitchell catchments in qld but also sedimentary carbonate rocks occurring sporadically across the daly and roper catchments in the northern territory nt as well as gulf of carpentaria region ahmad and munson 2013 groves et al 1994 jell 2013 in places the surface geology overlies large sedimentary basins that can contain highly permeable carbonate e g the cambrian limestone aquifer in the nt or siliciclastic formations e g grant group and poole sandstone aquifers in wa northern parts of the great artesian basin in qld fig 1b the seasonal tropic region also includes wide alluvial floodplains associated with meandering rivers and extensive wetlands that form during the wet season much of the land surface has been subjected to intense chemical weathering leading to widespread laterite formation another feature of the seasonal tropics are the numerous low lying islands off the top end coast in the gulf of carpentaria and along the coral sea and timor sea coastlines fig 1 these islands are often inhabited by indigenous australians hence have important water security considerations rainfall in both the wet and seasonal tropics is primarily driven by the southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone during the summer months davidson et al 1984 troup 1961 while early wet season events from november to december involve relatively short lived intense convective storms the shift to equatorial westerly winds around december brings large scale monsoonal conditions until april troup 1961 wheeler and mcbride 2005 during this second part of the wet season monsoonal bursts can last between a few days to a week or more and are characterised by convective cells that yield lower intensity but higher magnitude rainfall relative to early storms wheeler and mcbride 2005 tropical cyclones can also occasionally form in the vicinity of monsoonal depressions bringing more intense rainfall rainfall regimes during the wet season are broadly similar across the humid and seasonal tropics with 1000 3000 mm falling along the northern and eastern coast between november and april fig 2a a substantial rainfall gradient occurs from north to south in the seasonal tropics with semi arid tropical regions receiving lower rainfall amounts 500 mm during the wet season in the drier months may to october the two bioclimatic zones experience distinctly different rainfall patterns fig 2d rain in the seasonal tropics ceases almost completely for four to five months making the region one of the global hotspots for extreme rainfall seasonality feng et al 2013 in the humid tropics however the presence of the great dividing range enables south easterly winds to bring orographic rainfall to the region even during the austral winter ensuring rainfall of between 300 and 1000 mm between may and october both regions experience high rates of evaporation year round evaporation here refers to the bulk flux of water including transpiration following miralles et al 2020 with the highest rates during the wet season when precipitation and temperature are highest fig 2b 2e as a result the ratio between evaporation and rainfall or evaporative index is 1 in high rainfall areas during the wet season i e no rainfall deficit fig 2c but 1 during the dry season except for the humid tropics where rainfall occurs year round and for the semi arid inland areas to the south where evaporation is negligible given the lack of rainfall and low vegetation cover fig 2f this diversity in landscape and climate drivers results in significant differences in the hydrological regime of streams and rivers across the region fig 3 rivers of the humid tropics tend to flow year round with rainfall during the drier months ensuring regular replenishment of groundwater stores and sustained discharge to rivers e g daintree and north johnstone rivers in fig 3 in contrast many rivers of the seasonal tropics cease to flow during the prolonged dry season e g fitzroy river in fig 3 unless they are connected to large groundwater systems that sustain surface water flow via baseflow contributions e g daly river in fig 3 associated with the cambrian limestone aquifer because rainfall can be particularly irregular from year to year rivers of the seasonal tropics are also subject to considerable interannual variations in their flow regime petheram et al 2008b 3 humid tropics a legacy of research on stormflow generation hydrological research in tropical australia began in the 1970 s in the steep forested region of northeast qld with the establishment of a hydrological observatory in one of the most humid areas of australia near babinda south of cairns b in fig 1b where annual precipitation averages 4500 mm in what is often referred to as the babinda catchments a wide range of experimental approaches were applied to examine the response of streams to rainfall and the impact of logging on this response the site comprised two paired sub catchments namely south creek supporting intact rainforest and north creek which had been logged from the 1970 s to the late 1990 s the babinda observatory became one of the most intensely studied sites in the tropics e g bonell et al 1998 bonell and gilmour 1978 bonell et al 1981 cassells et al 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer et al 1994 these studies generated significant new understandings of storm runoff generation in the humid tropics as briefly detailed below early work in babinda showed that tropical rainforest catchments can be highly responsive to rainfall and capable of generating overland flow bonell and gilmour 1978 this finding contradicted the then prevailing view that forested catchments were dominated by subsurface stormflow in both south and north creek highly transmissive surface soil layers were underlain by a low permeability layer at 0 2 m depth which under high antecedent wetness and intense rainfall could result in saturation excess overland flow as a perched water table formed in the upper soil bonell et al 1983 1981 bonell and gilmour 1978 cassells et al 1985 subsurface stormflow was also observed and occurred mostly via preferential pathways along large root systems bonell and gilmour 1978 while stemflow contributed substantially to overland flow via branches that quickly funnelled rainfall to the ground herwitz 1986 in the 1980 s research in the babinda catchments contributed significantly to the emerging debate over the contributions of old or pre event and new or event water sources to the storm hydrograph under wet antecedent conditions and monsoon type rainfall event water dominated the runoff response elsenbeer et al 1995 yet under lower intensity rainfall less favourable to the generation of saturation excess overland flow large contributions from pre event water were observed both in south creek elsenbeer et al 1995 and north creek barnes and bonell 1996 it was also established that as the region transitioned to the drier season streamflow became dominated by older groundwater sources bonell et al 1998 1983 1981 recognising the necessary distinction between celerities pressure wave and velocities mass movement to characterise catchment response barnes and bonell 1996 were the first to incorporate isotopic tracers into a hydrological model a study that paved the way for a better integration of water transit times in catchment studies and for a widespread use of tracer time series in hydrology hrachowitz et al 2016 mcdonnell and beven 2014 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 sprenger et al 2019 overall the breadth of research conducted in the humid tropics of australia during that period inspired hydrological research in other tropical regions of the world e g elsenbeer and lack 1996 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 noguchi et al 1997 schellekens et al 2004 at a time when hydrological process understanding was predominantly focused on temperate regions 4 seasonal tropics recent scrutiny with the push to develop the north while hydrological monitoring and assessments in the seasonal tropics of australia have been conducted by state agencies since the 1960 s interest in small scale hydrological process understanding was relatively limited until the 2000 s among the few research studies undertaken in the 1970 s and 1980 s bonell and williams 1986 examined runoff patterns in an undisturbed savanna hillslope near torrens creek central north qld tck in fig 1b they found that infiltration excess overland flow developed during high intensity rainfall events on bare soil surfaces however over 95 of this runoff was redistributed and subsequently infiltrated a short distance downslope as a result of high soil hydraulic conductivity bonell and williams 1986 in another study in the burdekin river catchment br in fig 1b holt et al 1996 partly attributed the higher infiltration rates they observed in a lightly grazed savanna relative to an overgrazed site to higher termite activity within the topsoil these early findings suggest that both the extent of savanna vegetation cover and soil properties including soil fauna may be important determinants of runoff generation processes in the australian seasonal tropics with severe droughts impacting southern australian catchments northern catchments have been scrutinised since the mid 2000 s for potential development of primary industries commonwealth of australia 2015 several programs were launched that gave impetus to new research on the rivers of the region these programs e g tropical rivers and coastal knowledge established in 2007 northern australia sustainable yields project launched in 2008 northern australia environmental resources hub established in 2012 northern australia water resource assessment launched in 2015 fostered transdisciplinary research that delivered critical information on the extreme variability of flow regimes petheram et al 2008b 2012a and the effect of flow seasonality on riverine ecosystems e g douglas et al 2005 jardine et al 2015 leigh and sheldon 2008 warfe et al 2011 because groundwater development would potentially impact the continuity of dry season surface flow the role of intermediate to regional scale groundwater systems in maintaining baseflow to rivers was also investigated in detail across the region cook et al 2003 1998 gardner et al 2011 jolly et al 2013 leblanc et al 2015 smerdon et al 2012 return flow from bank storage was identified as an important process that can contribute significant proportions of baseflow to large rivers batlle aguilar et al 2014 doble et al 2012 another focus of these programs was to examine ecohydrological processes during the dry season with several studies demonstrating the reliance of riparian trees on groundwater cook and o grady 2006 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 overall we now have access to much needed baseline information on the biophysical environment of the seasonal tropics detailed investigations of hydrological processes specific to the region however have been limited until recently catchment functioning is likely to be fundamentally different in the tropics compared to temperate regions wohl et al 2012 wright et al 2018 yet our understanding of processes such as runoff generation sources and pathways of stormflow and groundwater contributions to surface flow remains fragmented for the seasonal tropics of australia recent efforts including modelling and observations based on environmental tracers e g water stable isotopes radioisotopes have helped clarify some of these processes as outlined in section 5 5 new insights from isotopic studies towards a baseline hydrological framework the use of environmental tracers has underlain key advances in the conceptual understanding of catchment processes kendall and mcdonnell 1998 in australia bonell and colleagues were pivotal in the development of tracer techniques as tools to unravel runoff generation processes e g barnes and bonell 1996 bonell et al 1998 bonell et al 1983 elsenbeer et al 1995 hensel and elsenbeer 1997 while these early investigations relied on a low number of measurements the advent of infrared isotope spectroscopy is now enabling high resolution observations at time scales that match those of fundamental hydrological drivers birkel et al 2012 von freyberg et al 2017 the ability to acquire high resolution isotopic data both oxygen 18o 16o or δ18o and hydrogen 2h 1h or δd is particularly important in tropical regions where stormflow events can be intense and short lived and where the isotopic composition of rainfall can be highly variable at sub hourly time scales munksgaard et al 2012 2020 over the last decade or so isotopic studies focussed on streams and rivers in tropical australia have advanced our understanding of the hydrological response of these systems to hydroclimatic drivers e g birkel et al 2020 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 tweed et al 2016 here we summarise the main findings from these and other studies and propose a broad framework of hydrological functioning for the region 5 1 hydrological responses to monsoonal rain recent research has shown that wet season rainfall can have distinct isotopic compositions over the course of the season largely dependent on cloud generation dynamics and their transport trajectories zwart et al 2016 2018 the large scale monsoonal convective systems that occur at the peak of the wet season are characterised by highly depleted δd and δ18o compared to earlier storms and to storms that occur between monsoonal bursts munksgaard et al 2020 zwart et al 2016 2018 furthermore tropical cyclones can bring rainfall with even more negative δd and δ18o values munksgaard et al 2015 such temporal variations in the isotopic composition of rainfall offer the opportunity to assess the response of australian tropical streams and rivers to different hydroclimatic drivers and their associated spatial and temporal patterns research has shown that runoff generation mechanisms in tropical australian catchments vary over the course of the wet season as a result of rainfall intensity and changing antecedent wetness conditions e g soil moisture and groundwater states analysing the hydrological response of seventeen mile creek sm in fig 1b a river north of katherine seasonal tropics montanari et al 2006 found that saturation excess overland flow occurred during the wettest months and after sustained monsoonal events this was despite high storage capacity within the catchment and a predominance of subsurface inflows during storms saturation excess can be attributed to the subdued topography and high soil permeability that may together induce optimal infiltration and ponding via a rise of the water table above the ground surface in the upper burdekin catchment br in fig 1b jarihani et al 2017 also attributed wet season overland flow to the filling and spilling of shallow soil storage these authors showed that infiltration excess was more likely to occur in the drier months due to high rainfall intensities and lower water tables to assess the relative proportions of different water sources to high flow events duvert et al 2020 developed mixing models adjusted to δ18o electrical conductivity and tritium measurements in the howard river a monsoon driven lowland system near darwin hr in fig 1b under high flow conditions most streamflow originated from the slow drainage of wetland and floodplain stores as well as from shallow groundwater discharge birkel et al 2020 used a semi distributed model based on δd and δ18o time series to simulate both water and solute movement in the same river system these authors confirmed the role of seasonal wetlands as receivers and temporary stores of shallow subsurface contributions during the wet season steeper catchments of the humid tropics are characterised by a wide range of hydrological responses although subsurface stormflow seems to be the prevailing mechanism in these systems bass et al 2014 measured the isotopic ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon 13c 12c δ13c in combination with δ18o and δd at a high resolution during a stormflow event in atika creek a pristine forested stream ack in fig 1b isotopic values showed an initial period of significant overland flow contribution but as streamflow peaked and receded the system rapidly switched to an almost entirely subsurface contribution subsurface stormflow has also been observed in cleared areas of the humid tropics tweed et al 2016 reported significant changes in δ18o and δd at peak flow in scheu creek an agricultural catchment south of cairns sck in fig 1b which they interpreted as enhanced discharge of shallow groundwater from saturated areas along the stream via translatory flow of pre event water under particularly high antecedent wetness conditions and intense rainfall however overland flow was found to dominate the response in forested catchments likely a result of the generally low permeability of the subsoil in certain areas bonell and gilmour 1978 elsenbeer et al 1995 herwitz 1986 while surface and shallow subsurface water sources tend to prevail during stormflow events deeper groundwater inflows can also play a key role in the hydrological response of australian tropical catchments despite the rapid flow response and the dominance of shallow sources in the howard river birkel et al 2020 found that deep groundwater upwelling led to overall relatively old 1 year streamflow even during monsoonal bursts similarly large contributions from old groundwater to peak flow were detected in early work by barnes and bonell 1996 during low intensity rainfall events groundwater discharging from fractured rock aquifers in upland areas of the humid tropics was also found to contribute the bulk of streamflow even under high flow conditions cook et al 2001 5 2 recharge pathways evidence shows the importance of riverbanks and alluvial deposits in storing monsoonal rainfall this process is particularly important in large low gradient rivers of the seasonal tropics and typically occurs through overbank flooding doble et al 2012 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018a the increase in river stage at the peak of the wet season can be very substantial with the width of inundation potentially exceeding 30 km in the lower fitzroy river karim et al 2018 groundwater recharge from overbank flooding occurs across much of the seasonal tropics and is likely to be the dominant recharge mechanism to alluvial aquifers in the more arid inland areas e g the bsh climate zone other localised recharge mechanisms are likely to occur across the region in part because of intense chemical weathering of the land surface which has resulted in large heterogeneities in the hydraulic conductivity of near surface materials for instance shallow lateritic horizons can contain solution cavities and macropores cook et al 1998 doyle 2001 hutley et al 2000 while in areas underlain by carbonate rocks karstification has created complex networks of sinkholes conduits and caves karp 2008 tickell 2011 such heterogeneous structures in the subsurface are likely to lead to preferential flow and recharge pathways which can represent a disproportionate contribution to aquifer recharge turnadge et al 2018 showed that recharged waters to a dolostone aquifer of the nt were not subject to evaporative fractionation this was inferred to be due to the bulk of recharge occurring via relatively fast localised pathways such as buried sinkholes this work was followed up by enemark et al 2020 who confirmed via model testing that depressions in the landscape likely act as conduits for preferential recharge but these mechanisms are not limited to carbonate systems for instance sandy paleochannels in upland outcrop areas of the mitchell catchment qld have also been identified as key recharge zones taylor et al 2018b inter aquifer flow can also be an important recharge process for lowland aquifer systems receiving limited diffuse recharge the fractured rock aquifers in upland areas of the great dividing range contribute to recharging alluvial and other sedimentary formations in the drier areas to the west such as the flinders and gilbert catchments jolly et al 2013 further work is needed to better quantify mountain front recharge and inter aquifer linkages across such areas overall the role of landscape and geological heterogeneities in controlling groundwater recharge and the contribution of preferential recharge and overbank flood recharge relative to diffuse recharge remain largely unknown across much of tropical australia 5 3 dry season water sources differences in the amplitude of rainfall seasonality strongly modulate the flow regimes of streams and rivers across the australian tropics petheram et al 2008b fig 3 after rainfall has largely ceased in the seasonal tropics the magnitude and duration of flow recession is a function of the storage capacity of adjacent temporary stores wetlands floodplains alluvial deposits riverbanks and of their state of connection with the channel fig 3 duvert et al 2020 and birkel et al 2020 showed that the slow drainage of waters previously stored in connected floodplains maintains surface flows in the howard river several months after the last rains in larger rivers return flow from bank and alluvial storage can be a major contributor to flow recession and potentially to dry season baseflow e g batlle aguilar et al 2014 jolly et al 2013 using simple numerical simulations based on cross sections of the fitzroy river in the kimberley fr in fig 1b doble et al 2012 demonstrated that after a major high flow event several years may be required for all water stored in riverbanks to return to the river after shallow water sources have been depleted the connection with larger deeper groundwater stores becomes an important determinant of the dry season flow regime in the seasonal tropics where and when surface systems are not connected to regional groundwater channels tend to break up into a series of discrete pools fig 3 using long term hydrological records and modelling cresswell et al 2009 suggested that intermittent streams and rivers are far more common than perennial systems across tropical australia this is often also the case in low lying islands where groundwater storage potential is very limited but see banks et al 2021 after surface flow has ceased subsurface flow often persists in the sandy deposits that underlie channels shanafield et al 2021 alternatively perennial surface flow occurs in areas where regional aquifer systems discharge into surface water systems fig 3 such as in the cambrian limestone aquifer e g cook et al 2003 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 the grant group and poole sandstone aquifers e g gardner et al 2011 harrington et al 2011 taylor et al 2018c or other sedimentary or fractured rock aquifers e g jolly et al 2013 leblanc et al 2015 where surface flow is perennial geological faults often provide preferential pathways for groundwater discharge harrington et al 2011 based on terrigenous helium 4 analyses gardner et al 2011 and smerdon et al 2012 estimated that the baseflow of the fitzroy and daly rivers fig 1b 3 had residence times of up to 1000 and 10 000 years respectively a major spring complex that feeds the roper river rr in fig 1b also had long residence times associated with the cambrian limestone aquifer with possibly even older contributions from formations underlying the cambrian limestone aquifer lamontagne et al 2021 late dry season streamflow in the howard river which is connected to a less extensive carbonate aquifer was 100 years old duvert et al 2020 in more humid regions shallow groundwater stores are likely to be replenished even during the drier months as a result of dry season storms providing abundant baseflow to rivers all year round fig 3 cook et al 2001 showed that groundwater inflows made up the main source of streamflow in areas of the atherton tableland qld at in fig 1b underlain by fractured basalt lava flows with isotopic evidence that young 30 years groundwater contained in the basalt discharged to streams throughout the year in upland areas where forest cover has remained intact mcjannet et al 2007 demonstrated the role of cloud interception as an important source of baseflow for streams during the drier months 5 4 uptake by vegetation due to the seasonal cycle in rainfall most vegetation communities across tropical australia are water limited during the dry season with evaporation rates as high as or higher than rainfall rates e p 1 fig 2 an exception to this situation is for the rainforests of the humid tropics where e p 1 even during the drier months mcjannet et al 2007 yet despite the near absence of dry season rain in the seasonal tropics not all ecosystems of the region are limited by water availability this is because water can occur in underground stores e g deep soil horizons or capillary fringe of the water table which support steady rates of overstorey evaporation through the dry season examples of this are the coastal savannas of the top end in the nt hutley et al 2000 2001 whitley et al 2011 but also riparian corridors and other groundwater dependent ecosystems scattered throughout the region e g canham et al 2021 drake and franks 2003 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 several studies have examined the extent to which riparian trees may be reliant on groundwater by comparing the isotopic composition both δ18o and δd of potential tree water sources soil water at different depths groundwater to that of xylem water studies have shown that riparian trees tend to use shallow groundwater stores at the end of the dry season canham et al 2021 cook and o grady 2006 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 although few species used groundwater exclusively these findings highlight the importance of alluvial and bank storage replenishment during the wet season in contrast savanna trees extract soil water from deep soil horizons suggesting little to no groundwater dependence hutley et al 2000 kelley et al 2007 however the studies by hutley et al 2001 and kelley et al 2007 were conducted in high rainfall coastal savannas and little is known about the patterns of tree water uptake in lower rainfall inland areas where savanna vegetation may be more vulnerable to changes in rainfall fig 2 as a complement to isotopic approaches remote sensing techniques can offer opportunities to assess evaporation fluxes at broader but also coarser scales using modis products at a 250 m resolution crosbie and rachakonda 2021 identified one area in the roper river catchment near mataranka nt rr in fig 1b where evaporation largely exceeds rainfall e p 1 a likely indication of groundwater dependence despite the challenge of modelling savanna evaporation due to the different water use patterns of trees and grasses recent modelling efforts have enabled improved estimates of the seasonal variations in the evaporation flux across the seasonal tropics zhuang et al 2020 more field observations are now needed to advance our understanding of the sources and temporal dynamics of root water uptake at both local and larger scales and how this uptake may affect other components of the water cycle such as recharge and runoff remotely sensed evaporation data have potential to improve streamflow modelling herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 and we believe that finer estimates of evaporation fluxes will also improve hydrological understanding and modelling at small catchment scales 6 anticipating hydrological responses to climate change and future development 6 1 interannual flow variability and unknown effects of climate change interannual variability in rainfall is 40 higher in tropical australia compared to other tropical regions of the world with similar mean annual rainfall petheram et al 2008b this variability can be explained by the influence of large scale atmospheric patterns such as the el niño southern oscillation enso nicholls et al 1997 interdecadal pacific oscillation power et al 1999 and by the episodic impact of cyclones across northern australia the effect of enso on rainfall can in turn drive significant interannual changes in river flow chiew and mcmahon 2002 as exemplified with the mitchell river fig 3 this interannual variability is particularly extreme in more arid inland areas of the australian tropics petheram et al 2008b where it is the rarer larger rainfall events that tend to generate aquifer recharge recent isotopic investigations suggest that the passage of tropical cyclones is key to replenishing groundwater stores in lower rainfall areas of the region meredith et al 2018 skrzypek et al 2019 climate models project an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in tropical australia alexander and arblaster 2017 jourdain et al 2013 although large uncertainties remain dey et al 2019 the effect of these expected changes on hydrological regimes are also uncertain with projections ranging from decreases by up to 26 to increases by up to 29 in mean annual runoff across the australian tropics petheram et al 2012b because runoff generation and flow duration are highly dependent on the timing and intensity of rainfall changes in rainfall may exacerbate river flow variability modelling by karim et al 2016 indicates that the connectivity between wetlands and rivers could last up to 20 less in a drier climate than under the current climate while the connectivity could be 5 longer under a wetter climate an increase in potential evaporation rates can also be expected in tropical australia pan et al 2015 likely driven by changes in rainfall temperature and increased atmospheric co2 noting there remains uncertainty around other key variables such as wind speed while we lack data to constrain the uncertainties in these processes it is possible that altered potential evaporation rates during key hydrological periods may alter the response of catchments particularly during shoulder seasons e g delayed wetting up or early drying out and potentially contribute to increased flow intermittency in addition the expected increase in cyclone intensity knutson et al 2015 might induce increased runoff and recharge in drier areas of the region obviously the above statements are speculative given the current lack of knowledge and further research investigating the effects of changing rainfall and evaporation patterns on the hydrological response of australian tropical streams and rivers is needed 6 2 development will alter hydrological partitioning and flow regimes agricultural development in the humid tropics of australia has occurred since the middle of the 19th century with land cleared for sugarcane production and pasture development for dairy and beef cattle harding 1972 kemp et al 2007 large scale deforestation particularly on the coastal plains has likely led to important changes in the hydrological response of catchments of the region some of which have been investigated in detail see section 3 in contrast the seasonal tropics have been historically less affected by land disturbance with much of the land used for extensive cattle grazing on improved and native savanna vegetation abares 2021 however since the 2000 s the federal state and local governments have focused on opportunities presented by the vast area and abundant water resources of the seasonal tropics see section 4 in recent years there has been a renewed push for development of primary industries in the seasonal tropics some of the policy initiatives responding to this push are the white paper on developing northern australia commonwealth of australia 2015 and the establishment of a 1b national water infrastructure development fund in 2018 with 200 m committed to northern australia hart et al 2020 watson et al 2021 the current desire to expand irrigated agriculture in the region is accompanied by an interest to develop shale gas extraction in several sedimentary basins including the beetaloo sub basin knudsen et al 2019 which underlies parts of the cambrian limestone aquifer fig 1 while these potential developments are likely to affect streamflow and groundwater dynamics considerable uncertainty remains as to how surface and groundwater systems will respond to these changes across the region some of the expected impacts are directly associated with land disturbance for instance in the few places where dryland cropping is viable and where savanna woodland will be replaced by cropland increases in storm runoff and decreases in infiltration can be anticipated an early study by ive et al 1976 near katherine in the nt k in fig 1b found that almost 40 of rainfall occurring on grassland was translated downslope as infiltration excess overland stormflow at a research farm in the daly river area dilshad and peel 1994 showed that tillage and low vegetation cover resulted in nearly twice as much overland flow relative to cropping soil under zero till conversely bartley et al 2014 found that increased ground cover in the semi arid tropics of the upper burdekin catchment resulted in lower hillslope runoff coefficients during early wet season events however the expected decreases in infiltration rates following soil disturbance may be counterbalanced by a decrease in evaporation resulting from the replacement of native vegetation by shallow rooted pasture or cropland groundwater level rise and waterlogging following land clearing has been a common observation in the southern parts of the country e g allison et al 1990 sharma et al 1987 and could eventuate in areas of the tropics where the water table is already shallow despite lacking detailed investigations these early results suggest that local modifications to the land cover and soil structure of tropical savannas may have considerable impacts on the partitioning between runoff and recharge in those areas aside from the direct effects of land use change which will likely be restricted to a small proportion of the landscape important questions arise from the potential impacts of water resource development projects first and foremost groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the mining industry may have important effects on flow regimes and groundwater dependent ecosystems modelling results reported by chan et al 2012 suggest that groundwater development may significantly alter the natural flow regime of the daly river nt in the dry season by increasing flow intermittency and reducing lateral river floodplain and longitudinal upstream downstream connectivity because the regional groundwater that discharges into rivers can be very old see section 5 3 the effects of groundwater abstraction on river baseflow may occur long after development started as was modelled for the roper river in the nt bruwer and tickell 2015 furthermore there is broad consensus from isotopic studies that riparian trees in the seasonal tropics tend to use shallow groundwater stores at the end of the dry season canham et al 2021 cook and o grady 2006 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 indicating that a lowering of the water table due to groundwater development may alter the composition and abundance of some riparian ecosystems apart from impacts linked to groundwater abstraction unconventional gas mining operations may further alter natural groundwater flow processes hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction has the potential to increase the connectivity between exploited aquifers and deeper formations via preferential flow through faults or fractures myers 2012 of interest in the northern australian context are the possible vertical connections between the cambrian limestone aquifer and underlying formations containing high salinity water frery et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2021 the construction of dams for irrigation is also likely to affect the hydrological functioning of streams and rivers in northern australia dam release during the dry season means that some intermittent streams can become permanent e g bunn et al 2006 with potentially important ecological consequences close et al 2012 rolls and bond 2017 another dam related impact is the possible reduction of downstream flooding due to the storage and capture of flood waters during the wet season karim et al 2015 estimated that the construction of large dams in the flinders and gilbert catchments would have a relatively small impact on river floodplain connectivity but nielsen et al 2020 found that the inundated area of floodplains in the lower reaches of the mitchell river could potentially be reduced by 50 following dam construction while this has not been examined in detail the decrease in flooding extent and duration may also result in decreasing rates of overbank flood recharge a key recharge process in much of the region another effect of dams and irrigation could be the rising of water tables and increasing salinity in shallow aquifers as was observed in the lower burdekin catchment in qld petheram et al 2008a while small scale water harvesting is the more likely type of development in northern australia it is necessary to anticipate the hydrological impacts of the few large dams that might be built across the region petheram et al 2018 overall there remains important unknowns surrounding how future land use change and water resource development will impact the hydrology of northern australian streams rivers and aquifers as well as their associated ecosystems while basic hydrological assessments and modelling are certainly needed to address these unknowns and anticipate future change there is an equally important need for research programs that generate new data examine hydrological processes at different scales and the way these respond to different forcing and advance our conceptual understanding of catchment functioning in tropical australia we believe this should be achieved through intensive and long term studies of experimental catchment observatories that capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region as detailed in section 7 7 a research agenda for hydrological science in tropical australia despite improved understanding over recent decades our knowledge of key hydrological processes in the australian tropics remains incomplete limited observations across this vast and diverse tropical region prevent a more detailed description of the role of heterogeneities in both landscape and meteorological factors in modulating hydrological responses in addition to new observations we also need new cross disciplinary initiatives centred on the understanding of the critical zone i e the near surface environment from treetops to the water table as an integrated system made of interacting components and processes improved coordination among hydrological subdisciplines and with other disciplines can facilitate the development of hydrological theory and prediction of hydrological functioning across time and space brooks et al 2015 through the utilisation of multiple disciplines we can develop a baseline understanding of how tropical streams and rivers function at present against which to assess the effects of future development and climate change wright et al 2018 in the following we propose five broad research areas that we believe should be priorities for future hydrological research in northern australia these areas relate to 1 stormflow response 2 groundwater recharge 3 interactions with vegetation 4 groundwater discharge and 5 hydrological dis connectivity for each research area we outline the need for improved mechanistic understanding as well as implications in the context of future development and climate change we conclude by discussing the needs to build a network of experimental observatories across the tropics and to better integrate indigenous perspectives into hydrological science and management 7 1 stormflow response can we improve our conceptual understanding of the dominant runoff processes across the region and develop spatialised estimates of the partitioning between runoff and infiltration in lowland areas of the australian tropics saturation excess overland flow may be the dominant runoff mechanism but more observations are needed to evaluate the exact role of saturated areas along streams and rivers in generating runoff during the wetter months only by understanding how streamflow is generated across the landscape can we then predict the likely impacts of development on these processes additionally the potential occurrence of preferential flow pathways through macropores in shallow lateritic horizons as observed in other settings cuthbert and tindimugaya 2010 ruprecht and schofield 1993 needs further examination in the northern australian context particularly in relation to how macropores contribute to the hydrological response of catchments under monsoonal conditions one other key question is related to the way land disturbance whether it is clearing for agriculture change in fire management regimes or weed infestation may impact the partitioning between runoff and infiltration for example an important component of land use in the seasonal tropics is extensive livestock grazing abares 2021 grazing can significantly reduce infiltration rates due to soil compaction and erosion gifford and hawkins 1978 greenwood and mckenzie 2001 and decreased termite activity holt et al 1996 likewise post logging changes in soil properties and vegetation cover have led to decreased infiltration and increased overland flow during stormflow events in both the humid bonell 1993 cassells et al 1985 and seasonal tropics ive et al 1976 we need new field studies that assess the effect of both land clearing and changed grazing intensity on infiltration and recharge rates for contrasting areas of the australian tropics importantly changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change will be superimposed over any impacts from land use change studies that combine both these driving factors will provide key information to resource managers and decision makers 7 2 recharge what are the relative contributions of overbank flood recharge and other preferential recharge pathways across the australian tropics overbank flooding likely plays a major role in recharging the alluvial and underlying aquifers of large low gradient rivers doble et al 2012 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018a however there has been little effort to accurately quantify this recharge pathway and to highlight its importance in replenishing groundwater systems of the seasonal tropics relative to diffuse recharge this is much needed information especially if we are to predict the effect of dam construction and or groundwater abstraction on the loss of downstream river floodplain connectivity and in turn on recharge rates other recharge pathways also need more research the typically heterogeneous subsurface in tropical australia resulting from intense weathering and tectonic deformation indicates that much of the unsaturated and saturated flow may occur via preferential pathways e g enemark et al 2020 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018b despite its importance the role of structural heterogeneities in controlling groundwater recharge as well as vertical connectivity remains unclear in the region new studies should focus on assessing the contribution of preferential flow as a recharge pathway to underlying aquifers relative to diffuse recharge and overbank flood recharge imaging the structures of the subsurface via geophysical measurements is a promising avenue for the delineation of preferential pathways for instance airborne electromagnetic surveys have been successfully used to map geomorphologic features relevant to hydrological processes christensen et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 parsekian et al 2015 ultimately these data will enable better management and protection of the areas identified as key recharge zones and ensure long term more sustainable use of groundwater resources 7 3 plant water uptake what is the role of vegetation in partitioning water fluxes and can we predict the vulnerability of different vegetation communities to change water uptake by vegetation plays a central role in the hydrological cycle as it partitions rainfall into evaporation and recharge from a hydrological point of view accurate understanding of the mechanisms and patterns of plant water uptake is vital to successfully simulate catchment flow processes knighton et al 2020 kuppel et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 yang et al 2016 in tropical australia most studies have focused on identifying groundwater use by riparian trees in the dry season e g canham et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 but many questions remain regarding both temporal and cross ecosystem variations in plant water use for instance little is known about the sources and patterns of water uptake for different vegetation types savanna rainforest riparian corridors and how these vary under different wetness conditions in situ isotope measurements although still in their infancy can be particularly useful to fingerprint the sources of water extracted by vegetation and changes over time kühnhammer et al 2022 seeger and weiler 2021 spot measurements of stable isotopes can also add important information although questions currently arising around the potential biases associated with water extraction techniques should not be ignored allen and kirchner 2022 barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 because plant water uptake and productivity are also controlled by the structure of the subsurface particularly in water limited environments geophysical methods can provide additional insights into where plants obtain water brooks et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 a solid understanding of plant water uptake at local and regional scales is a critical step towards addressing the potential impacts of water resource development on vegetation communities key questions remain on the condition and abundance of groundwater dependent ecosystems how these may change under different types of development and whether species can adapt in response to changes in water table depth particularly in the dry season while clear advances have been made to predict the ecological responses of riverine ecosystems to changes in surface water flow e g pettit et al 2017 warfe et al 2011 much more needs to be done to understand how groundwater dependent vegetation may respond to human induced and climate change impacts 7 4 groundwater discharge how old and vulnerable are groundwater and spring systems across the australian tropics compared to the detailed investigations of springs in the arid zone of australia e g flook et al 2020 keppel et al 2012 love et al 2013 there is limited information on flow pathways and water ages of spring systems in the tropics groundwater contained in the large sedimentary basins of northern australia can be extremely old e g harrington et al 2011 reported groundwater from the grant group and pool sandstone aquifers over 30 000 years old and it has been shown that several spring fed rivers of the region are sustained by deep old groundwater sources gardner et al 2011 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 however an inventory and assessment of the origins of spring water their age and yield for northern australia is currently lacking this information is key to understanding the vulnerability of tropical springs to future development for instance the effect of groundwater abstraction on river baseflow and or spring yields may not be experienced for several decades or centuries because of the lags inherent to old regional groundwater systems all three major aquifer systems fig 1b have extensive unconventional gas reserves and the availability of water for hydraulic fracturing is a contentious issue for local communities given the cultural and environmental significance of springs in northern australia it is essential that the best available science is used to assess vulnerability prior to project approvals where spring flow may be affected the approval of the carmichael coal mine in qld is a high profile example where this was not the case currell et al 2020 furthermore there is limited data on the importance of groundwater discharge into other aquifers i e inter aquifer flow although this may be an important pathway in areas located downgradient of upland fractured rock aquifers jolly et al 2013 as water allocation policy in australia seeks to avoid double allocation future research should aim to quantify these inter aquifer linkages 7 5 flow intermittency can we anticipate how flow regimes and hydrological connectivity will be affected by climate change and development there is a clear need to assess the security of water supply in the australian tropics under future climate and development scenarios while climate models generally project an increase in the intensity and possibly frequency of extreme rainfall events in tropical australia the effect of these changes on hydrological regimes have been rarely considered the impact of potential changes to rainfall patterns requires further investigation but uncertainties in climate model predictions present challenges for example simulations across northern australia under a 1 c warming scenario resulted in an increase in runoff for half the global climate models tested and in a decrease for the other half petheram et al 2012b one possible scenario is that shifts in flow regimes due to changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration will exacerbate the duration and frequency of dry phases döll and schmied 2012 a recent study suggests that flow intermittency has increased in australia in the past few decades sauquet et al 2021 although there was no clear trend for tropical rivers because increased intermittency would have large implications for riverine ecosystem health datry et al 2016 rolls and bond 2017 the mechanisms by which climate change may exacerbate or reduce flow intermittency require further examination non perennial river systems are governed by distinctive and complex hydrological processes that have not yet been fully described shanafield et al 2021 better understanding these processes in the northern australian context is imperative for anticipating the potential consequences of altered flow regimes across the region also important is the potential effect of water resource development dam construction and or groundwater abstraction with dam construction likely to suppress flow intermittency bunn et al 2006 and groundwater abstraction likely to increase flow intermittency and reduce connectivity chan et al 2012 king et al 2015 mccallum et al 2013 the few studies that have modelled the impacts of development scenarios in northern australia suggest that reductions in flow connectivity may occur e g nielsen et al 2020 we now need further research that underpins an ability to predict the responses of tropical streams and rivers to future climate and development scenarios 7 6 towards a network of observatories as illustrated by the pioneering work carried out in the babinda catchments long term and intensive monitoring of experimental sites is essential to advance our understanding of the hydrological cycle burt and mcdonnell 2015 highlight that the hydrological community needs long term experimental catchments in the tropics where observations remain scarce and process understanding is lacking in the seasonal tropics in particular the lack of high resolution and long term hydrological data continues to limit our hydrological understanding as well as the robustness of water resource assessments and thereby water allocation policy petheram et al 2012a observations are required not only to unravel the processes of streamflow generation recharge pathways and ecohydrological interactions but also to develop and test predictive models and ultimately to provide an evidence base for informed decision making tetzlaff et al 2017 there are established networks of experimental catchments in north america e g white et al 2015 and in europe e g bogena et al 2016 gaillardet et al 2018 and the emerging australian critical zone observatory network ozczo funded through the australian research council represents a step forward in integrating below and above ground environmental processes but at this stage focuses mostly on the soil and groundwater compartments of the critical zone similarly the newly established 15 million long term groundwater monitoring network groundwater super science funded through the national collaborative research infrastructure strategy does not include any sites in the tropics working towards the establishment of a network of research observatories across tropical australia should be a priority and to this end the daintree rainforest observatory dro in the humid tropics bass et al 2011 dro in fig 1b could be paired with representative catchments of the seasonal tropics such as the weany creek long term monitoring site bartley et al 2006 2014 koci et al 2020 wck in fig 1b in addition to the acquisition of high resolution data a key focus of these observatories should be the extrapolation and upscaling from small experimental catchments to larger regional river and groundwater systems cross site comparisons can help with identifying mechanisms that are generalisable across space and time brooks et al 2015 experimental sites will contribute to accurate and long term quantification of water and energy fluxes at the regional scale which will in turn assist management and policy decisions such evidence base is particularly needed in the northern australian context with the predicted effects of climate change and the ongoing push by the federal and state governments for the development of primary and mining industries 7 7 integrating indigenous perspectives indigenous people make up a large proportion of the population in northern australia and almost two thirds of remote indigenous communities rely primarily on groundwater for their main source of drinking water australian bureau of statistics 2006 many of these communities are facing increasingly pressing issues that undermine their water security including groundwater depletion and heavy metal contamination howey and grealy 2021 to address these water security issues both local and regional scale assessments of surface and groundwater systems are urgently needed across remote areas of northern australia more generally water governance in australia has largely overlooked the interests and perspectives of indigenous australians until recently jackson et al 2015 o donnell et al 2022 greater involvement of indigenous organisations will be key to the success of future water resource development projects across the north research aimed at integrating and translating indigenous knowledge of hydrological systems into western science is necessary to not only improve understanding of indigenous water resource use but also to inform water management activities robinson et al 2016 woodward et al 2012 credit authorship contribution statement clément duvert conceptualization writing original draft han she lim

7861,study region tropical australia study focus streams and rivers of the australian tropics have been the subject of substantial hydrological process research spanning the last 50 years in this review we highlight initial efforts to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics and how this has been more recently followed by work in savannas of the seasonal tropics we describe recent findings from modelling and tracer studies and derive a framework of dominant hydrological processes for the region we also detail five critical knowledge gaps that will require further attention with climate change and ongoing interest in development in the region new hydrological insights for the region we outline the diversity of runoff generation mechanisms that prevail in the region and emphasise the role of connected wetlands and floodplains in catchment response we discuss the prominence of focused episodic recharge in the replenishment of groundwater stores across the region we also review how climate change and potential water resource development projects may alter the hydrology of northern australian catchments future research should focus on improving our physical understanding of key hydrological processes as well as anticipate the likely effects of development and climate change on these processes intensive and long term studies of experimental observatories which capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region will help frame sustainable water development policies in northern australia graphical abstract ga1 keywords isotopes catchment processes evapotranspiration wet tropics wet dry tropics tracer aided modelling research agenda interdisciplinary data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction stretching from the kimberley in western australia wa to the cape york peninsula in queensland qld about 25 of australia s land mass is characterised by a tropical climate fig 1 here we loosely define the australian tropics as all land north of latitude 21 s approximately corresponding to the transition between the seasonal semi arid tropics and more arid areas to the south beck et al 2018 this land which has a strong cultural value to indigenous australians is sparsely populated and has been subject to relatively limited water resource development to date less than 2 of the area is used for forestry cropping or mining with the remaining land either supporting extensive cattle grazing or reserved as conservation areas abares 2021 the relatively undisturbed landscapes of tropical australia generate a disproportionate amount of the continent s surface runoff petheram et al 2010 with many rivers in the region having retained a natural flow regime warfe et al 2011 this situation contrasts with most other tropical regions of the world that are often affected by large scale deforestation gibbs et al 2010 lambin et al 2003 and river impoundment zarfl et al 2015 the relatively intact state of northern australia combined with its diverse range of landscapes and sub climates and political stability relative to other tropical countries provides unique opportunities to develop a solid knowledge base of natural hydrological processes in the tropics further the renewed commitment from all levels of government to enable economic development in northern australia commonwealth of australia 2015 hart et al 2020 watson et al 2021 is likely to drive an expansion of primary industries across the region including irrigated agriculture ash et al 2017 aquaculture cobcroft et al 2020 and extractive industries knudsen et al 2019 there is therefore an urgent need for research that assesses the response of australian tropical catchments to projected water resource development as well as climate change while the humid tropics have been the subject of important research on fine scale hydrological process understanding since the 1970 s and 1980 s e g bonell and gilmour 1978 bonell et al 1981 cassells et al 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 the seasonal or wet dry tropics have received comparatively less attention e g cook et al 1998 even though the latter occupy a much larger area of the australian tropics fig 1 despite recent efforts to collect field data from understudied areas the research coverage has been spatially uneven and observations remain limited across much of tropical australia petheram et al 2012a the disparate nature and limited number of field studies has precluded development of a robust conceptual framework for understanding the key hydrological processes at play in the region in this article we first describe the diversity of landscapes and climates across the region section 2 we then provide a historical perspective of the work carried out to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics section 3 and outline the more recent interest in hydrological process understanding across the seasonal tropics section 4 through several recent examples we show how the collection of isotopic and other data has provided new insight into the response of these highly dynamic systems to monsoonal rainfall pulses section 5 we then draw on these examples to propose a framework of dominant processes for the region in section 6 we discuss how current hydrological functions may be affected by climate change and potential water resource development lastly we highlight some of the remaining knowledge gaps in australia s tropical hydrology in the face of future development and climate change section 7 this review synthesises the processes that control the hydrological response of catchments across the australian tropics and as such there are topics that are outside of the scope of this paper we do not review the numerous hydrological and hydrogeological assessments conducted by state agencies and research organisations since the 1950 s e g water budgets of specific regions groundwater recharge estimates etc unless these studies have expanded our understanding of key hydrological processes likewise we do not review studies that investigate other aspects of the critical zone such as aquatic biogeochemistry nutrient and sediment fluxes through rivers as each of these topics could be the focus of review papers in their own right 2 landscape and climate drivers of streamflow in the australian tropics the australian tropics are broadly made up of two bioclimatic zones the humid tropics and the seasonal or wet dry tropics the latter covering most 99 of tropical australia fig 1a the humid tropics defined here as the area that falls under climate classes af am and cfa of the köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 are a region of rugged rainforest terrain along the eastern flanks of the great dividing range fig 1b with confined valleys and narrow coastal plains that support pasture and cropland the geology of the humid tropics comprises of ancient e g palaeozoic metamorphic and granitic formations partially overlain in places by more recent e g cainozoic lava flows and ash deposits while thick colluvial and alluvial deposits extend along the coastal plains jell 2013 the seasonal tropics defined here as the area that falls under climate classes aw bsh and cwa of the köppen geiger classification comprise highly weathered landscapes of generally low topography fig 1b that support mixed savanna woodland grassland a diverse range of geological settings occur across the seasonal tropics for instance sedimentary siliciclastic rocks in much of the kimberley and top end igneous and metamorphic rocks in the headwaters of the flinders gilbert and mitchell catchments in qld but also sedimentary carbonate rocks occurring sporadically across the daly and roper catchments in the northern territory nt as well as gulf of carpentaria region ahmad and munson 2013 groves et al 1994 jell 2013 in places the surface geology overlies large sedimentary basins that can contain highly permeable carbonate e g the cambrian limestone aquifer in the nt or siliciclastic formations e g grant group and poole sandstone aquifers in wa northern parts of the great artesian basin in qld fig 1b the seasonal tropic region also includes wide alluvial floodplains associated with meandering rivers and extensive wetlands that form during the wet season much of the land surface has been subjected to intense chemical weathering leading to widespread laterite formation another feature of the seasonal tropics are the numerous low lying islands off the top end coast in the gulf of carpentaria and along the coral sea and timor sea coastlines fig 1 these islands are often inhabited by indigenous australians hence have important water security considerations rainfall in both the wet and seasonal tropics is primarily driven by the southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone during the summer months davidson et al 1984 troup 1961 while early wet season events from november to december involve relatively short lived intense convective storms the shift to equatorial westerly winds around december brings large scale monsoonal conditions until april troup 1961 wheeler and mcbride 2005 during this second part of the wet season monsoonal bursts can last between a few days to a week or more and are characterised by convective cells that yield lower intensity but higher magnitude rainfall relative to early storms wheeler and mcbride 2005 tropical cyclones can also occasionally form in the vicinity of monsoonal depressions bringing more intense rainfall rainfall regimes during the wet season are broadly similar across the humid and seasonal tropics with 1000 3000 mm falling along the northern and eastern coast between november and april fig 2a a substantial rainfall gradient occurs from north to south in the seasonal tropics with semi arid tropical regions receiving lower rainfall amounts 500 mm during the wet season in the drier months may to october the two bioclimatic zones experience distinctly different rainfall patterns fig 2d rain in the seasonal tropics ceases almost completely for four to five months making the region one of the global hotspots for extreme rainfall seasonality feng et al 2013 in the humid tropics however the presence of the great dividing range enables south easterly winds to bring orographic rainfall to the region even during the austral winter ensuring rainfall of between 300 and 1000 mm between may and october both regions experience high rates of evaporation year round evaporation here refers to the bulk flux of water including transpiration following miralles et al 2020 with the highest rates during the wet season when precipitation and temperature are highest fig 2b 2e as a result the ratio between evaporation and rainfall or evaporative index is 1 in high rainfall areas during the wet season i e no rainfall deficit fig 2c but 1 during the dry season except for the humid tropics where rainfall occurs year round and for the semi arid inland areas to the south where evaporation is negligible given the lack of rainfall and low vegetation cover fig 2f this diversity in landscape and climate drivers results in significant differences in the hydrological regime of streams and rivers across the region fig 3 rivers of the humid tropics tend to flow year round with rainfall during the drier months ensuring regular replenishment of groundwater stores and sustained discharge to rivers e g daintree and north johnstone rivers in fig 3 in contrast many rivers of the seasonal tropics cease to flow during the prolonged dry season e g fitzroy river in fig 3 unless they are connected to large groundwater systems that sustain surface water flow via baseflow contributions e g daly river in fig 3 associated with the cambrian limestone aquifer because rainfall can be particularly irregular from year to year rivers of the seasonal tropics are also subject to considerable interannual variations in their flow regime petheram et al 2008b 3 humid tropics a legacy of research on stormflow generation hydrological research in tropical australia began in the 1970 s in the steep forested region of northeast qld with the establishment of a hydrological observatory in one of the most humid areas of australia near babinda south of cairns b in fig 1b where annual precipitation averages 4500 mm in what is often referred to as the babinda catchments a wide range of experimental approaches were applied to examine the response of streams to rainfall and the impact of logging on this response the site comprised two paired sub catchments namely south creek supporting intact rainforest and north creek which had been logged from the 1970 s to the late 1990 s the babinda observatory became one of the most intensely studied sites in the tropics e g bonell et al 1998 bonell and gilmour 1978 bonell et al 1981 cassells et al 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer et al 1994 these studies generated significant new understandings of storm runoff generation in the humid tropics as briefly detailed below early work in babinda showed that tropical rainforest catchments can be highly responsive to rainfall and capable of generating overland flow bonell and gilmour 1978 this finding contradicted the then prevailing view that forested catchments were dominated by subsurface stormflow in both south and north creek highly transmissive surface soil layers were underlain by a low permeability layer at 0 2 m depth which under high antecedent wetness and intense rainfall could result in saturation excess overland flow as a perched water table formed in the upper soil bonell et al 1983 1981 bonell and gilmour 1978 cassells et al 1985 subsurface stormflow was also observed and occurred mostly via preferential pathways along large root systems bonell and gilmour 1978 while stemflow contributed substantially to overland flow via branches that quickly funnelled rainfall to the ground herwitz 1986 in the 1980 s research in the babinda catchments contributed significantly to the emerging debate over the contributions of old or pre event and new or event water sources to the storm hydrograph under wet antecedent conditions and monsoon type rainfall event water dominated the runoff response elsenbeer et al 1995 yet under lower intensity rainfall less favourable to the generation of saturation excess overland flow large contributions from pre event water were observed both in south creek elsenbeer et al 1995 and north creek barnes and bonell 1996 it was also established that as the region transitioned to the drier season streamflow became dominated by older groundwater sources bonell et al 1998 1983 1981 recognising the necessary distinction between celerities pressure wave and velocities mass movement to characterise catchment response barnes and bonell 1996 were the first to incorporate isotopic tracers into a hydrological model a study that paved the way for a better integration of water transit times in catchment studies and for a widespread use of tracer time series in hydrology hrachowitz et al 2016 mcdonnell and beven 2014 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 sprenger et al 2019 overall the breadth of research conducted in the humid tropics of australia during that period inspired hydrological research in other tropical regions of the world e g elsenbeer and lack 1996 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 noguchi et al 1997 schellekens et al 2004 at a time when hydrological process understanding was predominantly focused on temperate regions 4 seasonal tropics recent scrutiny with the push to develop the north while hydrological monitoring and assessments in the seasonal tropics of australia have been conducted by state agencies since the 1960 s interest in small scale hydrological process understanding was relatively limited until the 2000 s among the few research studies undertaken in the 1970 s and 1980 s bonell and williams 1986 examined runoff patterns in an undisturbed savanna hillslope near torrens creek central north qld tck in fig 1b they found that infiltration excess overland flow developed during high intensity rainfall events on bare soil surfaces however over 95 of this runoff was redistributed and subsequently infiltrated a short distance downslope as a result of high soil hydraulic conductivity bonell and williams 1986 in another study in the burdekin river catchment br in fig 1b holt et al 1996 partly attributed the higher infiltration rates they observed in a lightly grazed savanna relative to an overgrazed site to higher termite activity within the topsoil these early findings suggest that both the extent of savanna vegetation cover and soil properties including soil fauna may be important determinants of runoff generation processes in the australian seasonal tropics with severe droughts impacting southern australian catchments northern catchments have been scrutinised since the mid 2000 s for potential development of primary industries commonwealth of australia 2015 several programs were launched that gave impetus to new research on the rivers of the region these programs e g tropical rivers and coastal knowledge established in 2007 northern australia sustainable yields project launched in 2008 northern australia environmental resources hub established in 2012 northern australia water resource assessment launched in 2015 fostered transdisciplinary research that delivered critical information on the extreme variability of flow regimes petheram et al 2008b 2012a and the effect of flow seasonality on riverine ecosystems e g douglas et al 2005 jardine et al 2015 leigh and sheldon 2008 warfe et al 2011 because groundwater development would potentially impact the continuity of dry season surface flow the role of intermediate to regional scale groundwater systems in maintaining baseflow to rivers was also investigated in detail across the region cook et al 2003 1998 gardner et al 2011 jolly et al 2013 leblanc et al 2015 smerdon et al 2012 return flow from bank storage was identified as an important process that can contribute significant proportions of baseflow to large rivers batlle aguilar et al 2014 doble et al 2012 another focus of these programs was to examine ecohydrological processes during the dry season with several studies demonstrating the reliance of riparian trees on groundwater cook and o grady 2006 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 overall we now have access to much needed baseline information on the biophysical environment of the seasonal tropics detailed investigations of hydrological processes specific to the region however have been limited until recently catchment functioning is likely to be fundamentally different in the tropics compared to temperate regions wohl et al 2012 wright et al 2018 yet our understanding of processes such as runoff generation sources and pathways of stormflow and groundwater contributions to surface flow remains fragmented for the seasonal tropics of australia recent efforts including modelling and observations based on environmental tracers e g water stable isotopes radioisotopes have helped clarify some of these processes as outlined in section 5 5 new insights from isotopic studies towards a baseline hydrological framework the use of environmental tracers has underlain key advances in the conceptual understanding of catchment processes kendall and mcdonnell 1998 in australia bonell and colleagues were pivotal in the development of tracer techniques as tools to unravel runoff generation processes e g barnes and bonell 1996 bonell et al 1998 bonell et al 1983 elsenbeer et al 1995 hensel and elsenbeer 1997 while these early investigations relied on a low number of measurements the advent of infrared isotope spectroscopy is now enabling high resolution observations at time scales that match those of fundamental hydrological drivers birkel et al 2012 von freyberg et al 2017 the ability to acquire high resolution isotopic data both oxygen 18o 16o or δ18o and hydrogen 2h 1h or δd is particularly important in tropical regions where stormflow events can be intense and short lived and where the isotopic composition of rainfall can be highly variable at sub hourly time scales munksgaard et al 2012 2020 over the last decade or so isotopic studies focussed on streams and rivers in tropical australia have advanced our understanding of the hydrological response of these systems to hydroclimatic drivers e g birkel et al 2020 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 tweed et al 2016 here we summarise the main findings from these and other studies and propose a broad framework of hydrological functioning for the region 5 1 hydrological responses to monsoonal rain recent research has shown that wet season rainfall can have distinct isotopic compositions over the course of the season largely dependent on cloud generation dynamics and their transport trajectories zwart et al 2016 2018 the large scale monsoonal convective systems that occur at the peak of the wet season are characterised by highly depleted δd and δ18o compared to earlier storms and to storms that occur between monsoonal bursts munksgaard et al 2020 zwart et al 2016 2018 furthermore tropical cyclones can bring rainfall with even more negative δd and δ18o values munksgaard et al 2015 such temporal variations in the isotopic composition of rainfall offer the opportunity to assess the response of australian tropical streams and rivers to different hydroclimatic drivers and their associated spatial and temporal patterns research has shown that runoff generation mechanisms in tropical australian catchments vary over the course of the wet season as a result of rainfall intensity and changing antecedent wetness conditions e g soil moisture and groundwater states analysing the hydrological response of seventeen mile creek sm in fig 1b a river north of katherine seasonal tropics montanari et al 2006 found that saturation excess overland flow occurred during the wettest months and after sustained monsoonal events this was despite high storage capacity within the catchment and a predominance of subsurface inflows during storms saturation excess can be attributed to the subdued topography and high soil permeability that may together induce optimal infiltration and ponding via a rise of the water table above the ground surface in the upper burdekin catchment br in fig 1b jarihani et al 2017 also attributed wet season overland flow to the filling and spilling of shallow soil storage these authors showed that infiltration excess was more likely to occur in the drier months due to high rainfall intensities and lower water tables to assess the relative proportions of different water sources to high flow events duvert et al 2020 developed mixing models adjusted to δ18o electrical conductivity and tritium measurements in the howard river a monsoon driven lowland system near darwin hr in fig 1b under high flow conditions most streamflow originated from the slow drainage of wetland and floodplain stores as well as from shallow groundwater discharge birkel et al 2020 used a semi distributed model based on δd and δ18o time series to simulate both water and solute movement in the same river system these authors confirmed the role of seasonal wetlands as receivers and temporary stores of shallow subsurface contributions during the wet season steeper catchments of the humid tropics are characterised by a wide range of hydrological responses although subsurface stormflow seems to be the prevailing mechanism in these systems bass et al 2014 measured the isotopic ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon 13c 12c δ13c in combination with δ18o and δd at a high resolution during a stormflow event in atika creek a pristine forested stream ack in fig 1b isotopic values showed an initial period of significant overland flow contribution but as streamflow peaked and receded the system rapidly switched to an almost entirely subsurface contribution subsurface stormflow has also been observed in cleared areas of the humid tropics tweed et al 2016 reported significant changes in δ18o and δd at peak flow in scheu creek an agricultural catchment south of cairns sck in fig 1b which they interpreted as enhanced discharge of shallow groundwater from saturated areas along the stream via translatory flow of pre event water under particularly high antecedent wetness conditions and intense rainfall however overland flow was found to dominate the response in forested catchments likely a result of the generally low permeability of the subsoil in certain areas bonell and gilmour 1978 elsenbeer et al 1995 herwitz 1986 while surface and shallow subsurface water sources tend to prevail during stormflow events deeper groundwater inflows can also play a key role in the hydrological response of australian tropical catchments despite the rapid flow response and the dominance of shallow sources in the howard river birkel et al 2020 found that deep groundwater upwelling led to overall relatively old 1 year streamflow even during monsoonal bursts similarly large contributions from old groundwater to peak flow were detected in early work by barnes and bonell 1996 during low intensity rainfall events groundwater discharging from fractured rock aquifers in upland areas of the humid tropics was also found to contribute the bulk of streamflow even under high flow conditions cook et al 2001 5 2 recharge pathways evidence shows the importance of riverbanks and alluvial deposits in storing monsoonal rainfall this process is particularly important in large low gradient rivers of the seasonal tropics and typically occurs through overbank flooding doble et al 2012 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018a the increase in river stage at the peak of the wet season can be very substantial with the width of inundation potentially exceeding 30 km in the lower fitzroy river karim et al 2018 groundwater recharge from overbank flooding occurs across much of the seasonal tropics and is likely to be the dominant recharge mechanism to alluvial aquifers in the more arid inland areas e g the bsh climate zone other localised recharge mechanisms are likely to occur across the region in part because of intense chemical weathering of the land surface which has resulted in large heterogeneities in the hydraulic conductivity of near surface materials for instance shallow lateritic horizons can contain solution cavities and macropores cook et al 1998 doyle 2001 hutley et al 2000 while in areas underlain by carbonate rocks karstification has created complex networks of sinkholes conduits and caves karp 2008 tickell 2011 such heterogeneous structures in the subsurface are likely to lead to preferential flow and recharge pathways which can represent a disproportionate contribution to aquifer recharge turnadge et al 2018 showed that recharged waters to a dolostone aquifer of the nt were not subject to evaporative fractionation this was inferred to be due to the bulk of recharge occurring via relatively fast localised pathways such as buried sinkholes this work was followed up by enemark et al 2020 who confirmed via model testing that depressions in the landscape likely act as conduits for preferential recharge but these mechanisms are not limited to carbonate systems for instance sandy paleochannels in upland outcrop areas of the mitchell catchment qld have also been identified as key recharge zones taylor et al 2018b inter aquifer flow can also be an important recharge process for lowland aquifer systems receiving limited diffuse recharge the fractured rock aquifers in upland areas of the great dividing range contribute to recharging alluvial and other sedimentary formations in the drier areas to the west such as the flinders and gilbert catchments jolly et al 2013 further work is needed to better quantify mountain front recharge and inter aquifer linkages across such areas overall the role of landscape and geological heterogeneities in controlling groundwater recharge and the contribution of preferential recharge and overbank flood recharge relative to diffuse recharge remain largely unknown across much of tropical australia 5 3 dry season water sources differences in the amplitude of rainfall seasonality strongly modulate the flow regimes of streams and rivers across the australian tropics petheram et al 2008b fig 3 after rainfall has largely ceased in the seasonal tropics the magnitude and duration of flow recession is a function of the storage capacity of adjacent temporary stores wetlands floodplains alluvial deposits riverbanks and of their state of connection with the channel fig 3 duvert et al 2020 and birkel et al 2020 showed that the slow drainage of waters previously stored in connected floodplains maintains surface flows in the howard river several months after the last rains in larger rivers return flow from bank and alluvial storage can be a major contributor to flow recession and potentially to dry season baseflow e g batlle aguilar et al 2014 jolly et al 2013 using simple numerical simulations based on cross sections of the fitzroy river in the kimberley fr in fig 1b doble et al 2012 demonstrated that after a major high flow event several years may be required for all water stored in riverbanks to return to the river after shallow water sources have been depleted the connection with larger deeper groundwater stores becomes an important determinant of the dry season flow regime in the seasonal tropics where and when surface systems are not connected to regional groundwater channels tend to break up into a series of discrete pools fig 3 using long term hydrological records and modelling cresswell et al 2009 suggested that intermittent streams and rivers are far more common than perennial systems across tropical australia this is often also the case in low lying islands where groundwater storage potential is very limited but see banks et al 2021 after surface flow has ceased subsurface flow often persists in the sandy deposits that underlie channels shanafield et al 2021 alternatively perennial surface flow occurs in areas where regional aquifer systems discharge into surface water systems fig 3 such as in the cambrian limestone aquifer e g cook et al 2003 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 the grant group and poole sandstone aquifers e g gardner et al 2011 harrington et al 2011 taylor et al 2018c or other sedimentary or fractured rock aquifers e g jolly et al 2013 leblanc et al 2015 where surface flow is perennial geological faults often provide preferential pathways for groundwater discharge harrington et al 2011 based on terrigenous helium 4 analyses gardner et al 2011 and smerdon et al 2012 estimated that the baseflow of the fitzroy and daly rivers fig 1b 3 had residence times of up to 1000 and 10 000 years respectively a major spring complex that feeds the roper river rr in fig 1b also had long residence times associated with the cambrian limestone aquifer with possibly even older contributions from formations underlying the cambrian limestone aquifer lamontagne et al 2021 late dry season streamflow in the howard river which is connected to a less extensive carbonate aquifer was 100 years old duvert et al 2020 in more humid regions shallow groundwater stores are likely to be replenished even during the drier months as a result of dry season storms providing abundant baseflow to rivers all year round fig 3 cook et al 2001 showed that groundwater inflows made up the main source of streamflow in areas of the atherton tableland qld at in fig 1b underlain by fractured basalt lava flows with isotopic evidence that young 30 years groundwater contained in the basalt discharged to streams throughout the year in upland areas where forest cover has remained intact mcjannet et al 2007 demonstrated the role of cloud interception as an important source of baseflow for streams during the drier months 5 4 uptake by vegetation due to the seasonal cycle in rainfall most vegetation communities across tropical australia are water limited during the dry season with evaporation rates as high as or higher than rainfall rates e p 1 fig 2 an exception to this situation is for the rainforests of the humid tropics where e p 1 even during the drier months mcjannet et al 2007 yet despite the near absence of dry season rain in the seasonal tropics not all ecosystems of the region are limited by water availability this is because water can occur in underground stores e g deep soil horizons or capillary fringe of the water table which support steady rates of overstorey evaporation through the dry season examples of this are the coastal savannas of the top end in the nt hutley et al 2000 2001 whitley et al 2011 but also riparian corridors and other groundwater dependent ecosystems scattered throughout the region e g canham et al 2021 drake and franks 2003 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 several studies have examined the extent to which riparian trees may be reliant on groundwater by comparing the isotopic composition both δ18o and δd of potential tree water sources soil water at different depths groundwater to that of xylem water studies have shown that riparian trees tend to use shallow groundwater stores at the end of the dry season canham et al 2021 cook and o grady 2006 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 although few species used groundwater exclusively these findings highlight the importance of alluvial and bank storage replenishment during the wet season in contrast savanna trees extract soil water from deep soil horizons suggesting little to no groundwater dependence hutley et al 2000 kelley et al 2007 however the studies by hutley et al 2001 and kelley et al 2007 were conducted in high rainfall coastal savannas and little is known about the patterns of tree water uptake in lower rainfall inland areas where savanna vegetation may be more vulnerable to changes in rainfall fig 2 as a complement to isotopic approaches remote sensing techniques can offer opportunities to assess evaporation fluxes at broader but also coarser scales using modis products at a 250 m resolution crosbie and rachakonda 2021 identified one area in the roper river catchment near mataranka nt rr in fig 1b where evaporation largely exceeds rainfall e p 1 a likely indication of groundwater dependence despite the challenge of modelling savanna evaporation due to the different water use patterns of trees and grasses recent modelling efforts have enabled improved estimates of the seasonal variations in the evaporation flux across the seasonal tropics zhuang et al 2020 more field observations are now needed to advance our understanding of the sources and temporal dynamics of root water uptake at both local and larger scales and how this uptake may affect other components of the water cycle such as recharge and runoff remotely sensed evaporation data have potential to improve streamflow modelling herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 and we believe that finer estimates of evaporation fluxes will also improve hydrological understanding and modelling at small catchment scales 6 anticipating hydrological responses to climate change and future development 6 1 interannual flow variability and unknown effects of climate change interannual variability in rainfall is 40 higher in tropical australia compared to other tropical regions of the world with similar mean annual rainfall petheram et al 2008b this variability can be explained by the influence of large scale atmospheric patterns such as the el niño southern oscillation enso nicholls et al 1997 interdecadal pacific oscillation power et al 1999 and by the episodic impact of cyclones across northern australia the effect of enso on rainfall can in turn drive significant interannual changes in river flow chiew and mcmahon 2002 as exemplified with the mitchell river fig 3 this interannual variability is particularly extreme in more arid inland areas of the australian tropics petheram et al 2008b where it is the rarer larger rainfall events that tend to generate aquifer recharge recent isotopic investigations suggest that the passage of tropical cyclones is key to replenishing groundwater stores in lower rainfall areas of the region meredith et al 2018 skrzypek et al 2019 climate models project an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in tropical australia alexander and arblaster 2017 jourdain et al 2013 although large uncertainties remain dey et al 2019 the effect of these expected changes on hydrological regimes are also uncertain with projections ranging from decreases by up to 26 to increases by up to 29 in mean annual runoff across the australian tropics petheram et al 2012b because runoff generation and flow duration are highly dependent on the timing and intensity of rainfall changes in rainfall may exacerbate river flow variability modelling by karim et al 2016 indicates that the connectivity between wetlands and rivers could last up to 20 less in a drier climate than under the current climate while the connectivity could be 5 longer under a wetter climate an increase in potential evaporation rates can also be expected in tropical australia pan et al 2015 likely driven by changes in rainfall temperature and increased atmospheric co2 noting there remains uncertainty around other key variables such as wind speed while we lack data to constrain the uncertainties in these processes it is possible that altered potential evaporation rates during key hydrological periods may alter the response of catchments particularly during shoulder seasons e g delayed wetting up or early drying out and potentially contribute to increased flow intermittency in addition the expected increase in cyclone intensity knutson et al 2015 might induce increased runoff and recharge in drier areas of the region obviously the above statements are speculative given the current lack of knowledge and further research investigating the effects of changing rainfall and evaporation patterns on the hydrological response of australian tropical streams and rivers is needed 6 2 development will alter hydrological partitioning and flow regimes agricultural development in the humid tropics of australia has occurred since the middle of the 19th century with land cleared for sugarcane production and pasture development for dairy and beef cattle harding 1972 kemp et al 2007 large scale deforestation particularly on the coastal plains has likely led to important changes in the hydrological response of catchments of the region some of which have been investigated in detail see section 3 in contrast the seasonal tropics have been historically less affected by land disturbance with much of the land used for extensive cattle grazing on improved and native savanna vegetation abares 2021 however since the 2000 s the federal state and local governments have focused on opportunities presented by the vast area and abundant water resources of the seasonal tropics see section 4 in recent years there has been a renewed push for development of primary industries in the seasonal tropics some of the policy initiatives responding to this push are the white paper on developing northern australia commonwealth of australia 2015 and the establishment of a 1b national water infrastructure development fund in 2018 with 200 m committed to northern australia hart et al 2020 watson et al 2021 the current desire to expand irrigated agriculture in the region is accompanied by an interest to develop shale gas extraction in several sedimentary basins including the beetaloo sub basin knudsen et al 2019 which underlies parts of the cambrian limestone aquifer fig 1 while these potential developments are likely to affect streamflow and groundwater dynamics considerable uncertainty remains as to how surface and groundwater systems will respond to these changes across the region some of the expected impacts are directly associated with land disturbance for instance in the few places where dryland cropping is viable and where savanna woodland will be replaced by cropland increases in storm runoff and decreases in infiltration can be anticipated an early study by ive et al 1976 near katherine in the nt k in fig 1b found that almost 40 of rainfall occurring on grassland was translated downslope as infiltration excess overland stormflow at a research farm in the daly river area dilshad and peel 1994 showed that tillage and low vegetation cover resulted in nearly twice as much overland flow relative to cropping soil under zero till conversely bartley et al 2014 found that increased ground cover in the semi arid tropics of the upper burdekin catchment resulted in lower hillslope runoff coefficients during early wet season events however the expected decreases in infiltration rates following soil disturbance may be counterbalanced by a decrease in evaporation resulting from the replacement of native vegetation by shallow rooted pasture or cropland groundwater level rise and waterlogging following land clearing has been a common observation in the southern parts of the country e g allison et al 1990 sharma et al 1987 and could eventuate in areas of the tropics where the water table is already shallow despite lacking detailed investigations these early results suggest that local modifications to the land cover and soil structure of tropical savannas may have considerable impacts on the partitioning between runoff and recharge in those areas aside from the direct effects of land use change which will likely be restricted to a small proportion of the landscape important questions arise from the potential impacts of water resource development projects first and foremost groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the mining industry may have important effects on flow regimes and groundwater dependent ecosystems modelling results reported by chan et al 2012 suggest that groundwater development may significantly alter the natural flow regime of the daly river nt in the dry season by increasing flow intermittency and reducing lateral river floodplain and longitudinal upstream downstream connectivity because the regional groundwater that discharges into rivers can be very old see section 5 3 the effects of groundwater abstraction on river baseflow may occur long after development started as was modelled for the roper river in the nt bruwer and tickell 2015 furthermore there is broad consensus from isotopic studies that riparian trees in the seasonal tropics tend to use shallow groundwater stores at the end of the dry season canham et al 2021 cook and o grady 2006 duvert et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 indicating that a lowering of the water table due to groundwater development may alter the composition and abundance of some riparian ecosystems apart from impacts linked to groundwater abstraction unconventional gas mining operations may further alter natural groundwater flow processes hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction has the potential to increase the connectivity between exploited aquifers and deeper formations via preferential flow through faults or fractures myers 2012 of interest in the northern australian context are the possible vertical connections between the cambrian limestone aquifer and underlying formations containing high salinity water frery et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2021 the construction of dams for irrigation is also likely to affect the hydrological functioning of streams and rivers in northern australia dam release during the dry season means that some intermittent streams can become permanent e g bunn et al 2006 with potentially important ecological consequences close et al 2012 rolls and bond 2017 another dam related impact is the possible reduction of downstream flooding due to the storage and capture of flood waters during the wet season karim et al 2015 estimated that the construction of large dams in the flinders and gilbert catchments would have a relatively small impact on river floodplain connectivity but nielsen et al 2020 found that the inundated area of floodplains in the lower reaches of the mitchell river could potentially be reduced by 50 following dam construction while this has not been examined in detail the decrease in flooding extent and duration may also result in decreasing rates of overbank flood recharge a key recharge process in much of the region another effect of dams and irrigation could be the rising of water tables and increasing salinity in shallow aquifers as was observed in the lower burdekin catchment in qld petheram et al 2008a while small scale water harvesting is the more likely type of development in northern australia it is necessary to anticipate the hydrological impacts of the few large dams that might be built across the region petheram et al 2018 overall there remains important unknowns surrounding how future land use change and water resource development will impact the hydrology of northern australian streams rivers and aquifers as well as their associated ecosystems while basic hydrological assessments and modelling are certainly needed to address these unknowns and anticipate future change there is an equally important need for research programs that generate new data examine hydrological processes at different scales and the way these respond to different forcing and advance our conceptual understanding of catchment functioning in tropical australia we believe this should be achieved through intensive and long term studies of experimental catchment observatories that capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region as detailed in section 7 7 a research agenda for hydrological science in tropical australia despite improved understanding over recent decades our knowledge of key hydrological processes in the australian tropics remains incomplete limited observations across this vast and diverse tropical region prevent a more detailed description of the role of heterogeneities in both landscape and meteorological factors in modulating hydrological responses in addition to new observations we also need new cross disciplinary initiatives centred on the understanding of the critical zone i e the near surface environment from treetops to the water table as an integrated system made of interacting components and processes improved coordination among hydrological subdisciplines and with other disciplines can facilitate the development of hydrological theory and prediction of hydrological functioning across time and space brooks et al 2015 through the utilisation of multiple disciplines we can develop a baseline understanding of how tropical streams and rivers function at present against which to assess the effects of future development and climate change wright et al 2018 in the following we propose five broad research areas that we believe should be priorities for future hydrological research in northern australia these areas relate to 1 stormflow response 2 groundwater recharge 3 interactions with vegetation 4 groundwater discharge and 5 hydrological dis connectivity for each research area we outline the need for improved mechanistic understanding as well as implications in the context of future development and climate change we conclude by discussing the needs to build a network of experimental observatories across the tropics and to better integrate indigenous perspectives into hydrological science and management 7 1 stormflow response can we improve our conceptual understanding of the dominant runoff processes across the region and develop spatialised estimates of the partitioning between runoff and infiltration in lowland areas of the australian tropics saturation excess overland flow may be the dominant runoff mechanism but more observations are needed to evaluate the exact role of saturated areas along streams and rivers in generating runoff during the wetter months only by understanding how streamflow is generated across the landscape can we then predict the likely impacts of development on these processes additionally the potential occurrence of preferential flow pathways through macropores in shallow lateritic horizons as observed in other settings cuthbert and tindimugaya 2010 ruprecht and schofield 1993 needs further examination in the northern australian context particularly in relation to how macropores contribute to the hydrological response of catchments under monsoonal conditions one other key question is related to the way land disturbance whether it is clearing for agriculture change in fire management regimes or weed infestation may impact the partitioning between runoff and infiltration for example an important component of land use in the seasonal tropics is extensive livestock grazing abares 2021 grazing can significantly reduce infiltration rates due to soil compaction and erosion gifford and hawkins 1978 greenwood and mckenzie 2001 and decreased termite activity holt et al 1996 likewise post logging changes in soil properties and vegetation cover have led to decreased infiltration and increased overland flow during stormflow events in both the humid bonell 1993 cassells et al 1985 and seasonal tropics ive et al 1976 we need new field studies that assess the effect of both land clearing and changed grazing intensity on infiltration and recharge rates for contrasting areas of the australian tropics importantly changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change will be superimposed over any impacts from land use change studies that combine both these driving factors will provide key information to resource managers and decision makers 7 2 recharge what are the relative contributions of overbank flood recharge and other preferential recharge pathways across the australian tropics overbank flooding likely plays a major role in recharging the alluvial and underlying aquifers of large low gradient rivers doble et al 2012 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018a however there has been little effort to accurately quantify this recharge pathway and to highlight its importance in replenishing groundwater systems of the seasonal tropics relative to diffuse recharge this is much needed information especially if we are to predict the effect of dam construction and or groundwater abstraction on the loss of downstream river floodplain connectivity and in turn on recharge rates other recharge pathways also need more research the typically heterogeneous subsurface in tropical australia resulting from intense weathering and tectonic deformation indicates that much of the unsaturated and saturated flow may occur via preferential pathways e g enemark et al 2020 jolly et al 2013 taylor et al 2018b despite its importance the role of structural heterogeneities in controlling groundwater recharge as well as vertical connectivity remains unclear in the region new studies should focus on assessing the contribution of preferential flow as a recharge pathway to underlying aquifers relative to diffuse recharge and overbank flood recharge imaging the structures of the subsurface via geophysical measurements is a promising avenue for the delineation of preferential pathways for instance airborne electromagnetic surveys have been successfully used to map geomorphologic features relevant to hydrological processes christensen et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 parsekian et al 2015 ultimately these data will enable better management and protection of the areas identified as key recharge zones and ensure long term more sustainable use of groundwater resources 7 3 plant water uptake what is the role of vegetation in partitioning water fluxes and can we predict the vulnerability of different vegetation communities to change water uptake by vegetation plays a central role in the hydrological cycle as it partitions rainfall into evaporation and recharge from a hydrological point of view accurate understanding of the mechanisms and patterns of plant water uptake is vital to successfully simulate catchment flow processes knighton et al 2020 kuppel et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 yang et al 2016 in tropical australia most studies have focused on identifying groundwater use by riparian trees in the dry season e g canham et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2005 o grady et al 2006 but many questions remain regarding both temporal and cross ecosystem variations in plant water use for instance little is known about the sources and patterns of water uptake for different vegetation types savanna rainforest riparian corridors and how these vary under different wetness conditions in situ isotope measurements although still in their infancy can be particularly useful to fingerprint the sources of water extracted by vegetation and changes over time kühnhammer et al 2022 seeger and weiler 2021 spot measurements of stable isotopes can also add important information although questions currently arising around the potential biases associated with water extraction techniques should not be ignored allen and kirchner 2022 barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 because plant water uptake and productivity are also controlled by the structure of the subsurface particularly in water limited environments geophysical methods can provide additional insights into where plants obtain water brooks et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 a solid understanding of plant water uptake at local and regional scales is a critical step towards addressing the potential impacts of water resource development on vegetation communities key questions remain on the condition and abundance of groundwater dependent ecosystems how these may change under different types of development and whether species can adapt in response to changes in water table depth particularly in the dry season while clear advances have been made to predict the ecological responses of riverine ecosystems to changes in surface water flow e g pettit et al 2017 warfe et al 2011 much more needs to be done to understand how groundwater dependent vegetation may respond to human induced and climate change impacts 7 4 groundwater discharge how old and vulnerable are groundwater and spring systems across the australian tropics compared to the detailed investigations of springs in the arid zone of australia e g flook et al 2020 keppel et al 2012 love et al 2013 there is limited information on flow pathways and water ages of spring systems in the tropics groundwater contained in the large sedimentary basins of northern australia can be extremely old e g harrington et al 2011 reported groundwater from the grant group and pool sandstone aquifers over 30 000 years old and it has been shown that several spring fed rivers of the region are sustained by deep old groundwater sources gardner et al 2011 lamontagne et al 2021 smerdon et al 2012 however an inventory and assessment of the origins of spring water their age and yield for northern australia is currently lacking this information is key to understanding the vulnerability of tropical springs to future development for instance the effect of groundwater abstraction on river baseflow and or spring yields may not be experienced for several decades or centuries because of the lags inherent to old regional groundwater systems all three major aquifer systems fig 1b have extensive unconventional gas reserves and the availability of water for hydraulic fracturing is a contentious issue for local communities given the cultural and environmental significance of springs in northern australia it is essential that the best available science is used to assess vulnerability prior to project approvals where spring flow may be affected the approval of the carmichael coal mine in qld is a high profile example where this was not the case currell et al 2020 furthermore there is limited data on the importance of groundwater discharge into other aquifers i e inter aquifer flow although this may be an important pathway in areas located downgradient of upland fractured rock aquifers jolly et al 2013 as water allocation policy in australia seeks to avoid double allocation future research should aim to quantify these inter aquifer linkages 7 5 flow intermittency can we anticipate how flow regimes and hydrological connectivity will be affected by climate change and development there is a clear need to assess the security of water supply in the australian tropics under future climate and development scenarios while climate models generally project an increase in the intensity and possibly frequency of extreme rainfall events in tropical australia the effect of these changes on hydrological regimes have been rarely considered the impact of potential changes to rainfall patterns requires further investigation but uncertainties in climate model predictions present challenges for example simulations across northern australia under a 1 c warming scenario resulted in an increase in runoff for half the global climate models tested and in a decrease for the other half petheram et al 2012b one possible scenario is that shifts in flow regimes due to changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration will exacerbate the duration and frequency of dry phases döll and schmied 2012 a recent study suggests that flow intermittency has increased in australia in the past few decades sauquet et al 2021 although there was no clear trend for tropical rivers because increased intermittency would have large implications for riverine ecosystem health datry et al 2016 rolls and bond 2017 the mechanisms by which climate change may exacerbate or reduce flow intermittency require further examination non perennial river systems are governed by distinctive and complex hydrological processes that have not yet been fully described shanafield et al 2021 better understanding these processes in the northern australian context is imperative for anticipating the potential consequences of altered flow regimes across the region also important is the potential effect of water resource development dam construction and or groundwater abstraction with dam construction likely to suppress flow intermittency bunn et al 2006 and groundwater abstraction likely to increase flow intermittency and reduce connectivity chan et al 2012 king et al 2015 mccallum et al 2013 the few studies that have modelled the impacts of development scenarios in northern australia suggest that reductions in flow connectivity may occur e g nielsen et al 2020 we now need further research that underpins an ability to predict the responses of tropical streams and rivers to future climate and development scenarios 7 6 towards a network of observatories as illustrated by the pioneering work carried out in the babinda catchments long term and intensive monitoring of experimental sites is essential to advance our understanding of the hydrological cycle burt and mcdonnell 2015 highlight that the hydrological community needs long term experimental catchments in the tropics where observations remain scarce and process understanding is lacking in the seasonal tropics in particular the lack of high resolution and long term hydrological data continues to limit our hydrological understanding as well as the robustness of water resource assessments and thereby water allocation policy petheram et al 2012a observations are required not only to unravel the processes of streamflow generation recharge pathways and ecohydrological interactions but also to develop and test predictive models and ultimately to provide an evidence base for informed decision making tetzlaff et al 2017 there are established networks of experimental catchments in north america e g white et al 2015 and in europe e g bogena et al 2016 gaillardet et al 2018 and the emerging australian critical zone observatory network ozczo funded through the australian research council represents a step forward in integrating below and above ground environmental processes but at this stage focuses mostly on the soil and groundwater compartments of the critical zone similarly the newly established 15 million long term groundwater monitoring network groundwater super science funded through the national collaborative research infrastructure strategy does not include any sites in the tropics working towards the establishment of a network of research observatories across tropical australia should be a priority and to this end the daintree rainforest observatory dro in the humid tropics bass et al 2011 dro in fig 1b could be paired with representative catchments of the seasonal tropics such as the weany creek long term monitoring site bartley et al 2006 2014 koci et al 2020 wck in fig 1b in addition to the acquisition of high resolution data a key focus of these observatories should be the extrapolation and upscaling from small experimental catchments to larger regional river and groundwater systems cross site comparisons can help with identifying mechanisms that are generalisable across space and time brooks et al 2015 experimental sites will contribute to accurate and long term quantification of water and energy fluxes at the regional scale which will in turn assist management and policy decisions such evidence base is particularly needed in the northern australian context with the predicted effects of climate change and the ongoing push by the federal and state governments for the development of primary and mining industries 7 7 integrating indigenous perspectives indigenous people make up a large proportion of the population in northern australia and almost two thirds of remote indigenous communities rely primarily on groundwater for their main source of drinking water australian bureau of statistics 2006 many of these communities are facing increasingly pressing issues that undermine their water security including groundwater depletion and heavy metal contamination howey and grealy 2021 to address these water security issues both local and regional scale assessments of surface and groundwater systems are urgently needed across remote areas of northern australia more generally water governance in australia has largely overlooked the interests and perspectives of indigenous australians until recently jackson et al 2015 o donnell et al 2022 greater involvement of indigenous organisations will be key to the success of future water resource development projects across the north research aimed at integrating and translating indigenous knowledge of hydrological systems into western science is necessary to not only improve understanding of indigenous water resource use

clue s model and the soil and water assessment tool swat model were used and four land use scenarios s1 preference for dry land s2 historical trend s3 preference for paddy land and s4 grain for green were designed based on different preference in agricultural land and the ggp the responses of runoff sediment yields and economic benefits were compared under each land use scenario new hydrological insights for the region we find that s1 increases runoff and sediment yields s3 and s4 decrease runoff and sediment yields and s2 slightly increases runoff and reduces sediment yields different types of agricultural land mainly affected runoff by redistributing surface and subsurface runoffs paddy land would increase subsurface runoff and decrease surface runoff and sediment yields in contrast to dry land the economic benefit could be increased under s3 and be opposite under other scenarios promoting paddy farming in a water rich watershed can mitigate soil erosion conserve groundwater and gain more economic benefits simultaneously graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural land type grain for green program clue s model swat model hydrological response soil erosion 1 introduction with the rapid development of human civilisation a dramatic change has occurred in land use causing a series of changes in hydrological processes gashaw et al 2018 further resulting in problems such as soil erosion wang et al 2019b drought zhang et al 2022 and flood szwagrzyk et al 2018 in this context much research has been conducted to investigate the changes to hydrological processes which result from land use change and the connection between these changes du et al 2012 osei et al 2019 yang et al 2006 to accommodate the food demand of an increasing population during recent decades more forests and grasslands have been converted into agricultural land resulting in severe soil erosion and pollution kijowska strugała et al 2018 ouyang et al 2018 with the emergence of this problem an increasing body of research is being conducted regarding the erosion caused by agricultural activities worldwide china s population makes up around 19 of the total world s population however its agricultural land is around only 7 of the world s total therefore china is under significant food producing pressure and as a result of china s intensive agricultural land distribution severe soil erosion has also occurred in some regions that are mainly covered by agricultural land on a steep slope teng et al 2019 in china the soil erosion that is driven by water affects an area of 3 6 10 6 k m 2 which represents approximately 37 of the country s area fang et al 2017 as china pays more and more attention to sustainable development an important policy named grain for green program ggp has been practised since 2003 to mitigate the soil erosion brought about by agricultural activities wang et al 2002 the ggp has facilitated the conversion of bare and agricultural land to grasslands shrublands and forests especially in steep slope areas lei et al 2012 this program has positive effects on the control of soil erosion deng et al 2019 long et al 2006 but also leads to a decrease in domestic agricultural land this would exacerbate the contradiction between decreasing agricultural land and increasing demand for food brought by the increase of population agricultural land generates a substantial amount of sediment compared to other land use types feng et al 2016 yao et al 2016 but different types of agricultural land broadly divided into paddy land and dry land have different runoff and sediment generation characteristics gao et al 2020 yao et al 2016 due to their different planting characteristics e g soil surface disturbance crops root characteristics leaf area index some researchers reveal that paddy land will produce significantly less sediment than dry land ouyang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 this may encourage the local farmer to choose paddy land agriculture as a better way for some watersheds where developing agricultural economies can mitigate local soil erosion rather than abandoning agricultural practice therefore the research hypothesis of this paper is rather than changing the agricultural lands into forests simply converting the types of agricultural lands would be an alternative for the ggp the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model lambin et al 2000 is one of the commonly used models in simulating future land use maps henríquez dole et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 lamichhane and shakya 2019 used the clue s model to generate several future land use maps and evaluate the response of the groundwater recharge under different population growth scenarios in kathmandu valley nepal peng et al 2020 combined the random forest and clue s model to simulate the wetland distribution under different development scenarios in wuhan city hubei province china the soil water assessment tool swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model which is widely used in the research of hydrological simulation li and deliberty 2020 pirnia et al 2019 and hydrological responses under land use change conditions anand et al 2018 ghaffari et al 2010 wu et al 2017 yu et al 2018a has modified the swat model and used it in the flood simulation which achieved good performance choubin et al 2019 and mosavi et al 2021 used the swat model to develop new methods to simulate the streamflow in ungauged watersheds in iran recently the swat and clue s models have been combined and widely used to investigate the hydrology and n p load responses under different land use scenarios baker and miller 2013 wagner et al 2017 wang et al 2018a zhou et al 2013 such as szalinska et al 2020 combined the clue s model and swat model to simulate the sediment load variations under different climate and land use changes in a carpathian catchment khoi et al 2021 evaluate the streamflow and sediment load responses to different future land use change in the be river basin vietnam wang et al 2018a combined the swat model and clue s model to optimize the land use for better non point source pollution control however research comparing the responses of runoff soil erosion and economic benefit to different agricultural land development scenarios and ggp by combining swat and clue s models has not been conducted the primary purpose of this research is to investigate the response of runoff sediment yields and economic benefit to different agricultural type distributions under different agricultural land development and ggp to verify whether converting types of agricultural land can mitigate soil erosion and be an alternative for the grain for green program 2 methods 2 1 research approach for this research purpose the following approach is proposed in this paper 1 design four land use scenarios to represent different preferences in agricultural types and gpp 2 simulate a future land use map in the xxw under four different land use scenarios 3 apply the validated swat model to simulate the runoff and sediment yields under four scenarios 4 analyse the runoff sediment yields and economy responses under the four scenarios and find a suitable land use scenario for mitigating soil erosion 2 2 study watershed the xixian hydrological station is located at the source of the huaihe river basin hrb in mid eastern china the xixian watershed xxw drainage area is approximately 10 200 km2 30 50 32 45 n 111 15 115 e and was selected as the study area fig 1 the southwestern area of the xxw is a mountainous area where the highest elevation is 1110 m above sea level and plains dominate the central and eastern areas the watershed is in a subtropical monsoon zone with annual rainfall and average evaporation of 800 1400 mm and 800 1000 mm respectively most rainfall occurs during the flood season from june to september taking up around 60 of the annual rainfall which leads to an uneven distribution of water resources throughout the year there are two reservoirs sited in the centre of the xxw which are used for flood control and irrigation the hrb is a substantial food producing base in china which is suffering severe soil erosion wei et al 2022 and the soil erosion within the xxw accounts for 68 4 of the whole hrb cai et al 2012 the leading economy within the xxw is agriculture and approximately 56 of the watershed is agricultural land and part of it is experiencing severe soil erosion shi et al 2013 but it is not ideal to mitigate soil erosion by the ggp in regions such as the xxw because it may lead to a reduction of food production and a further decrease in the local economy paddy land and dry land are the main patterns of agricultural land in this region with a proportion of about 1 2 as the property of the paddy land and dry land is differ in many aspects maybe it is possible to mitigate local soil erosion by converting agricultural land types with a suitable preference land use instead of ggp in the xxw 2 3 scenario design the main agricultural land types are dry land and paddy land the dry land and paddy land area are mainly planted with wheat and rice for economic benefit within the xxw in order to explore the changes in runoff sediment yields and economy under different land use scenarios compared to the base scenario present land use condition in 2015 named as s0 four land use scenarios were created based on different preferences to agricultural land types and gpp the development period is defined from 2015 to 2030 during the development period the amount of each type of land use was gradually changed linearly and finally reach the target amount for each scenario for one preferred type of agricultural land its proportion would be increased during the development period otherwise it would be decreased for gpp the extent of forest would be increased with a decrease in agricultural land under this consideration four land use scenarios were designed as follows s1 preference to dry land during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land reaches 4 1 in 2030 while keeping other types of land use development with the historical trend during 2000 2015 s2 keeping historical trends during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land remains as 2 1 the same as the proportion during 2000 2015 s3 preference to paddy land during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land reaches 1 4 in 2030 while keeping other types of land use development with the historical trend during 2000 2015 s4 carry out the gpp during the development period under this scenario agricultural land converted into the forest with the area of agricultural land decreased to the minimum area required to be reserved by the government the increased forest area was used to plant the tea tree 2 4 models introduction and setup 2 4 1 clue s model 2 4 1 1 model description the clue s model consists of two independent modules a quantitative demand module and a spatial allocation module verburg et al 2002 it is widely used for land use spatial prediction and has provided satisfactory results verburg and overmars 2007 wang et al 2018b woldesenbet et al 2017 the quantitative demand module calculates the quantity of all types of land use in the study region and the main methods used in this module include trend extrapolation the markov model and other economic models zheng et al 2015 the spatial allocation module allocates the distribution of land uses in space at a raster scale according to the spatial suitability of land uses within the study region the spatial suitability of land uses is calculated by the following equation eq 1 1 t p r o p i u p i u e l a s u i t e r u where tprop i u is the total suitability of land use type for raster p i is the suitability of land use type u for the raster calculated by logistic regression lin et al 2011 based on the distribution of land use and driving factors elas u is the coefficient of elasticity for change of land use type u and iter u is the variable for model iteration the fitness of the logistic regression model was measured by the relative operating characteristic roc curves pontius schneider 2001 which were calculated by spss software to characterise the spatial correlations between land uses and driving factors the roc ranges from 0 5 to 1 with a better fit when it is closer to 1 the kappa index viera and garrett 2005 was used to measure the clue s model s performance in simulating the land use change within the study area the value of the kappa index range from 0 to 1 in most cases the higher value is the more accurate the simulation result is and a value higher than 0 7 is acceptable wang et al 2018a the kappa index is calculated by the following equation 2 k a p p a p 0 p c p p p c where p 0 is the correct simulation proportion p c is the expected correct simulation proportion the value in this study is 1 6 and the p p is the correct simulation proportion under ideal conditions 2 4 1 2 model setup the primary data requirements for the clue s model are land use maps in different periods and driving factors in space to calibrate the clue s model land use in 2000 and 2015 were selected as the primary and objective land use maps the land use was reclassified into six classes as follows paddy land dry land forest grassland water and urban area and 16 driving factors belonging to four categories table 2 were chosen to explain the land use distribution in space the land use demands from 2000 to 2015 were calculated by linear interpolation under s1 s2 and s3 the land use demands for forest grassland water and urban area from 2015 to 2030 were predicted by linear extrapolation based on the historical trend and the remaining area was allocated to paddy land and dry land according to the different proportions under s4 the land use demands for grassland water and urban area from 2015 to 2030 were predicted by linear extrapolation based on the historical trend the demands for paddy land and dry land were kept the minimum value regulated by the government and the remaining area was allocated to the forest based on the land use transfer matrix analysis from the land use map in 2000 and 2015 we defined the land use could transfer to all other land use types freely but with different probabilities the roc for all land use types was between 0 79 and 0 94 table 3 which showed a good cross correlation between all land use types and driving factors and the logistic regression result was adequate for the clue s model pontius schneider 2001 the elastic coefficient is an important parameter that would influence the spatial allocation of each type of land use in the clue s model land use will be more challenging to convert into other land uses if its elastic coefficient is closer to 1 verburg et al 2002 after calibrating the clue s model with the kappa index as the objective function the elastic coefficient for paddy land dry land forest grassland water and urban area were set to the value of 0 8 0 83 0 94 0 85 0 9 and 0 95 respectively the total amount of grids in the xixian watershed is 163 128 and the correctly simulated amount is 160 098 the kappa coefficient for the simulation accuracy is 0 98 which indicates that the clue s model can simulate the regional land use development well then maps of the future land use were simulated for each scenario by using the calibrated clue s model 2 4 2 swat model the swat model arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used hydrological models to investigate hydrological responses under land use changes messina and biggs 2016 nie et al 2011 woldesenbet et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 the swat model is physically based and semi distributed dividing a watershed into sub watersheds and further sub dividing the sub watersheds into hydrological response units hrus according to the simulating hydrologic processes by land use types slopes and soil types the swat2012 neitsch et al 2011b was used in this study in the swat model water balance is the central governing equation for all variable simulations and the simulation is separated into two sections the runoff generation section and the flow routing section the runoff generation section is separated into three parts for simulation surface runoff evapotranspiration and subsurface runoff in this study the overland runoff and evapotranspiration were estimated by the scs curve number method boughton 1989 and the penman monteith method howell and evett 2004 respectively the processes of subsurface runoff were simulated through the infiltration rule the flow routing section is calculated by the characteristic river length method williams 1969 the sediment simulation consists of erosion simulation and sediment transport simulation in this study the modified universal soil loss equation musle willams 1975 which was developed from the universal soil loss equation usle was applied to simulate soil erosion the musle contains a factor named the minimum value of the usle c factor for water erosion and the factor s value can change according to different land covers these characteristics bring about convenience in this research on sediment simulation under land cover changes the value of usle c was calibrated for each main land use type paddy land dry land and forest the simplified bagnold model arnold et al 1995 was selected to simulate sediment transportation generally the swat model controls the growth of the crops by daily accumulated heat unit theory neitsch et al 2011a in our research the real crops schedules were imported into the swat model for paddy and dry land as the actual farming conditions of xxw the paddy and dry land were mainly used to plant rice and wheat respectively according to the statistics from the chinese academy of sciences the farming activities within the xxw are mainly dominated by a double cropping system which means that both rice and wheat are all harvested twice a year the rice was sowing in march and july and harvested in july and october respectively the wheat was sowing in april and september and harvested in september and april next year respectively the swat model automatically performs irrigation operations according to the needs during the growth of different crops as well as fertilizer operation the performance of runoff and sediment yields simulations were evaluated by using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the performance is satisfactory if they meet the following conditions moriasi et al 2007 when 1 nse 0 5 2 the absolute value of pbias is lower than 25 and 55 for runoff and sediment yields respectively and 3 rsr 0 7 in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method integrated in swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2013 was chosen to automatically calibrate the swat model constructed for the studied area which was used widely in calibration and validation of the swat model and proven to be a useful optimisation method abbaspour et al 2018 constructing a swat model simulation needs data including digital elevation models dems soil types land use maps and hydrologic and climate data runoff sediment yields rainfall and some other climate data the data sources are described in table 1 in detail the watershed was separated into 36 sub watersheds and further divided into 675 hrus and ensured that each hru within a sub watershed is made up of a distinctive group of land use types soil and slope range measured daily rain from 20 precipitation gauges was inputted into the model and the swat model was used for monthly simulation then calibrated parameters based on observed runoff and sediment data to simulate runoff and sediment yields satisfactorily tables 2 3 2 4 3 model combination for each land use scenario the quantity of each land use will be obtained and be inputted into the calibrated clue s model to simulate the spatially distributed land use map the simulated land use maps will then be inputted into the calibrated swat model to simulate the runoff and sediment yields fig 2 to decrease the model uncertainties we simulated the runoff and sediment yields series in the xxw from 1982 to 2003 based on the measured historical daily precipitation and the calibrated swat model under five scenarios s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 these simulated runoff and sediment series will be used in the following scenarios analyses the significance of the difference between s1 s2 s3 s4 and base scenario s0 was analyzed by the analysis of variance anova st and wold 1989 2 5 economic and ecological benefits calculation methods the economic benefits in this research were separated into two parts the ecological benefit and the local farmer s economic income for the ecological benefit it includes the benefit on water conservation and soil conservation for the local farmer s economic income it represents the economic income for farmers from the land use scenario these two kinds of economic benefits are related to this research directly the ecological benefits were calculated by the changes of water and sediment yields the farmer s income would affect the farmer s choice of which type of agricultural land to adopt 2 5 1 ecological benefit in this research the economic benefits brought by the changes in sediment and water yields were used to evaluate the ecological benefits for each land use scenario the ecological benefits wang et al 2017 were divided into water conservation benefit and soil conservation benefit and their calculation methods were introduced as below water conservation benefit wang et al 2017 is determined by the water storage cost of the reservoir project it is calculated as the following equation eq 3 3 u c o n w a t e r c r e s p where the u c o n w a t e r is the water conservation benefit cny c r e s is the unit storage cost cny m 3 in this research the value of c r e s is 10 cny m 3 in 2015 p is the water conservation amount m 3 soil conservation benefit is calculated by the production value substitution method wang and wang 2001 according to the total amount of soil erosion and the average thickness of the cultivated layer of the country the method calculates the amount of soil conservation measures to reduce the loss of land resources and then calculates the output value of the crops that could be produced on the land the soil conservation benefit is calculated as the following equation eq 4 4 u c o n s o i l 2 q v 10000 ρ h where the u c o n s o i l is the soil conservation benefit cny q is the amount of the annual soil conservation t v is the crop economic benefit per unit area c n y h m 2 a the average economic benefit of paddy land and dry land is adopted as the value of v 46 826 c n y h m 2 a ρ is the soil density t m 3 the value of ρ is 2 65 t m 3 as announced by the related department h is the thickness of cultivated soil layer m the value of h is 0 207 m in xinyang city henan province 2 5 2 local farmer s economic income in this research the difference between different land use scenarios is mainly the difference between paddy land dry land and forest therefore the local farmer s economic output value per unit area of paddy land dry land and the forest is statistics and calculated the crops on paddy land and forest are regarded as rice and tea respectively the crops on dry land are regarded as wheat and vegetable the crop output per area was calculated through the average value range 2015 2019 via the xinyang statistical information network http www xytjj gov cn the unit price of the crop was counted from the market survey then the output value per unit area was calculated for paddy land dry land and forest the statistical results were shown in table 4 from table 4 the average output value per unit area of paddy land dry land and forest were 55 568 cny ha 38 083 97 cny ha and 44 346 09 cny ha respectively through the research of some scholars the rice fish co culture system could increase the income of paddy land by 1 42 bashir et al 2021 3 84 zhang et al 2016 and 3 39 hu et al 2013 times respectively in our study we adopt the average value of these results suppose the rice fish co culture system could increase the income of paddy land by 2 88 times which means that the average output value per unit area of paddy land was 160 035 8 cny ha when adopting the rice fish co culture system 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the swat model using t stat and p value abbaspour 2013 as the indices to measure the parameters sensitivity from the total parameters related to the runoff process the most sensitive parameters within the watershed are cn2 sol awc and gwqmn table 5 apart from these parameters sol bd sol z sol k rchrg dp hru slp surlag and ov n were also selected as sensitive parameters and were calibrated for the sediment simulation all parameters related to sediment yielding processes i e including usle p spexp spcon ch cov1 ch cov2 and usle c were taken into consideration the usle c parameter was calibrated for different key land use types resulting in a usle c parameter of 0 241 0 417 and 0 057 for paddy land dry land and forest respectively this approach aims to reflect the difference of sediment yield generation characters through the difference of the same parameter under different land use types the warm up period calibration periods and validation periods were 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2003 respectively as seen in table 6 and fig 3 for runoff simulation values of nse were higher than 0 85 and values of pbias and rsr were lower than 3 6 and 0 38 respectively during both calibration and validation periods for sediment yield simulations values of nse were higher than 0 79 and values of pbias and rsr were lower than 0 9 and 0 46 respectively during both calibration and validation periods fig 4 the overall accuracy for runoff and sediment yields simulation was good and the simulation results are acceptable compared with the criterion proposed by moriasi et al 2007 table 6 the swat model takes the daily rainfall as the input data but does not consider the actual rainfall distribution among one day nie et al 2011 which would reduce the flood peak and result in a relatively low peak runoff as to sediment yields simulation higher uncertainties were caused by equifinality for different parameters precipitation monitoring flow monitoring and missing sediment concentration however the total amount of sediment yields was simulated well according to the low value of pbias 3 2 land use prediction compared to s0 grassland has been decreased by 2 km2 and water and urban area have been increased by 49 km2 and 47 88 km2 respectively under all scenarios forest have been decreased by 32 93 km2 under both s1 s2 and s3 while increased by 621 91 km2 under s4 table 7 these results indicate that by 2030 agricultural land will be reduced by 61 95 km2 and the lost agricultural land will be mainly converted into water and urban area under s1 s2 and s3 the urban area is more concentrated under s1 than that under s3 fig 5 these differences may be caused by the apparent change of the rate between paddy land and dry land under s1 the amount of paddy land decreased by 500 52 km2 and the amount of dry land increased by 438 56 km2 the paddy land relatively far from the water was translated into dry land while the paddy land near the water remained fig 5 the urban area was mainly expanded where the terrain is relatively flat under s2 the amount of paddy land and dry land decreased by 39 13 km2 and 23 81 km2 respectively the land use distribution has not changed obviously compared to s0 under s3 the amount of paddy land increased by 2551 26 km2 and the amount of dry land increased by 2613 2 km2 the increase in paddy land mainly occurred in the flat area and the dry land on both sides of rivers almost all converted into paddy land this is suitable because the paddy land needs enough water to be irrigated to ensure good rice production under s4 the amount of forest increased by 621 91 km2 and the amount of paddy land and dry land decreased by 241 16 km2 and 475 63 km2 respectively the increase in forest mainly occurred in the northwestern of the xxw where near the original forest regions the new forest area transformed from paddy land and dry land where is mainly dominated by mountain topography and its agricultural adaptability is not so good the land use simulation results are reasonable 3 3 the temporal effects of different land use scenarios on runoffs and sediment yields 3 3 1 the effects on an annual scale 3 3 1 1 effects of different land use scenarios on runoff on an annual scale fig 6 a illustrates that the annual runoff under different scenarios was changed diversely compared to s0 the annual average runoff from 1982 to 2003 was 373 54 mm 376 38 mm 373 63 mm 361 18 mm and 369 22 mm under s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenario respectively under s0 the annual runoff ranges from 127 32 to 664 73 mm from 1982 to 2003 during this period the runoff under s1 s2 s3 and s4 changed with a rate ranged from 0 26 to 1 97 0 76 average 0 15 0 41 0 03 average 7 23 to 1 47 3 31 average and 3 12 to 0 15 1 16 average respectively compared to s0 in different years this suggests that s1 will slightly increase runoff and s3 and s4 will obviously decrease runoff at the same time s2 has different effects on runoff in different years and the impact is very slight the years with relatively small annual runoffs exhibit greater change rates and the years with relatively high annual runoffs exhibit lower change rates which indicates that the effect of land use change on runoffs will be lessened when precipitation is abundant wang et al 2007a this has also led to a phenomenon that compared with s0 different land use scenarios have an obvious impact on runoff in the median and low water years while the impact on runoff in high water years is less 3 3 1 2 effects of different land use scenarios on sediment yields on an annual scale fig 6 indicates that the overall change trend under different scenarios in annual sediment yields is almost the same as that for the annual runoff however changes in sediment yields were more pronounced than changes in runoff sediment in the watershed was transferred by the water which may be the reason for this consistency on an annual scale girmay et al 2009 mayor et al 2011 annual average sediment yields in 1982 2003 were 2926 600 t 2935 400 t 2912 800 t 2686 700 t and 2749 900 t for s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenario respectively under s0 the annual sediment yields ranged from 380 300 t to 6587 000 t from 1982 to 2003 during this period annual sediment yields under s1 s2 s3 and s4 changed with a rate ranged from 2 06 1 65 0 3 average 3 13 0 4 0 47 average 18 8 to 4 68 8 2 average and 12 86 to 3 43 6 04 average respectively compared to s0 in different years in a general way more precipitation will lead to more massive erosion and generate more sediment however the impact of land use change on sediment yields does not change obviously with changes in precipitation overall dry land will increase annual sediment yields paddy land and forest will decrease annual sediment yields ouyang et al 2018 however compared to s0 the annual sediment yields change ratio was higher in low and median water years than that in high water years this result may indicate that the impact of land use change on sediment yields will get weak when under rainstorms nu fang et al 2011 to some extent s3 and s4 can reduce the sediment yields on an annual scale than s1 and s2 3 3 2 the effects on the monthly scale 3 3 2 1 effects of different land use scenarios on runoff on an average monthly scale on the monthly scale s1 increases runoff slightly in most months s3 and s4 decrease runoff obviously in some months and s2 has a small impact on runoff in each month fig 7 a overall the monthly runoff change rate in the year was nearly symmetrically distributed around june and july as the xxw swat model set before there were two rice growth cycles in a year within the watershed as set in the swat model during the prometaphase of rice growth suitable water depth is needed in fields which will lead to more evaporation and infiltration compared to dry land further affecting the runoff the change in average monthly runoff under different scenarios also shows a similar trend to annual runoff runoff in the months with smaller precipitation feb mar apr sep and oct will be influenced more obviously compared to those in the months with more extensive precipitation jun and jul but in some months may and aug with more extensive precipitation they suffered a strong influence this may indicate that the impact of different land use scenarios on monthly runoff is not only related to the amount of precipitation but also related to the processes of crop growth this hypothesis needs further research to be confirmed 3 3 2 2 effects of different land use scenarios on sediment yields on an average monthly scale after the soil particle was loosed by the precipitation they were transported by the overland flow and finally flow into the riverway the streamflow is an important driving force for sediment yields and there exists a correlation between streamflow and sediment yields berg et al 2016 fortesa et al 2021 zheng et al 2008 in our study the changing trend of sediment yields was consistent with runoff under all scenarios on the monthly scale and the changes were more remarkable than runoff fig 7 overall the expected change trend of sediment yields decreased under s2 s3 and s4 but increased in most months under s1 sediment yields change in the first half year were more obvious than that in the second half year under all scenarios the percentage of the most and the least obvious change of sediment yields occurred in apr and jun respectively compared to s0 while the number of sediment yields changed most in aug and jul this indicates that different land use scenarios can affect sediment yields more obviously in the rainy season when the soil erosion is more prominent 3 4 the spatial effects of different land use scenarios on runoffs and sediment yields 3 4 1 effects on water yields at the subbasin scale the distribution of water yields within the xxw is variable fig 8 the regions with darker colours indicate that the water yields are higher combining fig 5 a and fig 8 the regions with more water yields were covered by forest and the regions with the least water yields were mainly covered by agricultural land this phenomenon may indicate that forests will generate more water after rain and crops grown in agricultural land will absorb a substantial amount of water during their growth period kang et al 2009 kuo et al 2006 besides in the previous studies the forest has less evapotranspiration compared to agricultural land aghsaei et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2012 one need noticed was that parts of the agricultural land were paddy land which need be covered by water during some growing period this could also increase evapotranspiration li et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 the result obtained in our study was consistent with these previous studies under different land use scenarios the changes in the spatial distribution of water yields were different water yields in most areas within the watershed increased under s1 approximately half of the watershed had a change rate range of 0 2 16 the largest rate of increase and the largest rate of decrease was 4 89 and 0 47 respectively under s2 the regions in the southern and north eastern watershed decreased in water yields with a rate of 0 0 53 while other regions in the watershed increased in water yields with a rate of 0 1 97 under s3 except for three sub watersheds that had a slight increase almost all sub watersheds had a decrease in water yields most sub watersheds decreased by a rate of 0 5 12 while sub watersheds 2 7 10 and 14 had an obvious decrease in water yields by a rate of 9 13 16 06 in the sub watersheds where water yields decreased obviously under s3 the paddy land converted from dry land was far from the river which may suggest that paddy land will consume more water than dry land peng et al 2018 as to s4 most sub watersheds had a decrease in water yields with a rate of 0 2 03 besides several sub watersheds had an obvious decrease in water yields with a rate of 2 03 6 12 where much agricultural land converted into the forest which indicates that forest will decrease water yields compared to agricultural land filoso et al 2017 some sub watersheds had a slight increase in water yields where the urban area was increased miller et al 2014 3 4 2 effects on surface runoff and subsurface runoff at the subbasin scale the surface and subsurface runoff were distributed with a converse spatial trend within the watershed fig 8 under s0 surface runoff increased gradually from the upper stream 101 65 mm to downstream 401 05 mm in contrast the subsurface runoff decreased gradually from the upper stream 407 03 mm to downstream 9 62 mm compared with fig 5 a and fig 8 the main land use type in the upper stream was the forest at the same time agricultural land most for dry land was the primary land use type for the midstream and downstream this indicates that forests will conserve more water than agricultural land generating more subsurface runoff and less surface runoff the intensive crops grown on dry land will reduce the infiltration which caused dry land to generate more surface runoff than forest kuo et al 2006 generally the surface runoff in more than half of sub watersheds increased slightly under s1 and s2 it decreased in most sub watersheds under s3 and s4 under s1 and s2 the surface runoff change trend is similar in space the surface runoff increased increased by 0 13 35 in more than half of sub watersheds and some sub watersheds spreading over the southern and western watershed had decreased decreased by 0 4 51 in surface runoff under s3 only three small sub watersheds 26 29 and 30 underwent an increase increased by 0 23 55 in the surface runoff and other sub watersheds all had a decrease decreased by 0 23 16 in the surface runoff under s4 more than half of the sub watersheds had a decrease in surface runoff some sub watersheds spreading over the western and eastern watershed had a slight increase in surface runoff under s1 most sub watersheds had a decrease in the subsurface runoff mainly decreased by 0 10 67 up to 28 74 with only several sub watersheds spreading over the southern watershed increased slightly increased by 0 2 48 in the subsurface runoff under s2 the spatial changing trend in subsurface runoff was similar to those under s1 the differences were the reduction of subsurface runoff mainly decreased by 0 2 91 in most sub watersheds which were smaller than that under s1 under s3 most sub watersheds increased in the subsurface runoff mainly increase by 0 44 35 up to 85 4 only a few sub watersheds had a decrease in subsurface runoff decreased by 0 4 06 under s4 most sub watersheds increased in the subsurface runoff mainly increase by 0 19 38 some northeastern sub watersheds decreased in the subsurface runoff mainly decrease by 0 12 58 combined fig 5 and fig 8 a large amount of dry land converted into paddy land in the middle and downstream of xxw where water yields and surface runoff increased while subsurface runoff decreased this shows that paddy land would consume more water than dry land and increase subsurface runoff by increasing the infiltration during rice growth the soil surface is submerged by water during some growth stages of rice this growth mechanism would increase the evaporation and infiltration further resulting in this phenomenon liu et al 2003 mahapatra et al 2020 besides this a large amount of agricultural land converted into the forest in the southwestern watershed under s4 where the subsurface runoff increase while the surface runoff and water yields decrease this phenomenon may indicate that the forest would decrease water yields and conserve more water than agricultural land filoso et al 2017 little et al 2009 which is consistent with the result mentioned before from these results we found that the changes in surface runoff and subsurface runoff were more obvious than water yields this may indicate that different land use scenarios mainly affect water yields in the division of surface runoff and subsurface runoff anand et al 2018 guzha et al 2018 this may be the reason why the change of water yields under different scenarios was not as evident as surface runoff and subsurface runoff 3 4 3 effects on sediment yields at the subbasin scale sediment yields within the watershed decreased gradually along the reach from the upper stream 50 69 t ha to downstream 0 75 t ha fig 9 under s1 about half of the sub watersheds had an increase in sediment yields mainly increased by 0 12 52 and the other sub watersheds had decreased mainly decreased by 0 5 15 up to 48 12 for s2 sediment yields in most sub watersheds decreased slightly mainly decreased by 0 4 11 up to 17 66 and several sub watersheds had increased mainly increased by 0 4 55 up to 38 96 for s3 sediment yields decreased in almost all sub watersheds mainly decreased by 10 98 36 13 up to 64 69 except for no 29 sub watershed as to s4 sediment yields decreased in most sub watersheds mainly decreased by 0 17 5 up to 65 01 compared with fig 5 and fig 9 sediment yields decreased in some sub watersheds where much dry land convert into paddy land or agricultural land converted into the forest in the sub watershed that more dry land converts into paddy land and more agricultural land converts into the forest sediment yields decreased more this phenomenon also indicates that paddy land could reduce sediment yields compared to dry land while forest could reduce sediment yields compared to agricultural land borrelli et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the soil in dry land will be carried away easily during a rainy event chamizo et al 2017 vásquez méndez et al 2010 however the soil in paddy land is underwater only the sediment that is suspended in water in paddy land can be taken away causing the amount of soil loss in paddy fields much less than that in the dry land chen et al 2012 the soil layer of agricultural land was artificial disturbance frequently during the farming period nowak and schneider 2017 the soil particle would be washed away easily compared to the fixed soil under the forest chrenková et al 2014 some sub watersheds sub watershed 32 36 lying on the south of the watershed which were suffering severe soil erosion were mainly covered by forest and a little agricultural land and some sub watersheds sub watershed 3 7 10 11 and 14 in the middle and downstream of the watershed suffered a slighter soil erosion were mainly covered by agricultural land the main difference between these sub watersheds is the topography the mountains are the primary topography in the south of the watershed with a steeper slope and the plains are the main topography in the middle and downstream of the watershed with a gentle slope fig 10 b the steeper the slope is the easier the soil particle be taken away by water flow zhao et al 2022 this may indicate that the topography is more important in soil erosion compared to land cover agricultural land will generate much more sediment yields when spreading over mountains areas sun et al 2014 and the effect of forest in preventing soil erosion will be weakened in mountain regions ochoa cueva et al 2015 many previous studies found that the soil type is also a key factor in soil erosion liu et al 2021 negewo and sarma 2021 wu et al 2018 but within our study area the soil type seems to have less influence on sediment yields compared to topography and land use type combined the fig 9 and fig 10 the sub watershed 2 3 and 7 were all dominated by dry land and the slope were all relatively gentle with a different combination of soil types but there is no obvious difference in sediment yield between these sub watersheds this may indicate that the soil type is not the dominant driving factor for soil erosion in the xxw 3 5 economic effects under different land use scenarios in this research the economic factor only takes the ecological benefit and the farmer s economic income which is directly related to soil and water conservation into consideration the ecological benefits such as gas regulation climate regulation biological control etc arowolo et al 2018 were not taken into consideration as shown in tables 8 10 the total economic benefits of s1 s2 and s4 were lower than s0 with a value of 820 84 million cny 292 78 million cny and 836 54 million cny respectively and the total economic benefit of s3 was higher than s0 with a value of 2960 65 million cny 29613 1 million cny under a rice fish co culture system compared to s0 the local farmer s economic income was highest with an increase of 4224 75 million cny 30877 2 million cny under a rice fish co culture system under s3 and the local farmer s economic income was lowest with a decrease of 1110 99 million cny under s1 results show that the economic income of paddy land is higher than that of dry land liu et al 2018 for ecological benefit the change in water yields was much higher than that in sediment yields which may result in the gap between the water conservation benefit and the soil conservation benefit compared to s0 the ecological benefit was highest under s1 with an increase of 290 15 million cny and the ecological benefit was lowest under s3 with a decrease of 1264 1 million cny though the annual average sediment yields under s3 and s4 all decreased obviously the ecological benefit of s3 and s4 decreased due to the substantial reduction in water yields 3 6 discussion and potential implementation in our research s3 and s4 generated obviously fewer sediment yields and reduced a certain amount of runoff compared to s1 and s2 at the watershed scale the changes in the annual runoff and sediment yields were all non significant table 11 but at the subbasin scale there exist significant changes in some sub watershed table 12 the annual sediment yields would be decreased significantly in 1 with an area of 11 km2 8 with an area of 2423 km2 and 8 with an area of 2399 km2 sub watersheds under s1 s3 and s4 respectively this indicates that s3 is perform best in soil erosion prevention in all scenarios even slightly better than s4 compared with fig 6 and fig 9 the effect of different land use scenarios on sediment yields is evident in space but not so obvious in the outlet of the watershed especially under s3 and s4 sediment generated in sub watersheds will be transferred along the reach from upstream to the outlet of the watershed many of them will be deposited in reaches during this process borrelli et al 2015 wu and chen 2012 the difference in changes of sediment yields mentioned before shows that s3 and s4 not only can mitigate soil erosion but also reduce the sedimentation in reaches which is good for the river downstream ecological sustainability espa et al 2015 pisaturo et al 2021 the decrease in runoff under s3 indicates that it is not a perfect way to mitigate soil erosion by encouraging converting too much dry land into paddy land peng et al 2018 we can set an upper limit on the area of paddy land to avoid decrease too much water resources besides this different agricultural development scenarios mainly affect runoff by redistributing surface runoff and subsurface runoff which denotes that encouraging a suitable amount of paddy land in plain regions is an excellent way to recharge underground water in addition to reducing soil erosion based on this some optimization models such as niche genetic algorithm mahfoud 1995 safaei et al 2021 and particle swarm optimization algorithm liu et al 2013 rajendran et al 2020 could be used for a more appropriate land use demands based on these responses to runoff sediment yields and economic benefit in a particular watershed referred to the results under s4 with the implementation of ggp the sediment yields and water yields would be decreased besides this many farmers lost their agricultural land their economic income has been decreased this would reduce their living quality even making them have to find a job in the city for their livelihood to some extent some farmers living in the countryside are more accustomed to their previous life compared to working in a city li et al 2010 which further bring some social problems generally the ggp suggests that returning the agricultural land to the forest where the slope is higher than 25 degrees wang et al 2007b yu et al 2018b could achieve good performance in decreasing soil erosion but in actuality the agricultural land within xxw for now almost all spread over the land where the slope is lower than 25 degrees compared to ggp the s3 could not only decrease soil erosion but also obviously increase the economic income of local farmers the economic income is the main driving factor for farmers to choose a project liu and liu 2016 mehdi et al 2018 ruhl 2016 which means adjusting the agricultural type convert dry land into paddy land is more feasible than encourage them to give up agricultural land encouraging paddy land is a better way to mitigate local soil erosion compared to ggp besides the u s department of agriculture s usda s farm service agency fsa has published a program named the conservation reserve program crp stubbs 2014 which provides payments to agricultural producers to take highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land out of production this program also could mitigate soil erosion and ensure farmers income but which would increase the government s economic burden and waste of resources at the same time compared to the crp s3 could relatively reduce the government s economic burden and waste of resources although researches indicate that paddy land exist some bad effect on the environment such as decreasing water yields kaushika arora 2019 and increasing the n p pollution peng et al 2018 farmers can reduce the n p pollution by taking the farming method of the rice fish co culture system kangmin 1988 and further increase farmers economic income since the rice fish co culture system was presented more and more researchers have shown interest in it because it is an eco friendly dual production system and can use water and land resources more efficiently hu et al 2013 mohanty et al 2009 wan et al 2019 with the deepening of research on the rice fish co culture system bashir et al 2020 2021 this system has gradually become mature and could be widely adopted with the rice fish co culture system used in paddy land the economic benefit would be more pronounced under s3 with the paddy land to dry land pldl program feng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 spread in northern china where is lack of water resources the rice yields would be obviously influenced encouraging convert dry land to paddy land in some regions where is with abundant water resources is an alternative for ggp to mitigate soil erosion which could also increase rice yields and local farmers economic income nowadays climate change has been a consensus all over the world many scholars have investigated the effect of climate change on precipitation under different climate change scenarios most studies were focused on the precipitation responses under different emission scenarios borrelli et al 2020 wu et al 2022 which stand for the different development trends during the human development process there are also have some relevant studies focused on the hrb for example wang et al 2019a found that the annual precipitation would increase under two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by three cmip5 models in the hrb yao et al 2021 also indicated that the precipitation within the hrb would be increased by 0 2 7 7 during 2017 2100 under different emission scenarios bian et al 2021 pointed out that there has increase trend in future precipitation series by gcms project and the flow would be increased obviously in the future fig 11 has shown the relationship between the precipitation and changes in runoff and sediment yields on an annual scale compared to s0 when the annual precipitation increased the runoff and sediment yields would decrease under s2 s3 and s4 but increased under s1 the linear tendency rate of the changes in sediment yields was higher than that in runoff under s3 and s4 and was the opposite under s2 the reduction effect of sediment yield and discharge under s2 s3 and s4 scenarios increases with the increase of annual rainfall indicating that these scenarios are more effective in water conservation and soil erosion mitigation under different climate change combined previous studies bian et al 2021 wang et al 2019a yao et al 2021 4 conclusions this research has stimulated the land use patterns under different land use scenarios and investigated responses of runoff sediment yields and economic benefits under each scenario 1 from this research converting dry land into paddy land and converting agricultural land into the forest would reduce runoff and sediment yields in contrast converting paddy land into dry land would increase runoff and sediment yield causing soil erosion these changes in runoff and sediment yields vary spatially in the studies watershed 2 the results indicate a probable precipitation threshold for the land use change effect on runoff and sediment yields if the precipitation is larger than the threshold the effect of land use change on runoff and sediment yields would be weakened in addition to precipitation the topography is an essential factor in sediment generation agricultural land both dry land and paddy land will generate much more sediment yields in the mountainous area compared to that in the plain the effect of topography on sediment yield is greater than that of land use and land use has a greater effect on sediment yield than soil type when the topography is similar different agricultural types affect runoff in the division of surface runoff and subsurface runoff the paddy land is more beneficial for conserving subsurface runoff compared to dry land 3 compared to the grain for green program encouraging local farmers to change their agricultural land type from dry land to paddy land is a better way to mitigate soil erosion which will simultaneously obviously increase the economic benefits for local farmers for many watersheds a reasonable proportion of dry land and paddy land could be determined based on local water resource characteristics to reduce soil erosion without abandoning agricultural land and the scenario could also be effective in soil erosion mitigation under climate changes in the future credit authorship contribution statement chong wei conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

7862,study region the xixian watershed is an agricultural watershed in the upper huaihe river basin china which suffers severe soil erosion study focus converting the types of agricultural production without losing their agricultural purposes would be a choice for mitigating soil erosion compared to the grain for green program ggp the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model and the soil and water assessment tool swat model were used and four land use scenarios s1 preference for dry land s2 historical trend s3 preference for paddy land and s4 grain for green were designed based on different preference in agricultural land and the ggp the responses of runoff sediment yields and economic benefits were compared under each land use scenario new hydrological insights for the region we find that s1 increases runoff and sediment yields s3 and s4 decrease runoff and sediment yields and s2 slightly increases runoff and reduces sediment yields different types of agricultural land mainly affected runoff by redistributing surface and subsurface runoffs paddy land would increase subsurface runoff and decrease surface runoff and sediment yields in contrast to dry land the economic benefit could be increased under s3 and be opposite under other scenarios promoting paddy farming in a water rich watershed can mitigate soil erosion conserve groundwater and gain more economic benefits simultaneously graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural land type grain for green program clue s model swat model hydrological response soil erosion 1 introduction with the rapid development of human civilisation a dramatic change has occurred in land use causing a series of changes in hydrological processes gashaw et al 2018 further resulting in problems such as soil erosion wang et al 2019b drought zhang et al 2022 and flood szwagrzyk et al 2018 in this context much research has been conducted to investigate the changes to hydrological processes which result from land use change and the connection between these changes du et al 2012 osei et al 2019 yang et al 2006 to accommodate the food demand of an increasing population during recent decades more forests and grasslands have been converted into agricultural land resulting in severe soil erosion and pollution kijowska strugała et al 2018 ouyang et al 2018 with the emergence of this problem an increasing body of research is being conducted regarding the erosion caused by agricultural activities worldwide china s population makes up around 19 of the total world s population however its agricultural land is around only 7 of the world s total therefore china is under significant food producing pressure and as a result of china s intensive agricultural land distribution severe soil erosion has also occurred in some regions that are mainly covered by agricultural land on a steep slope teng et al 2019 in china the soil erosion that is driven by water affects an area of 3 6 10 6 k m 2 which represents approximately 37 of the country s area fang et al 2017 as china pays more and more attention to sustainable development an important policy named grain for green program ggp has been practised since 2003 to mitigate the soil erosion brought about by agricultural activities wang et al 2002 the ggp has facilitated the conversion of bare and agricultural land to grasslands shrublands and forests especially in steep slope areas lei et al 2012 this program has positive effects on the control of soil erosion deng et al 2019 long et al 2006 but also leads to a decrease in domestic agricultural land this would exacerbate the contradiction between decreasing agricultural land and increasing demand for food brought by the increase of population agricultural land generates a substantial amount of sediment compared to other land use types feng et al 2016 yao et al 2016 but different types of agricultural land broadly divided into paddy land and dry land have different runoff and sediment generation characteristics gao et al 2020 yao et al 2016 due to their different planting characteristics e g soil surface disturbance crops root characteristics leaf area index some researchers reveal that paddy land will produce significantly less sediment than dry land ouyang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 this may encourage the local farmer to choose paddy land agriculture as a better way for some watersheds where developing agricultural economies can mitigate local soil erosion rather than abandoning agricultural practice therefore the research hypothesis of this paper is rather than changing the agricultural lands into forests simply converting the types of agricultural lands would be an alternative for the ggp the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model lambin et al 2000 is one of the commonly used models in simulating future land use maps henríquez dole et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 lamichhane and shakya 2019 used the clue s model to generate several future land use maps and evaluate the response of the groundwater recharge under different population growth scenarios in kathmandu valley nepal peng et al 2020 combined the random forest and clue s model to simulate the wetland distribution under different development scenarios in wuhan city hubei province china the soil water assessment tool swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model which is widely used in the research of hydrological simulation li and deliberty 2020 pirnia et al 2019 and hydrological responses under land use change conditions anand et al 2018 ghaffari et al 2010 wu et al 2017 yu et al 2018a has modified the swat model and used it in the flood simulation which achieved good performance choubin et al 2019 and mosavi et al 2021 used the swat model to develop new methods to simulate the streamflow in ungauged watersheds in iran recently the swat and clue s models have been combined and widely used to investigate the hydrology and n p load responses under different land use scenarios baker and miller 2013 wagner et al 2017 wang et al 2018a zhou et al 2013 such as szalinska et al 2020 combined the clue s model and swat model to simulate the sediment load variations under different climate and land use changes in a carpathian catchment khoi et al 2021 evaluate the streamflow and sediment load responses to different future land use change in the be river basin vietnam wang et al 2018a combined the swat model and clue s model to optimize the land use for better non point source pollution control however research comparing the responses of runoff soil erosion and economic benefit to different agricultural land development scenarios and ggp by combining swat and clue s models has not been conducted the primary purpose of this research is to investigate the response of runoff sediment yields and economic benefit to different agricultural type distributions under different agricultural land development and ggp to verify whether converting types of agricultural land can mitigate soil erosion and be an alternative for the grain for green program 2 methods 2 1 research approach for this research purpose the following approach is proposed in this paper 1 design four land use scenarios to represent different preferences in agricultural types and gpp 2 simulate a future land use map in the xxw under four different land use scenarios 3 apply the validated swat model to simulate the runoff and sediment yields under four scenarios 4 analyse the runoff sediment yields and economy responses under the four scenarios and find a suitable land use scenario for mitigating soil erosion 2 2 study watershed the xixian hydrological station is located at the source of the huaihe river basin hrb in mid eastern china the xixian watershed xxw drainage area is approximately 10 200 km2 30 50 32 45 n 111 15 115 e and was selected as the study area fig 1 the southwestern area of the xxw is a mountainous area where the highest elevation is 1110 m above sea level and plains dominate the central and eastern areas the watershed is in a subtropical monsoon zone with annual rainfall and average evaporation of 800 1400 mm and 800 1000 mm respectively most rainfall occurs during the flood season from june to september taking up around 60 of the annual rainfall which leads to an uneven distribution of water resources throughout the year there are two reservoirs sited in the centre of the xxw which are used for flood control and irrigation the hrb is a substantial food producing base in china which is suffering severe soil erosion wei et al 2022 and the soil erosion within the xxw accounts for 68 4 of the whole hrb cai et al 2012 the leading economy within the xxw is agriculture and approximately 56 of the watershed is agricultural land and part of it is experiencing severe soil erosion shi et al 2013 but it is not ideal to mitigate soil erosion by the ggp in regions such as the xxw because it may lead to a reduction of food production and a further decrease in the local economy paddy land and dry land are the main patterns of agricultural land in this region with a proportion of about 1 2 as the property of the paddy land and dry land is differ in many aspects maybe it is possible to mitigate local soil erosion by converting agricultural land types with a suitable preference land use instead of ggp in the xxw 2 3 scenario design the main agricultural land types are dry land and paddy land the dry land and paddy land area are mainly planted with wheat and rice for economic benefit within the xxw in order to explore the changes in runoff sediment yields and economy under different land use scenarios compared to the base scenario present land use condition in 2015 named as s0 four land use scenarios were created based on different preferences to agricultural land types and gpp the development period is defined from 2015 to 2030 during the development period the amount of each type of land use was gradually changed linearly and finally reach the target amount for each scenario for one preferred type of agricultural land its proportion would be increased during the development period otherwise it would be decreased for gpp the extent of forest would be increased with a decrease in agricultural land under this consideration four land use scenarios were designed as follows s1 preference to dry land during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land reaches 4 1 in 2030 while keeping other types of land use development with the historical trend during 2000 2015 s2 keeping historical trends during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land remains as 2 1 the same as the proportion during 2000 2015 s3 preference to paddy land during the development period under this scenario the proportion between dry land and paddy land reaches 1 4 in 2030 while keeping other types of land use development with the historical trend during 2000 2015 s4 carry out the gpp during the development period under this scenario agricultural land converted into the forest with the area of agricultural land decreased to the minimum area required to be reserved by the government the increased forest area was used to plant the tea tree 2 4 models introduction and setup 2 4 1 clue s model 2 4 1 1 model description the clue s model consists of two independent modules a quantitative demand module and a spatial allocation module verburg et al 2002 it is widely used for land use spatial prediction and has provided satisfactory results verburg and overmars 2007 wang et al 2018b woldesenbet et al 2017 the quantitative demand module calculates the quantity of all types of land use in the study region and the main methods used in this module include trend extrapolation the markov model and other economic models zheng et al 2015 the spatial allocation module allocates the distribution of land uses in space at a raster scale according to the spatial suitability of land uses within the study region the spatial suitability of land uses is calculated by the following equation eq 1 1 t p r o p i u p i u e l a s u i t e r u where tprop i u is the total suitability of land use type for raster p i is the suitability of land use type u for the raster calculated by logistic regression lin et al 2011 based on the distribution of land use and driving factors elas u is the coefficient of elasticity for change of land use type u and iter u is the variable for model iteration the fitness of the logistic regression model was measured by the relative operating characteristic roc curves pontius schneider 2001 which were calculated by spss software to characterise the spatial correlations between land uses and driving factors the roc ranges from 0 5 to 1 with a better fit when it is closer to 1 the kappa index viera and garrett 2005 was used to measure the clue s model s performance in simulating the land use change within the study area the value of the kappa index range from 0 to 1 in most cases the higher value is the more accurate the simulation result is and a value higher than 0 7 is acceptable wang et al 2018a the kappa index is calculated by the following equation 2 k a p p a p 0 p c p p p c where p 0 is the correct simulation proportion p c is the expected correct simulation proportion the value in this study is 1 6 and the p p is the correct simulation proportion under ideal conditions 2 4 1 2 model setup the primary data requirements for the clue s model are land use maps in different periods and driving factors in space to calibrate the clue s model land use in 2000 and 2015 were selected as the primary and objective land use maps the land use was reclassified into six classes as follows paddy land dry land forest grassland water and urban area and 16 driving factors belonging to four categories table 2 were chosen to explain the land use distribution in space the land use demands from 2000 to 2015 were calculated by linear interpolation under s1 s2 and s3 the land use demands for forest grassland water and urban area from 2015 to 2030 were predicted by linear extrapolation based on the historical trend and the remaining area was allocated to paddy land and dry land according to the different proportions under s4 the land use demands for grassland water and urban area from 2015 to 2030 were predicted by linear extrapolation based on the historical trend the demands for paddy land and dry land were kept the minimum value regulated by the government and the remaining area was allocated to the forest based on the land use transfer matrix analysis from the land use map in 2000 and 2015 we defined the land use could transfer to all other land use types freely but with different probabilities the roc for all land use types was between 0 79 and 0 94 table 3 which showed a good cross correlation between all land use types and driving factors and the logistic regression result was adequate for the clue s model pontius schneider 2001 the elastic coefficient is an important parameter that would influence the spatial allocation of each type of land use in the clue s model land use will be more challenging to convert into other land uses if its elastic coefficient is closer to 1 verburg et al 2002 after calibrating the clue s model with the kappa index as the objective function the elastic coefficient for paddy land dry land forest grassland water and urban area were set to the value of 0 8 0 83 0 94 0 85 0 9 and 0 95 respectively the total amount of grids in the xixian watershed is 163 128 and the correctly simulated amount is 160 098 the kappa coefficient for the simulation accuracy is 0 98 which indicates that the clue s model can simulate the regional land use development well then maps of the future land use were simulated for each scenario by using the calibrated clue s model 2 4 2 swat model the swat model arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used hydrological models to investigate hydrological responses under land use changes messina and biggs 2016 nie et al 2011 woldesenbet et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 the swat model is physically based and semi distributed dividing a watershed into sub watersheds and further sub dividing the sub watersheds into hydrological response units hrus according to the simulating hydrologic processes by land use types slopes and soil types the swat2012 neitsch et al 2011b was used in this study in the swat model water balance is the central governing equation for all variable simulations and the simulation is separated into two sections the runoff generation section and the flow routing section the runoff generation section is separated into three parts for simulation surface runoff evapotranspiration and subsurface runoff in this study the overland runoff and evapotranspiration were estimated by the scs curve number method boughton 1989 and the penman monteith method howell and evett 2004 respectively the processes of subsurface runoff were simulated through the infiltration rule the flow routing section is calculated by the characteristic river length method williams 1969 the sediment simulation consists of erosion simulation and sediment transport simulation in this study the modified universal soil loss equation musle willams 1975 which was developed from the universal soil loss equation usle was applied to simulate soil erosion the musle contains a factor named the minimum value of the usle c factor for water erosion and the factor s value can change according to different land covers these characteristics bring about convenience in this research on sediment simulation under land cover changes the value of usle c was calibrated for each main land use type paddy land dry land and forest the simplified bagnold model arnold et al 1995 was selected to simulate sediment transportation generally the swat model controls the growth of the crops by daily accumulated heat unit theory neitsch et al 2011a in our research the real crops schedules were imported into the swat model for paddy and dry land as the actual farming conditions of xxw the paddy and dry land were mainly used to plant rice and wheat respectively according to the statistics from the chinese academy of sciences the farming activities within the xxw are mainly dominated by a double cropping system which means that both rice and wheat are all harvested twice a year the rice was sowing in march and july and harvested in july and october respectively the wheat was sowing in april and september and harvested in september and april next year respectively the swat model automatically performs irrigation operations according to the needs during the growth of different crops as well as fertilizer operation the performance of runoff and sediment yields simulations were evaluated by using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the performance is satisfactory if they meet the following conditions moriasi et al 2007 when 1 nse 0 5 2 the absolute value of pbias is lower than 25 and 55 for runoff and sediment yields respectively and 3 rsr 0 7 in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method integrated in swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2013 was chosen to automatically calibrate the swat model constructed for the studied area which was used widely in calibration and validation of the swat model and proven to be a useful optimisation method abbaspour et al 2018 constructing a swat model simulation needs data including digital elevation models dems soil types land use maps and hydrologic and climate data runoff sediment yields rainfall and some other climate data the data sources are described in table 1 in detail the watershed was separated into 36 sub watersheds and further divided into 675 hrus and ensured that each hru within a sub watershed is made up of a distinctive group of land use types soil and slope range measured daily rain from 20 precipitation gauges was inputted into the model and the swat model was used for monthly simulation then calibrated parameters based on observed runoff and sediment data to simulate runoff and sediment yields satisfactorily tables 2 3 2 4 3 model combination for each land use scenario the quantity of each land use will be obtained and be inputted into the calibrated clue s model to simulate the spatially distributed land use map the simulated land use maps will then be inputted into the calibrated swat model to simulate the runoff and sediment yields fig 2 to decrease the model uncertainties we simulated the runoff and sediment yields series in the xxw from 1982 to 2003 based on the measured historical daily precipitation and the calibrated swat model under five scenarios s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 these simulated runoff and sediment series will be used in the following scenarios analyses the significance of the difference between s1 s2 s3 s4 and base scenario s0 was analyzed by the analysis of variance anova st and wold 1989 2 5 economic and ecological benefits calculation methods the economic benefits in this research were separated into two parts the ecological benefit and the local farmer s economic income for the ecological benefit it includes the benefit on water conservation and soil conservation for the local farmer s economic income it represents the economic income for farmers from the land use scenario these two kinds of economic benefits are related to this research directly the ecological benefits were calculated by the changes of water and sediment yields the farmer s income would affect the farmer s choice of which type of agricultural land to adopt 2 5 1 ecological benefit in this research the economic benefits brought by the changes in sediment and water yields were used to evaluate the ecological benefits for each land use scenario the ecological benefits wang et al 2017 were divided into water conservation benefit and soil conservation benefit and their calculation methods were introduced as below water conservation benefit wang et al 2017 is determined by the water storage cost of the reservoir project it is calculated as the following equation eq 3 3 u c o n w a t e r c r e s p where the u c o n w a t e r is the water conservation benefit cny c r e s is the unit storage cost cny m 3 in this research the value of c r e s is 10 cny m 3 in 2015 p is the water conservation amount m 3 soil conservation benefit is calculated by the production value substitution method wang and wang 2001 according to the total amount of soil erosion and the average thickness of the cultivated layer of the country the method calculates the amount of soil conservation measures to reduce the loss of land resources and then calculates the output value of the crops that could be produced on the land the soil conservation benefit is calculated as the following equation eq 4 4 u c o n s o i l 2 q v 10000 ρ h where the u c o n s o i l is the soil conservation benefit cny q is the amount of the annual soil conservation t v is the crop economic benefit per unit area c n y h m 2 a the average economic benefit of paddy land and dry land is adopted as the value of v 46 826 c n y h m 2 a ρ is the soil density t m 3 the value of ρ is 2 65 t m 3 as announced by the related department h is the thickness of cultivated soil layer m the value of h is 0 207 m in xinyang city henan province 2 5 2 local farmer s economic income in this research the difference between different land use scenarios is mainly the difference between paddy land dry land and forest therefore the local farmer s economic output value per unit area of paddy land dry land and the forest is statistics and calculated the crops on paddy land and forest are regarded as rice and tea respectively the crops on dry land are regarded as wheat and vegetable the crop output per area was calculated through the average value range 2015 2019 via the xinyang statistical information network http www xytjj gov cn the unit price of the crop was counted from the market survey then the output value per unit area was calculated for paddy land dry land and forest the statistical results were shown in table 4 from table 4 the average output value per unit area of paddy land dry land and forest were 55 568 cny ha 38 083 97 cny ha and 44 346 09 cny ha respectively through the research of some scholars the rice fish co culture system could increase the income of paddy land by 1 42 bashir et al 2021 3 84 zhang et al 2016 and 3 39 hu et al 2013 times respectively in our study we adopt the average value of these results suppose the rice fish co culture system could increase the income of paddy land by 2 88 times which means that the average output value per unit area of paddy land was 160 035 8 cny ha when adopting the rice fish co culture system 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the swat model using t stat and p value abbaspour 2013 as the indices to measure the parameters sensitivity from the total parameters related to the runoff process the most sensitive parameters within the watershed are cn2 sol awc and gwqmn table 5 apart from these parameters sol bd sol z sol k rchrg dp hru slp surlag and ov n were also selected as sensitive parameters and were calibrated for the sediment simulation all parameters related to sediment yielding processes i e including usle p spexp spcon ch cov1 ch cov2 and usle c were taken into consideration the usle c parameter was calibrated for different key land use types resulting in a usle c parameter of 0 241 0 417 and 0 057 for paddy land dry land and forest respectively this approach aims to reflect the difference of sediment yield generation characters through the difference of the same parameter under different land use types the warm up period calibration periods and validation periods were 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2003 respectively as seen in table 6 and fig 3 for runoff simulation values of nse were higher than 0 85 and values of pbias and rsr were lower than 3 6 and 0 38 respectively during both calibration and validation periods for sediment yield simulations values of nse were higher than 0 79 and values of pbias and rsr were lower than 0 9 and 0 46 respectively during both calibration and validation periods fig 4 the overall accuracy for runoff and sediment yields simulation was good and the simulation results are acceptable compared with the criterion proposed by moriasi et al 2007 table 6 the swat model takes the daily rainfall as the input data but does not consider the actual rainfall distribution among one day nie et al 2011 which would reduce the flood peak and result in a relatively low peak runoff as to sediment yields simulation higher uncertainties were caused by equifinality for different parameters precipitation monitoring flow monitoring and missing sediment concentration however the total amount of sediment yields was simulated well according to the low value of pbias 3 2 land use prediction compared to s0 grassland has been decreased by 2 km2 and water and urban area have been increased by 49 km2 and 47 88 km2 respectively under all scenarios forest have been decreased by 32 93 km2 under both s1 s2 and s3 while increased by 621 91 km2 under s4 table 7 these results indicate that by 2030 agricultural land will be reduced by 61 95 km2 and the lost agricultural land will be mainly converted into water and urban area under s1 s2 and s3 the urban area is more concentrated under s1 than that under s3 fig 5 these differences may be caused by the apparent change of the rate between paddy land and dry land under s1 the amount of paddy land decreased by 500 52 km2 and the amount of dry land increased by 438 56 km2 the paddy land relatively far from the water was translated into dry land while the paddy land near the water remained fig 5 the urban area was mainly expanded where the terrain is relatively flat under s2 the amount of paddy land and dry land decreased by 39 13 km2 and 23 81 km2 respectively the land use distribution has not changed obviously compared to s0 under s3 the amount of paddy land increased by 2551 26 km2 and the amount of dry land increased by 2613 2 km2 the increase in paddy land mainly occurred in the flat area and the dry land on both sides of rivers almost all converted into paddy land this is suitable because the paddy land needs enough water to be irrigated to ensure good rice production under s4 the amount of forest increased by 621 91 km2 and the amount of paddy land and dry land decreased by 241 16 km2 and 475 63 km2 respectively the increase in forest mainly occurred in the northwestern of the xxw where near the original forest regions the new forest area transformed from paddy land and dry land where is mainly dominated by mountain topography and its agricultural adaptability is not so good the land use simulation results are reasonable 3 3 the temporal effects of different land use scenarios on runoffs and sediment yields 3 3 1 the effects on an annual scale 3 3 1 1 effects of different land use scenarios on runoff on an annual scale fig 6 a illustrates that the annual runoff under different scenarios was changed diversely compared to s0 the annual average runoff from 1982 to 2003 was 373 54 mm 376 38 mm 373 63 mm 361 18 mm and 369 22 mm under s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenario respectively under s0 the annual runoff ranges from 127 32 to 664 73 mm from 1982 to 2003 during this period the runoff under s1 s2 s3 and s4 changed with a rate ranged from 0 26 to 1 97 0 76 average 0 15 0 41 0 03 average 7 23 to 1 47 3 31 average and 3 12 to 0 15 1 16 average respectively compared to s0 in different years this suggests that s1 will slightly increase runoff and s3 and s4 will obviously decrease runoff at the same time s2 has different effects on runoff in different years and the impact is very slight the years with relatively small annual runoffs exhibit greater change rates and the years with relatively high annual runoffs exhibit lower change rates which indicates that the effect of land use change on runoffs will be lessened when precipitation is abundant wang et al 2007a this has also led to a phenomenon that compared with s0 different land use scenarios have an obvious impact on runoff in the median and low water years while the impact on runoff in high water years is less 3 3 1 2 effects of different land use scenarios on sediment yields on an annual scale fig 6 indicates that the overall change trend under different scenarios in annual sediment yields is almost the same as that for the annual runoff however changes in sediment yields were more pronounced than changes in runoff sediment in the watershed was transferred by the water which may be the reason for this consistency on an annual scale girmay et al 2009 mayor et al 2011 annual average sediment yields in 1982 2003 were 2926 600 t 2935 400 t 2912 800 t 2686 700 t and 2749 900 t for s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenario respectively under s0 the annual sediment yields ranged from 380 300 t to 6587 000 t from 1982 to 2003 during this period annual sediment yields under s1 s2 s3 and s4 changed with a rate ranged from 2 06 1 65 0 3 average 3 13 0 4 0 47 average 18 8 to 4 68 8 2 average and 12 86 to 3 43 6 04 average respectively compared to s0 in different years in a general way more precipitation will lead to more massive erosion and generate more sediment however the impact of land use change on sediment yields does not change obviously with changes in precipitation overall dry land will increase annual sediment yields paddy land and forest will decrease annual sediment yields ouyang et al 2018 however compared to s0 the annual sediment yields change ratio was higher in low and median water years than that in high water years this result may indicate that the impact of land use change on sediment yields will get weak when under rainstorms nu fang et al 2011 to some extent s3 and s4 can reduce the sediment yields on an annual scale than s1 and s2 3 3 2 the effects on the monthly scale 3 3 2 1 effects of different land use scenarios on runoff on an average monthly scale on the monthly scale s1 increases runoff slightly in most months s3 and s4 decrease runoff obviously in some months and s2 has a small impact on runoff in each month fig 7 a overall the monthly runoff change rate in the year was nearly symmetrically distributed around june and july as the xxw swat model set before there were two rice growth cycles in a year within the watershed as set in the swat model during the prometaphase of rice growth suitable water depth is needed in fields which will lead to more evaporation and infiltration compared to dry land further affecting the runoff the change in average monthly runoff under different scenarios also shows a similar trend to annual runoff runoff in the months with smaller precipitation feb mar apr sep and oct will be influenced more obviously compared to those in the months with more extensive precipitation jun and jul but in some months may and aug with more extensive precipitation they suffered a strong influence this may indicate that the impact of different land use scenarios on monthly runoff is not only related to the amount of precipitation but also related to the processes of crop growth this hypothesis needs further research to be confirmed 3 3 2 2 effects of different land use scenarios on sediment yields on an average monthly scale after the soil particle was loosed by the precipitation they were transported by the overland flow and finally flow into the riverway the streamflow is an important driving force for sediment yields and there exists a correlation between streamflow and sediment yields berg et al 2016 fortesa et al 2021 zheng et al 2008 in our study the changing trend of sediment yields was consistent with runoff under all scenarios on the monthly scale and the changes were more remarkable than runoff fig 7 overall the expected change trend of sediment yields decreased under s2 s3 and s4 but increased in most months under s1 sediment yields change in the first half year were more obvious than that in the second half year under all scenarios the percentage of the most and the least obvious change of sediment yields occurred in apr and jun respectively compared to s0 while the number of sediment yields changed most in aug and jul this indicates that different land use scenarios can affect sediment yields more obviously in the rainy season when the soil erosion is more prominent 3 4 the spatial effects of different land use scenarios on runoffs and sediment yields 3 4 1 effects on water yields at the subbasin scale the distribution of water yields within the xxw is variable fig 8 the regions with darker colours indicate that the water yields are higher combining fig 5 a and fig 8 the regions with more water yields were covered by forest and the regions with the least water yields were mainly covered by agricultural land this phenomenon may indicate that forests will generate more water after rain and crops grown in agricultural land will absorb a substantial amount of water during their growth period kang et al 2009 kuo et al 2006 besides in the previous studies the forest has less evapotranspiration compared to agricultural land aghsaei et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2012 one need noticed was that parts of the agricultural land were paddy land which need be covered by water during some growing period this could also increase evapotranspiration li et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 the result obtained in our study was consistent with these previous studies under different land use scenarios the changes in the spatial distribution of water yields were different water yields in most areas within the watershed increased under s1 approximately half of the watershed had a change rate range of 0 2 16 the largest rate of increase and the largest rate of decrease was 4 89 and 0 47 respectively under s2 the regions in the southern and north eastern watershed decreased in water yields with a rate of 0 0 53 while other regions in the watershed increased in water yields with a rate of 0 1 97 under s3 except for three sub watersheds that had a slight increase almost all sub watersheds had a decrease in water yields most sub watersheds decreased by a rate of 0 5 12 while sub watersheds 2 7 10 and 14 had an obvious decrease in water yields by a rate of 9 13 16 06 in the sub watersheds where water yields decreased obviously under s3 the paddy land converted from dry land was far from the river which may suggest that paddy land will consume more water than dry land peng et al 2018 as to s4 most sub watersheds had a decrease in water yields with a rate of 0 2 03 besides several sub watersheds had an obvious decrease in water yields with a rate of 2 03 6 12 where much agricultural land converted into the forest which indicates that forest will decrease water yields compared to agricultural land filoso et al 2017 some sub watersheds had a slight increase in water yields where the urban area was increased miller et al 2014 3 4 2 effects on surface runoff and subsurface runoff at the subbasin scale the surface and subsurface runoff were distributed with a converse spatial trend within the watershed fig 8 under s0 surface runoff increased gradually from the upper stream 101 65 mm to downstream 401 05 mm in contrast the subsurface runoff decreased gradually from the upper stream 407 03 mm to downstream 9 62 mm compared with fig 5 a and fig 8 the main land use type in the upper stream was the forest at the same time agricultural land most for dry land was the primary land use type for the midstream and downstream this indicates that forests will conserve more water than agricultural land generating more subsurface runoff and less surface runoff the intensive crops grown on dry land will reduce the infiltration which caused dry land to generate more surface runoff than forest kuo et al 2006 generally the surface runoff in more than half of sub watersheds increased slightly under s1 and s2 it decreased in most sub watersheds under s3 and s4 under s1 and s2 the surface runoff change trend is similar in space the surface runoff increased increased by 0 13 35 in more than half of sub watersheds and some sub watersheds spreading over the southern and western watershed had decreased decreased by 0 4 51 in surface runoff under s3 only three small sub watersheds 26 29 and 30 underwent an increase increased by 0 23 55 in the surface runoff and other sub watersheds all had a decrease decreased by 0 23 16 in the surface runoff under s4 more than half of the sub watersheds had a decrease in surface runoff some sub watersheds spreading over the western and eastern watershed had a slight increase in surface runoff under s1 most sub watersheds had a decrease in the subsurface runoff mainly decreased by 0 10 67 up to 28 74 with only several sub watersheds spreading over the southern watershed increased slightly increased by 0 2 48 in the subsurface runoff under s2 the spatial changing trend in subsurface runoff was similar to those under s1 the differences were the reduction of subsurface runoff mainly decreased by 0 2 91 in most sub watersheds which were smaller than that under s1 under s3 most sub watersheds increased in the subsurface runoff mainly increase by 0 44 35 up to 85 4 only a few sub watersheds had a decrease in subsurface runoff decreased by 0 4 06 under s4 most sub watersheds increased in the subsurface runoff mainly increase by 0 19 38 some northeastern sub watersheds decreased in the subsurface runoff mainly decrease by 0 12 58 combined fig 5 and fig 8 a large amount of dry land converted into paddy land in the middle and downstream of xxw where water yields and surface runoff increased while subsurface runoff decreased this shows that paddy land would consume more water than dry land and increase subsurface runoff by increasing the infiltration during rice growth the soil surface is submerged by water during some growth stages of rice this growth mechanism would increase the evaporation and infiltration further resulting in this phenomenon liu et al 2003 mahapatra et al 2020 besides this a large amount of agricultural land converted into the forest in the southwestern watershed under s4 where the subsurface runoff increase while the surface runoff and water yields decrease this phenomenon may indicate that the forest would decrease water yields and conserve more water than agricultural land filoso et al 2017 little et al 2009 which is consistent with the result mentioned before from these results we found that the changes in surface runoff and subsurface runoff were more obvious than water yields this may indicate that different land use scenarios mainly affect water yields in the division of surface runoff and subsurface runoff anand et al 2018 guzha et al 2018 this may be the reason why the change of water yields under different scenarios was not as evident as surface runoff and subsurface runoff 3 4 3 effects on sediment yields at the subbasin scale sediment yields within the watershed decreased gradually along the reach from the upper stream 50 69 t ha to downstream 0 75 t ha fig 9 under s1 about half of the sub watersheds had an increase in sediment yields mainly increased by 0 12 52 and the other sub watersheds had decreased mainly decreased by 0 5 15 up to 48 12 for s2 sediment yields in most sub watersheds decreased slightly mainly decreased by 0 4 11 up to 17 66 and several sub watersheds had increased mainly increased by 0 4 55 up to 38 96 for s3 sediment yields decreased in almost all sub watersheds mainly decreased by 10 98 36 13 up to 64 69 except for no 29 sub watershed as to s4 sediment yields decreased in most sub watersheds mainly decreased by 0 17 5 up to 65 01 compared with fig 5 and fig 9 sediment yields decreased in some sub watersheds where much dry land convert into paddy land or agricultural land converted into the forest in the sub watershed that more dry land converts into paddy land and more agricultural land converts into the forest sediment yields decreased more this phenomenon also indicates that paddy land could reduce sediment yields compared to dry land while forest could reduce sediment yields compared to agricultural land borrelli et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the soil in dry land will be carried away easily during a rainy event chamizo et al 2017 vásquez méndez et al 2010 however the soil in paddy land is underwater only the sediment that is suspended in water in paddy land can be taken away causing the amount of soil loss in paddy fields much less than that in the dry land chen et al 2012 the soil layer of agricultural land was artificial disturbance frequently during the farming period nowak and schneider 2017 the soil particle would be washed away easily compared to the fixed soil under the forest chrenková et al 2014 some sub watersheds sub watershed 32 36 lying on the south of the watershed which were suffering severe soil erosion were mainly covered by forest and a little agricultural land and some sub watersheds sub watershed 3 7 10 11 and 14 in the middle and downstream of the watershed suffered a slighter soil erosion were mainly covered by agricultural land the main difference between these sub watersheds is the topography the mountains are the primary topography in the south of the watershed with a steeper slope and the plains are the main topography in the middle and downstream of the watershed with a gentle slope fig 10 b the steeper the slope is the easier the soil particle be taken away by water flow zhao et al 2022 this may indicate that the topography is more important in soil erosion compared to land cover agricultural land will generate much more sediment yields when spreading over mountains areas sun et al 2014 and the effect of forest in preventing soil erosion will be weakened in mountain regions ochoa cueva et al 2015 many previous studies found that the soil type is also a key factor in soil erosion liu et al 2021 negewo and sarma 2021 wu et al 2018 but within our study area the soil type seems to have less influence on sediment yields compared to topography and land use type combined the fig 9 and fig 10 the sub watershed 2 3 and 7 were all dominated by dry land and the slope were all relatively gentle with a different combination of soil types but there is no obvious difference in sediment yield between these sub watersheds this may indicate that the soil type is not the dominant driving factor for soil erosion in the xxw 3 5 economic effects under different land use scenarios in this research the economic factor only takes the ecological benefit and the farmer s economic income which is directly related to soil and water conservation into consideration the ecological benefits such as gas regulation climate regulation biological control etc arowolo et al 2018 were not taken into consideration as shown in tables 8 10 the total economic benefits of s1 s2 and s4 were lower than s0 with a value of 820 84 million cny 292 78 million cny and 836 54 million cny respectively and the total economic benefit of s3 was higher than s0 with a value of 2960 65 million cny 29613 1 million cny under a rice fish co culture system compared to s0 the local farmer s economic income was highest with an increase of 4224 75 million cny 30877 2 million cny under a rice fish co culture system under s3 and the local farmer s economic income was lowest with a decrease of 1110 99 million cny under s1 results show that the economic income of paddy land is higher than that of dry land liu et al 2018 for ecological benefit the change in water yields was much higher than that in sediment yields which may result in the gap between the water conservation benefit and the soil conservation benefit compared to s0 the ecological benefit was highest under s1 with an increase of 290 15 million cny and the ecological benefit was lowest under s3 with a decrease of 1264 1 million cny though the annual average sediment yields under s3 and s4 all decreased obviously the ecological benefit of s3 and s4 decreased due to the substantial reduction in water yields 3 6 discussion and potential implementation in our research s3 and s4 generated obviously fewer sediment yields and reduced a certain amount of runoff compared to s1 and s2 at the watershed scale the changes in the annual runoff and sediment yields were all non significant table 11 but at the subbasin scale there exist significant changes in some sub watershed table 12 the annual sediment yields would be decreased significantly in 1 with an area of 11 km2 8 with an area of 2423 km2 and 8 with an area of 2399 km2 sub watersheds under s1 s3 and s4 respectively this indicates that s3 is perform best in soil erosion prevention in all scenarios even slightly better than s4 compared with fig 6 and fig 9 the effect of different land use scenarios on sediment yields is evident in space but not so obvious in the outlet of the watershed especially under s3 and s4 sediment generated in sub watersheds will be transferred along the reach from upstream to the outlet of the watershed many of them will be deposited in reaches during this process borrelli et al 2015 wu and chen 2012 the difference in changes of sediment yields mentioned before shows that s3 and s4 not only can mitigate soil erosion but also reduce the sedimentation in reaches which is good for the river downstream ecological sustainability espa et al 2015 pisaturo et al 2021 the decrease in runoff under s3 indicates that it is not a perfect way to mitigate soil erosion by encouraging converting too much dry land into paddy land peng et al 2018 we can set an upper limit on the area of paddy land to avoid decrease too much water resources besides this different agricultural development scenarios mainly affect runoff by redistributing surface runoff and subsurface runoff which denotes that encouraging a suitable amount of paddy land in plain regions is an excellent way to recharge underground water in addition to reducing soil erosion based on this some optimization models such as niche genetic algorithm mahfoud 1995 safaei et al 2021 and particle swarm optimization algorithm liu et al 2013 rajendran et al 2020 could be used for a more appropriate land use demands based on these responses to runoff sediment yields and economic benefit in a particular watershed referred to the results under s4 with the implementation of ggp the sediment yields and water yields would be decreased besides this many farmers lost their agricultural land their economic income has been decreased this would reduce their living quality even making them have to find a job in the city for their livelihood to some extent some farmers living in the countryside are more accustomed to their previous life compared to working in a city li et al 2010 which further bring some social problems generally the ggp suggests that returning the agricultural land to the forest where the slope is higher than 25 degrees wang et al 2007b yu et al 2018b could achieve good performance in decreasing soil erosion but in actuality the agricultural land within xxw for now almost all spread over the land where the slope is lower than 25 degrees compared to ggp the s3 could not only decrease soil erosion but also obviously increase the economic income of local farmers the economic income is the main driving factor for farmers to choose a project liu and liu 2016 mehdi et al 2018 ruhl 2016 which means adjusting the agricultural type convert dry land into paddy land is more feasible than encourage them to give up agricultural land encouraging paddy land is a better way to mitigate local soil erosion compared to ggp besides the u s department of agriculture s usda s farm service agency fsa has published a program named the conservation reserve program crp stubbs 2014 which provides payments to agricultural producers to take highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land out of production this program also could mitigate soil erosion and ensure farmers income but which would increase the government s economic burden and waste of resources at the same time compared to the crp s3 could relatively reduce the government s economic burden and waste of resources although researches indicate that paddy land exist some bad effect on the environment such as decreasing water yields kaushika arora 2019 and increasing the n p pollution peng et al 2018 farmers can reduce the n p pollution by taking the farming method of the rice fish co culture system kangmin 1988 and further increase farmers economic income since the rice fish co culture system was presented more and more researchers have shown interest in it because it is an eco friendly dual production system and can use water and land resources more efficiently hu et al 2013 mohanty et al 2009 wan et al 2019 with the deepening of research on the rice fish co culture system bashir et al 2020 2021 this system has gradually become mature and could be widely adopted with the rice fish co culture system used in paddy land the economic benefit would be more pronounced under s3 with the paddy land to dry land pldl program feng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 spread in northern china where is lack of water resources the rice yields would be obviously influenced encouraging convert dry land to paddy land in some regions where is with abundant water resources is an alternative for ggp to mitigate soil erosion which could also increase rice yields and local farmers economic income nowadays climate change has been a consensus all over the world many scholars have investigated the effect of climate change on precipitation under different climate change scenarios most studies were focused on the precipitation responses under different emission scenarios borrelli et al 2020 wu et al 2022 which stand for the different development trends during the human development process there are also have some relevant studies focused on the hrb for example wang et al 2019a found that the annual precipitation would increase under two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by three cmip5 models in the hrb yao et al 2021 also indicated that the precipitation within the hrb would be increased by 0 2 7 7 during 2017 2100 under different emission scenarios bian et al 2021 pointed out that there has increase trend in future precipitation series by gcms project and the flow would be increased obviously in the future fig 11 has shown the relationship between the precipitation and changes in runoff and sediment yields on an annual scale compared to s0 when the annual precipitation increased the runoff and sediment yields would decrease under s2 s3 and s4 but increased under s1 the linear tendency rate of the changes in sediment yields was higher than that in runoff under s3 and s4 and was the opposite under s2 the reduction effect of sediment yield and discharge under s2 s3 and s4 scenarios increases with the increase of annual rainfall indicating that these scenarios are more effective in water conservation and soil erosion mitigation under different climate change combined previous studies bian et al 2021 wang et al 2019a yao et al 2021 4 conclusions this research has stimulated the land use patterns under different land use scenarios and investigated responses of runoff sediment yields and economic benefits under each scenario 1 from this research converting dry land into paddy land and converting agricultural land into the forest would reduce runoff and sediment yields in contrast converting paddy land into dry land would increase runoff and sediment yield causing soil erosion these changes in runoff and sediment yields vary spatially in the studies watershed 2 the results indicate a probable precipitation threshold for the land use change effect on runoff and sediment yields if the precipitation is larger than the threshold the effect of land use change on runoff and sediment yields would be weakened in addition to precipitation the topography is an essential factor in sediment generation agricultural land both dry land and paddy land will generate much more sediment yields in the mountainous area compared to that in the plain the effect of topography on sediment yield is greater than that of land use and land use has a greater effect on sediment yield than soil type when the topography is similar different agricultural types affect runoff in the division of surface runoff and subsurface runoff the paddy land is more beneficial for conserving subsurface runoff compared to dry land 3 compared to the grain for green program encouraging local farmers to change their agricultural land type from dry land to paddy land is a better way to mitigate soil erosion which will simultaneously obviously increase the economic benefits for local farmers for many watersheds a reasonable proportion of dry land and paddy land could be determined based on local water resource characteristics to reduce soil erosion without abandoning agricultural land and the scenario could also be effective in soil erosion mitigation under climate changes in the future credit authorship contribution statement chong wei conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

7863,study region south africa study focus this study focuses on the impact of overgrazing on the water resources in a semi arid catchment in south africa we have applied the swat model to a data scarce area during the modeling process hydropedological principles were applied in model parameterization and analysis of simulation results to identify areas which are sensitive to overgrazing the scenario analysis indicates that overgrazing might not necessarily have a large impact on the water balance of the whole watershed but may have negative impacts at the local subbasin scale these impacts are increased surface runoff and evaporation which are the consequence of compaction of topsoils new hydrological insights for the region the application of hydropedological principles in the analysis of simulation results help to identify areas sensitive to overgrazing shallow soils soils with low surface infiltration capacities and hydromorphic soils are vulnerable to adverse effects

of landscapes since they control most hydrological processes like evapotranspiration and runoff generation vereecken et al 2015 among others soils are influenced by land use and land use change borrelli et al 2017 leading mostly to a decreasing soil quality fao and itps 2015 in present time the quality of the global soils can only be rated with fair poor or very poor condition fao and itps 2015 because of human activities such as grazing or livestock ranging borrelli et al 2017 lai and kumar 2020 grazing with varying intensities is one of the most frequent practices worldwide in grass and rangelands lai and kumar 2020 this practice has negative impacts and can result in soil degradation and erosion especially in areas subjected to high intensity grazing lai and kumar 2020 moreover high grazing intensities affect grassland vegetation by reducing leaf area index lai and species richness hao et al 2018 rutherford and powrie 2013 xu et al 2013 impacts of livestock grazing at varying intensities on soil properties and related hydrological fluxes have been a subject of several studies these studies reported that the treading and trampling of the livestock increases the bulk density of the topsoil through compaction fatichi et al 2014 lai and kumar 2020 zhao et al 2010 these changes of the topsoil structure result in decreased water content lai and kumar 2020 zhao et al 2010 kairis et al 2015 lower hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity fiedler et al 2002 fatichi et al 2014 kairis et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 the changes in the hydraulic properties of the topsoil through compaction under high grazing intensities lead to more surface runoff generation and related soil erosion fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 park et al 2017 infiltration is consequently reduced and coupled with reduced vegetative cover will result in decreased transpiration pereyra et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 the impact of varying grazing intensities on soil functions and related hydrological fluxes have been determined by experiments lai and kumar 2020 fatichi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 fiedler et al 2002 among others and modeling studies at the plot as well as the watershed scale chaubey et al 2010 park et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 among others for watershed scale modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to assess the impact of grazing chaubey et al 2010 gassman et al 2007 park et al 2017 hydrological models are useful tools to develop measures in the frame of integrated water resources management gassman et al 2007 however a major limitation on conducting modeling studies at watershed scale is the availability of model input data in most cases spatial soil information lilly et al 1998 tavares wahren et al 2016 van tol et al 2020 one approach to overcome this data scarcity is to use digital soil mapping e g mcbratney at al 2003 to provide the input data which is needed for watershed scale modeling tavares wahren et al 2016 van tol et al 2020 the presented study focuses on a grassland dominated watershed in south africa comparable to other grass and rangelands worldwide intensive livestock grazing in grass and rangelands in south africa have led to a degradation of soil functions and properties chungag et al 2017 du toit et al 2009 like in other regions the availability of soil input data for watershed scale modeling is limited in south africa as well van tol et al 2020 the objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model swat bieger et al 2017 to assess the impact of high grazing intensity on fluxes of blue and green water cf falkenmark and rockström 2006 in a data scarce catchment data scarcity is overcome by combining readily available soil data with surveys of landscape position and the application of hydropedological principles van tol et al 2021 lin et al 2010 we hypothesize that there are differences in the vulnerability to the adverse impacts of overgrazing among different hydropedological soil groups to test this hypothesis we developed different scenarios which describe overgrazing at different landscape positions in the watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and input data the study area is located in the eastern part of the free state province in south africa it covers the quaternary catchment c18f fig 1 as delineated by the department of water and sanitation of south africa dws quaternary catchments are the smallest and most detailed entity used for planning purposes in the dws schulze et al 2007 the catchment c81f has an area of 696 km2 and is located between 28 22 00 and 28 48 00 s latitude and between 28 40 00 and 28 57 00 e longitude the altitude ranges from 1620 to 3270 m asl with the highest lying area in the south forming part of the maloti drakensberg mountain range which is also the border between south africa and lesotho fig 1 more than half of the catchment 55 has a slope of 15 with the southern side of the catchment being steeper and flattening occurring towards the north fig 2c the mountains in the south result in a marked increase in annual rainfall from the north 650 mm to the south 1250 mm schulze and lynch 2007 the mean annual temperature is approximately 14 8 c schulze and maharaj 2007 the vegetation of the higher lying areas is dominated by ukhahlamba basalt grassland with eastern free state sandy grassland occurring in the lower lying areas as input data for the modeling study we used the 30 m digital elevation model srtm 2013 14 south african land cover data geoterraimage 2014 and soil data from the land type database of south africa land type survey staff 1972 2002 a land type is an area which can be demarcated at a scale of 1 250 000 with uniform climate geological and topographical patterns as well as uniform soil distribution patterns patterson et al 2015 the meteorological input data is from the bethlehem station of the south african weather services complemented by 4 stations near the study area from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2015 2 2 land use fig 2b shows the land use distribution in the study area in the watershed grassland is the dominating land use 65 followed by urban areas 16 and shrubland 10 all other depicted land use classes have a share of 5 2 3 soil the land type dataset is the only soil information which covers the whole of south africa it is important to note that a land type is not a soil polygon but rather an area with homogenous soil distribution pattern from the crest to the valley bottom the land type inventories accompanying the spatial information describes the soils occurring in various terrain positions here we divided each land type into an upland and floodplain the upland represents the crest and midslope positions and the floodplain the lower footslope and valley bottom the dominant soil forms occurring in these landscape positions were then identified as depicted in table 1 to simplify parameterization the soil forms were regrouped into hydropedological groups van tol and le roux 2019 soil input parameters were obtained from pike and schulze 1995 where possible or derived from pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 c f tables s1 s4 in the supplement the defining characteristics of the hydropedological soil groups in the study area can be described according to van tol and le roux 2019 as follows interflow soil bedrock soils overlying bedrock with low permeability as indicated by hydromorphic properties at the soil bedrock interface perched water table at the bedrock interface will result in interflow at the soil bedrock interface interflow a b hydromorphic properties grey colors and ferrolysis between top and subsoil signify periodic saturation typically duplex profiles with textural discontinuity between top and subsoil resulting in a perched water table at a b horizon interface and interflow recharge deep soils without hydromorphic properties such as mottling or grey colors caused by gleying vertical drainage through and out of the profile is dominant typically deep profiles with large storage capacity for transpiration in this study we distinguish between two recharge deep groups 1 those dominated by coarse material hutton and dundee where fast vertical drainage is expected and 2 those dominated by fine material bonheim and valsrivier where vertical movement is expected to be slow responsive shallow these can either be very shallow soils with limited storage capacity e g mispah milkwood and rock or soils with very low surface infiltration rates during the rainy season arcadia the soils storage capacity or infiltration rate will be exceeded following rain storms and promote overland flow generation responsive wet gleyed subsoil indicates long periods of saturation typically wetland soils soil will respond quickly to rain events and promote overland flow due to saturation excess 2 4 swat and model setup for the simulation of the water balance in the study area and the different scenarios on overgrazing the model swat bieger et al 2017 which is a revised version of the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 was used in swat the general water balance equation is solved at the level of hydrological response units hru which are formed from areas within a subbasin which possess the same land use soil and slope characteristics in order to form the hru s the watershed is divided into subbasins based on the information of a digital elevation model the water fluxes calculated from the water balance equation at hru level are accumulated for each subbasin and routed to the main watershed outlet via a defined stream network in the new swat version landscape units were introduced where hydrological and biogeochemical fluxes can be routed through different landscape elements such as hillslope floodplains and wetlands according to bieger et al 2019 landscape units lsu are connected based on topography and their topology hru s form the basic elements of the lsu where all water fluxes are calculated based on user defined portions lateral flow and surface runoff are send to the downward connected lsu there for instance surface runoff can be subjected to infiltration into the soil or is accumulated to the surface runoff which is formed in the lsu and routed either to the next lsu or if closer to the stream the lsu are connected to one groundwater aquifer which receives the groundwater recharge this aquifer contributes to streamflow via groundwater or base flow in the presented model setup the watershed was divided in 25 subbasins fig 2c 245 landscape units and 1190 hru s 2 5 calibration and validation before scenario simulation the model was calibrated with the r package swatplusr schuerz 2019 with the r package lhs carnell 2022 1000 parameter sets were generated with the parameters and the respective ranges listed in table 2 the parameters have been selected based on the experience from the studies of van tol and le roux 2019 van tol et al 2020 in south africa and from the studies of mwangi et al 2016 and kamamia et al 2019 in other data scarce watersheds in tropical africa from the parameter sets 1000 iterations of the model with the swatplusr package were done for the calibration period january 2006 december 2009 for each calibration run the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the percentage bias pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 were calculated for simulated and observed streamflow at a monthly time step from the thousand simulations for the calibration we selected the parameter sets which resulted in values 0 65 for nse and between 15 for pbias which have been rated as good by moriasi et al 2007 for the selected parameter sets simulations were done for a validation period january 2010 december 2012 and the above mentioned criteria were calculated as well the parameter set with the best efficiency with regard to nse and pbias in the validation period was selected for the simulation of the scenarios all simulations were realized with a model warm up phase of two years before the calibration and validation period respectively the simulation results during that warm up were not considered in the calibration and validation process 2 6 scenario development in order to evaluate the impact of overgrazing on grassland on the blue and green water fluxes in the study area three scenarios were simulated and compared to a baseline scenario which represents the state without the impact of overgrazing the analyzed water fluxes are transpiration evaporation surface run off and lateral flow as well as the water content in the top 30 cm of the soil as these are mostly impacted by overgrazing and are also the most important elements of the water cycle in a semi arid watershed scenario a investigates the impact of overgrazing in the floodplain as this is a common local practice scenario b considers overgrazing on slopes which were steeper than 15 where the hydropedological group responsive shallow is dominant in scenario c only grassland with slopes flatter than 15 are considered where the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock can be mainly found table 3 summarizes the extend of the scenarios in the studied watershed based on the topography and land use in the study area for scenarios a b and c 2 46 and 25 of the total catchment area are considered in the scenarios respectively overgrazing mainly influences the properties of the topsoil the most impacts reported in the literature are an increase of moist bulk density chaichi et al 2005 chungag et al 2017 du toit et al 2009 teague et al 2011 a decrease of available water capacity chaichi et al 2005 teague et al 2011 a decrease of the saturated hydraulic conductivity chungag et al 2017 teague et al 2011 and a reduction of the organic carbon content dlamini et al 2016 teague et al 2011 for each scenario the soil properties were changed in the previously defined areas to simulate overgrazing the applied changes to the respective soil parameters are given in table 4 changes were only made in the top layer of the respective soil c f table s4 supplement 3 results table 5 presents the results for the best parameter set table 2 after the calibration and validation process for the calibration period 0 72 for nse and 0 5 for pbias was achieved for the validation period the values dropped to 0 42 nse and 35 pbias if the total simulation period for the scenarios 2006 2012 is considered the simulation efficiency is 0 54 for nse and 16 for pbias fig 3 provides an overview of the simulated and observed hydrographs during the calibration and validation period it can be seen that the model with the selected parameter set is able to follow the dynamics of dry periods and rainy seasons during the majority of the simulated period the model slightly to moderately overestimates the discharge only in the rainy season of 2009 is the discharge underestimated by the model the most significant overestimation by the model occurs in the rainy season at the end of the year 2012 likely due to uncertainties in the precipitation data which result in uncertainties in the simulation of discharge the simulated water fluxes for each hru reflect the behavior which is expected for the respective hydropedological groups fig s2 in the supplement summarizes the simulated hydrological fluxes per hydropedological groups for all hru s the majority of the soils in the watershed belong to the group responsive shallow and interflow soil bedrock where lateral flow and surface runoff are dominating processes this explains the quick reaction of the catchment to rainfall events and the low dry weather flows since only little amounts of water contribute to groundwater recharge and base flow significant percolation occurs only for the groups interflow a b and recharge deep slow which mostly occur in the areas with shallow slope table 6 summarizes the results of the simulation of the baseline and the three overgrazing scenarios as mean annual values for blue and green water fluxes for the whole watershed overgrazing according to scenario a overgrazing on the floodplains has only little impact on the overall water balance of the watershed here the water content until a depth of 30 cm decreased and surface runoff increased minimally the changes in water fluxes as a consequence of overgrazing according to scenario b overgrazing on grassland with more than 15 slope results in larger changes of the water balance as in scenario a the largest changes occurred in the water content of the top 30 cm of the soils here a decrease of around 6 compared to the baseline could be observed in scenario b an increase in surface runoff and evaporation from the soil of 1 6 and 2 5 respectively occurred water yield and lateral flow decreased by 1 8 and 3 8 compared to the baseline respectively for scenario c overgrazing on grassland with less than 15 slope surface runoff and evaporation from the soil increased by 2 6 and 1 6 in comparison to the baseline respectively for all other components of the water balance a decrease was observed with the strongest decline for water content in the uppermost 30 cm soil depth 9 3 in fig 4 the changes of the water fluxes for all subbasins for scenario a overgrazing on the floodplains as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups are illustrated among all subbasins interflow a b covers the majority of overgrazed areas between 1 and 15 of the respective subbasin area in contrast to the total watershed larger changes in the water balance components in all subbasins were simulated the graph shows for scenario a an increase of surface runoff between 1 and 5 for the majority of the subbasins also the water yield in the majority of the subbasins experienced slight increases in contrast the lateral flow decreased due to overgrazing in most subbasins the soil water content at 30 cm depth decreased in most subbasins between 2 and 5 as well resulting in a decrease of transpiration in fig 5 the changes in water fluxes for scenario b overgrazing on grasslands on areas with slope larger 15 at the subbasin scale as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups can be seen in the majority of the subbasins overgrazing occurred on soils which belong to the hydropedological group responsive shallow followed by soils of the group interflow soil bedrock the surface runoff in the subbasin increased between 1 and 10 mostly in subbasins with a high share of areas with responsive shallow soils for water yield slight increases and decreases could be noted whereas lateral flow mostly decreased similar to scenario a evaporation increased in the subbasins related with a decrease in water content in the first 30 cm for transpiration only small changes were observed in fig 6 the changes in water fluxes for scenario c overgrazing on grasslands with slope lower 15 at the subbasin scale as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups are illustrated for this scenario overgrazing mostly occurred on areas with soils which can be associated with the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock and recharge deep slow in several subbasins overgrazing also occurred on soils which belong to the group responsive shallow surface runoff increased in the majority of the subbasins between 1 and 25 where the highest increases can be noted for subbasins with a high share of responsive shallow soils for water yield and lateral flow mostly slight to moderate decreases could be noted for all subbasins an increase in evaporation and a decrease in water content for the uppermost 30 cm of soil could be noted whereas transpiration did not change significantly fig 7 summarizes the change in water fluxes for overgrazing on grassland under scenario a overgrazing in the floodplain for all affected hru s and the respective hydropedological groups it can be seen that for this scenario surface runoffs increased on all hydropedological groups around 7 on average higher increases for evaporation could be noted for soils of the group responsive shallow related with decreases in lateral flow lateral flow for the other hydropedological groups did not decrease significantly all hydropedological groups show reductions of the water content in the uppermost 30 cm of soil with the largest decrease for the group responsive shallow fig 8 displays the changes in the water balance caused by overgrazing on grassland under scenario b areas with slopes larger than 15 for all affected hru s the increase in surface runoff between the hru s with the different hydropedological soil groups is stronger compared to scenario a whereas for soils of the group responsive shallow a larger increase in surface runoff could be noted compared to the other groups for this group a higher increase in evaporation can also be observed the group of responsive shallow soils had the largest reductions in lateral flow whereas the water content in the top 30 cm of the soil decreased the most under soils of the group recharge deep slow fig 9 summarizes the change in water fluxes for all hru s affected by overgrazing on grassland under scenario c areas with slopes lower than 15 for the respective hydropedological groups the highest increases in surface runoff could be noted for soils of the groups responsive shallow and interflow a b for responsive shallow soils and soils of group recharge deep slow a reduction in evaporation was simulated as well for the soils in the group interflow soil bedrock an increase in lateral flow was simulated whereas for all other groups lateral flow decreased responsive shallow soils strongest for all hydropedological groups water content of the first 30 cm decreased 4 discussion the values for nse and pbias during calibration validation as well as for the total simulation period are in the recommended or at least acceptable range according to the proposed evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 the values of et water yield surface runoff and lateral flow in the baseline simulation are comparable to simulated values in other catchments which are situated in the same climatic region van tol et al 2020 this indicates that swat is able to capture the governing rainfall runoff processes which is a prerequisite for scenario analysis gupta et al 2005 swat has been also successful to represent crop management in northeastern africa nkwasa et al 2022 and to identify connectivity between upland and floodplain areas in a catchment in the united states bieger et al 2019 depending on the share of the affected area the simulated impact of overgrazing on the water balance of the total watershed is small as the simulation results indicate overgrazing leads to an increase in surface runoff and evaporation and consequently to a reduction of lateral flow between 0 and 4 for all fluxes which has only little impact on the water yield of the whole watershed however on the local and subbasin scale the effects of overgrazing are much larger depending on the scenario for instance an increase in surface runoff between 1 and 25 compared to the baseline was simulated the increase in surface runoff was mostly associated with higher evaporation and a reduction of lateral flow and a decrease in transpiration zhao et al 2010 combined field measurements and hydrological simulation to assess the effect of heavy grazing and found a reduction in infiltration and transpiration as well as a increase in evaporation mainly for the scenarios b and c it could be noted that the increase in surface runoff was related with the share of the hydropedological soil groups responsive shallow and interflow a b the soils of the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock show only smaller increases in surface runoff and evaporation this may indicate a higher vulnerability to overgrazing and related compaction for certain hydropedological soil groups overgrazing or intensive grazing is associated with the compaction increase in bulk density of the topsoil and a decrease in hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 and consequently to increased surface runoff and associated erosion fao and itps 2015 lai and kumar 2020 in the scenario simulations the hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of the top layer decreased 50 and 25 respectively depending on the soil type and bulk density increased 12 this resulted in decreased infiltration capacities for the soils of the hydropedological groups responsive shallow and interflow a b which already have the lowest infiltration capacities of all soils in the watershed cf table s2 in supplement the infiltration capacities of the soils of the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock are reduced as well due to compaction from overgrazing but this reduction was not high enough to impede infiltration and water movement through the soil reduced infiltration capacities of the soils with higher clay content hydropedological groups responsive shallow and interflow a b resulted in ponding of water at the soil surface during rainfall events and in presence of a sloping gradient the water runs off as surface runoff the water from the surface runoff either reaches the stream network and contributes to discharge or it is stored in other landscapes elements like depressions where it is evaporated or reinfiltrates into the soil a process which is simulated with the landscape units in the new swat model bieger et al 2017 these complex interactions at the landscape scale were also observed by fiedler et al 2002 who found that overgrazing can lead to reduced infiltration on one place and increased infiltration on another place run on phenomenon this can provide an explanation for the little observed impact of overgrazing at the watershed scale but larger observed changes at the subbasin and local scale higher surface runoff and evaporation due to overgrazing can be confirmed by the results of other field studies which also found an increase in surface runoff and evaporation fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 park et al 2017 the integration of hydropedological principles in model parameterization as well as in the analysis of simulation results supported the identification of areas in the watershed which are more sensitive to overgrazing these findings are confirmed by studies of tavares wahren et al 2016 and van tol et al 2020 who also concluded that detailed soil information improves simulation quality as lin 2010 stated hydropedological principles can contribute to understanding the impact of land use and land management on the interaction between soil functions and the water cycle in complex landscapes 5 conclusions our findings show that despite limitations in input data meteorological and soil data swat is a useful tool to identify areas where overgrazing have a larger impact on water resources this modeling approach was supported by the integration of hydropedological principles in model parameterization as well as analysis of simulation results in these identified areas overgrazing may lead to negative impacts such as soil erosion and consequently a loss of soil functions furthermore the simulations indicate that the impact of overgrazing not necessarily significant when the entire watershed is considered but more visible at the local subbasin scale the consequences of overgrazing are increased surface runoff generation and increased evaporation which are associated with compaction and reduction in vegetative cover increase surface runoff is mostly linked with higher erosion which hampers soil quality and function with the model based scenario analysis it was possible to identify sensitive areas at the local scale which are dominated by soils of the groups responsive shallow and interflow a b this information can assist in the process of soil protection and resources management to develop focused mitigation measures to reduce overgrazing and therefore limit its negative impacts on soil and water resources credit authorship contribution statement sj and jvt conceived the study approach mam conducted the simulation and

2015 because of human activities such as grazing or livestock ranging borrelli et al 2017 lai and kumar 2020 grazing with varying intensities is one of the most frequent practices worldwide in grass and rangelands lai and kumar 2020 this practice has negative impacts and can result in soil degradation and erosion especially in areas subjected to high intensity grazing lai and kumar 2020 moreover high grazing intensities affect grassland vegetation by reducing leaf area index lai and species richness hao et al 2018 rutherford and powrie 2013 xu et al 2013 impacts of livestock grazing at varying intensities on soil properties and related hydrological fluxes have been a subject of several studies these studies reported that the treading and trampling of the livestock increases the bulk density of the topsoil through compaction fatichi et al 2014 lai and kumar 2020 zhao et al 2010 these changes of the topsoil structure result in decreased water content lai and kumar 2020 zhao et al 2010 kairis et al 2015 lower hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity fiedler et al 2002 fatichi et al 2014 kairis et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 the changes in the hydraulic properties of the topsoil through compaction under high grazing intensities lead to more surface runoff generation and related soil erosion fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 park et al 2017 infiltration is consequently reduced and coupled with reduced vegetative cover will result in decreased transpiration pereyra et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 the impact of varying grazing intensities on soil functions and related hydrological fluxes have been determined by experiments lai and kumar 2020 fatichi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 fiedler et al 2002 among others and modeling studies at the plot as well as the watershed scale chaubey et al 2010 park et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 among others for watershed scale modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to assess the impact of grazing chaubey et al 2010 gassman et al 2007 park et al 2017 hydrological models are useful tools to develop measures in the frame of integrated water resources management gassman et al 2007 however a major limitation on conducting modeling studies at watershed scale is the availability of model input data in most cases spatial soil information lilly et al 1998 tavares wahren et al 2016 van tol et al 2020 one approach to overcome this data scarcity is to use digital soil mapping e g mcbratney at al 2003 to provide the input data which is needed for watershed scale modeling tavares wahren et al 2016 van tol et al 2020 the presented study focuses on a grassland dominated watershed in south africa comparable to other grass and rangelands worldwide intensive livestock grazing in grass and rangelands in south africa have led to a degradation of soil functions and properties chungag et al 2017 du toit et al 2009 like in other regions the availability of soil input data for watershed scale modeling is limited in south africa as well van tol et al 2020 the objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model swat bieger et al 2017 to assess the impact of high grazing intensity on fluxes of blue and green water cf falkenmark and rockström 2006 in a data scarce catchment data scarcity is overcome by combining readily available soil data with surveys of landscape position and the application of hydropedological principles van tol et al 2021 lin et al 2010 we hypothesize that there are differences in the vulnerability to the adverse impacts of overgrazing among different hydropedological soil groups to test this hypothesis we developed different scenarios which describe overgrazing at different landscape positions in the watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and input data the study area is located in the eastern part of the free state province in south africa it covers the quaternary catchment c18f fig 1 as delineated by the department of water and sanitation of south africa dws quaternary catchments are the smallest and most detailed entity used for planning purposes in the dws schulze et al 2007 the catchment c81f has an area of 696 km2 and is located between 28 22 00 and 28 48 00 s latitude and between 28 40 00 and 28 57 00 e longitude the altitude ranges from 1620 to 3270 m asl with the highest lying area in the south forming part of the maloti drakensberg mountain range which is also the border between south africa and lesotho fig 1 more than half of the catchment 55 has a slope of 15 with the southern side of the catchment being steeper and flattening occurring towards the north fig 2c the mountains in the south result in a marked increase in annual rainfall from the north 650 mm to the south 1250 mm schulze and lynch 2007 the mean annual temperature is approximately 14 8 c schulze and maharaj 2007 the vegetation of the higher lying areas is dominated by ukhahlamba basalt grassland with eastern free state sandy grassland occurring in the lower lying areas as input data for the modeling study we used the 30 m digital elevation model srtm 2013 14 south african land cover data geoterraimage 2014 and soil data from the land type database of south africa land type survey staff 1972 2002 a land type is an area which can be demarcated at a scale of 1 250 000 with uniform climate geological and topographical patterns as well as uniform soil distribution patterns patterson et al 2015 the meteorological input data is from the bethlehem station of the south african weather services complemented by 4 stations near the study area from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2015 2 2 land use fig 2b shows the land use distribution in the study area in the watershed grassland is the dominating land use 65 followed by urban areas 16 and shrubland 10 all other depicted land use classes have a share of 5 2 3 soil the land type dataset is the only soil information which covers the whole of south africa it is important to note that a land type is not a soil polygon but rather an area with homogenous soil distribution pattern from the crest to the valley bottom the land type inventories accompanying the spatial information describes the soils occurring in various terrain positions here we divided each land type into an upland and floodplain the upland represents the crest and midslope positions and the floodplain the lower footslope and valley bottom the dominant soil forms occurring in these landscape positions were then identified as depicted in table 1 to simplify parameterization the soil forms were regrouped into hydropedological groups van tol and le roux 2019 soil input parameters were obtained from pike and schulze 1995 where possible or derived from pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 c f tables s1 s4 in the supplement the defining characteristics of the hydropedological soil groups in the study area can be described according to van tol and le roux 2019 as follows interflow soil bedrock soils overlying bedrock with low permeability as indicated by hydromorphic properties at the soil bedrock interface perched water table at the bedrock interface will result in interflow at the soil bedrock interface interflow a b hydromorphic properties grey colors and ferrolysis between top and subsoil signify periodic saturation typically duplex profiles with textural discontinuity between top and subsoil resulting in a perched water table at a b horizon interface and interflow recharge deep soils without hydromorphic properties such as mottling or grey colors caused by gleying vertical drainage through and out of the profile is dominant typically deep profiles with large storage capacity for transpiration in this study we distinguish between two recharge deep groups 1 those dominated by coarse material hutton and dundee where fast vertical drainage is expected and 2 those dominated by fine material bonheim and valsrivier where vertical movement is expected to be slow responsive shallow these can either be very shallow soils with limited storage capacity e g mispah milkwood and rock or soils with very low surface infiltration rates during the rainy season arcadia the soils storage capacity or infiltration rate will be exceeded following rain storms and promote overland flow generation responsive wet gleyed subsoil indicates long periods of saturation typically wetland soils soil will respond quickly to rain events and promote overland flow due to saturation excess 2 4 swat and model setup for the simulation of the water balance in the study area and the different scenarios on overgrazing the model swat bieger et al 2017 which is a revised version of the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 was used in swat the general water balance equation is solved at the level of hydrological response units hru which are formed from areas within a subbasin which possess the same land use soil and slope characteristics in order to form the hru s the watershed is divided into subbasins based on the information of a digital elevation model the water fluxes calculated from the water balance equation at hru level are accumulated for each subbasin and routed to the main watershed outlet via a defined stream network in the new swat version landscape units were introduced where hydrological and biogeochemical fluxes can be routed through different landscape elements such as hillslope floodplains and wetlands according to bieger et al 2019 landscape units lsu are connected based on topography and their topology hru s form the basic elements of the lsu where all water fluxes are calculated based on user defined portions lateral flow and surface runoff are send to the downward connected lsu there for instance surface runoff can be subjected to infiltration into the soil or is accumulated to the surface runoff which is formed in the lsu and routed either to the next lsu or if closer to the stream the lsu are connected to one groundwater aquifer which receives the groundwater recharge this aquifer contributes to streamflow via groundwater or base flow in the presented model setup the watershed was divided in 25 subbasins fig 2c 245 landscape units and 1190 hru s 2 5 calibration and validation before scenario simulation the model was calibrated with the r package swatplusr schuerz 2019 with the r package lhs carnell 2022 1000 parameter sets were generated with the parameters and the respective ranges listed in table 2 the parameters have been selected based on the experience from the studies of van tol and le roux 2019 van tol et al 2020 in south africa and from the studies of mwangi et al 2016 and kamamia et al 2019 in other data scarce watersheds in tropical africa from the parameter sets 1000 iterations of the model with the swatplusr package were done for the calibration period january 2006 december 2009 for each calibration run the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the percentage bias pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 were calculated for simulated and observed streamflow at a monthly time step from the thousand simulations for the calibration we selected the parameter sets which resulted in values 0 65 for nse and between 15 for pbias which have been rated as good by moriasi et al 2007 for the selected parameter sets simulations were done for a validation period january 2010 december 2012 and the above mentioned criteria were calculated as well the parameter set with the best efficiency with regard to nse and pbias in the validation period was selected for the simulation of the scenarios all simulations were realized with a model warm up phase of two years before the calibration and validation period respectively the simulation results during that warm up were not considered in the calibration and validation process 2 6 scenario development in order to evaluate the impact of overgrazing on grassland on the blue and green water fluxes in the study area three scenarios were simulated and compared to a baseline scenario which represents the state without the impact of overgrazing the analyzed water fluxes are transpiration evaporation surface run off and lateral flow as well as the water content in the top 30 cm of the soil as these are mostly impacted by overgrazing and are also the most important elements of the water cycle in a semi arid watershed scenario a investigates the impact of overgrazing in the floodplain as this is a common local practice scenario b considers overgrazing on slopes which were steeper than 15 where the hydropedological group responsive shallow is dominant in scenario c only grassland with slopes flatter than 15 are considered where the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock can be mainly found table 3 summarizes the extend of the scenarios in the studied watershed based on the topography and land use in the study area for scenarios a b and c 2 46 and 25 of the total catchment area are considered in the scenarios respectively overgrazing mainly influences the properties of the topsoil the most impacts reported in the literature are an increase of moist bulk density chaichi et al 2005 chungag et al 2017 du toit et al 2009 teague et al 2011 a decrease of available water capacity chaichi et al 2005 teague et al 2011 a decrease of the saturated hydraulic conductivity chungag et al 2017 teague et al 2011 and a reduction of the organic carbon content dlamini et al 2016 teague et al 2011 for each scenario the soil properties were changed in the previously defined areas to simulate overgrazing the applied changes to the respective soil parameters are given in table 4 changes were only made in the top layer of the respective soil c f table s4 supplement 3 results table 5 presents the results for the best parameter set table 2 after the calibration and validation process for the calibration period 0 72 for nse and 0 5 for pbias was achieved for the validation period the values dropped to 0 42 nse and 35 pbias if the total simulation period for the scenarios 2006 2012 is considered the simulation efficiency is 0 54 for nse and 16 for pbias fig 3 provides an overview of the simulated and observed hydrographs during the calibration and validation period it can be seen that the model with the selected parameter set is able to follow the dynamics of dry periods and rainy seasons during the majority of the simulated period the model slightly to moderately overestimates the discharge only in the rainy season of 2009 is the discharge underestimated by the model the most significant overestimation by the model occurs in the rainy season at the end of the year 2012 likely due to uncertainties in the precipitation data which result in uncertainties in the simulation of discharge the simulated water fluxes for each hru reflect the behavior which is expected for the respective hydropedological groups fig s2 in the supplement summarizes the simulated hydrological fluxes per hydropedological groups for all hru s the majority of the soils in the watershed belong to the group responsive shallow and interflow soil bedrock where lateral flow and surface runoff are dominating processes this explains the quick reaction of the catchment to rainfall events and the low dry weather flows since only little amounts of water contribute to groundwater recharge and base flow significant percolation occurs only for the groups interflow a b and recharge deep slow which mostly occur in the areas with shallow slope table 6 summarizes the results of the simulation of the baseline and the three overgrazing scenarios as mean annual values for blue and green water fluxes for the whole watershed overgrazing according to scenario a overgrazing on the floodplains has only little impact on the overall water balance of the watershed here the water content until a depth of 30 cm decreased and surface runoff increased minimally the changes in water fluxes as a consequence of overgrazing according to scenario b overgrazing on grassland with more than 15 slope results in larger changes of the water balance as in scenario a the largest changes occurred in the water content of the top 30 cm of the soils here a decrease of around 6 compared to the baseline could be observed in scenario b an increase in surface runoff and evaporation from the soil of 1 6 and 2 5 respectively occurred water yield and lateral flow decreased by 1 8 and 3 8 compared to the baseline respectively for scenario c overgrazing on grassland with less than 15 slope surface runoff and evaporation from the soil increased by 2 6 and 1 6 in comparison to the baseline respectively for all other components of the water balance a decrease was observed with the strongest decline for water content in the uppermost 30 cm soil depth 9 3 in fig 4 the changes of the water fluxes for all subbasins for scenario a overgrazing on the floodplains as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups are illustrated among all subbasins interflow a b covers the majority of overgrazed areas between 1 and 15 of the respective subbasin area in contrast to the total watershed larger changes in the water balance components in all subbasins were simulated the graph shows for scenario a an increase of surface runoff between 1 and 5 for the majority of the subbasins also the water yield in the majority of the subbasins experienced slight increases in contrast the lateral flow decreased due to overgrazing in most subbasins the soil water content at 30 cm depth decreased in most subbasins between 2 and 5 as well resulting in a decrease of transpiration in fig 5 the changes in water fluxes for scenario b overgrazing on grasslands on areas with slope larger 15 at the subbasin scale as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups can be seen in the majority of the subbasins overgrazing occurred on soils which belong to the hydropedological group responsive shallow followed by soils of the group interflow soil bedrock the surface runoff in the subbasin increased between 1 and 10 mostly in subbasins with a high share of areas with responsive shallow soils for water yield slight increases and decreases could be noted whereas lateral flow mostly decreased similar to scenario a evaporation increased in the subbasins related with a decrease in water content in the first 30 cm for transpiration only small changes were observed in fig 6 the changes in water fluxes for scenario c overgrazing on grasslands with slope lower 15 at the subbasin scale as well as the share of overgrazed areas among the hydropedological soil groups are illustrated for this scenario overgrazing mostly occurred on areas with soils which can be associated with the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock and recharge deep slow in several subbasins overgrazing also occurred on soils which belong to the group responsive shallow surface runoff increased in the majority of the subbasins between 1 and 25 where the highest increases can be noted for subbasins with a high share of responsive shallow soils for water yield and lateral flow mostly slight to moderate decreases could be noted for all subbasins an increase in evaporation and a decrease in water content for the uppermost 30 cm of soil could be noted whereas transpiration did not change significantly fig 7 summarizes the change in water fluxes for overgrazing on grassland under scenario a overgrazing in the floodplain for all affected hru s and the respective hydropedological groups it can be seen that for this scenario surface runoffs increased on all hydropedological groups around 7 on average higher increases for evaporation could be noted for soils of the group responsive shallow related with decreases in lateral flow lateral flow for the other hydropedological groups did not decrease significantly all hydropedological groups show reductions of the water content in the uppermost 30 cm of soil with the largest decrease for the group responsive shallow fig 8 displays the changes in the water balance caused by overgrazing on grassland under scenario b areas with slopes larger than 15 for all affected hru s the increase in surface runoff between the hru s with the different hydropedological soil groups is stronger compared to scenario a whereas for soils of the group responsive shallow a larger increase in surface runoff could be noted compared to the other groups for this group a higher increase in evaporation can also be observed the group of responsive shallow soils had the largest reductions in lateral flow whereas the water content in the top 30 cm of the soil decreased the most under soils of the group recharge deep slow fig 9 summarizes the change in water fluxes for all hru s affected by overgrazing on grassland under scenario c areas with slopes lower than 15 for the respective hydropedological groups the highest increases in surface runoff could be noted for soils of the groups responsive shallow and interflow a b for responsive shallow soils and soils of group recharge deep slow a reduction in evaporation was simulated as well for the soils in the group interflow soil bedrock an increase in lateral flow was simulated whereas for all other groups lateral flow decreased responsive shallow soils strongest for all hydropedological groups water content of the first 30 cm decreased 4 discussion the values for nse and pbias during calibration validation as well as for the total simulation period are in the recommended or at least acceptable range according to the proposed evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 the values of et water yield surface runoff and lateral flow in the baseline simulation are comparable to simulated values in other catchments which are situated in the same climatic region van tol et al 2020 this indicates that swat is able to capture the governing rainfall runoff processes which is a prerequisite for scenario analysis gupta et al 2005 swat has been also successful to represent crop management in northeastern africa nkwasa et al 2022 and to identify connectivity between upland and floodplain areas in a catchment in the united states bieger et al 2019 depending on the share of the affected area the simulated impact of overgrazing on the water balance of the total watershed is small as the simulation results indicate overgrazing leads to an increase in surface runoff and evaporation and consequently to a reduction of lateral flow between 0 and 4 for all fluxes which has only little impact on the water yield of the whole watershed however on the local and subbasin scale the effects of overgrazing are much larger depending on the scenario for instance an increase in surface runoff between 1 and 25 compared to the baseline was simulated the increase in surface runoff was mostly associated with higher evaporation and a reduction of lateral flow and a decrease in transpiration zhao et al 2010 combined field measurements and hydrological simulation to assess the effect of heavy grazing and found a reduction in infiltration and transpiration as well as a increase in evaporation mainly for the scenarios b and c it could be noted that the increase in surface runoff was related with the share of the hydropedological soil groups responsive shallow and interflow a b the soils of the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock show only smaller increases in surface runoff and evaporation this may indicate a higher vulnerability to overgrazing and related compaction for certain hydropedological soil groups overgrazing or intensive grazing is associated with the compaction increase in bulk density of the topsoil and a decrease in hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 and consequently to increased surface runoff and associated erosion fao and itps 2015 lai and kumar 2020 in the scenario simulations the hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of the top layer decreased 50 and 25 respectively depending on the soil type and bulk density increased 12 this resulted in decreased infiltration capacities for the soils of the hydropedological groups responsive shallow and interflow a b which already have the lowest infiltration capacities of all soils in the watershed cf table s2 in supplement the infiltration capacities of the soils of the hydropedological group interflow soil bedrock are reduced as well due to compaction from overgrazing but this reduction was not high enough to impede infiltration and water movement through the soil reduced infiltration capacities of the soils with higher clay content hydropedological groups responsive shallow and interflow a b resulted in ponding of water at the soil surface during rainfall events and in presence of a sloping gradient the water runs off as surface runoff the water from the surface runoff either reaches the stream network and contributes to discharge or it is stored in other landscapes elements like depressions where it is evaporated or reinfiltrates into the soil a process which is simulated with the landscape units in the new swat model bieger et al 2017 these complex interactions at the landscape scale were also observed by fiedler et al 2002 who found that overgrazing can lead to reduced infiltration on one place and increased infiltration on another place run on phenomenon this can provide an explanation for the little observed impact of overgrazing at the watershed scale but larger observed changes at the subbasin and local scale higher surface runoff and evaporation due to overgrazing can be confirmed by the results of other field studies which also found an increase in surface runoff and evaporation fatichi et al 2014 fiedler et al 2002 kairis et al 2015 park et al 2017 the integration of hydropedological principles in model parameterization as well as in the analysis of simulation results supported the identification of areas in the watershed which are more sensitive to overgrazing these findings are confirmed by studies of tavares wahren et al 2016 and van tol et al 2020 who also concluded that detailed soil information improves simulation quality as lin 2010 stated hydropedological principles can contribute to understanding the impact of land use and land management on the interaction between soil functions and the water cycle in complex landscapes 5 conclusions our findings show that despite limitations in input data meteorological and soil data swat is a useful tool to identify areas where overgrazing have a larger impact on water resources this modeling approach was supported by the integration of hydropedological principles in model parameterization as well as analysis of simulation results in these identified areas overgrazing may lead to negative impacts such as soil erosion and consequently a loss of soil functions furthermore the simulations indicate that the impact of overgrazing not necessarily significant when the entire watershed is considered but more visible at the local subbasin scale the consequences of overgrazing are increased surface runoff generation and increased evaporation which are associated with compaction and reduction in vegetative cover increase surface runoff is mostly linked with higher erosion which hampers soil quality and function with the model based scenario analysis it was possible to identify sensitive areas at the local scale which are dominated by soils of the groups responsive shallow and interflow a b this information can assist in the process of soil protection and resources management to develop focused mitigation measures to reduce overgrazing and therefore limit its negative impacts on soil and water resources credit authorship contribution statement sj and jvt conceived the study approach mam conducted the simulation and

along with other balance components using gratis libre open access data and open source software the results were compared with the data available from the literature on central italy to validate the model and to investigate the variation in the gr while considering different lithologies the comparison of the gr results with anthropogenic water withdrawals enabled the evaluation of sustainable

between the different system of earth circulating between the atmosphere hydrosphere and geosphere this continuous movement which is essentially fed by solar energy and gravity is called the natural water cycle which can be schematised using a water balance equation as expressed below 1 p gr et ro where p is the precipitation in the form of rain and snow gr is the groundwater recharge et is evapotranspiration and ro is surface runoff these three terms represent the portion of precipitation p that infiltrates into the soil gr which then transfers into the atmosphere et and flows over the surface ro these terms are commonly expressed in millimetres per unit of surface and can be estimated over different spatio temporal scales generally the estimations of et are carried out by considering p and temperature t as the main input variables here we focused on gr which can be defined as the amount of meteoric water per unit surface that infiltrates into the soil recharging aquifers consequently this is a measure of the capability of a hydrogeological complex to absorb meteoric water in the european literature gr is also known as effective infiltration see e g boni and bono 1982 boni et al 1982 soulios 1984 boni et al 1986 destouni 1991 boni and petitta 1994 bonacci 2001 jukić and denić jukić 2004 jukić denić jukić 2008 nützmann and mey 2004 bonacci et al 2006 cassiani et al 2009 jemcov and petric 2009 mastrorillo and petitta 2010 spadoni et al 2010 romano et al 2014 allocca et al 2015 malard et al 2016 bar michalczyk et al 2017 de vita et al 2018 viaroli et al 2018 graf and jawgiel 2018 rossi and donnini 2018 in this study we used the term groundwater recharge which is most commonly used one in the international literature generally gr is expressed in mm year 1 and the existing studies purpose different methods for its estimation field direct indirect and water balance methods see e g rossi and donnini 2018 in field methods in situ investigations are performed to measure water fluxes and the groundwater levels directly or through geophysical surveys in direct methods the amount of water that flows from the ground is assumed to be equivalent to the amount of water that previously infiltrates the ground e g boni and petitta 1994 boni et al 1986 consequently in these studies gr was estimated by dividing the average volume of water discharged by the springs in one year by their recharge area in indirect methods gr was estimated as a percentage of precipitation by applying an empirical coefficient grc called the groundwater recharge coefficient this coefficient is dimensionless and ranges from 0 to 1 for different lithologies the water balance method estimates the terms of the natural water cycle expressed as the basic formulation of eq 1 the balance equation is resolved annually mm year 1 monthly mm month 1 or daily mm day 1 with a few exceptions at the sub daily scale the shorter the scale the more complex the abstraction and representation of water related processes and the more accurate the balance estimation however this process may have higher input data demands and result in larger uncertainties hence determining the scale for resolving the balance is not always straightforward the choice should depend on the final purpose of the analysis along with the final water balance components that need to be investigated and the ability to model them in space and time opting for the maximum temporal resolution e g day does not always lead to more accurate and reliable estimations and in some cases there is the possibility of high costs and extensive time requirement without obtaining any significant results in the case of gr analyses over large areas the water balance is generally applied at yearly or monthly scales mainly because it is difficult to calculate the subsurface water component estimations due to the requirement of unknown soil and rock related variables notably the basic water balance concept is widely and flexibly applied for different scientific and technical purposes many dynamic environmental processes such as the movement of nutrients contamination solute balance and sediment transport are led by the natural water cycle abdollahi et al 2018 water balance models can be used to study anthropogenic perturbations in the natural water cycle the human withdrawals w component can be added to the balance since it may have a possible non negligible effect on the final water budget estimation water balance models can be a useful tool for making strategic decisions to assess the environmental impacts of anthropogenic perturbations e g irrigation water supply and wastewater systems abdollahi et al 2018 estimating the amount of water stored in the aquifers and the variation caused by human withdrawals is in line with the goal 6 of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development https sdgs un org which aims to ensure access to water and sanitation for all and is one of the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs identified by the united nations un the sdgs are an urgent call for action by all countries aimed at ending poverty and other deprivations in 2019 17 countries i e one quarter of the world s population experienced extreme water stress hofste et al 2019 and this number will increase to 33 in 2040 maddocks et al 2015 in this study we focused on estimating gr over italy we used the water balance model named hydro bm for this purpose the model is open source and coded in r r core team 2015 and it was developed by rossi and donnini 2018 the model previously applied to estimate gr and the other water balance components in the european alps and in central apennines italy was modified for use for the entire italian territory we used different geo environmental data with higher resolutions and non averaged monthly historical climatic data the model was verified validated by comparing the gr values obtained by boni et al 1986 and mastrorillo et al 2009 using direct methods in central italy additionally we investigated and compared the estimated deep infiltration storages with the known anthropogenic water withdrawals thus providing insights that can help achieve the sustainable use of these aquifers the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we present a brief literature review of the studies performed at different scales to estimate gr and the grc in section 3 we describe the study area in section 4 we explain the hydro bm and the input data used in this study in section 5 we explain the model application and results in section 6 we discuss the results and their interpretations and finally in section 7 we present the major conclusions of our study 2 literature background in this section we present a critical review of the literature on gr estimations first we searched peer reviewed articles in the web of science www webofscience com online platform which was formerly a thomson reuters product reuters 2014 and currently a part of clarivate analytics using keywords with boolean search criteria applied to the title abstract and keywords of publications however conference proceedings grey literature e g government technical and project reports and dissertations were not considered in this study fig 1 explains the criteria considered in this study first we used the keyword groundwater recharge or the following synonyms ground water recharge ground water recharge water recharge net recharge recharge coefficient and effective infiltration which yielded 8618 results to understand the scale of application of the papers we introduced two main combinations 1 at a large scale using the or operator in the keywords basin catchment watershed river and aquifer 2 and at a small scale using the or operator in the keywords worldwide estimate worldwide estimation worldwide study global estimate global estimation global study regional estimate regional estimation regional study national estimate national estimation and national study the figure highlights the fact that most previous studies were performed at a large scale 5713 records with the predominance of the studies conducted at the basin or catchment or watershed scale 3693 records followed by studies at the aquifer 3223 records river 2053 records regional 1206 records and lake scales 472 records among the 5713 studies that were conducted at a large scale only 1202 21 contained the keyword water balance of which only 304 25 contained the keyword land use or the synonyms land cover land use and cover or land use cover regarding the studies performed at a small scale we had access to only 19 records nine of which contained water balance as a keyword we considered only six articles that contained the keywords land use land cover land use and cover and land use cover and using the or operator as shown in the figure most of the analysed studies which focused on water balance estimations and used land use and cover information were performed at different large scales ranging from the hillslope to basin scales see e g schilling et al 2008 nugroho et al 2013 deng et al 2015 kundu et al 2017 awotwi et al 2019 bao et al 2019 chemura et al 2020 on the contrary a few studies conducted at a small scale i e from national to global scale used of land use and cover data e g arnold et al 2000 who estimated the gr in the upper mississippi river basin usa batelaan and smedt 2007 who applied a spatially distributed water balance to estimate the dependence of gr on land cover soil texture topography and hydrometeorological parameters in three neighbouring catchments located in the ne of belgium total area of about 4300 km2 additionally riley et al 2019 studied the impact of land cover on gr in the high plains usa 3 study area the italian peninsula extends in the middle of the mediterranean along a nw se direction two large islands sicily and sardinia are located along the southwest and west coasts of the peninsula respectively italy is an active geodynamic state because it is located at the convergence of two tectonic mega plates namely the eurasian and african plates consequently volcanic and seismic activities are common in the region and pose a serious threat to the population notably the italian territory is also characterised by large hydrogeological variations as shown in fig 2 ispra 2007 which subdivides the emerged land masses into the following hydrogeological complexes i major streams fluvial deposits ii peri tyrrhenian basins ptb alluvial complexes iii padano venetian plan pvp multilayer complexes iv pvp undifferentiated complexes v volcanic complexes vi mixed sedimentary complexes vii sand complexes viii flysh complexes ix impermeable rock complexes x calcareous complexes xi calcareous dolomitic complexes xii evaporite complexes xiii crystalline complexes in the same map the hydrogeological complexes are overlapped to the seven geological sectors identified by bosellini 2005 2017 i alps ii po plain also called padano venetian plain or po valley iii apennines iv apulia foreland v calabrian peloritan arc vi sicily and vii sardinia bosellini 2005 2017 the alps are an arc shaped mountain chain and the italian part of the alps is predominantly composed of a mix of crystalline volcanic and flyshoid rock complexes which are characterised by low permeability with the exception of the highly tectonised areas subordinately the italian alps are composed of carbonates having high permeability these rocks are abundant in the southeastern sector of the mountain range where the more productive springs are located crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 donnini et al 2016 2020 bosellini 2017 rossi and donnini 2018 the po plain is a relatively flat region characterised by the presence of alluvial sediments that are mainly produced by the po river and its tributaries forming a single complex aquifer that is locally affected by the saltwater intrusion phenomena crampon et al 1996 bosellini 2017 rossi and donnini 2018 the apennines are a mountain chain that is commonly referred to as the backbone of italy crampon et al 1996 they are predominantly composed of a mix of flyshoids carbonates and volcanic rocks crampon et al 1996 bosellini 2017 the carbonate rocks host important aquifers which are largely fed by precipitations a series of volcanic aquifers is located on the western side of the apennines such aquifers feed on many large springs and have diverse permeability values which depend on the extent and intensity of weathering processes deep depressions located along the coastal margins and extending into the mountains are filled with highly permeable coarse grained deposits forming multi layered aquifers crampon et al 1996 de vita et al 2018 the apulia foreland composed of highly permeable carbonate aquifers that are affected by karst processes is located outside the apennine mountain chain region these aquifers are weakly deformed by recent tectonic activities and characterised by widespread groundwater loss of along the coastline civita 2008 bosellini 2017 de vita et al 2018 the calabrian peloritan arc can be considered as a portion of the alpine mountain range it is composed of metamorphic and granitic rocks that are characterised by low permeability consequently this area is poor in groundwater resources and consists of scattered springs having limited productivity civita 2008 bosellini 2017 de vita et al 2018 sicily with the exception of the southernmost portion of the calabrian peloritan arc belongs to the northern sector of the african plate bosellini 2017 the volcanic rocks of mount etna host the most important aquifers on this island the carbonate aquifers are located in the se and nw regions of the island the central part of the island is mainly composed of marly clayey and arenaceous matrix complexes which are impermeable and host poorly productive aquifers crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 from a geological perspective sardinia is a fragment of the european continent and is mainly composed of crystalline and volcanic rocks characterised by low permeability therefore important and productive aquifers are uncommon crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 4 materials and methods following rossi and donnini 2018 we used gratis libre open access data and open source software programs and tools to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses by following the concept of open science nüst and bartoschek 2018 grass 7 8 2 neteler and mitasova 2008 neteler et al 2012 qgis 2 14 quantum gis

geographical data ascii raster and shapefiles while r 3 6 2 r core team 2013 is the language used for coding the water balance model the method used in this study as described in rossi and donnini 2018 was based on a monthly water balance model for estimating gr and the other water balance components over large areas we performed a monthly analysis according to thornthwaite 1948 and mather 1978 1979 generally such model uses an accounting procedure to allocate water to different various components of the hydrologic system the main inputs were the monthly temperature and precipitation notably our model did not directly consider land use and cover in spite of this limitation the thornthwaite mather approach has been applied extensively in the scientific literature and proven to be effective for estimating water balance components at low temporal resolutions i e monthly or yearly in not just different environments but also complex geological frameworks see e g mammoliti et al 2021 and references therein in particular this approach can be applied to large areas and in case of large available datasets see e g donker 1987 sellinger 1996 armiraglio et al 2003 mccabe and markstrom 2007 the water balance model and its components and their possible transfers identified in the proposed methodology derived by the code used by mccabe and markstrom 2007 are schematised in fig 3 the main time variant components variables i e those that represent different physical processes were i precipitation p both in the form of rainfall prain and snow psnow ii snow storage snowstor iii evapotranspiration et which can be categorised as potential pet and actual evapotranspiration aet iv shallow infiltration st and deep infiltration storages deepstor and v runoff represented as the direct monthly runoff dro and runoff derived from the water balance in the previous month ro the model also considered additional time variant auxiliary variables a exceeded water that cannot infiltrate or evapotranspirate sur b water stored in the soil surface surface soil water storage in a month remain c precipitation available for evapotranspiration p aet and d snow melt sm the water transferred to the different balance components was generally modulated by the 1 fraction of water in the soil that infiltrates at different depths pmhfact 2 fraction of precipitation that contributes directly to the runoff in a month drofact and 3 fraction of water that becomes surface runoff within a month after infiltration and evapotranspiration withdrawal rfact most importantly we used the model to calculate the monthly water repartition among the different balance components conceptually the model considers different storage elements in which the input and output are modulated by different processes fig 4 illustrates a matrix like schema portraying i the processing and aggregation procedures applied to the input data to homogenize align the different formats resolutions and reference systems and ii the water balance computations their outputs and the relative aggregation procedures see rossi and donnini 2018 the main inputs of the model were i soil elevation data from

2003 daroussin et al 1994 released in raster format with the grid resolution of the etrs89 extended laea europe epsg 3035 reference system set at 10 km coherent with the resolution and reference system of the inspire vector grid the cumulative daily precipitation and minimum and maximum daily temperature raster data were processed in r r core team 2013 to obtain the monthly precipitation and temperature series for 1981 2010 as shown in fig 4 the monthly raster data were transformed in the etrs89 extended laea europe epsg 3035 reference system and their values corresponding to the 10 km inspire vector grid resolution of 10 km were used as inputs for water balance computations the awc sub and awc top were derived from the textural class and from the soil packing density for the subsoil and for the topsoil the values come from categorical values refer to column description in table 1 associated to the minimum and maximum values refer to columns range values in table 1 expressed in mm m 1 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the values for the analysis refer to column calibr in table 1 were derived from rossi and donnini 2018 by comparing of the gr and grc model outputs with the values estimated by the studies on the central apennines boni et al 1986 according to van liedekerke and panagos 2003 and daroussin et al 1994 the dr may correspond either to i the depth to the top of the r layer soil layer few affected by paedogenic processes ditzler et al 2017 or ii the top of the c layer soil layer constituted by from strongly cemented to indurated bedrock ditzler et al 2017 similarly to the awc sub and awc top the values of dr column calibr in table 2 were derived from the categorical refer to column description in table 2 and range values refer to columns range values in table 2 thus characterising the dr in the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 in this study awc sub awc top and dr were used to estimate the water holding capacity whc of the soil which can be considered as a measure of the maximum amount of water that can be stored and withdrawn from the soil water storage fig 4 the text srf dom parameter expresses the main surface textural class van liedekerke and panagos 2003 and was used to characterize the direct and monthly runoff responses for a given

following month see fig 3 and rossi and donnini 2018 the minimum and a maximum values range associated to drofact and rfact and the final calibrated values are listed in table 3 the last input parameter was the pmh which represents the storage capacity and permeability of the region van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the categorical values characterising pmh van liedekerke

infiltrated the subsurface up to a particular depth on a monthly base for the other model inputs the minimum maximum and calibrated values are also presented in table 4 fig 3 portrays also the influence of elevation in meltmax and tsnow determination as discussed by rossi and donnini 2018 meltmax is a parameter that controls the calculation of sm snow melt fraction that is the fraction of snow storage snowstor that melts in a month and tsnow is a temperature threshold above which the precipitation is in the form of snow fig 5 a portrays the elevation map derived from the digital

resolution data available in the scia database managed by the ispra desiato et al 2006 2007 http www scia isprambiente it these three maps were aggregated to the inspire vector grid having a

corresponding to the inspire vector grid resolution of 10 km fig 6f portrays the whc of the soil which was computed from the awc sub awc top and dr values see fig 4 by applying eq 2 as explained by rossi and donnini 2018 2 whc awc sub dr 2 awc top dr 2 the water balance model was essentially the same as the one used by rossi and donnini 2018 and considered different time variant components variables that represented different physical processes related to the water cycle balance these variables are i p rain and p snow ii snowstor iii pet and aet iv st and deepstor and v dro and ro additionally the model considers the following auxiliary time variant variables i remain ii st iii p aet and iv snowmelt the water transferred to the different balance components was modulated by a few controlling factors which were i pmhfact ii drofact and iii rfact generally over time temperature influences different balance components in time and the elevation soil and lithological data being time invariant can spatially modulate the different balance components as well the proposed model was able to calculate the water repartition among different balance components on a monthly basis conceptually it considered different storage elements whose input and output were modulated by different processes deepstor was a key variable considered in this study corresponding to the deep water storage that was accumulated on a monthly basis i e each month this value changed in relation to the amount of infiltration from the surface this variable was used to estimate gr commonly expressed as an average annual value in mm corresponding to year deepstor in fig 3 the grc value corresponding to the variable coef inf in fig 3 was estimated by including eq 3 or excluding eq 4 from the soil moisture storage withdrawal stw 3 grc coef inf total deepstor stw σ p 4 grc coef inf total deepstor σ p year deepstor stw year prec in these equations stw and total deepstor correspond to their final values for the simulated period 30 years 1981 2010 and σ p is the total precipitation during the same period alternative but equivalent formulations may consider year deepstor that represents the deepstor simulated considering a specific year instead of total deepstor and year prec that represents the precipitation during the same specific year instead of σ p the gr and grc results were obtained as the aggregated statistics of the monthly water balance variables over the inspire reference grid results 5 results we applied the water balance model for the entire italian territory using the monthly precipitation and temperature raster data series for 1981 2010 the model results mainly consisted of values in shapefile and textual format and plots in pdf format of the hydrological balance components estimated for each inspire grid cell at the monthly scale in the resulting maps the water balance components were calculated as the average values derived for the period 1981 2010 we considered the averages of only gr mm year 1 and grc dimensionless from 0 to 1 expresses as gr avg and grc avg respectively estimated for the period of 1981 2010 fig 7a portrays the map developed using the gr avg values ranging from 0 to 1130 mm year 1 with mean median first and third quartiles of 357 327 269 and 421 mm year 1 respectively notably gr avg spatial distribution is similar to the mean annual precipitation distribution fig 5b which is in turn influenced by altitude fig 5a such a similar pattern is mainly conditioned by the distribution of the mountainous areas of the territory which receive a greater amount of precipitation than the plains and coasts particularly when they are exposed to the humid air masses circulations from the sea fratianni and acquaotta 2017 in the grc avg map in fig 7b this general pattern is not evident with the maximum grc avg values observed predominantly along the tyrrhenian coast west coast in correspondence with the eastern part of the ligurian sea and with the southernmost sector of the peninsula calabria region the gr and grc representation is detailed in fig 8 wherein we estimated the minimum the mean and the maximum gr and grc values for the different italian hydrogeological complexes identified by ispra 2007 as shown in fig 2 the minimum and maximum values were estimated using the 5th and the 95th percentile respectively fig 8a b and c confirm the gr values distribution shown in fig 7a the minimum and mean gr maps as shown in fig 8a and b highlight the dependence of gr on lithology rather than precipitation indeed within the alpine mountain range which is generally characterised by high precipitation rates see fig 5b the highest gr values were observed along the south eastern region where the more permeable carbonate lithologies were abundant see fig 2 a further inspection of fig 8d e and f confirmed a less evident grc pattern as shown in fig 7b with the lowest grc values observed in the portions of the alps and apennines characterised by the presence of crystalline mainly metamorphic rocks and volcanic mainly intrusive rocks complexes in line with the analysis of celico 1988 fig 9 to compare the modelled gr values with water withdrawals we performed a literature analysis to gather the reference withdrawals data the most recent withdrawals data considered in this study were acquired from i bono and boni 1996 for the mineral waters industry and ii istat 2019 for civil use including springs and wells we used hydro bm to estimate the gr for 1992 and 2015 referred to as gr 1992 fig 10 b and gr 2015 fig 10 c respectively these values were aggregated at the regional level considering the average value for the entire period i e gr avg fig 10 a as shown in the fig 10 gr is classified as vl very low 0 2 5 109 m3 year 1 l low 2 5 5 109 m3 year 1 m medium 5 7 5 109 m3 year 1 h high 7 5 10 109 m3 year 1 vh very high 10 12 5 109 m3 year 1 and vvh extremely high 12 5 15 109 m3 year 1 the analysis revealed that the regions with the highest gr values are located in the north western portion of italy piemonte toscana and lombardia and in sicily conversely the regions with the lowest gr values were valle d aosta and liguria in northern italy umbria in central italy and molise in southern italy fig 10a indicates that in the 1981 2010 period i none of the regions could be categorised as vvh and vh ii four regions piemonte toscana lombardia and sicily portrayed h values iii five regions emilia romagna calabria veneto lazio and sardinia portrayed m values iv nine regions trentino alto adige puglia campania friuli venezia giulia abruzzo basilicata marche umbria and liguria had l values and v two regions molise and valle d aosta had vl values as shown in fig 10b in 1992 i no

sardinia puglia and lazio had m values v five regions campania friuli venezia giulia marche abruzzo and basilicata had l values and vi four regions had vl values umbria liguria molise and valle d

regions lazio sardinia trentino alto adige campania puglia and friuli venezia giulia had m values v five regions marche abruzzo basilicata umbria and liguria had l values and vi two regions molise and valle d aosta had vl values the variations in the gr 1992 and gr 2015 values with respect to gr avg values are shown in fig 10d and e the generic pv gr year is the percentage variation in a specific year with respect to the gr avg calculated as using the following equation 5 pv gr year gr year gr avg 100 100 as shown in fig 10d for campania in 1992 the gr values were quite similar to those estimated for 1981 2010 period while the regions with the highest positive gr percentage variation were nine and predominantly located in the northern sector of the italian peninsula valle d aosta trentino alto adige and piemonte with pv gr 1992 ranging from 15 to 35 followed by lombardia emilia romagna veneto puglia sicily and marche with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 2 to 15 conversely 10 regions portrayed the highest negative gr percentage variations and were predominantly located in the central and tyrrhenian regions of the peninsula umbria and liguria with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 15 to 35 followed by lazio sardinia abruzzo molise calabria friuli venezia giulia basilicata and toscana with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 2 to 15 fig 10e portrays that during 2015 the gr in umbria was similar to the gr avg whereas in the other regions the gr was significantly higher in particular emilia romagna piemonte calabria lombardia sicily and valle d aosta portrayed the highest pv gr 2015 values ranging from 35 to 55 followed by marche veneto basilicata campania trentino alto adige puglia and abruzzo with the pv gr 2015 ranging from 15 to 35 and finally by friuli venezia giulia lazio liguria toscana sardinia molise and umbria with the pv gr 2015 values ranging from 2 to 15 6 discussions groundwater recharge estimation is a complex task as it requires information regarding lithology morphology and climate to address this issue we customised the water balance model proposed by rossi and donnini 2018 for the european alps and the central apennines and refined the model to make it applicable for italy using a grid resolution of 10 km in the refined approach we used more detailed elevation and climatic data that is i the elevation at 10 m grid resolution from tinitaly 01 tarquini et al 2007 and ii the cumulative monthly precipitation and the minimum and maximum temperature data acquired from the scia database desiato et al 2006 2007 of the ispra for the period 1981 2010 at a daily scale and with a 10 km grid resolution the soil and lithology data for this resolution were derived from different layers of the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 and were the same as those used by rossi and donnini 2018 1 awc top 2 awc sub 3 dr 4 text srf dom and 5 pmh see section 4 we decided to use the data from the european soil database version 2 0 because they represent quantitative attributes of the diversity and spatial variability of the soil daroussin et al 1994 in contrast to for example the corine land cover data büttner et al 2004 which only provides qualitative information the calibrated values of awc sub awc top dr drofact rfact and pmhfact reported in tables 2 3 and 4 used for modelling in this study were observed at the boundaries of the original ranges indicated by the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 all these values jointly contribute to the increase in the amount of water that may infiltrate into the soil and accumulate as deep water storages with the effect of increasing the final modelled gr estimations this indicates a need to push the model towards its maximum capacity to reproduce the gr reference values accurately which can potentially result in the underestimation of gr in contrast to rossi and donnini 2018 in our analysis no aggregations were performed and for this reason the estimation of the minimum maximum and average values of the water balance components the three modelling scenarios namely s1 minimum s2 average and s3 maximum were not quantified the proposed model did not directly consider land use and cover however even over small study areas such information was effective in modelling gr we acknowledge that this may potentially lead to spatio temporal biases when estimating the water balance components however as shown in section 2 at a small scale specifically at the national scale land use and cover was not commonly used as an input variable furthermore none of the studies in the literature have been performed in italy which limit the potential advantages and limitations of this model to analyse regions similar to italy the grid cell resolution of 10 km allows for the analysis of gr and its sustainability at the regional and hydrogeological complex scales but not at the small aquifer scale hence gr estimates can be compared with anthropogenic withdrawals at the regional level but not for the analysis of small aquifers and their overexploitation however possible applications at regional and hydrogeological complex scales may focus on the estimation of heat and co2 fluxes in groundwaters over wide areas see e g kessler and harvey 2001 frondini et al 2019 6 1 comparison with literature data we performed a robust comparison of the modelled gr and grc values with all possible reference data available in the literature boni et al 1986 mastrorillo et al 2009 we maintain that an analysis of the uncertainty variation in the modelled data is important to validate and calibrate the models at the same time we are aware that a correct analysis of the uncertainty of and variations in the results is fundamental to obtaining a reliable dataset of infiltrating rates that can portray the variations in the spatiotemporal data we performed uncertainty variation analyses of the results using i the gr and grc in the main aquifers of central italy mainly composed of carbonate flyshoid and volcanic rocks as estimated by boni et al 1986 and ii the gr in the hydrogeological units of the umbria region central italy consisting of carbonates as explained by mastrorillo et al 2009 notably both these studies used direct methods we are aware that the gr and grc values of apennines could be different from those of the rest of italy as the country features diverse geological and climatological contexts however we maintain that the studies of boni et al 1986 and of mastrorillo et al 2009 are the most accurate ones performed at the regional scale in italy with the most accurate and reliable gr grc reference to the best of our knowledge the first qualitative evaluation of the gr in italy was performed by boni and bono 1982 while focusing mainly on the carbonate complexes in the central apennines in that area the authors recognized 12 domains in the region and estimated the average discharge of the main springs for each complex boni et al 1986 refined this analysis for central italy identifying 22 main hydrogeological complexes and estimating the corresponding gr as shown in fig 11 a the authors grouped the aquifers into five domains with the gr values displayed in fig 11 b i the shelf domain ii the pelagic domain iii the marly calcarenitic complex iv the volcanic domain and v the structures made by rocks belonging to more than one domain which in this study are referred to as heterogeneous complexes a synoptic view of the gr values within the 22 hydrogeological complexes is illustrated in fig 11 c highlighting the following i the highest gr values were observed in the shelf domain minimum 706 mm year 1 maximum 983 mm year 1 and average 847 75 mm year 1 ii the lowest gr values were observed in the marly calcarenitic aquifers minimum 183 mm year 1 maximum 281 mm year 1 and average 235 mm year 1 and iii the intermediate gr values were observed in the pelagic and volcanic aquifers the figure illustrates that the pelagic domain was composed of two aquifers with the gr values of 533 and 637 mm year 1 whereas the volcanic domain was composed of four aquifers with the gr values ranging between 280 and 778 mm year 1 with an average value of 428 mm year 1 medium to high values were recorded in the aquifers of the heterogeneous complexes with the gr values ranging from 568 to 888 mm year 1 average value of 743 25 mm year 1 as sown in fig 11 c the grc values estimated for the shelf domain minimum 0 88 maximum 0 57 average 0 70 were the highest among the five domains the lowest grc values were observed for the marly calcarenitic complex minimum 0 19 maximum 0 25 average 0 22 the intermediate grc values were estimated for the pelagic composed of two aquifers with grc of 0 48 0 60 and the volcanic domains composed of four aquifers with grc values of 0 28 0 60 and an average of 0 36 the medium to high grc values were observed for the heterogeneous complexes minimum 0 44 maximum 0 75 average 0 62 notably all the estimated grc values agreed with those indicated by celico 1988 as shown in fig 9 the carbonate rocks limestone dolomitic limestone and dolostone portrayed quite high grc values ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 the marly limestone portrayed medium low grc values 0 3 0 5 and the volcanic rocks pyroclastic deposits pyroclastics and lavas and intrusive rocks portrayed a wide spectrum of grc values 0 15 0 9 such values particularly those indicated for carbonate rocks were in line with the studies conducted by other authors burdon 1965 kessler 1965 vilimonovic 1965 drogue 1971 soulios 1984 bonacci 2001 jukić and denić jukić 2004 jukić denić jukić 2008 who estimated quite high grc values for the european calcareous karst aquifers ranging from 0 5 to 0 76 the aquifers in the pelagic domains were analysed in detail by mastrorillo et al 2009 and mastrorillo and petitta 2010 the two hydrological complexes recognised by boni et al 1986 g5 and s9 in fig 11a were discretised by mastrorillo et al 2009 into 21 complexes see fig 11d the values of which are shown in figs 11d and 11e a comparison of the values displayed in fig 11c and f highlight that the gr values estimated by boni et al 1986 and by mastrorillo et al 2009 are quite similar but some local differences exist within the pelagic complexes furthermore boni et al 1986 analysed the pelagic complexes and estimated their gr values as 533 mm year 1 g5 and 637 mm year 1 s9 while mastrorillo et al 2009 stated that the estimated values of the 21 complexes ranged from 250 mm year 1 to 880 mm year 1 with an average value of 487 mm year 1 standard deviation of 118 mm year 1 the values decreased with increasing marly content the gr and grc values modelled in this study were compared with those shown in fig 11 estimated by boni at al 1986 and by mastrorillo et al 2009 the different hydrological domains where the gr and grc were derived by boni et al 1986 and mastrorillo et al 2009 overlapped with multiple grid cells of the inspire reference grid used in our analyses this allowed us to estimate the minimum mean and maximum gr and grc values within the different hydrological domains to account for possible unreliable modelling outliers in the analyses the minimum and maximum values were estimated respectively as the 5th and 95th percentile values respectively a comparison of the minimum mean and maximum modelled values and their corresponding references is shown in fig 12 while for mastrorillo et al 2009 it was possible to compare only gr values when considering boni at al 1986 both the gr and grc comparisons were possible for each comparison a linear correlation equation assuming an intercept of 0 was estimated and the corresponding determination coefficients r2 were calculated indeed by definition the modelled values should be 0 when the reference values are 0 implying the use of a regression model without an intercept in such a case the angular coefficient allows for the direct verification of the model for possible under or over estimations the prediction intervals are shown in the plots of grey shades the r2 value was high 0 84 for all the gr comparisons with the highest values obtained when considering mastrorillo et al s 2009 data as a reference 0 93 moreover the results highlight that the larger gr differences could be obtained for the marly calcarenitic complexes brown circles in fig 12a b and c while minor differences could be observed for the shelf and pelagic domains light green and dark green circles in fig 12a b and c such a good correspondence for the pelagic domains was confirmed as shown in fig 12g h and i conversely low r2 values 0 50 0 58 were obtained when comparing the modelled and the reference grc values boni et al 1986 with the largest difference observed in the marly calcarenitic complex and in the volcanic domain brown and red circles in fig 12d e and f overall the comparison shown in fig 12 highlights that a good correlation exists between the modelled and reference gr data while confirming the wide grc variability estimated by others celico 1988 6 2 groundwater recharge gr and groundwater recharge coefficient grc values within the different hydrogeological complexes the variability of the modelled gr and grc values within the hydrogeological complexes identified by ispra 2007 fig 8 is portrayed in fig 13 while portraying the 1st 25th 50th median 75th and 99th percentiles a visual inspection of fig 13 a highlights the large variations in the median gr values and their interquartile range iqr indicated by the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the different hydrogeological complexes such large variations and their overlap suggest that a direct correlation between gr and lithology may not exists possibly because of the dependence of gr on precipitation it is important to emphasise that with the exception of major stream fluvial deposits pvp multilayer complex and pvp undifferentiated complex located in the po plain and of the evaporite complex located in sicily and the calabrian peloritan arc almost all the lithologies were present in areas characterized by different precipitation values see figs 2 and 5b smaller variability characterises grc iqr values as shown in fig 13b the comparison of the modelled grc values shown in the figure with the reference values observed by celico 1988 reported in fig 9 highlights a possible model underestimation however celico 1988 already acknowledged that the grc values in nature could differ from estimations fig 9 due to possible relations with the slope vegetation cover porosity and or fracturing notably the comparison of figs 9 and 13 is not straightforward given the possible lithological classification discrepancies the large variability in the range between the 1st and 99th percentiles can be attributed to the significant differences among the precipitation values within the different lithologies furthermore in the alluvial deposits i e major stream fluvial deposits pvp multilayer complexes pvp undifferentiated complexes and ptb alluvial complexes the analysis of fig 13a revealed a large variability among the gr values the first two domains major stream fluvial deposits and pvp multilayer complexes and the last one ptb alluvial complexes portrayed low median gr values as well as low iqr while the pvp undifferentiated complexes portrayed the highest median gr and iqr values this difference can be attributed to the precipitation variability shown in fig 5b quite low precipitation values were observed in the major stream fluvial deposits in pvp multilayer complexes and in ptb alluvial complexes and conversely quite high precipitation values were observed in the pvp undifferentiated complexes this difference was less evident in the grc values fig 13b with all the four hydrogeological complexes portraying quite high median and relatively small iqr values even if the grc values observed by celico 1988 for alluvial deposits see fig 9 were considerably higher than the modelled values they are among the highest when considering all the modelled values obtained for the different hydrological domains low median gr and iqr values as well as low grc values were observed for the volcanic complex fig 13a and b which was in agreement with the values reported for these lithologies both by boni et al 1986 and by celico 1988 medium low median gr and small iqr values were observed for the impermeable rock flysh and for sand complexes fig 13a conversely quite high median gr and iqr values were observed for the mixed sedimentary rocks and medium high gr values were observed for the calcareous and calcareous dolomitic complexes the higher gr values for carbonate aquifers i e calcareous complexes and calcareous dolomitic complexes and lower grc values for marly sandstone aquifers impermeable rock flysh and sand complexes were confirmed by boni et al 1986 as shown in fig 11 the high median gr value associated with very high iqr values for the mixed sedimentary complexes can be attributed to the small extension of these complexes across the italian territory see fig 2 medium low gr grc and low iqr values were observed in the crystalline complexes fig 13 consistent with the findings of celico 1988 the large variability in the range between the 1st and 99th percentiles may be due to the large precipitation differences fig 5b within the lithology fig 2 varying from high values in the alps to low values in sardinia and the calabrian peloritan arc medium low gr values for the evaporite complex fig 13a may be due to the low precipitation values fig 5b associated with this lithology in italy sardinia and calabrian peloritan arc fig 2 while its high grc values may be due to the highly fractured nature of the lithology overall the large variability of the gr values for the different hydrogeological complexes shown in fig 13a suggests that gr strongly depends on precipitation rather than lithology regarding grc the smallest variability was shown in the median and in the iqr values while quite high variability was observed in the outliers see fig 13b which may be due to the large difference in precipitation within the different lithologies the grc values estimated in this study were always lower than those observed by celico 1988 ones but the lithological classification of this study was quite different from the classification adopted by celico 1988 in conclusion fig 13 highlights that reasonable gr and grc estimates could be defined only at the hydrogeological complex scale and that the general correlation between the gr and grc cannot be defined 6 3 deep infiltration storages and sustainability of water withdrawals in the natural water cycle as well as in the water balance model illustrated in this study the withdrawals w were not considered even if as stated in section 1 they could have a non negligible impact on many components of the water cycle a systematic and long term monitoring of water withdrawals in italy has not been conducted the most recent and complete studies on water withdrawals were conducted by chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 which quantified the use of water resources in italy while highlighting its main repartition among the agricultural 50 civil 27 and industrial 23 uses istat 2019 highlighted that the estimates of withdrawal for civil use were quite reliable in contrast to the estimates for agricultural and industrial use because for the latter two uses a widespread and systematic monitoring system does not exist in the following considerations we assumed that the water of springs and wells is derived predominantly from the deep infiltration storages gr or alternatively referred to year deepstor in the hydro bm water balance model code and that the water of the river systems as well as of the natural and artificial lakes is derived from runoff ro and shallow soil moisture storage st water withdrawals for agricultural use istat 2019 can be subdivided into irrigation and zootechnical uses according to the same source the withdrawals for irrigation use during the 2009 2010 agricultural year were 11 6 109 m3 and those for zootechnical use during the 2016 agricultural year were 0 32 109 m3 for a total of 11 9 109 m3 30 less than the values of 17 0 109 m3 reported by chiaroni et al 2018 for 2015 according to istat 2019 within agricultural use the major withdrawals are for irrigation 97 3 and only a marginal portion is used for zootechnical use 2 7 furthermore chiaroni et al 2018 reported that among the withdrawals for irrigation use 65 is for irrigation and remediation consortia consorzi di irrigazione e bonifica with 18 5 withdrawn from groundwater and 16 5 from surficial waters ciafani et al 2008 reported the anbi an acronym for the italian national association of consortia for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation water associazione nazionale consorzi di gestione e tutela del territorio e acque irrigue www anbi it data and stated that more than 90 of withdrawals of irrigation and remediation consortia was derived from watercourses and from artificial lakes fig 14 reports the percentage of water withdrawn for agricultural use with particular reference to the contributions from groundwater and surface water bodies approximately 25 of withdrawals for agricultural use was from groundwater bodies ranging from 2 98 109 m3 year 1 and 4 25 109 m3 year 1 estimated respectively as stated by istat 2019 and chiaroni et al 2018 according to istat 2019 during 2015 the amount of water withdrawn for civil use was 9 49 109 m3 similar values were reported by chiaroni et al 2018 who estimated values of 9 00 109 m3 for 2015 and 9 5 109 m3 for 2012 differences exist between the two data sources in terms of the provenance of these volumes istat 2019 estimated that 84 3 of the withdrawals were from springs and wells i e from the deep infiltration storages and the remaining 15 7 were from watercourses river streams etc natural and artificial lakes i e from runoff and shallow soil moisture storage and seawater alternatively chiaroni et al 2018 estimated that 53 of the withdrawals were from surficial waters and 48 were from groundwater consequently the amount of withdrawals for civil use from gr were estimated ranging from 8 00 109 m3 istat 2019 to 4 28 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 similar to agriculture the estimated withdrawals for industrial use from istat 2019 have a significant degree of uncertainty to overcome this information gap istat 2019 reported the estimates of the withdrawals for the manufacturing activity during 2015 as 3 79 109 m3 regarding the provenance of water for industrial use the authors specify that small companies with less than five employees often use water from the public network for civil use with an estimated volume of water of 195 103 m3 0 01 whereas medium and large companies use specific self supply systems or water from infrastructures for industrial areas different values were reported by chiaroni et al 2018 who estimated that 6 1 109 m3 of withdrawals were for manufacturing activity confirming the withdrawals of 195 103 m3 for small companies with less than five employees the authors reported that the majority of withdrawals for the manufacturing activity was from groundwater 96 ranging from 3 62 109 m3 istat 2019 to 5 83 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 chiaroni et al 2018 also estimated 1 6 109 m3 of withdrawals for energy production fig 15 portrays a comparison of the withdrawals considering the chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 estimates as well as the amount of withdrawals coming from deep infiltration storage hence coming from gr overall the total amount of withdrawals ranges from 32 10 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 to 25 18 109 m3 istat 2019 and the amount of withdrawals from gr ranges from 13 50 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 to 14 00 109 m3 istat 2019 another important withdrawal was by the mineral water industry an exhaustive even if old dated estimate of the amount of water bottled in italy was reported by bono and boni 1996 indicating that in 1992 233 mineral water brands and 181 spa units operates in the italian territory resulting in a production of 6 2 106 m3 of mineral water approximately three order of magnitude lower than the values shown in fig 15 in this study the average gr estimates came from a climatic dataset of 30 years 1981 2010 which can be considered robust accordingly to wmo 2017 which states that a 30 year period is long enough to filter out any inter annual variation or anomalies but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends the water withdrawals data was acquired from a less robust dataset that considered i one year i e 2015 for civil and industrial use chiaroni and istat et al 2018 2019 and ii one year i e 1992 for the mineral water industry bono and boni 1996 for relative comparison both datasets should consider the same period of time with hopefully a longer period unfortunately in italy there is no specific system to enable the systematic and long term monitoring of water withdrawal the works of chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 for civil and industrial use withdrawals and the work of bono and boni 1996 represent the most recent and complete studies in this respect at the national level the gr avg values allow for the quantification of 109 58 109 m3 of the total amount of water deeply stored on average in a year in the italian territory in 1992 and 2015 these amounts gr 1992 and gr 2015 respectively were comparable and corresponded to 113 13 109 m3 in 1992 and 139 04 109 m3 in 2015 about 3 and 27 more than the average long period estimates respectively according to these estimations the amount of water withdrawn from groundwater for civil industrial and agricultural use chiaroni et al 2018 istat 2019 fig 15 was 14 of the gr avg more specifically the amount of water withdrawn for the mineral water industry w bottled according to bono and boni 1996 was 0 01 of the gr 1992 value whereas that withdrawn for civil use w civil according to istat 2019 was 10 of the gr 2015 value fig 16 portrays a comparison between gr 1992 and w bottled and between gr 2015 and w civil figure 16a shows that the region with highest w bottled values was lombardia 3 01 106 m3 year 1 followed by veneto 1 44 106 m3 year 1 piemonte 1 27 106 m3 year 1 emilia romagna 1 9 106 m3 year 1 and tuscany 1 1 106 m3 year 1 w bottled in the other regions were lower than 1 0 106 m3 year 1 with the exception of valle d aosta and molise which had no data fig 16b shows the regions grouped into four classes of w civil the regions with highest w civil values were lombardia 1 44 109 m3 year 1 and lazio 1 13 109 m3 year 1 followed by campania 0 98 109 m3 year 1 veneto 0 65 109 m3 year 1 sicily 0 62 109 m3 year 1 and piemonte 0 58 109 m3 year 1 ten regions have values of 0 1 0 5 109 m3 year 1 calabria toscana emilia romagna abruzzo trentino alto adige friuli venezia giulia molise liguria marche and umbria and four regions puglia sardinia basilicata and valle d aosta portrayed values of 0 0 1 109 m3 year 1 fig 16 c and d also portray the percentage of w bottled with respect to gr 1992 and that of w civil with respect to gr 2015 the two percentages are denoted as p w bottled and p w civil respectively and were

sardinia the values were 0 01 0 02 and in lombardia and umbria the values were higher than 0 02 fig 16d portrays that the p w civil values were the highest in lazio 16 2 and campania 16 1 followed by lombardia 11 7 and molise 10 7 while veneto abruzzo sicily and liguria have values of 5 10 the remaining twelve regions friuli venezia giulia piemonte valle d aosta calabria trentino alto adige umbria

libre open access data and open source software programs and tools in line with the concept of open science nüst and bartoschek 2018 we conducted a groundwater recharge study at the national level for italy and considered important variables that may affect subsurface infiltration and gr notably our model can be applied to most parts of the eurasian continent using the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the model provided groundwater recharge estimates for the italian territory within a 10 km grid cell resolution mesh using monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1981 to 2010 from the ispra scia database desiato et al 2006 2007 the model was calibrated and validated with reference to literature data available for the area of apennines central italy the comparison of gr values estimated for specific years i e 1992 and 2015 along with the data of water withdrawals highlighted the following i the mineral water industry consumption was close to 0 01 of the total gr in 1992 ii the civil use was not negligible being 10 of the total gr in 2015 and correlated with the number of inhabitants iii a correlation between the number of inhabitants per region and the percentage of water withdrawn for civil use with respect to total gr was not evident suggesting that the sustainability of water withdrawals varied regionally we maintain that the proposed approach may have strategic importance for developing countries which are affected by water availability and have sustainability issues especially in the context of climate change such applications would largely benefit from the findability accessibility interoperability and reusability fair data our methodology allows for the evaluation of the

along with other balance components using gratis libre open access data and open source software the results were compared with the data available from the literature on central italy to validate the model and to investigate the variation in the gr while considering different lithologies the comparison of the gr results with anthropogenic water withdrawals enabled the evaluation of sustainable

new hydrological insights for the region in italy the annual averaged gr is 110 109 m3 this estimate may vary for specific years in 1992 and 2015 the gr exceeded the value by 3 and 27 respectively according to these and related estimations the 1981 2010 average groundwater withdrawals for civil industrial and agricultural use were estimated to be 14 of the averaged gr for the same period in 1992 the withdrawals for the mineral water industry was about 0 01 of the gr and that for civil use was 10 in 2015 in this study we observed significant differences in the gr at the regional level

between the different system of earth circulating between the atmosphere hydrosphere and geosphere this continuous movement which is essentially fed by solar energy and gravity is called the natural water cycle which can be schematised using a water balance equation as expressed below 1 p gr et ro where p is the precipitation in the form of rain and snow gr is the groundwater recharge et is evapotranspiration and ro is surface runoff these three terms represent the portion of precipitation p that infiltrates into the soil gr which then transfers into the atmosphere et and flows over the surface ro these terms are commonly expressed in millimetres per unit of surface and can be estimated over different spatio temporal scales generally the estimations of et are carried out by considering p and temperature t as the main input variables here we focused on gr which can be defined as the amount of meteoric water per unit surface that infiltrates into the soil recharging aquifers consequently this is a measure of the capability of a hydrogeological complex to absorb meteoric water in the european literature gr is also known as effective infiltration see e g boni and bono 1982 boni et al 1982 soulios 1984 boni et al 1986 destouni 1991 boni and petitta 1994 bonacci 2001 jukić and denić jukić 2004 jukić denić jukić 2008 nützmann and mey 2004 bonacci et al 2006

et al 2018 graf and jawgiel 2018 rossi and donnini 2018 in this study we used the term groundwater recharge which is most commonly used one in the international literature generally gr is expressed in mm year 1 and the existing studies purpose different methods for its estimation field direct indirect and water balance methods see e g rossi and donnini 2018 in field methods in situ investigations are performed to measure water fluxes and the groundwater levels directly or through geophysical surveys in direct methods the amount of water that flows from the ground is assumed to be equivalent to the amount of water that previously infiltrates the ground e g boni and petitta 1994 boni et al 1986 consequently in these studies gr was estimated by dividing the average volume of water discharged by the springs in one year by their recharge area in indirect methods gr was estimated as a percentage of precipitation by applying an empirical coefficient grc called the groundwater recharge coefficient this coefficient is dimensionless and ranges from 0 to 1 for different lithologies the water balance method estimates the terms of the natural water cycle expressed as the basic formulation of eq 1 the balance equation is resolved annually mm year 1 monthly mm month 1 or daily mm day 1 with a few exceptions at the sub daily scale the shorter the scale the more complex the abstraction and representation of water related processes and the more accurate the balance estimation however this process may have higher input data demands and result in larger uncertainties hence determining the scale for resolving the balance is not always straightforward the choice should depend on the final purpose of the analysis along with the final water balance components that need to be investigated and the ability to model them in space and time opting for the maximum temporal resolution e g day does not always lead to more accurate and reliable estimations and in some cases there is the possibility of high costs and extensive time requirement without obtaining any significant results in the case of gr analyses over large areas the water balance is generally applied at yearly or monthly scales mainly because it is difficult to calculate the subsurface water component estimations due to the requirement of unknown soil and rock related variables notably the basic water balance concept is widely and flexibly applied for different scientific and technical purposes many dynamic environmental processes such as the movement of nutrients contamination solute balance and sediment transport are led by the natural water cycle abdollahi et al 2018 water balance models can be used to study anthropogenic perturbations in the natural water cycle the human withdrawals w component can be added to the balance since it may have a possible non negligible effect on the final water budget estimation water balance models can be a useful tool for making strategic decisions to assess the environmental impacts of anthropogenic perturbations e g irrigation water supply and wastewater systems abdollahi et al 2018 estimating the amount of water stored in the aquifers and the variation caused by human withdrawals is in line with the goal 6 of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development https sdgs un org which aims to ensure access to water and sanitation for all and is one

estimating gr over italy we used the water balance model named hydro bm for this purpose the model is open source and coded in r r core team 2015 and it was developed by rossi and donnini 2018 the model previously applied to estimate gr and the other water balance components in the european alps and in central apennines italy was modified for use for the entire italian territory we used different geo environmental data with higher resolutions and non averaged monthly historical climatic data the model was verified validated by comparing the gr values obtained by boni et al 1986 and mastrorillo et al 2009 using direct methods in central italy additionally we investigated and compared the estimated deep infiltration storages with the known anthropogenic water withdrawals thus providing insights that can help achieve the sustainable use of these aquifers the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we present a brief literature review of the studies performed at different scales to estimate gr and the grc in section 3 we describe the study area in section 4 we explain the hydro bm and the input data used in this study in section 5 we explain the model application and results in section 6 we discuss the results and their interpretations and finally in section 7 we present the major conclusions of our study 2 literature background in this section we present a critical review of the literature on gr estimations first we searched peer reviewed articles in the web of science www webofscience com online platform which was formerly a thomson reuters product reuters 2014 and currently a part of clarivate analytics using keywords with boolean search criteria applied to the title abstract and keywords of publications however conference proceedings grey literature e g government technical and project reports and dissertations were not considered in this study fig 1 explains the criteria considered in this study first we used the keyword groundwater recharge or the following synonyms ground water recharge ground water recharge water recharge net recharge recharge coefficient and effective infiltration which yielded 8618 results to understand the scale of application of the papers we introduced two main combinations 1 at a large scale using the or operator in the keywords basin catchment watershed river and aquifer 2 and at a small scale using the or operator in the keywords worldwide estimate worldwide estimation worldwide study global estimate global estimation global study regional estimate regional estimation regional study national estimate national estimation and national study the figure highlights the fact that most previous studies were performed at a large scale 5713 records with the predominance of the studies conducted at the basin or catchment or watershed scale 3693 records followed by studies at the aquifer 3223 records river 2053 records regional 1206 records and lake scales 472 records among the 5713 studies that were conducted at a large scale only 1202 21 contained the keyword water balance of which only 304 25 contained the keyword land use or the synonyms land cover land use and cover or land use cover regarding the studies performed at a small scale we had access to only 19 records nine of which contained water balance as a keyword we considered only six articles that contained the keywords land use land cover land use and cover and land use cover and using the or operator as shown in the figure most of the analysed studies which focused on water balance estimations and used land use and cover information were performed at different large scales ranging from the hillslope to basin scales see e g schilling et al 2008 nugroho et al 2013 deng et al 2015 kundu et al 2017 awotwi et al 2019 bao et al 2019 chemura et al 2020 on the contrary a few studies conducted at a small scale i e from national to global scale used of land use and cover data e g arnold et al 2000 who estimated the gr in the upper mississippi river basin usa batelaan and smedt 2007 who applied a spatially distributed water balance to estimate the dependence of gr on land cover soil texture topography and hydrometeorological parameters in three neighbouring catchments located in the ne of belgium total area of about 4300 km2 additionally riley et al 2019 studied the impact of land cover on gr in the high plains usa 3 study area the italian peninsula extends in the middle of the mediterranean along a nw se direction two large islands sicily and sardinia are located along the southwest and west coasts of the peninsula respectively italy is an active geodynamic state because it is located at the convergence of two tectonic mega plates namely the eurasian and african plates consequently volcanic and seismic activities are common in the region and pose a serious threat to the population notably the italian territory is also characterised by large hydrogeological variations as shown in fig 2 ispra 2007 which subdivides the emerged land masses into the following hydrogeological complexes i major streams fluvial deposits ii peri tyrrhenian basins ptb alluvial complexes iii padano venetian plan pvp multilayer complexes iv pvp undifferentiated complexes v volcanic complexes vi mixed sedimentary complexes vii sand complexes viii flysh complexes ix impermeable rock complexes x calcareous complexes xi calcareous dolomitic complexes xii evaporite complexes xiii crystalline complexes in the same map the hydrogeological complexes are overlapped to the seven geological sectors identified by bosellini 2005 2017 i alps ii po plain also called padano venetian plain or po valley iii apennines iv apulia foreland v calabrian peloritan arc vi sicily and vii sardinia bosellini 2005 2017 the alps are an arc shaped mountain chain and the italian part of the alps is predominantly composed of a mix of crystalline volcanic and flyshoid rock complexes which are characterised by low permeability with the exception of the highly tectonised areas subordinately the italian alps are composed of carbonates having high permeability these rocks are abundant in the southeastern sector of the mountain range where the more productive springs are located crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 donnini et al 2016 2020 bosellini 2017 rossi and donnini 2018 the po plain is a relatively flat region characterised by the presence of alluvial sediments that are mainly produced by the po river and its tributaries forming a single complex aquifer that is locally affected by the saltwater intrusion phenomena crampon et al 1996 bosellini 2017 rossi and donnini 2018 the apennines are a mountain chain that is commonly referred to as the backbone of italy crampon et al 1996 they are predominantly composed of a mix of flyshoids carbonates and volcanic rocks crampon et al 1996 bosellini 2017 the carbonate rocks host important aquifers which are largely fed by precipitations a series of volcanic aquifers is located on the western side of the apennines such aquifers feed on many large springs and have diverse permeability values which depend on the extent and intensity of weathering processes deep depressions located along the coastal margins and extending into the mountains are filled with highly permeable coarse grained deposits forming multi layered aquifers crampon et al 1996 de vita et al 2018 the apulia foreland composed of highly permeable carbonate aquifers that are affected by karst processes is located outside the apennine mountain chain region these aquifers are weakly deformed by recent tectonic activities and characterised by widespread groundwater loss of along the coastline civita 2008 bosellini 2017 de vita et al 2018 the calabrian peloritan arc can be considered as a portion of the alpine mountain range it is composed of metamorphic and granitic rocks that are characterised by low permeability consequently this area is poor in groundwater resources and consists of scattered springs having limited productivity civita 2008 bosellini 2017 de vita et al 2018 sicily with the exception of the southernmost portion of the calabrian peloritan arc belongs to the northern sector of the african plate bosellini 2017 the volcanic rocks of mount etna host the most important aquifers on this island the carbonate aquifers are located in the se and nw regions of the island the central part of the island is mainly composed of marly clayey and arenaceous matrix complexes which are impermeable and host poorly productive aquifers crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 from a geological perspective sardinia is a fragment of the european continent and is mainly composed of crystalline and volcanic rocks characterised by low permeability therefore important and productive aquifers are uncommon crampon et al 1996 civita 2008 4 materials and methods following rossi and donnini 2018 we used gratis libre open access data and open source software programs and tools to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses by following the concept of open science nüst and bartoschek 2018 grass 7 8 2 neteler and mitasova 2008 neteler et al 2012 qgis 2 14 quantum gis development team 2017 and postgresql 9 6 https www postgresql org with the spatial extension postgis 2 4 http www postgis org were used in this work to manage process and aggregate the input geographical data ascii raster and shapefiles while r 3 6 2 r core team 2013 is the language used for coding the water balance model the method used in this study as described in rossi and donnini 2018 was based on a monthly water balance model for estimating gr and the other water balance components over large areas we performed a monthly analysis according to thornthwaite 1948 and mather 1978 1979 generally such model uses an accounting procedure to allocate water to different various components of the hydrologic system the main inputs were the monthly temperature and precipitation notably our model did not directly consider land use and cover in spite of this limitation the thornthwaite mather approach has been applied extensively in the scientific literature and proven to be effective for estimating water balance components at low temporal resolutions i e monthly or yearly in not just different environments but also complex geological frameworks see e g mammoliti et al 2021 and references therein in particular this approach can be applied to large areas and in case of large available datasets see e g donker 1987 sellinger 1996 armiraglio et al 2003 mccabe and markstrom 2007 the water balance model and its components and their possible transfers identified in the proposed methodology derived by the code used by mccabe and markstrom 2007 are schematised in fig 3 the main time variant components variables i e those that represent different physical processes were i precipitation p both in the form of rainfall prain and snow psnow ii snow storage snowstor iii evapotranspiration et which can be categorised as potential pet and actual evapotranspiration aet iv shallow infiltration st and deep infiltration storages deepstor and v runoff represented as the direct monthly runoff dro and runoff derived from the water balance in the previous month ro the model also considered additional time variant auxiliary variables a exceeded water that cannot infiltrate or evapotranspirate sur b water stored in the soil surface surface soil water storage in a month remain c precipitation available for evapotranspiration p aet and d snow melt sm the water transferred to the different balance components was generally modulated by the 1 fraction of water in the soil that infiltrates at different depths pmhfact 2 fraction of precipitation that contributes directly to the runoff in a month drofact and 3 fraction of water that becomes surface runoff within a month after infiltration and evapotranspiration withdrawal rfact most importantly we used the model to calculate the monthly water repartition among the different balance components conceptually the model considers different storage elements in which the input and output are modulated by different processes fig 4 illustrates a matrix like schema portraying i the processing and aggregation procedures applied to the input data to homogenize align the different formats resolutions and reference systems and ii the water balance computations their outputs and the relative aggregation procedures see rossi and donnini 2018 the main inputs of the model were i soil elevation data from

2003 daroussin et al 1994 released in raster format with the grid resolution of the etrs89 extended laea europe epsg 3035 reference system set at 10 km coherent with the resolution and reference system of the inspire vector grid the cumulative daily precipitation and minimum and maximum daily temperature raster data were processed in r r core team 2013 to obtain the monthly precipitation and temperature series for 1981 2010 as shown in fig 4 the monthly raster data were transformed in the etrs89 extended laea europe epsg 3035 reference system and their values corresponding to the 10 km inspire vector grid resolution of 10 km were used as inputs for water balance computations the awc sub and awc top were derived from the textural class and from the soil packing density for the subsoil and for the topsoil the values come from categorical values refer to column description in table 1 associated to the minimum and maximum values refer to columns range values in table 1 expressed in mm m 1 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the values for the analysis refer to column calibr in table 1 were derived from rossi and donnini 2018 by comparing of the gr and grc model outputs with the values estimated by the studies on the central apennines boni et al 1986 according to van liedekerke and panagos 2003 and daroussin et al 1994 the dr may correspond either to i the depth to the top of the r layer soil layer few affected by paedogenic processes ditzler et al 2017 or ii the top of the c layer soil layer constituted by from strongly cemented to indurated bedrock ditzler et al 2017 similarly to the awc sub and awc top the values of dr column calibr in table 2 were derived from the categorical refer to column description in table 2 and range values refer to columns range values in table 2 thus characterising the dr in the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 in this study awc sub awc top and dr were used to estimate the water holding capacity whc of the soil which can be considered as a measure of the maximum amount of water that can be stored and withdrawn from the soil water storage fig 4 the text srf dom parameter expresses the main surface textural class van liedekerke and panagos 2003 and was used to characterize the direct and monthly runoff responses for a given

following month see fig 3 and rossi and donnini 2018 the minimum and a maximum values range associated to drofact and rfact and the final calibrated values are listed in table 3 the last input parameter was the pmh which represents the storage capacity and permeability of the region van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the categorical values characterising pmh van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 were used to derive numerical estimates of pmhfact a parameter of the water balance model that ranges from 0 to 1 table 4 and controls the fraction of water that infiltrated the subsurface up to a particular depth on a monthly base for the other model inputs the minimum maximum and calibrated values are also presented in table 4 fig 3 portrays also the influence of elevation in meltmax and tsnow determination as discussed by rossi and donnini 2018 meltmax is a parameter that controls the calculation of sm snow melt fraction that is the fraction of snow storage snowstor that melts in a month and tsnow is a temperature threshold above which the precipitation is in the form of snow fig 5 a portrays the elevation map derived from the digital elevation model tinitaly 01 grid resolution 10 m tarquini et al 2007 while figs 5 b and 5 c portray the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual temperature maps derived from the 10 km grid resolution data available in the scia database managed by the ispra desiato et al 2006 2007 http www scia isprambiente it these three maps were aggregated to the inspire vector grid having a

corresponding to the inspire vector grid resolution of 10 km fig 6f portrays the whc of the soil which was computed from the awc sub awc top and dr values see fig 4 by applying eq 2 as explained by rossi and donnini 2018 2 whc awc sub dr 2 awc top dr 2 the water balance model was essentially the same as the one used by rossi and donnini 2018 and considered different time variant components variables that represented different physical processes related to the water cycle balance these variables are i p rain and p snow ii snowstor iii pet and aet iv st and deepstor and v dro and ro additionally the model considers the following auxiliary time variant variables i remain ii st iii p aet and iv snowmelt the water transferred to the different balance components was modulated by a few controlling factors which were i pmhfact ii drofact and iii rfact generally over time temperature influences different balance components in time and the elevation soil and lithological data being time invariant can spatially modulate the different balance components as well the proposed model was able to calculate the water repartition among different balance components on a monthly basis conceptually it considered different storage elements whose input and output were modulated by different processes deepstor was a key variable considered in this study corresponding to the deep water storage that was accumulated on a monthly basis i e each month this value changed in relation to the amount of infiltration from the surface this variable was used to estimate gr commonly expressed as an average annual value in mm corresponding to year deepstor in fig 3 the grc value corresponding to the variable coef inf in fig 3 was estimated by including eq 3 or excluding eq 4 from the soil moisture storage withdrawal stw 3 grc coef inf total deepstor stw σ p 4 grc coef inf total deepstor σ p year deepstor stw year prec in these equations stw and total deepstor correspond to their final values for the simulated period 30 years 1981 2010 and σ p is the total precipitation during the same period alternative but equivalent formulations may consider year deepstor that represents the deepstor simulated considering a specific year instead of total deepstor and year prec that represents the precipitation during the same specific year instead of σ p the gr and grc results were obtained as the aggregated statistics of the monthly water balance variables over the inspire reference grid results 5 results we applied the water balance model for the entire italian territory using the monthly precipitation and temperature raster data series for 1981 2010 the model results mainly consisted of values in shapefile and textual format and plots in pdf format of the hydrological balance components estimated for each inspire grid cell at the monthly scale in the resulting maps the water balance components were calculated as the average values derived for the period 1981 2010 we considered the averages of only gr mm year 1 and grc dimensionless from 0 to 1 expresses as gr avg and grc avg respectively estimated for the period of 1981 2010 fig 7a portrays the map developed using the gr avg values ranging from 0 to 1130 mm year 1 with mean median first and third quartiles of 357 327 269 and 421 mm year 1 respectively notably gr avg spatial distribution is similar to the mean annual precipitation distribution fig 5b which is in turn influenced by altitude fig 5a such a similar pattern is mainly conditioned by the distribution of the mountainous areas of the territory which receive a greater amount of precipitation than the plains and coasts particularly when they are exposed to the humid air masses circulations from the sea fratianni and acquaotta 2017 in the grc avg map in fig 7b this general pattern is not evident with the maximum grc avg values observed predominantly along the tyrrhenian coast west coast in correspondence with the eastern part of the ligurian sea and with the southernmost sector of the peninsula calabria region the gr and grc representation is detailed in fig 8 wherein we estimated the minimum the mean and the maximum gr and grc values for the different italian hydrogeological complexes identified by ispra 2007 as shown in fig 2 the minimum and maximum values were estimated using the 5th and the 95th percentile respectively fig 8a b and c confirm the gr values distribution shown in fig 7a the minimum and mean gr maps as shown in fig 8a and b highlight the dependence of gr on lithology rather than precipitation indeed within the alpine mountain range which is generally characterised by high precipitation rates see fig 5b the highest gr values were observed along the south eastern region where the more permeable carbonate lithologies were abundant see fig 2 a further inspection of fig 8d e and f confirmed a less evident grc pattern as shown in fig 7b with the lowest grc values observed in the portions of the alps and apennines characterised by the presence of crystalline mainly metamorphic rocks and volcanic mainly intrusive rocks complexes in line with the analysis of celico 1988 fig 9 to compare the modelled gr values with water withdrawals we performed a literature analysis to gather the reference withdrawals data the most recent withdrawals data considered in this study were acquired from i bono and boni 1996 for the mineral waters industry and ii istat 2019 for civil use including springs and wells we used hydro bm to estimate the gr for 1992 and 2015 referred to as gr 1992 fig 10 b and gr 2015 fig 10 c respectively these values were aggregated at the regional level considering the average value for the entire period i e gr avg fig 10 a as shown in the fig 10 gr is classified as vl very low 0 2 5 109 m3 year 1 l low 2 5 5 109 m3 year 1 m medium 5 7 5 109 m3 year 1 h high 7 5 10 109 m3 year 1 vh very high 10 12 5 109 m3 year 1 and vvh extremely high 12 5 15 109 m3 year 1 the analysis revealed that the regions with the highest gr values are located in the north western portion of italy piemonte toscana and lombardia and in sicily conversely the regions with the lowest gr values were valle d aosta and liguria in northern italy umbria in central italy and molise in southern italy fig 10a indicates that in the 1981 2010 period i none of the regions could be categorised as vvh and vh ii four regions piemonte toscana lombardia and sicily portrayed h values iii five regions emilia romagna calabria veneto lazio and sardinia portrayed m values iv nine regions trentino alto adige puglia campania friuli venezia giulia abruzzo basilicata marche umbria and liguria had l values and v two regions molise and valle d aosta had vl values as shown in fig 10b in 1992 i no regions portrayed vvh values ii two regions piemonte and lombardia had vh values iii three regions toscana emilia romagna and sicily had h values iv six regions veneto calabria trentino alto adige sardinia puglia and lazio had m values v five regions campania friuli venezia giulia marche abruzzo and basilicata had l values and vi four regions had vl values umbria liguria molise and valle d aosta as shown in fig 10c in 2015 i lombardia only had vvh values ii four regions lombardia emilia romagna sicily and toscana had vh values iii two regions calabria and veneto had h values iv six regions lazio sardinia trentino alto adige campania puglia and friuli venezia giulia had m values v five regions marche abruzzo basilicata umbria and liguria had l values and vi two regions molise and valle d aosta had vl values the variations in the gr 1992 and gr 2015 values with respect to gr avg values are shown in fig 10d and e the generic pv gr year is the percentage variation in a specific year with respect to the gr avg calculated as using the following equation 5 pv gr year gr year gr avg 100 100 as shown in fig 10d for campania in 1992 the gr values were quite similar to those estimated for 1981 2010 period while the regions with the highest positive gr percentage variation were nine and predominantly located in the northern sector of the italian peninsula valle d aosta trentino alto adige and piemonte with pv gr 1992 ranging from 15 to 35 followed by lombardia emilia romagna veneto puglia sicily and marche with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 2 to 15 conversely 10 regions portrayed the highest negative gr percentage variations and were predominantly located in the central and tyrrhenian regions of the peninsula umbria and liguria with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 15 to 35 followed by lazio sardinia abruzzo molise calabria friuli venezia giulia basilicata and toscana with pv gr 1992 values ranging from 2 to 15 fig 10e portrays that during 2015 the gr in umbria was similar to the gr avg whereas in the other regions the gr was significantly higher in particular emilia romagna piemonte calabria lombardia sicily and valle d aosta portrayed the highest pv gr 2015 values ranging from 35 to 55 followed by marche veneto basilicata campania trentino alto adige puglia and abruzzo with the pv gr 2015 ranging from 15 to 35 and finally by friuli venezia giulia lazio liguria toscana sardinia molise and umbria with the pv gr 2015 values ranging from 2 to 15 6 discussions groundwater recharge estimation is a complex task as it requires information regarding lithology morphology and climate to address this issue we customised the water balance model proposed by rossi and donnini 2018 for the european alps and the central apennines and refined the model to make it applicable for italy using a grid resolution of 10 km in the refined approach we used more detailed elevation and climatic data that is i the elevation at 10 m grid resolution from tinitaly 01 tarquini et al 2007 and ii the cumulative monthly precipitation and the minimum and maximum temperature data acquired from the scia database desiato et al 2006 2007 of the ispra for the period 1981 2010 at a daily scale and with a 10 km grid resolution the soil and lithology data for this resolution were derived from different layers of the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 and were the same as those used by rossi and donnini 2018 1 awc top 2 awc sub 3 dr 4 text srf dom and 5 pmh see section 4 we decided to use the data from the european soil database version 2 0 because they represent quantitative attributes of the diversity and spatial variability of the soil daroussin et al 1994 in contrast to for example the corine land cover data büttner et al 2004 which only provides qualitative information the calibrated values of awc sub awc top dr drofact rfact and pmhfact reported in tables 2 3 and 4 used for modelling in this study were observed at the boundaries of the original ranges indicated by the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 all these values jointly contribute to the increase in the amount of water that may infiltrate into the soil and accumulate as deep water storages with the effect of increasing the final modelled gr estimations this indicates a need to push the model towards its maximum capacity to reproduce the gr reference values accurately which can potentially result in the underestimation of gr in contrast to rossi and donnini 2018 in our analysis no aggregations were performed and for this reason the estimation of the minimum maximum and average values of the water balance components the three modelling scenarios namely s1 minimum s2 average and s3 maximum were not quantified the proposed model did not directly consider land use and cover however even over small study areas such information was effective in modelling gr we acknowledge that this may potentially lead to spatio temporal biases when estimating the water balance components however as shown in section 2 at a small scale specifically at the national scale land use and cover was not commonly used as an input variable furthermore none of the studies in the literature have been performed in italy which limit the potential advantages and limitations of this model to analyse regions similar to italy the grid cell resolution of 10 km allows for the analysis of gr and its sustainability at the regional and hydrogeological complex scales but not at the small aquifer scale hence gr estimates can be compared with anthropogenic withdrawals at the regional level but not for the analysis of small aquifers and their overexploitation however possible applications at regional and hydrogeological complex scales may focus on the estimation of heat and co2 fluxes in groundwaters over wide areas see e g kessler and harvey 2001 frondini et al 2019 6 1 comparison with literature data we performed a robust comparison of the modelled gr and grc values with all possible reference data available in the literature boni et al 1986 mastrorillo et al 2009 we maintain that an analysis of the uncertainty variation in the modelled data is important to validate and calibrate the models at the same time we are aware that a correct analysis of the uncertainty of and variations in the results is fundamental to obtaining a reliable dataset of infiltrating rates that can portray the variations in the spatiotemporal data we performed uncertainty variation analyses of the results using i the gr and grc in the main aquifers of central italy mainly composed of carbonate flyshoid and volcanic rocks as estimated by boni et al 1986 and ii the gr in the hydrogeological units of the umbria region central italy consisting of carbonates as explained by mastrorillo et al 2009 notably both these studies used direct methods we are aware that the gr and grc values of apennines could be different from those of the rest of italy as the country features diverse geological and climatological contexts however we maintain that the studies of boni et al 1986 and of mastrorillo et al 2009 are the most accurate ones performed at the regional scale in italy with the most accurate and reliable gr grc reference to the best of our knowledge the first qualitative evaluation of the gr in italy was performed by boni and bono 1982 while focusing mainly on the carbonate complexes in the central apennines in that area the authors recognized 12 domains in the region and estimated the average discharge of the main springs for each complex boni et al 1986 refined this analysis for central italy identifying 22 main hydrogeological complexes and estimating the corresponding gr as shown in fig 11 a the authors grouped the aquifers into five domains with the gr values displayed in fig 11 b i the shelf domain ii the pelagic domain iii the marly calcarenitic complex iv the volcanic domain and v the structures made by rocks belonging to more than one domain which in this study are referred to as heterogeneous complexes a synoptic view of the gr values within the 22 hydrogeological complexes is illustrated in fig 11 c highlighting the following i the highest gr values were observed in the shelf domain minimum 706 mm year 1 maximum 983 mm year 1 and average 847 75 mm year 1 ii the lowest gr values were observed in the marly calcarenitic aquifers minimum 183 mm year 1 maximum 281 mm year 1 and average 235 mm year 1 and iii the intermediate gr values were observed in the pelagic and volcanic aquifers the figure illustrates that the pelagic domain was composed of two aquifers with the gr values of 533 and 637 mm year 1 whereas the volcanic domain was composed of four aquifers with the gr values ranging between 280 and 778 mm year 1 with an average value of 428 mm year 1 medium to high values were recorded in the aquifers of the heterogeneous complexes with the gr values ranging from 568 to 888 mm year 1 average value of 743 25 mm year 1 as sown in fig 11 c the grc values estimated for the shelf domain minimum 0 88 maximum 0 57 average 0 70 were the highest among the five domains the lowest grc values were observed for the marly calcarenitic complex minimum 0 19 maximum 0 25 average 0 22 the intermediate grc values were estimated for the pelagic composed of two aquifers with grc of 0 48 0 60 and the volcanic domains composed of four aquifers with grc values of 0 28 0 60 and an average of 0 36 the medium to high grc values were observed for the heterogeneous complexes minimum 0 44 maximum 0 75 average 0 62 notably all the estimated grc values agreed with those indicated by celico 1988 as shown in fig 9 the carbonate rocks limestone dolomitic limestone and dolostone portrayed quite high grc values ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 the marly limestone portrayed medium low grc values 0 3 0 5 and the volcanic rocks pyroclastic deposits pyroclastics and lavas and intrusive rocks portrayed a wide spectrum of grc values 0 15 0 9 such values particularly those indicated for carbonate rocks were in line with the studies conducted by other authors burdon 1965 kessler 1965 vilimonovic 1965 drogue 1971 soulios 1984 bonacci 2001 jukić and denić jukić 2004 jukić denić jukić 2008 who estimated quite high grc values for the european calcareous karst aquifers ranging from 0 5 to 0 76 the aquifers in the pelagic domains were analysed in detail by mastrorillo et al 2009 and mastrorillo and petitta 2010 the two hydrological complexes recognised by boni et al 1986 g5 and s9 in fig 11a were discretised by mastrorillo et al 2009 into 21 complexes see fig 11d the values of which are shown in figs 11d and 11e a comparison of the values displayed in fig 11c and f highlight that the gr values estimated by boni et al 1986 and by mastrorillo et al 2009 are quite similar but some local differences exist within the pelagic complexes furthermore boni et al 1986 analysed the pelagic complexes and estimated their gr values as 533 mm year 1 g5 and 637 mm year 1 s9 while mastrorillo et al 2009 stated that the estimated values of the 21 complexes ranged from 250 mm year 1 to 880 mm year 1 with an average value of 487 mm year 1 standard deviation of 118 mm year 1 the values decreased with increasing marly content the gr and grc values modelled in this study were compared with those shown in fig 11 estimated by boni at al 1986 and by mastrorillo et al 2009 the different hydrological domains where the gr and grc were derived by boni et al 1986 and mastrorillo et al 2009 overlapped with multiple grid cells of the inspire reference grid used in our analyses this allowed us to estimate the minimum mean and maximum gr and grc values within the different hydrological domains to account for possible unreliable modelling outliers in the analyses the minimum and maximum values were estimated respectively as the 5th and 95th percentile values respectively a comparison of the minimum mean and maximum modelled values and their corresponding references is shown in fig 12 while for mastrorillo et al 2009 it was possible to compare only gr values when considering boni at al 1986 both the gr and grc comparisons were possible for each comparison a linear correlation equation assuming an intercept of 0 was estimated and the corresponding determination coefficients r2 were calculated indeed by definition the modelled values should be 0 when the reference values are 0 implying the use of a regression model without an intercept in such a case the angular coefficient allows for the direct verification of the model for possible under or over estimations the prediction intervals are shown in the plots of grey shades the r2 value was high 0 84 for all the gr comparisons with the highest values obtained when considering mastrorillo et al s 2009 data as a reference 0 93 moreover the results highlight that the larger gr differences could be obtained for the marly calcarenitic complexes brown circles in fig 12a b and c while minor differences could be observed for the shelf and pelagic domains light green and dark green circles in fig 12a b and c such a good correspondence for the pelagic domains was confirmed as shown in fig 12g h and i conversely low r2 values 0 50 0 58 were obtained when comparing the modelled and the reference grc values boni et al 1986 with the largest difference observed in the marly calcarenitic complex and in the volcanic domain brown and red circles in fig 12d e and f overall the comparison shown in fig 12 highlights that a good correlation exists between the modelled and reference gr data while confirming the wide grc variability estimated by others celico 1988 6 2 groundwater recharge gr and groundwater recharge coefficient grc values within the different hydrogeological complexes the variability of the modelled gr and grc values within the hydrogeological complexes identified by ispra 2007 fig 8 is portrayed in fig 13 while portraying the 1st 25th 50th median 75th and 99th percentiles a visual inspection of fig 13 a highlights the large variations in the median gr values and their interquartile range iqr indicated by the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the different hydrogeological complexes such large variations and their overlap suggest that a direct correlation between gr and lithology may not exists possibly because of the dependence of gr on precipitation it is important to emphasise that with the exception of major stream fluvial deposits pvp multilayer complex and pvp undifferentiated complex located in the po plain and of the evaporite complex located in sicily and the calabrian peloritan arc almost all the lithologies were present in areas characterized by different precipitation values see figs 2 and 5b smaller variability characterises grc iqr values as shown in fig 13b the comparison of the modelled grc values shown in the figure with the reference values observed by celico 1988 reported in fig 9 highlights a possible model underestimation however celico 1988 already acknowledged that the grc values in nature could differ from estimations fig 9 due to possible relations with the slope vegetation cover porosity and or fracturing notably the comparison of figs 9 and 13 is not straightforward given the possible lithological classification discrepancies the large variability in the range between the 1st and 99th percentiles can be attributed to the significant differences among the precipitation values within the different lithologies furthermore in the alluvial deposits i e major stream fluvial deposits pvp multilayer complexes pvp undifferentiated complexes and ptb alluvial complexes the analysis of fig 13a revealed a large variability among the gr values the first two domains major stream fluvial deposits and pvp multilayer complexes and the last one ptb alluvial complexes portrayed low median gr values as well as low iqr while the pvp undifferentiated complexes portrayed the highest median gr and iqr values this difference can be attributed to the precipitation variability shown in fig 5b quite low precipitation values were observed in the major stream fluvial deposits in pvp multilayer complexes and in ptb alluvial complexes and conversely quite high precipitation values were observed in the pvp undifferentiated complexes this difference was less evident in the grc values fig 13b with all the four hydrogeological complexes portraying quite high median and relatively small iqr values even if the grc values observed by celico 1988 for alluvial deposits see fig 9 were considerably higher than the modelled values they are among the highest when considering all the modelled values obtained for the different hydrological domains low median gr and iqr values as well as low grc values were observed for the volcanic complex fig 13a and b which was in agreement with the values reported for these lithologies both by boni et al 1986 and by celico 1988 medium low median gr and small iqr values were observed for the impermeable rock flysh and for sand complexes fig 13a conversely quite high median gr and iqr values were observed for the mixed sedimentary rocks and medium high gr values were observed for the calcareous and calcareous dolomitic complexes the higher gr values for carbonate aquifers i e calcareous complexes and calcareous dolomitic complexes and lower grc values for marly sandstone aquifers impermeable rock flysh and sand complexes were confirmed by boni et al 1986 as shown in fig 11 the high median gr value associated with very high iqr values for the mixed sedimentary complexes can be attributed to the small extension of these complexes across the italian territory see fig 2 medium low gr grc and low iqr values were observed in the crystalline complexes fig 13 consistent with the findings of celico 1988 the large variability in the range between the 1st and 99th percentiles may be due to the large precipitation differences fig 5b within the lithology fig 2 varying from high values in the alps to low values in sardinia and the calabrian peloritan arc medium low gr values for the evaporite complex fig 13a may be due to the low precipitation values fig 5b associated with this lithology in italy sardinia and calabrian peloritan arc fig 2 while its high grc values may be due to the highly fractured nature of the lithology overall the large variability of the gr values for the different hydrogeological complexes shown in fig 13a suggests that gr strongly depends on precipitation rather than lithology regarding grc the smallest variability was shown in the median and in the iqr values while quite high variability was observed in the outliers see fig 13b which may be due to the large difference in precipitation within the different lithologies the grc values estimated in this study were always lower than those observed by celico 1988 ones but the lithological classification of this study was quite different from the classification adopted by celico 1988 in conclusion fig 13 highlights that reasonable gr and grc estimates could be defined only at the hydrogeological complex scale and that the general correlation between the gr and grc cannot be defined 6 3 deep infiltration storages and sustainability of water withdrawals in the natural water cycle as well as in the water balance model illustrated in this study the withdrawals w were not considered even if as stated in section 1 they could have a non negligible impact on many components of the water cycle a systematic and long term monitoring of water withdrawals in italy has not been conducted the most recent and complete studies on water withdrawals were conducted by chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 which quantified the use of water resources in italy while highlighting its main repartition among the agricultural 50 civil 27 and industrial 23 uses istat 2019 highlighted that the estimates of withdrawal for civil use were quite reliable in contrast to the estimates for agricultural and industrial use because for the latter two uses a widespread and systematic monitoring system does not exist in the following considerations we assumed that the water of springs and wells is derived predominantly from the deep infiltration storages gr or alternatively referred to year deepstor in the hydro bm water balance model code and that the water of the river systems as well as of the natural and artificial lakes is derived from runoff ro and shallow soil moisture storage st water withdrawals for agricultural use istat 2019 can be subdivided into irrigation and zootechnical uses according to the same source the withdrawals for irrigation use during the 2009 2010 agricultural year were 11 6 109 m3 and those for zootechnical use during the 2016 agricultural year were 0 32 109 m3 for a total of 11 9 109 m3 30 less than the values of 17 0 109 m3 reported by chiaroni et al 2018 for 2015 according to istat 2019 within agricultural use the major withdrawals are for irrigation 97 3 and only a marginal portion is used for zootechnical use 2 7 furthermore chiaroni et al 2018 reported that among the withdrawals for irrigation use 65 is for irrigation and remediation consortia consorzi di irrigazione e bonifica with 18 5 withdrawn from groundwater and 16 5 from surficial waters ciafani et al 2008 reported the anbi an acronym for the italian national association of consortia for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation water associazione nazionale consorzi di gestione e tutela del territorio e acque irrigue www anbi it data and stated that more than 90 of withdrawals of irrigation and remediation consortia was derived from watercourses and from artificial lakes fig 14 reports the percentage of water withdrawn for agricultural use with particular reference to the contributions from groundwater and surface water bodies approximately 25 of withdrawals for agricultural use was from groundwater bodies ranging from 2 98 109 m3 year 1 and 4 25 109 m3 year 1 estimated respectively as stated by istat 2019 and chiaroni et al 2018 according to istat 2019 during 2015 the amount of water withdrawn for civil use was 9 49 109 m3 similar values were reported by chiaroni et al 2018 who estimated values of 9 00 109 m3 for 2015 and 9 5 109 m3 for 2012 differences exist between the two data sources in terms of the provenance of these volumes istat 2019 estimated that 84 3 of the withdrawals were from springs and wells i e from the deep infiltration storages and the remaining 15 7 were from watercourses river streams etc natural and artificial lakes i e from runoff and shallow soil moisture storage and seawater alternatively chiaroni et al 2018 estimated that 53 of the withdrawals were from surficial waters and 48 were from groundwater consequently the amount of withdrawals for civil use from gr were estimated ranging from 8 00 109 m3 istat 2019 to 4 28 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 similar to agriculture the estimated withdrawals for industrial use from istat 2019 have a significant degree of uncertainty to overcome this information gap istat 2019 reported the estimates of the withdrawals for the manufacturing activity during 2015 as 3 79 109 m3 regarding the provenance of water for industrial use the authors specify that small companies with less than five employees often use water from the public network for civil use with an estimated volume of water of 195 103 m3 0 01 whereas medium and large companies use specific self supply systems or water from infrastructures for industrial areas different values were reported by chiaroni et al 2018 who estimated that 6 1 109 m3 of withdrawals were for manufacturing activity confirming the withdrawals of 195 103 m3 for small companies with less than five employees the authors reported that the majority of withdrawals for the manufacturing activity was from groundwater 96 ranging from 3 62 109 m3 istat 2019 to 5 83 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 chiaroni et al 2018 also estimated 1 6 109 m3 of withdrawals for energy production fig 15 portrays a comparison of the withdrawals considering the chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 estimates as well as the amount of withdrawals coming from deep infiltration storage hence coming from gr overall the total amount of withdrawals ranges from 32 10 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 to 25 18 109 m3 istat 2019 and the amount of withdrawals from gr ranges from 13 50 109 m3 chiaroni et al 2018 to 14 00 109 m3 istat 2019 another important withdrawal was by the mineral water industry an exhaustive even if old dated estimate of the amount of water bottled in italy was reported by bono and boni 1996 indicating that in 1992 233 mineral water brands and 181 spa units operates in the italian territory resulting in a production of 6 2 106 m3 of mineral water approximately three order of magnitude lower than the values shown in fig 15 in this study the average gr estimates came from a climatic dataset of 30 years 1981 2010 which can be considered robust accordingly to wmo 2017 which states that a 30 year period is long enough to filter out any inter annual variation or anomalies but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends the water withdrawals data was acquired from a less robust dataset that considered i one year i e 2015 for civil and industrial use chiaroni and istat et al 2018 2019 and ii one year i e 1992 for the mineral water industry bono and boni 1996 for relative comparison both datasets should consider the same period of time with hopefully a longer period unfortunately in italy there is no specific system to enable the systematic and long term monitoring of water withdrawal the works of chiaroni et al 2018 and istat 2019 for civil and industrial use withdrawals and the work of bono and boni 1996 represent the most recent and complete studies in this respect at the national level the gr avg values allow for the quantification of 109 58 109 m3 of the total amount of water deeply stored on average in a year in the italian territory in 1992 and 2015 these amounts gr 1992 and gr 2015 respectively were comparable and corresponded to 113 13 109 m3 in 1992 and 139 04 109 m3 in 2015 about 3 and 27 more than the average long period estimates respectively according to these estimations the amount of water withdrawn from groundwater for civil industrial and agricultural use chiaroni et al 2018 istat 2019 fig 15 was 14 of the gr avg more specifically the amount of water withdrawn for the mineral water industry w bottled according to bono and boni 1996 was 0 01 of the gr 1992 value whereas that withdrawn for civil use w civil according to istat 2019 was 10 of the gr 2015 value fig 16 portrays a comparison between gr 1992 and w bottled and between gr 2015 and w civil figure 16a shows that the region with highest w bottled values was lombardia 3 01 106 m3 year 1 followed by veneto 1 44 106 m3 year 1 piemonte 1 27 106 m3 year 1 emilia romagna 1 9 106 m3 year 1 and tuscany 1 1 106 m3 year 1 w bottled in the other regions were lower than 1 0 106 m3 year 1 with the exception of valle d aosta and molise which had no data fig 16b shows the regions grouped into four classes of w civil the regions with highest w civil values were lombardia 1 44 109 m3 year 1 and lazio 1 13 109 m3 year 1 followed by campania 0 98 109 m3 year 1 veneto 0 65 109 m3 year 1 sicily 0 62 109 m3 year 1 and piemonte 0 58 109 m3 year 1 ten regions have values of 0 1 0 5 109 m3 year 1 calabria toscana emilia romagna abruzzo trentino alto adige friuli venezia giulia molise liguria marche and umbria and four regions puglia sardinia basilicata and valle d aosta portrayed values of 0 0 1 109 m3 year 1 fig 16 c and d also portray the percentage of w bottled with respect to gr 1992 and that of w civil with respect to gr 2015 the two percentages are denoted as p w bottled and p w civil respectively and were estimated using the following equations 6 p w bottled w bottled 100 gr 1992 7 p w civil w civil 100 gr 2015 fig 16c portrays the italian regions having p w bottled values lower than 0 01 in veneto and sardinia the values were 0 01 0 02 and in lombardia and umbria the values were higher than 0 02 fig 16d portrays that the p w civil values were the highest in lazio 16 2 and campania 16 1 followed by lombardia 11 7 and molise 10 7 while veneto abruzzo sicily and liguria have values of 5 10 the remaining twelve regions friuli venezia giulia piemonte valle d aosta calabria trentino alto adige umbria

libre open access data and open source software programs and tools in line with the concept of open science nüst and bartoschek 2018 we conducted a groundwater recharge study at the national level for italy and considered important variables that may affect subsurface infiltration and gr notably our model can be applied to most parts of the eurasian continent using the european soil database version 2 0 van liedekerke and panagos 2003 daroussin et al 1994 the model provided groundwater recharge estimates for the italian territory within a 10 km grid cell resolution mesh using monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1981 to 2010 from the ispra scia database desiato et al 2006 2007 the model was calibrated and validated with reference to literature data available for the area of apennines central italy the comparison of gr values estimated for specific years i e 1992 and 2015 along with the data of water withdrawals highlighted the following i the mineral water industry consumption was close to 0 01 of the total gr in 1992 ii the civil use was not negligible being 10 of the total gr in 2015 and correlated with the number of inhabitants iii a correlation between the number of inhabitants per region and the percentage of water withdrawn for civil use with respect to total gr was not evident suggesting that the sustainability of water withdrawals varied regionally we maintain that the proposed approach may have strategic importance for developing countries which are affected by water availability and have sustainability issues especially in the context of climate change such applications would largely benefit from the findability accessibility interoperability and reusability fair data our methodology allows for the evaluation of the sustainability of water withdrawals at the regional and national scale in line with the 6th un sdg https sdgs un org and help european countries achieve targets 6 4 and 6 5 in particular the water balance provides meaningful data for evaluating the indicator 6 4 1 change in water use efficiency over time 6 4 2 level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater
