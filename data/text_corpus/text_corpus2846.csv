obtained for as v continuous elimination thomas and modified dose response demonstrate to be the best fitting models for continuous sorption data a critical bed depth was determined to be 1 5 cm applying the bed depth service time model bdst keywords chitosan arsenic removal continuous sorption optimization 1 introduction arsenic as is a ubiquitous element found in rocks and soils atmosphere natural waters and organisms among the most common elements in the earth s crust as occupies the 20th place 1 the presence of as in drinking waters is fundamentally natural with a small anthropogenic contribution high concentrations of arsenic in soils and water constitute a risk to human health and limit the agricultural livestock production since the as can be integrated later in the food chain the andes ranges was melded through the movement of tectonic plates more than 50 million years ago and large amounts of volcanic ashes with a high content of arsenic and fluorine were emitted into the atmosphere during the process in argentina the presence of high levels of as in underground water in diverse areas of the chaco pampean plain more than one million of km2 2 is related to volcanic activity in the andes between 14 and 28 s approximately 50 of the population in rural areas is unaware of as poisoning in many regions arsenic concentrations are greater than 0 01 mg l 1 which is the world health organization who current reference value of as in drinking water 3 even though in argentina the permitted drinking water value is 50 μg l 1 arsenic concentrations in underground water vary in a range from 0 5 to 5000 μg l 1 4 6 the existence of a dose response relationship between arsenic consumption for long periods of time and cancer diabetes in people was proposed 7 arsenic induces cancer by mechanisms involving cytotoxicity and this is an accepted phenomenon supported by experimental evidence 8 this type of chronic poisoning primarily affects people with fewer resources and small or isolated populations which consume underground water without periodic analysis until now as has been eliminated using the following traditional technologies precipitation coagulation flocculation ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration in recent years sorption researches have focused on using natural sorbents in the removal of arsenic from water chitin is a long chain biopolymer obtained from the shrimp and crab shells 9 but its small sorption capacity limits its application as a sorbent in the treatment of contaminated water with arsenic 10 its most important derivative chitosan is produced by deacetylation in alkaline medium at temperatures above 60 c and has different properties from chitin 11 chitosan physical chemical characteristics such as the presence of a large amount of hydroxyl and amine groups nontoxicity biodegradability chemical stability chelation behaviour and selectivity towards metal ions make this polymer an attractive alternative to other biomaterials for as removal 12 14 good experimental designs are necessary for understanding complex situations of cause effect relationship a statistical design of experiments is the most effective way to make tests applying the scientific method with the intention of generating knowledge about a process by means of properly planned experiments 15 as v sorption behaviour onto chitosan biopolymer was evaluated in this work arsenic removal from aqueous solutions by batch and column system was examined batch studies were carried out in order to a select the optimal ph for as v removal b know if arsenic sorption on chitosan occurs slowly or quickly a fast sorption speed of the contaminant is a requirement to work with column systems c find out the mechanism of as v sorption through kinetic and equilibrium studies and d select suitable reagents for arsenic desorption that allow chitosan reuse langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models were selected to explain equilibrium sorption data while for kinetic sorption analysis pseudo ﬁrst and pseudo second order rate equations were used to define optimal operational parameters on which fixed bed columns packed with chitosan work effectively response surface methodology based on a ccd was used the use of factorial designs for arsenic continuous removal from water is not easily found in research works continuous sorption studies are required because they reflect more accurately the reality of the removal process providing evidences that could help to project an industrial scale sorption process for water treatments experimental breakthrough curves were fitted with thomas yoon nelson and modified dose response models sorbent recycle capacity was verified with two adsorption desorption cycles and continuous process scale up studies were achieved by applying bed depth service time bdst model the presence of arsenic on chitosan was confirmed by two spectroscopic techniques fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray diﬀ raction xrd analysis quantification of as v was carried out by modifying the traditional molybdenum blue method which is described in detail it should be noticed that the use of this methodology is extremely convenient because it allows to perform more controls in a shorter time to ensure the water quality for example in argentina small town laboratories do not have high tech equipment such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers special infrastructure or technicians specifically trained to measure arsenic concentration in water for these reasons the required controls are not usually carried out for long periods of time therefore affecting the local community furthermore this useful method has the sensitivity required by the current legislation 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification chitosan parafarm 70 particle size 100 μm was employed as received without chemical modification 2 1 1 as v detection and quantification molybdenum blue method 16 17 is a simple and economical procedure to determine as v traces in aqueous solutions therefore the quantitative determination of as v was carried out using this methodology with a self made modification moreover with the purpose of obtaining more data regarding the stability and reaction rate of molybdate arsenate complex absorbance measurements of the reagents involved in arsenic quantification were made each sample was acidified with 1 hcl and then treated with 14 0 sulfuric acid h2so4 3 0 ammonium heptamolybdate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 1 1 antimony potassium tartrate c4h4k2o6sb 1 2h2o and 11 0 ascorbic acid c6h8o6 in a 5 2 1 2 vol ratio and respecting that mixing order the absorbance was measured at 890 nm with a quartz cell of 10 cm light passage and a double beam jasco v 550 spectrophotometer as v concentration was calculated using eq 1 1 as v abs ε b f where abs is the sample absorbance ε is the molar absorptivity m 1 cm 1 b is the optical path cm and f is the dilution factor 2 1 2 ft ir and xrd analysis to identify the chemical functional groups present on chitosan and as v loaded biomaterial ft ir spectroscopy perkin elmer ft ir spectrum one spectrophotometer was performed ir absorbance data were obtained at 500 4000 cm 1 wave number range by the kbr dilution method 1 5 w w the xrd measurements were carried out in order to evaluate the semi crystallinity chitosan degree before and after as v treatment on a panalytical empyrean series x ray diﬀ ractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and cukα radiation 1 540598 å at current of 30 ma and voltage of 40 kv 2 1 3 effect of ph on as v sorption an important variable that can affect a sorption process is ph for example arsenic species present in a solution are a function of ph conditions moreover ph values have an important influence on the chitosan polymer properties and therefore the effect of ph on as v sorption by chitosan was studied batch experiments were performed at ph values ranged from 3 to 6 the initial arsenic concentration was 1 0 mg l 1 with a 5 0 g l 1 of chitosan dose the solutions were shaken at 75 rpm in a shaker at 25 c 2 1 4 kinetic study of as v sorption process kinetic is probably the most important factor during the design of a sorption system the kinetic study allows to determine the elimination speed of contaminants from the solution numerous kinetic models have been developed with different degrees of complexity to describe the mechanism through which the sorption process takes place the kinetic sorption was analysed in this study with two different models pseudo first order or lagergren model 18 and pseudo second order or ho and mckay model 19 described below pseudo first order model is probably one of the most commonly used to describe solutes sorption from a solution by a solid sorbent it can be expressed correctly in nonlinear form by eq 2 2 q t q e 1 e k 1 t the pseudo second order equation was initially developed to explain kinetic sorption of bivalent metals by sorbents although it was successfully used to describe the sorption of toxic ions in different oxidation states it is defined by eq 3 3 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 t k 2 q e where qe mg g 1 and qt mg g 1 are the sorption capacity at equilibrium and at any time t respectively k1 and k2 are the pseudo first order min 1 and the pseudo second order rate constants g mg 1 min 1 respectively the last model suggests that sorption capacity is related to the active sites filled by the sorbate which means that sorption reaction is principally governed by chemisorption during the kinetic test samples were taken at various times and the working conditions were as v concentration 0 5 mg l 1 chitosan dose 0 5 g l 1 ph 4 5 and t 5 c 2 1 5 arsenic equilibrium sorption study sorption isotherms describe how sorbates present in a solution interact with sorbents for this reason it is important to optimize their use in the sorption process thus a description of equilibrium data by theoretical or empirical equations becomes important for a practical and effective design of sorption systems in literature there are numerous models to study equilibrium sorption which provide information about sorbent affinity for toxic ions and allow to characterize the sorbent surface properties through the isotherm parameters isotherm models employed for experimental data fitting were langmuir 20 freundlich 21 and dubinin radushkevich d r 22 batch experimental conditions were t 25 c as v concentration 20 700 mg l 1 ph 4 5 chitosan dose 10 g l 1 contact time between sorbent and sorbate 15 min 2 1 5 1 langmuir isotherm this two parameter model has been one of the most studied for sorption experiments and is expressed in eq 4 4 q e b q m c e 1 b c e where qe is the sorption capacity mg g 1 and ce is the concentration of the sorbate in solution mg l 1 qm is the maximum sorption capacity for complete monolayer coverage mg g 1 and b is a constant related to the affinity between sorbent and sorbate particles l mg 1 2 1 5 2 freundlich isotherm freundlich empirical model is the second most used unlike the previous model it does not indicate a finite sorption capacity and it is used in a range of low to intermediate concentrations mathematically it is easier to handle than other models due to the relative simplicity of its expression eq 5 5 q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the freundlich constant related to the sorption capacity of the solid mg g 1 ce and qe are defined in a similar way to langmuir model the n constant describes the attraction level between sorbate and sorbent a favourable sorption tends to have a value of n from 1 to 10 a value of n close to 10 implies a strong interaction sorbent contaminant 23 2 1 5 3 dubinin radushkevich isotherm the d r equation allows to estimate the sorption energy which provides evidence about the sorption mechanism physical or chemical the present model can be written as eq 6 6 q e q m e b ε 2 where b is a constant related to the sorption energy mol2 kj 2 and ε is polanyi s sorption potential which is expressed as eq 7 7 ε r t ln 1 1 c e where r value is 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 t is the solution temperature k ce qe and qm are defined in a similar way as in the previous models the free energy of sorption e kj mol 1 can be obtained by eq 8 8 e 2 b 1 2 when the e value is between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the sorption process follows a chemical mechanism while e values 8 kj mol 1 suggest a physical sorption process 24 to select the isotherm model that best fits the experimental data and consequently allows a better description of the system r2 correlation coefficient and χ2 square chi were considered the mathematical model that best fits the data obtained experimentally will have a high r2 tending to 1 and a minimum χ 2 tending to 0 batch sorption capacities q mentioned previously for kinetic and equilibrium studies were calculated by eq 9 9 q c 0 c m s v where q is the sorption capacity of as v mg g 1 ms is the chitosan mass g v represents the suspension volume l c0 and c are the initial and final batch concentrations of as v mg l 1 respectively 2 1 6 up flow fixed bed adsorption process and modeling different known amounts of chitosan contained within polyurethane filters were packed inside the borosilicate glass columns 10 cm long and 2 cm of internal diameter until the desired height and packing density 1 0 mg l 1 as v solutions were pumped through the columns using a peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 at room temperature 25 c and ph 4 5 at different times samples were collected and as v effluent concentration was measured the as v sorption capacity qt was calculated with eq 10 10 q t m in m out m s c 0 v q 0 t c t dt m s qt represents as v uptake per unit mass of chitosan mg g 1 min and mout are the total amounts of as v input and output from the ﬁxed bed column mg ms is the dry mass of chitosan g c0 and c are the initial and efﬂuent contaminant concentrations mg l 1 v is the total volume of treated water l q is the volumetric ﬂow rate l min 1 and 0 t c t dt represents the elution profile area mg integration limits 0 and t are the times associated to 0 and 0 95 c c0 ratios respectively the elution profile area value multiplied by the volumetric flow rate represents the not retained as v mout min was calculated with eq 11 11 m in c 0 q t e 1000 where te min is the column saturation time when c c0 0 95 finally as v removal percentage r can be calculated with min and mout values through eq 12 12 r m in m out m in 100 thomas 25 yoon nelson 26 modified dose response 27 and bdst 28 models were used to fit the experimental data 2 1 7 experimental design the column height and volumetric flow rate effects were investigated using a rsm ccd of 13 runs in order to find the optimal conditions for as v removal via a continuous sorption process the statistical software design expert 7 0 stat ease inc usa was employed to determine the optimal parameters for the highest as v removal 29 a second order polynomial model function was used with the intention to correlate the response to the operational variables the full quadratic model is shown in eq 13 13 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i j 1 i j k β ij x i x j ε where y is the response β0 is the constant coefficient βi and βii are the linear and quadratic coefficients of the independent factor xi respectively βij is the interaction coefficient of the independent factors xi and ε is the model error the range and levels of the independent variables are presented in table 1 rsm experiments were carried out at as v 0 1 0 mg l 1 ph 4 5 and packing density 270 kg m 3 the bed height h and volumetric flow rate q evaluated ranges were 3 0 6 6 cm and 5 0 15 0 ml min 1 respectively to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed model analysis of variance anova was used and f test and p value were performed the model is considered statistically significant if a p value for a larger f value is lower than 0 05 95 confidence in addition the significance of the regression coefficients for each factor was tested with the standard error coefficient se coefficient t value and p value when the probability level is 5 p 0 05 the factor effect under study is significant 3d surface and contour graphs were applied to explore the relationship between dependent and independent variables 30 2 1 8 desorption studies desorption continuous processes are important because these make possible the contaminant recovery in a very small volume furthermore the repeated use of a sorbent minimizes the operational cost 31 in this study the desorption process was carried out at 1 0 ml min 1 using 0 1 m h2so4 as desorption reagent as v initial concentration was 1 0 mg l 1 and the bed column height was fixed at 6 6 cm with a packing density equal to 270 kg m 3 the sorption desorption cycles were repeated twice desorption efficiency d was calculated using eq 14 14 d m d m r m in 100 where md is the amount of pollutant desorbed and obtained from the area under the desorption curve mg min is the total mass of as v input from the previous sorption cycle mg mr is the amount of as v remaining in the sorbent after desorption mg calculated as min md in the first sorption cycle the sorbent is free of the contaminant therefore mr is 0 3 results 3 1 as v quantitative determination ascorbic acid reacts with mo vi to produce a complex which has a maximum absorption band at 810 nm fig s1 the ascorbic mo vi complex reaction was developed in 5 min however when antimony salts were added to the reaction medium the reaction rate was incremented changes in the absorbance measurements are presented in fig s2 finally the molybdenum as v reaction produces an increment in the molar absorptivity coefficient pointing out that pentavalent arsenic specie participates in the arsenomolybdate blue complex formation fig s3 shows a maximum band shift from 810 to 820 nm to 890 nm while the complex reaction takes place an increase and greater stability in absorbance values after 15 min were also evidenced this last property along with the use of a 10 0 cm optical path cuvette was essential to perform reproducible analytical measurements the ε obtained by this method into the experimental linear range 0 0050 0 50 mg l 1 has a value of 19 100 m 1 cm 1 quantification value 0 014 mg l 1 was lower than the argentina legislated value 0 050 mg l 1 and the detection limit found was equal to 0 0048 mg l 1 3 2 effect of ph on as v sorption at ph values from 3 0 to 6 0 the predominant arsenic specie in solution is h2aso4 anion 32 on the other hand ph of point zero charge phpzc of chitosan used in these studies is 6 3 33 when ph is lower than 6 3 the biopolymer presents a positive charge because nh2 groups are protonated based on these conclusions ph lower than 6 was a proper sorption condition for removing as v where arsenate ions with a negative charge are easily sorbed throughout electrostatic attraction by positively charged chitosan the experimental results are presented in fig s4 it can be observed that as v concentration decreases in 10 min remaining constant within the time 10 60 min and ph 3 0 6 0 ranges studied however the lowest concentration of arsenic in solution is achieved at ph between 4 0 and 5 0 at ph values near to the pka of chitosan as v removal probably decreases due to the loss of positive charges on the polymer to evaluate the influence of ph on arsenic sorption in more detail the ph range was delimited from 3 5 to 5 0 the optimal contact time was established in 15 min fig s5 shows a maximum as v removal obtained at ph 4 5 and the percentage of arsenic removed was 71 for this reason the optimal ph value for the following arsenic chitosan sorption studies was 4 5 at this ph as mentioned before there is a favourable electrostatic attraction between as v and chitosan allowing an efficient removal of arsenate ions 3 3 ft ir and xrd characterization chitosan xrd patterns fig 1 shows strong reﬂection signals characteristics of semi crystalline polymers at 2θ 11 6 19 04 and 23 45 34 after sorbent interaction with the arsenate solutions the typical chitosan diffraction peaks show an intensity reduction as a consequence of a more amorphous structure this behaviour is emphasized by the establishment of a new structure of the sorbent after as v removal it could be possible because intramolecular hydrogen bonds at the polymer are disrupted when the interaction between arsenate ions and amine groups occurs this allows a rearrangement of the polymer chains that result in a less crystalline phase similar results were observed by wang and colleagues 35 chitosan ft ir spectrum is presented in fig 2 the band at 3500 3400 cm 1 can be assigned to o h and n h stretching vibrations in the polysaccharide structure and to adsorbed water molecules a signal around 2900 cm 1 compatible with ch2 vibrations of the pyranose ring can be also observed 36 vibrations within 1660 1652 cm 1 are associated to c n axial deformation of the amide and amine functions and bands from 1150 to 1070 cmare typical of polysaccharide structures c o c n at 1416 cm 1 a band corresponding to the vibration of the oh groups are displayed the band at 1380 cm 1 arises from the stretching vibrations of the methyl presents in the residual acetamide groups 37 after as v sorption onto chitosan the intensity of the bands assigned to o h and n h stretching vibrations were slightly changed suggesting the participation of this group in the binding of as v to the sorbent also the intensity of the band assigned to the amide was changed suggesting the participation of this group in the interaction with as v at ph 4 5 chitosan is positively charged and could interact with h2aso4 ions through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bridges these interactions are weak compared to the formation of surface complexes promoting only modification in the intensities of the ft ir bands moreover vibration bands corresponding to the as o bond of arsenate molecules are located at 900 750 cm 1 and 500 400 cm 1 38 these bands only appear in the ft ir spectrum of chitosan after being treated with the as v solution therefore it can be confirmed that arsenic ions present in solution were retained onto the polymer surface after as v contact 3 4 kinetic study fig 3 shows qt versus t graph for as v retention on chitosan the kinetic parameters for each model are presented in table 2 a pronounced as v initial sorption was observed followed by a period of time where equilibrium sorption is reached the equilibrium reaction was rapidly established less than 5 min this result is very interesting because it allows the design of continuous bed sorption systems that could be appropriate to water treatment based on the correlation between experimental and calculated qe experimental data were better explained by the pseudo first order model it means that the mechanism involved in arsenate sorption would be physical in physical sorption the equilibrium is reached quickly and usually is reversible and sorbent sorbate interactions could occur throughout electrostatic attractions similar kinetic results for arsenic removal by chitosan were previously reported in the literature 39 3 5 equilibrium studies fig 4 shows the non linear fit of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the parameters of the each model and their values are summarized in table 3 the tabulated results indicate that the proposed models fitted the experimental data in a good approximation and high values of correlation coefficients were obtained however the χ2 and r2 values of langmuir suggest that this model would be the best describing the experimental data maximum sorption capacity for as v on chitosan was equal to 19 63 mg g 1 in addition the e value obtained from d r model was 7 10 kj mol 1 suggesting that the sorption process of as v by chitosan is physical finally considering the data derived from equilibrium kinetic fi tr and ph studies the arsenic sorption mechanism proposed is illustrated in fig s6 3 6 bed column experiments effect of flow rate volumetric flow rate was a significant variable affecting as v sorption in a continuous process three different flow rates were selected to show the effect on the as v elution profile 5 0 10 0 and 15 0 ml min 1 the height of the column bed and the ph were remained constant in 4 8 cm and 4 5 respectively fig 5 a shows that the breakthrough time as well as saturation time occurred more quickly with a higher flow rate because the sorption zone front reaches the column top in a shorter time in contrast a slower flow rate would provide longer residence times resulting in longer contact time 40 41 in addition the experimental data were better explained by modified dose response and thomas models fig 5b with higher r2 values tables s1 yoon nelson method does not describe the experimental data 3 7 effect of bed height fig 6 a shows the breakthrough and saturation time increments when the column bed height varies from 3 0 to 6 6 cm in this situation the sorption sites become higher increasing the chitosan sorption area and allowing an increment in the sorption capacity the slopes of the curves become flat which might be caused by a broader mass transfer zone 42 43 modified dose response and thomas models describe properly the experimental results while the use of yoon nelson model is not appropriate to fit the data fig 6b mathematical model parameters are presented in table s1 3 8 analysis of as v continuous sorption removal by rsm table 4 exhibits the experimental design data and the results for as v removal r as the variable response data were analysed with a second order model expression according to the pentavalent arsenic sorption parameters the tested variables in coded factors were eq 15 15 r 66 60 6 29 x 1 4 77 x 2 3 95 x 1 2 6 02 x 2 2 5 97 x 1 x 2 the predicted r values were very close to the experimental results and the relationship between the actual and predicted responses can be seen distributed relatively near to a straight line fig s7 analysis of variance table 5 indicated that the model f value 32 56 with a low probability value p 0 0001 has a high significance for the regression model determination coefficient r2 0 9588 and the insignificant lack of fit f value 2 05 indicated that the model was suitable to represent the real relationships among the selected parameters the values of predicted r2 0 7998 and adjusted r2 0 9293 were in reasonable agreement with the signal to noise ratio value 21 14 suggesting that the model can be used to describe the as v sorption process for a 0 05 level of significance no outliers were observed fig s8 furthermore the linear effect of the selected factor h and q was statistically significant p 0 05 however volumetric flow rate p 0 0003 and t value 6 69 showed stronger influence than column height which could also be assumed from the coefficient of each factor the interaction factor and quadratic effect were significant implying that there is a curve relation among h q and r 3 9 quantitative effects of the factors the column bed height and volumetric flow rate optimal values were 4 6 cm and 6 5 ml min 1 respectively and the predicted maximum value of as v removal was 76 8 at optimal conditions the model was validated average of three repeated experiments under those conditions a relatively close value of 77 2 0 8 was found 3d view and contour response surface plots are presented in fig 7 the optimum as v removal value obtained in this study was greater than the value achieved 68 3 when ground water was used in a same experimental ccd 33 in that case favourable interactions between coexisting oxyanions and chitosan affected the arsenic sorption process these anions compete for the cationic sites protonated nh2 groups present in the polymer and therefore a lower amount of arsenate ions could be removed by chitosan in addition we observed a reduction of no3 and po4 3 concentrations in the effluent and a conductivity decrease after water treatment 33 chen and chung also confirmed that presence of anions such as chloride and sulphate reduces the arsenate sorption onto chitosan at ph near 5 44 3 10 scale up studies bdst model was applied to carry out scale up studies 28 a linear function of the operation time with the bed depth could be expressed as eq 16 16 t n 0 c 0 υ z 1 k bdst c 0 ln c 0 c 1 17 z 0 υ k bdst n 0 ln c 0 c 1 where n0 is the adsorption capacity mg l 1 υ is the fluid velocity cm min 1 and kbdst is the kinetic constant l mg 1 min 1 using a fixed bed column at four c c0 ratios isoconcentration lines for as v sorption were analyzed fig 8 table s2 shows the kbdst and n0 values obtained at a low breakthrough condition some active sites remain free and n0 values are lower than the full chitosan bed capacity in addition a good fitting was achieved by inspection of the breakthrough curve at 50 where the logarithmic term is zero this result means that the used of the model for as v sorption process by chitosan is valid the critical bed depth z0 obtained by eq 17 was equal to 1 5 cm this is the minimum theoretical column bed height that produces at t 0 an outlet concentration lower than the breakthrough concentration 3 10 desorption studies fig 9 shows the graphics obtained for two regeneration cycles desorption curves present an asymmetric distribution with a strong initial increment in the released as v concentration the observed desorption efficiencies in the first and second cycle were 88 and 77 respectively r decreased very little at the second sorption cycle furthermore there was no evidence of bed height or particles size changes and the sorbent maintained its structural stability after two regeneration cycles this is an advantage of chitosan over other biomaterials which tend to decompose after several cycles of sorption desorption for example shakoor and colleagues reported that watermelon rind losses over 50 of the removal capacity after three cycles of arsenic sorption desorption 45 also shakoor and co authors studied the sorption of as v onto corn cob water chestnut shell java plum seed tea waste egg shell and pomegranate peel in this work they reported that these materials reduce their sorption capacity over 50 after two sorption desorption cycles 46 he and colleagues reported the use of iron impregnated biochar in the removal of as v 47 in that research work as v sorption was reduced to 63 after three sorption desorption cycles and this reduction was ascribed to the loss of sorption sites due to the degradation of superficial structures 4 conclusions in this work the main conclusions are the following an inexpensive and simple spectrophotometric method with an appropriate sensitivity was used to as v detection and quantification the qmax value 19 63 mg g 1 obtained suggests that the sorption process is favourable the value of 7 10 kj mol 1 for sorption energy and the kinetic data better explained by pseudo first order model indicate that the sorption mechanism is physical ft ir spectrum for the untreated chitosan sample exhibited the sorption characteristic bands of chitosan polymer the bands corresponding to the arsenate group were observed when the sorbent was treated with the as v solutions after as v sorption diffraction peaks in chitosan xrd pattern showed an intensity reduction because of modifications in the polymer structure a ccd rsm was successfully employed for the optimization of arsenic removal in a continuous sorption process in optimum experimental condition as v removal efficiency was 76 8 recovery of as v from columns was effectively performed after two regeneration cycles consequently the high as v removal efficiency and the low cost of chitosan highlight this biomaterial as a good sorbent to be implemented in continuous water treatments the possibility to use mathematical models for continuous processes is an important topic because sorption studies in fixed bed columns provide details that could serve for

vary in a range from 0 5 to 5000 μg l 1 4 6 the existence of a dose response relationship between arsenic consumption for long periods of time and cancer diabetes in people was proposed 7 arsenic induces cancer by mechanisms involving cytotoxicity and this is an accepted phenomenon supported by experimental evidence 8 this type of chronic poisoning primarily affects people with fewer resources and small or isolated populations which consume underground water without periodic analysis until now as has been eliminated using the following traditional technologies precipitation coagulation flocculation ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration in recent years sorption researches have focused on using natural sorbents in the removal of arsenic from water chitin is a long chain biopolymer obtained from the shrimp and crab shells 9 but its small sorption capacity limits its application as a sorbent in the treatment of contaminated water with arsenic 10 its most important derivative chitosan is produced by deacetylation in alkaline medium at temperatures above 60 c and has different properties from chitin 11 chitosan physical chemical characteristics such as the presence of a large amount of hydroxyl and amine groups nontoxicity biodegradability chemical stability chelation behaviour and selectivity towards metal ions make this polymer an attractive alternative to other biomaterials for as removal 12 14 good experimental designs are necessary for understanding complex situations of cause effect relationship a statistical design of experiments is the most effective way to make tests applying the scientific method with the intention of generating knowledge about a process by means of properly planned experiments 15 as v sorption behaviour onto chitosan biopolymer was evaluated in this work arsenic removal from aqueous solutions by batch and column system was examined batch studies were carried out in order to a select the optimal ph for as v removal b know if arsenic sorption on chitosan occurs slowly or quickly a fast sorption speed of the contaminant is a requirement to work with column systems c find out the mechanism of as v sorption through kinetic and equilibrium studies and d select suitable reagents for arsenic desorption that allow chitosan reuse langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models were selected to explain equilibrium sorption data while for kinetic sorption analysis pseudo ﬁrst and pseudo second order rate equations were used to define optimal operational parameters on which fixed bed columns packed with chitosan work effectively response surface methodology based on a ccd was used the use of factorial designs for arsenic continuous removal from water is not easily found in research works continuous sorption studies are required because they reflect more accurately the reality of the removal process providing evidences that could help to project an industrial scale sorption process for water treatments experimental breakthrough curves were fitted with thomas yoon nelson and modified dose response models sorbent recycle capacity was verified with two adsorption desorption cycles and continuous process scale up studies were achieved by applying bed depth service time bdst model the presence of arsenic on chitosan was confirmed by two spectroscopic techniques fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray diﬀ raction xrd analysis quantification of as v was carried out by modifying the traditional molybdenum blue method which is described in detail it should be noticed that the use of this methodology is extremely convenient because it allows to perform more controls in a shorter time to ensure the water quality for example in argentina small town laboratories do not have high tech equipment such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers special infrastructure or technicians specifically trained to measure arsenic concentration in water for these reasons the required controls are not usually carried out for long periods of time therefore affecting the local community furthermore this useful method has the sensitivity required by the current legislation 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification chitosan parafarm 70 particle size 100 μm was employed as received without chemical modification 2 1 1 as v detection and quantification molybdenum blue method 16 17 is a simple and economical procedure to determine as v traces in aqueous solutions therefore the quantitative determination of as v was carried out using this methodology with a self made modification moreover with the purpose of obtaining more data regarding the stability and reaction rate of molybdate arsenate complex absorbance measurements of the reagents involved in arsenic quantification were made each sample was acidified with 1 hcl and then treated with 14 0 sulfuric acid h2so4 3 0 ammonium heptamolybdate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 1 1 antimony potassium tartrate c4h4k2o6sb 1 2h2o and 11 0 ascorbic acid c6h8o6 in a 5 2 1 2 vol ratio and respecting that mixing order the absorbance was measured at 890 nm with a quartz cell of 10 cm light passage and a double beam jasco v 550 spectrophotometer as v concentration was calculated using eq 1 1 as v abs ε b f where abs is the sample absorbance ε is the molar absorptivity m 1 cm 1 b is the optical path cm and f is the dilution factor 2 1 2 ft ir and xrd analysis to identify the chemical functional groups present on chitosan and as v loaded biomaterial ft ir spectroscopy perkin elmer ft ir spectrum one spectrophotometer was performed ir absorbance data were obtained at 500 4000 cm 1 wave number range by the kbr dilution method 1 5 w w the xrd measurements were carried out in order to evaluate the semi crystallinity chitosan degree before and after as v treatment on a panalytical empyrean series x ray diﬀ ractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and cukα radiation 1 540598 å at current of 30 ma and voltage of 40 kv 2 1 3 effect of ph on as v sorption an important variable that can affect a sorption process is ph for example arsenic species present in a solution are a function of ph conditions moreover ph values have an important influence on the chitosan polymer properties and therefore the effect of ph on as v sorption by chitosan was studied batch experiments were performed at ph values ranged from 3 to 6 the initial arsenic concentration was 1 0 mg l 1 with a 5 0 g l 1 of chitosan dose the solutions were shaken at 75 rpm in a shaker at 25 c 2 1 4 kinetic study of as v sorption process kinetic is probably the most important factor during the design of a sorption system the kinetic study allows to determine the elimination speed of contaminants from the solution numerous kinetic models have been developed with different degrees of complexity to describe the mechanism through which the sorption process takes place the kinetic sorption was analysed in this study with two different models pseudo first order or lagergren model 18 and pseudo second order or ho and mckay model 19 described below pseudo first order model is probably one of the most commonly used to describe solutes sorption from a solution by a solid sorbent it can be expressed correctly in nonlinear form by eq 2 2 q t q e 1 e k 1 t the pseudo second order equation was initially developed to explain kinetic sorption of bivalent metals by sorbents although it was successfully used to describe the sorption of toxic ions in different oxidation states it is defined by eq 3 3 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 t k 2 q e where qe mg g 1 and qt mg g 1 are the sorption capacity at equilibrium and at any time t respectively k1 and k2 are the pseudo first order min 1 and the pseudo second order rate constants g mg 1 min 1 respectively the last model suggests that sorption capacity is related to the active sites filled by the sorbate which means that sorption reaction is principally governed by chemisorption during the kinetic test samples were taken at various times and the working conditions were as v concentration 0 5 mg l 1 chitosan dose 0 5 g l 1 ph 4 5 and t 5 c 2 1 5 arsenic equilibrium sorption study sorption isotherms describe how sorbates present in a solution interact with sorbents for this reason it is important to optimize their use in the sorption process thus a description of equilibrium data by theoretical or empirical equations becomes important for a practical and effective design of sorption systems in literature there are numerous models to study equilibrium sorption which provide information about sorbent affinity for toxic ions and allow to characterize the sorbent surface properties through the isotherm parameters isotherm models employed for experimental data fitting were langmuir 20 freundlich 21 and dubinin radushkevich d r 22 batch experimental conditions were t 25 c as v concentration 20 700 mg l 1 ph 4 5 chitosan dose 10 g l 1 contact time between sorbent and sorbate 15 min 2 1 5 1 langmuir isotherm this two parameter model has been one of the most studied for sorption experiments and is expressed in eq 4 4 q e b q m c e 1 b c e where qe is the sorption capacity mg g 1 and ce is the concentration of the sorbate in solution mg l 1 qm is the maximum sorption capacity for complete monolayer coverage mg g 1 and b is a constant related to the affinity between sorbent and sorbate particles l mg 1 2 1 5 2 freundlich isotherm freundlich empirical model is the second most used unlike the previous model it does not indicate a finite sorption capacity and it is used in a range of low to intermediate concentrations mathematically it is easier to handle than other models due to the relative simplicity of its expression eq 5 5 q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the freundlich constant related to the sorption capacity of the solid mg g 1 ce and qe are defined in a similar way to langmuir model the n constant describes the attraction level between sorbate and sorbent a favourable sorption tends to have a value of n from 1 to 10 a value of n close to 10 implies a strong interaction sorbent contaminant 23 2 1 5 3 dubinin radushkevich isotherm the d r equation allows to estimate the sorption energy which provides evidence about the sorption mechanism physical or chemical the present model can be written as eq 6 6 q e q m e b ε 2 where b is a constant related to the sorption energy mol2 kj 2 and ε is polanyi s sorption potential which is expressed as eq 7 7 ε r t ln 1 1 c e where r value is 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 t is the solution temperature k ce qe and qm are defined in a similar way as in the previous models the free energy of sorption e kj mol 1 can be obtained by eq 8 8 e 2 b 1 2 when the e value is between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the sorption process follows a chemical mechanism while e values 8 kj mol 1 suggest a physical sorption process 24 to select the isotherm model that best fits the experimental data and consequently allows a better description of the system r2 correlation coefficient and χ2 square chi were considered the mathematical model that best fits the data obtained experimentally will have a high r2 tending to 1 and a minimum χ 2 tending to 0 batch sorption capacities q mentioned previously for kinetic and equilibrium studies were calculated by eq 9 9 q c 0 c m s v where q is the sorption capacity of as v mg g 1 ms is the chitosan mass g v represents the suspension volume l c0 and c are the initial and final batch concentrations of as v mg l 1 respectively 2 1 6 up flow fixed bed adsorption process and modeling different known amounts of chitosan contained within polyurethane filters were packed inside the borosilicate glass columns 10 cm long and 2 cm of internal diameter until the desired height and packing density 1 0 mg l 1 as v solutions were pumped through the columns using a peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 at room temperature 25 c and ph 4 5 at different times samples were collected and as v effluent concentration was measured the as v sorption capacity qt was calculated with eq 10 10 q t m in m out m s c 0 v q 0 t c t dt m s qt represents as v uptake per unit mass of chitosan mg g 1 min and mout are the total amounts of as v input and output from the ﬁxed

flow rate represents the not retained as v mout min was calculated with eq 11 11 m in c 0 q t e 1000 where te min is the column saturation time when c c0 0 95 finally as v removal percentage r can be calculated with min and mout values through eq 12 12 r m in m out m in 100 thomas 25 yoon nelson 26 modified dose response 27 and bdst 28 models were used to fit the experimental data 2 1 7 experimental design the column height and volumetric flow rate effects were investigated using a rsm ccd of 13 runs in order to find the optimal conditions for as v removal via a continuous sorption process the statistical software design expert 7 0 stat ease inc usa was employed to determine the optimal parameters for the highest as v removal 29 a second order polynomial model function was used with the intention to correlate the response to the operational variables the full quadratic model is shown in eq 13 13 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i j 1 i j k β ij x i x j ε where y is the response β0 is the constant coefficient βi and βii are the linear and quadratic coefficients of the independent factor xi respectively βij is the interaction coefficient of the independent factors xi and ε is the model error the range and levels of the independent variables are presented in table 1 rsm experiments were carried out at as v 0 1 0 mg l 1 ph 4 5 and packing density 270 kg m 3 the bed height h and volumetric flow rate q evaluated ranges were 3 0 6 6 cm and 5 0 15 0 ml min 1 respectively to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed model analysis of variance anova was used and f test and p value were performed the model is considered statistically significant if a p value for a larger f value is lower than 0 05 95 confidence in addition the significance of the regression coefficients for each factor was tested with the standard error coefficient se coefficient t value and p value when the probability level is 5 p 0 05 the factor effect under study is significant 3d surface and contour graphs were applied to explore the relationship between dependent and independent variables 30 2 1 8 desorption studies desorption continuous processes are important because these make possible the contaminant recovery in a very small volume furthermore the repeated use of a sorbent minimizes the operational cost 31 in this study the desorption process was carried out at 1 0 ml min 1 using 0 1 m h2so4 as desorption reagent as v initial concentration was 1 0 mg l 1 and the bed column height was fixed at 6 6 cm with a packing density equal to 270 kg m 3 the sorption desorption cycles were repeated twice desorption efficiency d was calculated using eq 14 14 d m d m r m in 100 where md is the amount of pollutant desorbed and obtained from the area under the desorption curve mg min is the total mass of as v input from the previous sorption cycle mg mr is the amount of as v remaining in the sorbent after desorption mg calculated as min md in the first sorption cycle the sorbent is free of the contaminant therefore mr is 0 3 results 3 1 as v quantitative determination ascorbic acid reacts with mo vi to produce a complex which has a maximum absorption band at 810 nm fig s1 the ascorbic mo vi complex reaction was developed in 5 min however when antimony salts were added to the reaction medium the reaction rate was incremented changes in the absorbance measurements are presented in fig s2 finally the molybdenum as v reaction produces an increment in the molar absorptivity coefficient pointing out that pentavalent arsenic specie participates in the arsenomolybdate blue complex formation fig s3 shows a maximum band shift from 810 to 820 nm to 890 nm while the complex reaction takes place an increase and greater stability in absorbance values after 15 min were also evidenced this last property along with the use of a 10 0 cm optical path cuvette was essential to perform reproducible analytical measurements the ε obtained by this method into the experimental linear range 0 0050 0 50 mg l 1 has a value of 19 100 m 1 cm 1 quantification value 0 014 mg l 1 was lower than the argentina legislated value 0 050 mg l 1 and the detection limit found was equal to 0 0048 mg l 1 3 2 effect of ph on as v sorption at ph values from 3 0 to 6 0 the predominant arsenic specie in solution is h2aso4 anion 32 on the other hand ph of point zero charge phpzc of chitosan used in these studies is 6 3 33 when ph is lower than 6 3 the biopolymer presents a positive charge because nh2 groups are protonated based on these conclusions ph lower than 6 was a proper sorption condition for removing as v where arsenate ions with a negative charge are easily sorbed throughout electrostatic attraction by positively charged chitosan the experimental results are presented in fig s4 it can be observed that as v concentration decreases in 10 min remaining constant within the time 10 60 min and ph 3 0 6 0 ranges studied however the lowest concentration of arsenic in solution is achieved at ph between 4 0 and 5 0 at ph values near to the pka of chitosan as v removal probably decreases due to the loss of positive charges on the polymer to evaluate the influence of ph on arsenic sorption in more detail the ph range was delimited from 3 5 to 5 0 the optimal contact time was established in 15 min fig s5 shows a maximum as v removal obtained at ph 4 5 and the percentage of arsenic removed was 71 for this reason the optimal ph value for the following arsenic chitosan sorption studies was 4 5 at this ph as mentioned before there is a favourable electrostatic attraction between as v and chitosan allowing an efficient removal of arsenate ions 3 3 ft ir and xrd characterization chitosan xrd patterns fig 1 shows strong reﬂection signals characteristics of semi crystalline polymers at 2θ 11 6 19 04 and 23 45 34 after sorbent interaction with the arsenate solutions the typical chitosan diffraction peaks show an intensity reduction as a consequence of a more amorphous structure this behaviour is emphasized by the establishment of a new structure of the sorbent after as v removal it could be possible because intramolecular hydrogen bonds at the polymer are disrupted when the interaction between arsenate ions and amine groups occurs this allows a rearrangement of the polymer chains that result in a less crystalline phase similar results were observed by wang and colleagues 35 chitosan ft ir spectrum is presented in fig 2 the band at 3500 3400 cm 1 can be assigned to o h and n h stretching vibrations in the polysaccharide structure and to adsorbed water molecules a signal around 2900 cm 1 compatible with ch2 vibrations of the pyranose ring can be also observed 36 vibrations within 1660 1652 cm 1 are associated to c n axial deformation of the amide and amine functions and bands from 1150 to 1070 cmare typical of polysaccharide structures c o c n at 1416 cm 1 a band corresponding to the vibration of the oh groups are displayed the band at 1380 cm 1 arises from the stretching vibrations of the methyl presents in the residual acetamide groups 37 after as v sorption onto chitosan the intensity of the bands assigned to o h and n h stretching vibrations were slightly changed suggesting the participation of this group in the binding of as v to the sorbent also the intensity of the band assigned to the amide was changed suggesting the participation of this group in the interaction with as v at ph 4 5 chitosan is positively charged and could interact with h2aso4 ions through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bridges these interactions are weak compared to the formation of surface complexes promoting only modification in the intensities of the ft ir bands moreover vibration bands corresponding to the as o bond of arsenate molecules are located at 900 750 cm 1 and 500 400 cm 1 38 these bands only appear in the ft ir spectrum of chitosan after being treated with the as v solution therefore it can be confirmed that arsenic ions present in solution were retained onto the polymer surface after as v contact 3 4 kinetic study fig 3 shows qt versus t graph for as v retention on chitosan the kinetic parameters for each model are presented in table 2 a pronounced as v initial sorption was observed followed by a period of time where equilibrium sorption is reached the equilibrium reaction was rapidly established less than 5 min this result is very interesting because it allows the design of continuous bed sorption systems that could be appropriate to water treatment based on the correlation between experimental and calculated qe experimental data were better explained by the pseudo first order model it means that the mechanism involved in arsenate sorption would be physical in physical sorption the equilibrium is reached quickly and usually is reversible and sorbent sorbate interactions could occur throughout electrostatic attractions similar kinetic results for arsenic removal by chitosan were previously reported in the literature 39 3 5 equilibrium studies fig 4 shows the non linear fit of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the parameters of the each model and their values are summarized in table 3 the tabulated results indicate that the proposed models fitted the experimental data in a good approximation and high values of correlation coefficients were obtained however the χ2 and r2 values of langmuir suggest that this model would be the best describing the experimental data maximum sorption capacity for as v on chitosan was equal to 19 63 mg g 1 in addition the e value obtained from d r model was 7 10 kj mol 1 suggesting that the sorption process of as v by chitosan is physical finally considering the data derived from equilibrium kinetic fi tr and ph studies the arsenic sorption mechanism proposed is illustrated in fig s6 3 6 bed column experiments effect of flow rate volumetric flow rate was a significant variable affecting as v sorption in a continuous process three different flow rates were selected to show the effect on the as v elution profile 5 0 10 0 and 15 0 ml min 1 the height of the column bed and the ph were remained constant in 4 8 cm and 4 5 respectively fig 5 a shows that the breakthrough time as well as saturation time occurred more quickly with a higher flow rate because the sorption zone front reaches the column top in a shorter time in contrast a slower flow rate would provide longer residence times resulting in longer contact time 40 41 in addition the experimental data were better explained by modified dose response and thomas models fig 5b with higher r2 values tables s1 yoon nelson method does not describe the experimental data 3 7 effect of bed height fig 6 a shows the breakthrough and saturation time increments when the column bed height varies from 3 0 to 6 6 cm in this situation the sorption sites become higher increasing the chitosan sorption area and allowing an increment in the sorption capacity the slopes of the curves become flat which might be caused by a broader mass transfer zone 42 43 modified dose response and thomas models describe properly the experimental results while the use of yoon nelson model is not appropriate to fit the data fig 6b mathematical model parameters are presented in table s1 3 8 analysis of as v continuous sorption removal by rsm table 4 exhibits the experimental design data and the results for as v removal r as the variable response data were analysed with a second order model expression according to the pentavalent arsenic sorption parameters the tested variables in coded factors were eq 15 15 r 66 60 6 29 x 1 4 77 x 2 3 95 x 1 2 6 02 x 2 2 5 97 x 1 x 2 the predicted r values were very close to the experimental results and the relationship between the actual and predicted responses can be seen distributed relatively near to a straight line fig s7 analysis of variance table 5 indicated that the model f value 32 56 with a low probability value p 0 0001 has a high significance for the regression model determination coefficient r2 0 9588 and the insignificant lack of fit f value 2 05 indicated that the model was suitable to represent the real relationships among the selected parameters the values of predicted r2 0 7998 and adjusted r2 0 9293 were in reasonable agreement with the signal to noise ratio value 21 14 suggesting that the model can be used to describe the as v sorption process for a 0 05 level of significance no outliers were observed fig s8 furthermore the linear effect of the selected factor h and q was statistically significant p 0 05 however volumetric flow rate p 0 0003 and t value 6 69 showed stronger influence than column height which could also be assumed from the coefficient of each factor the interaction factor and quadratic effect were significant implying that there is a curve relation among h q and r 3 9 quantitative effects of the factors the column bed height and volumetric flow rate optimal values were 4 6 cm and 6 5 ml min 1 respectively and the predicted maximum value of as v removal was 76 8 at optimal conditions the model was validated average of three repeated experiments under those conditions a relatively close value of 77 2 0 8 was found 3d view and contour response surface plots are presented in fig 7 the optimum as v removal value obtained in this study was greater than the value achieved 68 3 when ground water was used in a same experimental ccd 33 in that case favourable interactions between coexisting oxyanions and chitosan affected the arsenic sorption process these anions compete for the cationic sites protonated nh2 groups present in the polymer and therefore a lower amount of arsenate ions could be removed by chitosan in addition we observed a reduction of no3 and po4 3 concentrations in the effluent and a conductivity decrease after water treatment 33 chen and chung also confirmed that presence of anions such as chloride and sulphate reduces the arsenate sorption onto chitosan at ph near 5 44 3 10 scale up studies bdst model was applied to carry out scale up studies 28 a linear function of the operation time with the bed depth could be expressed as eq 16 16 t n 0 c 0 υ z 1 k bdst c 0 ln c 0 c 1 17 z 0 υ k bdst n 0 ln c 0 c 1 where n0 is the adsorption capacity mg l 1 υ is the fluid velocity cm min 1 and kbdst is the kinetic constant l mg 1 min 1 using a fixed bed column at four c c0 ratios isoconcentration lines for as v sorption were analyzed fig 8 table s2 shows the kbdst and n0 values obtained at a low breakthrough condition some active sites remain free and n0 values are lower than the full chitosan bed capacity in addition a good fitting was achieved by inspection of the breakthrough curve at 50 where the logarithmic term is zero this result means that the used of the model for as v sorption process by chitosan is valid the critical bed depth z0 obtained by eq 17 was equal to 1 5 cm this is the minimum theoretical column bed height that produces at t 0 an outlet concentration lower than the breakthrough concentration 3 10 desorption studies fig 9 shows the graphics obtained for two regeneration cycles desorption curves present an asymmetric distribution with a strong initial increment in the released as v concentration the observed desorption efficiencies in the first and second cycle were 88 and 77 respectively r decreased very little at the second sorption cycle furthermore there was no evidence of bed height or particles size changes and the sorbent maintained its structural stability after two regeneration cycles this is an advantage of chitosan over other biomaterials which tend to decompose after several cycles of sorption desorption for example shakoor and colleagues reported that watermelon rind losses over 50 of the removal capacity after three cycles of arsenic sorption desorption 45 also shakoor and co authors studied the sorption of as v onto corn cob water chestnut shell java plum seed tea waste egg shell and pomegranate peel in this work they reported that these materials reduce their sorption capacity over 50 after two sorption desorption cycles 46 he and colleagues reported the use of iron impregnated biochar in the removal of as v 47 in that research work as v sorption was reduced to 63 after three sorption desorption cycles and this reduction was ascribed to the loss of sorption sites due to the degradation of superficial structures 4 conclusions in this work the main conclusions are the following an inexpensive and simple spectrophotometric method with an appropriate sensitivity was used to as v detection and quantification the qmax value 19 63 mg g 1 obtained suggests that the sorption process is favourable the value of 7 10 kj mol 1 for sorption energy and the kinetic data better explained by pseudo first order model indicate that the sorption mechanism is physical ft ir spectrum for the untreated chitosan sample exhibited the sorption characteristic bands of chitosan polymer the bands corresponding to the arsenate group were observed when the sorbent was treated with the as v solutions after as v sorption diffraction peaks in chitosan xrd pattern showed an intensity reduction because of modifications in the polymer structure a ccd rsm was successfully employed for the optimization of arsenic removal in a continuous sorption process in optimum experimental condition as v removal efficiency was 76 8 recovery of as v from columns was effectively performed after two regeneration cycles consequently the high as v removal efficiency and the low cost of chitosan highlight this biomaterial as a good sorbent to be implemented in continuous water treatments the possibility to use mathematical models for continuous processes is an important topic because sorption studies in fixed bed columns provide details that could serve for

14231,the btex compounds have potential pollution with serious risk to the environment and human health in this study batch and continuous bioreactors using biofilms supported on activated carbon particles were studied to remove btex compounds the activated sludge from local wastewater treatment plant was adapted to biodegrade btex compounds and used in this work the obtained results showed that the biofilm well adapted with the evaluated conditions and was able to conduct a complete degradation of btex compounds additionally particles samples demonstrated higher bacteria content ranging from 79 40 toluene to 8 84 mgvss l o xylene of biomass amount kinetic parameters were obtained in a batch bioreactor fed daily with btex compounds the tests showed that the biomass in the bioreactor was able to remove the btex compounds up to 300 min showing a potential strategy for the petrochemical industry in addition compared to the initial toxicity after the treatment a reduction in the acute toxicity up to 99 was observed confirm the potentiality of the proposed system in this study keywords biodegradation biofilm btex removal environment 1 introduction the toxic compounds removal has been driving the researchers to find new technologies more efficient and low cost processes by reducing installation units high flexibility and good performance 1 4 the liquid effluents from petroleum refineries contain several organic contaminants notably benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes known as btex which high toxicity representing a serious risk to the environment and to human health 5 8 these compounds are listed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as priority chemicals due to the toxic properties with a maximum limit at 5 μg g in drinkable water for benzene 9 11 biological treatment is efficient and potentially alternative for toxic compounds treatment mainly due to the low residues production reducing the risk of future contamination 1 12 14 however biological treatment is limited due to the toxicity of some compounds or the formation of partially oxidized products that can even be more toxic and mutagenic than the initial contaminant making the biodegradation process slower particularly for high contaminant concentrations 15 16 the advances in the biological treatment of effluents have been achieved by using biofilm supported on inert materials 1 17 18 the development of a biofilm provides the microorganisms important benefits such as increased nutrients concentration at liquid biofilm interfaces since the polymeric matrix favors the adsorption of nutrient molecules in addition the biofilm provides protection against harsh environmental factors such as ph salt and heavy metal dehydration shearing forces aggressive chemical substances bactericides antibiotics possibility to exchange of genetic material due to the long microorganism retention times and the establishment of symbiotic relations 13 19 22 the biodegradation of btex compounds has been extensively studied by many researchers 6 8 9 23 25 in order to identify the substrates degradation the main reasons of the interaction effects synergistic and or antagonistic during the btex compounds biodegradation can be attributed to the competitive inhibition 26 toxicity and formation of toxic by products 27 28 and enzyme induction 23 29 dou et al 30 studied the interactions in the anaerobic biodegradation of btex compounds the authors observed that low concentrations of m xylene increase the degradation of benzene but at high concentrations of m xylene the same was not observed the toluene addition stimulates the degradation of o xylene while ethylbenzene addition inhibited the degradation of o xylene when the concentration of btex mixtures was higher than 150 mg l the degradation of benzene o xylene m xylene and p xylene was inhibited vogel and alvarez 31 measured the biodegradation for individually binary and ternary mixtures of benzene toluene and para xylene by two pure cultures of bacteria pseudomonas sp cfs 215 and arthrobacter sp hcb and the mixture of the cultures the authors observed cases of non interaction competitive inhibition and co metabolism the toluene degradation was faster when individually compared with binary and ternary mixtures suggesting the same metabolic way and thus competitive inhibition on the other hand arthrobacter was unable to degrade toluene and para xylene individually and in mixtures the degradation of these compounds occurred only in the presence of benzene suggesting that co metabolism was responsible for the beneficial effect otênio et al 32 evaluated the biodegradation of btex compounds by pseudomonas putida ccmi 852 and reported that the culture was able to metabolize toluene and p xylene but not benzene the toluene was degraded at a rate twice higher than p xylene jo et al 27 evaluated the synergistic and antagonistic effects during biodegradation of the btex compounds using a mixed culture of microorganisms and showed that by increasing the xylene concentration was possible to increase the btex removal based on these relevant aspects this study address to develop a low cost system able to biodegrade btex using immobilize microorganisms from an effluent treatment station on activated carbon as support thus the

mineral solution ms used to culture biomass was prepared by macro and micronutrients according to described by shim and yang 33 the ph of ms solution was adjusted to 7 0 using a buffer solution due to the high volatility of btex compounds an oxygen source of h2o2 30 by mass was used 33 for the activated sludge adaptation called biomass and biofilm formation 14 g of activated carbon particles 180 ml of ms 50 ml of activated sludge 150 mg l of sucrose and 30 μl of hydrogen peroxide added to each erlenmeyer flask called bioreactor the bioreactors were placed to a horizontal shaker logen scientific model ls 4500 at 120 rpm at 25 c for the biofilm formation the bioreactors were daily fed by removing 100 ml of the bioreactor solution and adding 100 ml of ms and 150 mg l of sucrose single carbon source added to bioreactors each 12 h 100 μl of hydrogen peroxide was added to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration do 2 mg l after 20 days the adaptation of the biofilm by btex compounds started by gradual replacement the sucrose source by btex compounds at the first 10 days the bioreactor was daily fed with 90 of sucrose and 10 of btex for the next 10 days the btex carbon source was increased to 20 and the sucrose reduced to 80 then the btex carbon source was increased by 20 every 10 days until reach 100 all the bioreactors were daily feed by replacing 100 ml of the solution in the bioreactor by a new solution 100 μl of hydrogen peroxide and 150 mg l of the btex compounds evaluated in the respective bioreactor this procedure was carried out for 30 days and the kinetic of biodegradation were evaluated the adaptation step is necessary once the btex compounds have high toxicity and the adaptation can prevent the possible death or eventual microorganism inhibition chemical oxygen demand cod analysis were daily performed to determine the sucrose consumption according to the standards adopted by the american public health association standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 34 the btex concentration was determined after complete replacement of sucrose by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a uv vis detector model 437 b at 254 nm a 250 mm reverse phase nucleosil c18 column with an internal diameter of 4 6 mm methanol hplc grade carlo erba and milliq water 80 20 was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min a calibration curve for each btex was carried out in a concentration range from 5 a 100 ppm r2 0 998 all samples were filtrated in a polyester filter 0 20 μm before the analysis and diluted in a methanol solution 50 50 methanol to milliq water in order to improve the btex compounds solubility 2 2 kinetic assays to carry out the biodegradation kinetics the whole solution from the bioreactor was removed and the activated carbon particles were filtered to remove the non adhered activated sludge suspension sludge after that 20 g of activated carbon particles with adhered biofilm bioparticles 280 ml of mineral solution 100 μl of hydrogen peroxide and 80 mg l of btex compounds were added to each bioreactor at regular sampling intervals aliquots of 0 5 ml were taken off from each bioreactor to analyze the compound concentration the system was kept at 25 c 120 rpm and do 2 mg l in order to evaluate the btex lost by volatilization during the kinetics assays a control reactor containing only the mineral solution ms hydrogen peroxide and 80 mg l of each compound was prepared and monitored during the kinetics assays the btex concentration was determined by hplc according to methodology already described above in this study in order to avoid the substrate interactions witch can alter degradation rates of individual contaminants either synergistically or antagonistically the btex compounds were evaluated separately the kinetic parameters were obtained michaelis menten model eq 1 involving a single substrate reaction 1 r r max s k m s where r is the substrate removal rate m l3 t1 rmax is the maximum substrate removal rate m l3 t1 km is the michaelis menten half saturation coefficient m l3 and s is the substrate concentration m l3 2 3 adsorption assays in order to study the adsorption of btex by the activated carbon particles instead of biodegradation at the first step adsorption test was carried out to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon particles without biofilm the adsorption isotherms of btx compounds were performed at 25 c and 120 rpm in a range of activated carbon mass from 0 1 to 1 g the btx concentration 80 mg l was kept constant for each evaluated compound the erlenmeyer flasks were sealed in order to avoid evaporation and shaken for 24 h to ensure the equilibrium the adsorption capacity qe expressed as the amount of btx adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g was calculated by langmuir isotherm eq 2 2 q e k l q m a x c e 1 k l c e where ce is the solute concentration at equilibrium mg l qe is the amount of btx adsorbed at equilibrium mg g qmax is the monolayer capacity of the adsorbent mg g and kl is the langmuir adsorption constant related to the energy of adsorption l mg in order to verify if the bioparticles were adsorbing instead of biodegrading the compounds 60 mg l of each btx compound placing in a batch bioreactor containing 12 g of already adapted bioparticles the bioreactor was sampled every 12 h to determine the btx concentration the btx concentration was determined by hplc 2 4 btx biodegradation in continuous system btx compounds biodegradation was also evaluated in a continuous system using a glass column with 3 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length with 7 sampling points distributed across the column the column was filled with 351 g of bioparticles already adapted to the btex 160 g of dry activated carbon particles without biofilm a peristaltic pump gilson miniplus 3 was used to circulate the mineral solution hydrogen peroxide and btx compounds at regular sampling intervals aliquots were taken off from the column to analyze the compounds concentration for the continuous process it was evaluated the interference of the feed flow in the btx removal the btx concentration was determined by hplc 2 5 biomass quantification the biomass was measured by protein concentration lowry method according to the methodology described by lowry et al 35 the biomass adhered to the support was extracted with a naoh 1 n solution at 80 c and 5 min in an ultrasound bath 1 the procedure was also carried out for the activated carbon particles without biomass standard to express the biomass in terns of mgvss l the volatile suspended solids vss for the biomass in suspension in the bioreactor was determinate according to american public health association standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 34 2 6 acute toxicity assays the acute toxicity assays were carried out according to the methodology described by baumer et al 36 using microcrustaceans daphnia magna 6 24 h of life not fed during the test period briefly the sample was tested under 6 dilutions ratio 2 each dilution was prepared in duplicate with 25 ml of test solution placed in a beaker with 10 organisms and incubated for 48 h at room temperature after 48 h the number of immobile organisms was determined the organisms were considered immobile if not showed any mobility during 20 s of observation monthly d magna organisms were evaluated by sensitivity test against potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 as standard in order to guarantee the validity of the performed tests the results were expressed in terms of dilution factor df equivalent to the lowest dilution in which the immobility is higher than 10 dilution water was prepared according to the iso 6341 methodology 37 a negative control was carried out in parallel using dilution water 2 7 morphological analysis morphological analysis was carried out using scanning electron microscope philips model xl 30 to verify the biofilm formation on the particles the samples were prepared by using hexamethyldisilazane hmds according to the methodology proposed by nation 38 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of parameters for biomass adaptation before starting the btex compounds biodegradation assay biofilm formation on the activated carbon particles and biofilm adaptation microorganisms adhered to the particles was carried out this procedure became necessary once the activated sludge used was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant then as soon as the bioreactors were assembled with the addition of activated carbon activated sludge nutrients solution and h2o2 it was fed sucrose as the major carbon source the biofilm formation was analyzed daily by cod to evaluate the sucrose consumption by the biomass the cod results performed during the biomass adaptation period using sucrose as a carbon source showed an average reduction of 74 after 24 h after the adaptation period the sucrose was gradually replaced by btex compound 60 of sucrose and 40 of btex and an average reduction of 62 was observed indicating that the microorganisms present in the bioreactor were adapted to the btex medium oxygen peroxide was added to the medium 100 μl every 12 h to ensure enough oxygen for the microorganisms to consume all the organic content in the bioreactor the h2o2 amount was chosen after verify that the oxygen concentration remained above 2 mg l and the aerobic degradation of the compounds was guarantee shim and yang 33 also studied the biodegradation of volatile compounds with the addition of hydrogen peroxide as the source of oxygen and obtained good results without the interference of oxygen in the process this type of unconventional oxygenation was chosen to avoid volatilization and consequently loss of btex to the environment after biofilm adaptation period the biodegradation kinetics of btex compounds and the cell concentration in each bioreactor was evaluated through protein analysis to certify the presence of microorganisms table 1 shows the average of protein content in the biomass in suspension and biofilm from the bioreactors after benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene biodegradation it can be observed that the protein content was higher for toluene since toluene had lower toxicity to the biofilm compared to the mixture of toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene similar results were reported by abuhamed et al 39 the authors evaluated the effect of pseudomonas putida f1 700007 atcc adaptation and biodegradation of benzene toluene and phenol the authors found that cell growth using toluene and benzene as carbon sources was faster than when phenol was used in order to quantify the protein concentration per microorganism it was assumed that all the microorganisms present in the biofilm were from the same species as those in suspension then a biomass in suspension taken off from the bioreactor was analyzed in terms of proteins and vss and it was obtained 89 29 mg of protein l corresponding to 390 mg of vss l thus the biomass amount in vss per gram of support in each bioreactor was 49 97 79 40 11 88 and 8 84 for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene respectively equivalent to 45 85 72 48 10 80 and 8 06 mgvss l respectively the biomass content observed for the studied activated carbon can be related to the high specific surface area 1012 m2 g for particles with average diameter of 5 8 mm when compared to the sand less than 0 1 m2 g for particles with average diameter of 2 mm for example 3 40 bertin et al 12 studied the biodegradation of industrial effluent using activated charcoal and obtained an immobilized biomass yield of 37 24 mg per gram of dry support analyzing the results obtained in this work it can be verified that the cells immobilized in the coal were similar to that reported by bertin et al 12 demonstrating that activated carbon was effective for biofilm formation and could be used in wastewater treatment plant with btex compounds from the sem images fig 1 a thin biofilm with similar bacterial morphology on the external surface of the particles was observed most of the surface has been colonized with actively dividing rod cells however there are zones yet to be colonized perhaps the adherence of microorganisms to the carbon particles may be explained by the fact that these particles have high internal porosity as well as great roughness of the external surface harendranath et al 41 also attribute the formation of biofilms to these characteristics due to the high available area for microbial colonization high biomass retention capacity and consequently high performance in the bioreactor thus from the results it was confirmed that the activated carbon is an efficient alternative support for the biomass adaptation and biofilm formation at this point it is important to mention that as the microorganism was from an activated sludge taken off from a municipal wastewater treatment station the presence of different type of microorganism it was expected thus the biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon mixtures becomes more effective when different types of microorganisms are used considering that a single species can show lower efficiency in the biodegradation due to some metabolism restriction 28 3 2 kinetic study of btex degradation batch mode before biodegradation kinetics assays an adsorption study of the btx compounds in the activated carbon without the biofilm with a sequenced feed evaluation in a bioreactor was carried out these observations were necessary to rule out the possibility of adsorption of btex compounds rather than biodegradation which was not desired in this work adsorption isotherms parameters and correlation coefficient r2 of benzene toluene and o xylene compounds fitted to the langmuir model are shown in table 2 from the results it was observed that the adsorption isotherms were fitted well by the langmuir model it can be observed that the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained for o xylene which has a higher structure higher molecular weight and lower solubility in water followed by toluene and benzene according to daifullah and girgis 42 the adsorption of the btx compounds is favored by decreasing the solubility and increasing molecular mass clarifying the obtained result another test to verify the adsorption process was performed sampling the bioreactor containing the bioparticles activated carbon biofilm before the feed step this bioreactor was fed with 180 mg l btx 60 mg l each every 12 h for 4 days the results showed that after 96 h of operation the concentration of btx compounds did not increase during the feeding step these results confirm that the btex reduction occurs only by the biodegradation process and not by adsorption once that 1620 mg l of btx was added to the bioreactor and the saturation point of activated carbon particles is 404 mg l thus for the next steps the effect of adsorption contribution was neglected in addition through the control reactor the volatilization of btex compounds was also neglected since the concentration of the compounds in the control reactor remained constant over the experiment time after verifying that the predominant process was biodegradation kinetic batch assays were carried out to determine the biodegradation time required for each compound as well as to obtain the kinetic parameters the kinetic study fig 2 and michaelis menten kinetic parameters of each compound in an individual bioreactor over the time for the batch process are shown in table 2 based on the results it was verified that the biomass was able to degrade all compounds present in the bioreactor and the maximal reduction for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene was observed after 300 250 350 and 350 min respectively in addition from fig 2 it was observed that the reaction rate was proportional to the substrate concentration from the results table 2 it is found that the michaelis menten model well fitted to the experimental data since the correlation coefficient r2 was higher than 0 90 for all compounds it was also observed that the higher degradation rate rma was obtained for toluene followed by benzene o xylene and ethylbenzene higher biomass concentration in the reactor 18 179 mg gsupport for toluene compared to 2 719 mg gsupport for ethylbenzene table 1 can be associated to the higher efficiency shim and yang 33 evaluated the biodegradation of btex compounds in a bioreactor by pseudomonas putida and p fluorescens immobilized in a fibrous matrix under hypoxic conditions the authors obtained degradation rate values of 0 025 0 0208 0 015 and 0 0080 mg l s and half saturation coefficient of 600 462 236 and 80 mg l respectively for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene with a biomass content of 2 2 mgvss l lower results to the reported in this work mohammed and allayla 43 studied the biodegradation of btex compounds in batch mode with sand particles and obtained a degradation rate of 1 21 10 4 1 07 10 4 and 0 98 10 4 mg l s for benzene toluene and o xylene respectively and a half saturation coefficient ka of 30 mg l for all the compounds these results are close to that found in the present work but different from those obtained by shim and yang 33 possibly due to the fact that the authors employed pure cultures with lower substrate affinity the half saturation coefficient ka is related to the biofilm substrate and high values can negatively affect the biodegradation of the compounds 44 according to song et al 45 the half saturation coefficient is strongly dependent on the type of microorganisms and on the physiological stages when the degradation rate is compared with the reported results in the literature it is important to mention that the quality of biomass is also an important characteristic to be evaluated 1 6 13 3 3 study of btx degradation fixed bed column the results for the btx compounds removal by biodegradation process using a fixed bed column with biofilm for different concentrations and feed flow rates are shown in fig 3 the btx compounds in the mixture are biodegraded by the previously adapted biofilm with a more accentuated reduction at the beginning of the column fig 3a shows that o xylene is the compound with the lower biodegradation by the microorganisms followed by benzene and toluene it was also verified that for the studied initial concentration 40 mg l of each compound and high flow rate 5 0 ml min the btx concentration at the end of the column remaining high requiring an increase in the bioreactor length or the reduction of the flow rate thus fig 3b shows the btx removal for different initial concentration of benzene 78 mgb l toluene 58 mgt l and o xylene 29 mgx l with a flow rate of 3 0 ml min the results showed that o xylene was more resistant to biodegradation than toluene and benzene and that the biofilm preferentially consumed toluene compared to o xylene and benzene corroborating to the batch tests deeb and alvarez cohen 23 evaluated three different cultures two pure and one mixture of pure culture and showed that all cultures were able to completely biotransform btex compounds and reported a biodegradation order as follow toluene benzene ethylbenzene and ortho meta para xylene the authors related that the pure cultures are not able to biodegrade simultaneously and efficiently all btex compounds the authors concluded that the mixture of cultures was more efficient than the pure culture in the mineralization of btex compounds and the results can be related to the presence of different microbial species allowing the use of several metabolic pathways as well also the effects of synergism between species similar results as reported by deeb and alvarez cohen 23 were obtained in this work demonstrating that biomass obtained from the wastewater treatment plant was efficiently adapted to biodegrade the btex compounds these results indicate that microorganisms are able to adapt and survive to different conditions 3 4 evaluation of acute toxicity in order to verify if the studied procedure was also efficient in term of toxicity reducing the btex compounds collected from each bioreactor after the btex biodegradation period approximately 6 h after feeding were evaluated against daphnia magna table 3 the brazilian federal law 46 establish a maximal dilution factor limit df as 2 for the petrochemical effluents where dilution factor higher than 2 are considered toxic the results indicate that all treated btex compounds analyzed had acute toxicity as observed see table 3 o xylene was the most toxic compound and toluene the lowest toxicity after the treatment process these results are in accordance with the compounds removal since the o xylene showed the lower removal by the biofilm however it is important to note the reduction of the acute toxicity after treatment process becoming less toxic peng et al 47 examined the growth rate morphological changes and chlorophyll contents in e gracilis treated with single and the mixture of btex and observed that btex induced morphological change lipofuscin formation and decreased of chlorophyll content in addition the authors reported that the toxicity of individual btex on cell growth and chlorophyll inhibition is in the order of xylenes ethylbenzene toluene benzene in some cases the toxicity of an effluent after treatment can be related to the formation of toxic intermediary compounds from the microorganism pathway as in the biodegradation of toluene where intermediates such as benzoic acid and phenolic compounds with biocide activity catechol is the intermediate most commonly formed during the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and it can be completely degraded through cleavage of the aromatic ring 29 48 these intermediate compounds may be produced during the btex compounds biodegradation suggesting that in a sludge sewage treatment an additional polishing process is required to remove the intermediates or to increase the residence time of these compounds in order to reduce the toxicity after the treatment 4 conclusions in this study the kinetic parameters of the btex compounds were obtained in a batch bioreactor containing activated carbon with immobilized biomass from the results the biomass was able to degrade the btex compounds in the bioreactor in a concentration of 49 97 79 40 11 88 and 8 84 mg of cells per gram of support for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene respectively in addition the experiments carried out in the column approach showed high efficiency the results indicate that the processes reduce the acute toxicity ranging from 93 to 99 after studied treatment the formation of intermediary compounds remaining after the treatment of the synthetic effluent may be responsible for the toxicity based on the results presented in this work was verified that the removal of toxic compounds presents in petrochemical effluents using biofilms immobilized on activated carbon showed good efficiency and the process could be used as one of the stages in the liquid effluents treatment plant from petroleum refineries declaration of competing interest all authors agreed that there is no

14231,the btex compounds have potential pollution with serious risk to the environment and human health in this study batch and continuous bioreactors using biofilms supported on activated carbon particles were studied to remove btex compounds the activated sludge from local wastewater treatment plant was adapted to biodegrade btex compounds and used in this work the obtained results showed that the biofilm well adapted with the evaluated conditions and was able to conduct a complete degradation of btex compounds additionally particles samples demonstrated higher bacteria content ranging from 79 40 toluene to 8 84 mgvss l o xylene of biomass amount kinetic parameters were obtained in a batch bioreactor fed daily with btex compounds the tests showed that the biomass in the bioreactor was able to remove the btex compounds up to 300 min showing a potential strategy for the petrochemical industry in addition compared to the initial toxicity after the treatment a reduction in the acute toxicity up to 99 was observed confirm the potentiality of the proposed system in this study keywords biodegradation biofilm btex removal environment 1 introduction the toxic compounds removal has been driving the researchers to find new technologies more efficient and low cost processes by reducing installation units high flexibility and good performance 1 4 the liquid effluents from petroleum refineries contain several organic contaminants notably benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes known as btex which high toxicity representing a serious risk to the environment and to human health 5 8 these compounds are listed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as priority chemicals due to the toxic properties with a maximum limit at 5 μg g in drinkable water for benzene 9 11 biological treatment is efficient and potentially alternative for toxic compounds treatment mainly due to the low residues production reducing the risk of future contamination 1 12 14 however biological treatment is limited due to the toxicity of some compounds or the formation of partially oxidized products that can even be more toxic and mutagenic than the initial contaminant making the biodegradation process slower particularly for high contaminant concentrations 15 16 the advances in the biological treatment of effluents have been achieved by using biofilm supported on inert materials 1 17 18 the development of a biofilm provides the microorganisms important benefits such as increased nutrients concentration at liquid biofilm interfaces since the polymeric matrix favors the adsorption of nutrient molecules in addition the biofilm provides protection against harsh environmental factors such as ph salt and heavy metal dehydration shearing forces aggressive chemical substances bactericides antibiotics possibility to exchange of genetic material due to the long microorganism retention times and the establishment of symbiotic relations 13 19 22 the biodegradation of btex compounds has been extensively studied by many researchers 6 8 9 23 25 in order to identify the substrates degradation the main reasons of the interaction effects synergistic and or antagonistic during the btex compounds biodegradation can be attributed to the competitive inhibition 26 toxicity and formation of toxic by products 27 28 and enzyme induction 23 29 dou et al 30 studied the interactions in the anaerobic biodegradation of btex compounds the authors observed that low concentrations of m xylene increase the degradation of benzene but at high concentrations of m xylene the same was not observed the toluene addition stimulates the degradation of o xylene while ethylbenzene addition inhibited the degradation of o xylene when the concentration of btex mixtures was higher than 150 mg l the degradation of benzene o xylene m xylene and p xylene was inhibited vogel and alvarez 31 measured the biodegradation for individually binary and ternary mixtures of benzene toluene and para xylene by two pure cultures of bacteria pseudomonas sp cfs 215 and arthrobacter sp hcb and the mixture of the cultures the authors observed cases of non interaction competitive inhibition and co metabolism the toluene degradation was faster when individually compared with binary and ternary mixtures suggesting the same metabolic way and thus competitive inhibition on the other hand arthrobacter was unable to degrade toluene and para xylene individually and in mixtures the degradation of these compounds occurred only in the presence of benzene suggesting that co metabolism was responsible for the beneficial effect otênio et al 32 evaluated the biodegradation of btex compounds by pseudomonas putida ccmi 852 and reported that the culture was able to metabolize toluene and p xylene but not benzene the toluene was degraded at a rate twice higher than p xylene jo et al 27 evaluated the synergistic and antagonistic effects during biodegradation of the btex compounds using a mixed culture of microorganisms and showed that by increasing the xylene concentration was possible to increase the btex removal based on these relevant aspects this study address to develop a low cost system able to biodegrade btex using immobilize microorganisms from an effluent treatment station on activated carbon as support thus the biodegradation kinetics from the batch bioreactor was evaluated to obtain the btex compounds biodegradation profile in a fixed bed column using adapted biofilms supported on activated carbon particles in addition toxicity assays were carried out after the treatment to evaluated the process efficiency and confirm the toxic potential of btex compounds 2 material and methods 2 1 biosorption and

tests the results were expressed in terms of dilution factor df equivalent to the lowest dilution in which the immobility is higher than 10 dilution water was prepared according to the iso 6341 methodology 37 a negative control was carried out in parallel using dilution water 2 7 morphological analysis morphological analysis was carried out using scanning electron microscope philips model xl 30 to verify the biofilm formation on the particles the samples were prepared by using hexamethyldisilazane hmds according to the methodology proposed by nation 38 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of parameters for biomass adaptation before starting the btex compounds biodegradation assay biofilm formation on the activated carbon particles and biofilm adaptation microorganisms adhered to the particles was carried out this procedure became necessary once the activated sludge used was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant then as soon as the bioreactors were assembled with the addition of activated carbon activated sludge nutrients solution and h2o2 it was fed sucrose as the major carbon source the biofilm formation was analyzed daily by cod to evaluate the sucrose consumption by the biomass the cod results performed during the biomass adaptation period using sucrose as a carbon source showed an average reduction of 74 after 24 h after the adaptation period the sucrose was gradually replaced by btex compound 60 of sucrose and 40 of btex and an average reduction of 62 was observed indicating that the microorganisms present in the bioreactor were adapted to the btex medium oxygen peroxide was added to the medium 100 μl every 12 h to ensure enough oxygen for the microorganisms to consume all the organic content in the bioreactor the h2o2 amount was chosen after verify that the oxygen concentration remained above 2 mg l and the aerobic degradation of the compounds was guarantee shim and yang 33 also studied the biodegradation of volatile compounds with the addition of hydrogen peroxide as the source of oxygen and obtained good results without the interference of oxygen in the process this type of unconventional oxygenation was chosen to avoid volatilization and consequently loss of btex to the environment after biofilm adaptation period the biodegradation kinetics of btex compounds and the cell concentration in each bioreactor was evaluated through protein analysis to certify the presence of microorganisms table 1 shows the average of protein content in the biomass in suspension and biofilm from the bioreactors after benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene biodegradation it can be observed that the protein content was higher for toluene since toluene had lower toxicity to the biofilm compared to the mixture of toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene similar results were reported by abuhamed et al 39 the authors evaluated the effect of pseudomonas putida f1 700007 atcc adaptation and biodegradation of benzene toluene and phenol the authors found that cell growth using toluene and benzene as carbon sources was faster than when phenol was used in order to quantify the protein concentration per microorganism it was assumed that all the microorganisms present in the biofilm were from the same species as those in suspension then a biomass in suspension taken off from the bioreactor was analyzed in terms of proteins and vss and it was obtained 89 29 mg of protein l corresponding to 390 mg of vss l thus the biomass amount in vss per gram of support in each bioreactor was 49 97 79 40 11 88 and 8 84 for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene respectively equivalent to 45 85 72 48 10 80 and 8 06 mgvss l respectively the biomass content observed for the studied activated carbon can be related to the high specific surface area 1012 m2 g for particles with average diameter of 5 8 mm when compared to the sand less than 0 1 m2 g for particles with average diameter of 2 mm for example 3 40 bertin et al 12 studied the biodegradation of industrial effluent using activated charcoal and obtained an immobilized biomass yield of 37 24 mg per gram of dry support analyzing the results obtained in this work it can be verified that the cells immobilized in the coal were similar to that reported by bertin et al 12 demonstrating that activated carbon was effective for biofilm formation and could be used in wastewater treatment plant with btex compounds from the sem images fig 1 a thin biofilm with similar bacterial morphology on the external surface of the particles was observed most of the surface has been colonized with actively dividing rod cells however there are zones yet to be colonized perhaps the adherence of microorganisms to the carbon particles may be explained by the fact that these particles have high internal porosity as well as great roughness of the external surface harendranath et al 41 also attribute the formation of biofilms to these characteristics due to the high available area for microbial colonization high biomass retention capacity and consequently high performance in the bioreactor thus from the results it was confirmed that the activated carbon is an efficient alternative support for the biomass adaptation and biofilm formation at this point it is important to mention that as the microorganism was from an activated sludge taken off from a municipal wastewater treatment station the presence of different type of microorganism it was expected thus the biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon mixtures becomes more effective when different types of microorganisms are used considering that a single species can show lower efficiency in the biodegradation due to some metabolism restriction 28 3 2 kinetic study of btex degradation batch mode before biodegradation kinetics assays an adsorption study of the btx compounds in the activated carbon without the biofilm with a sequenced feed evaluation in a bioreactor was carried out these observations were necessary to rule out the possibility of adsorption of btex compounds rather than biodegradation which was not desired in this work adsorption isotherms parameters and correlation coefficient r2 of benzene toluene and o xylene compounds fitted to the langmuir model are shown in table 2 from the results it was observed that the adsorption isotherms were fitted well by the langmuir model it can be observed that the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained for o xylene which has a higher structure higher molecular weight and lower solubility in water followed by toluene and benzene according to daifullah and girgis 42 the adsorption of the btx compounds is favored by decreasing the solubility and increasing molecular mass clarifying the obtained result another test to verify the adsorption process was performed sampling the bioreactor containing the bioparticles activated carbon biofilm before the feed step this bioreactor was fed with 180 mg l btx 60 mg l each every 12 h for 4 days the results showed that after 96 h of operation the concentration of btx compounds did not increase during the feeding step these results confirm that the btex reduction occurs only by the biodegradation process and not by adsorption once that 1620 mg l of btx was added to the bioreactor and the saturation point of activated carbon particles is 404 mg l thus for the next steps the effect of adsorption contribution was neglected in addition through the control reactor the volatilization of btex compounds was also neglected since the concentration of the compounds in the control reactor remained constant over the experiment time after verifying that the predominant process was biodegradation kinetic batch assays were carried out to determine the biodegradation time required for each compound as well as to obtain the kinetic parameters the kinetic study fig 2 and michaelis menten kinetic parameters of each compound in an individual bioreactor over the time for the batch process are shown in table 2 based on the results it was verified that the biomass was able to degrade all compounds present in the bioreactor and the maximal reduction for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene was observed after 300 250 350 and 350 min respectively in addition from fig 2 it was observed that the reaction rate was proportional to the substrate concentration from the results table 2 it is found that the michaelis menten model well fitted to the experimental data since the correlation coefficient r2 was higher than 0 90 for all compounds it was also observed that the higher degradation rate rma was obtained for toluene followed by benzene o xylene and ethylbenzene higher biomass concentration in the reactor 18 179 mg gsupport for toluene compared to 2 719 mg gsupport for ethylbenzene table 1 can be associated to the higher efficiency shim and yang 33 evaluated the biodegradation of btex compounds in a bioreactor by pseudomonas putida and p fluorescens immobilized in a fibrous matrix under hypoxic conditions the authors obtained degradation rate values of 0 025 0 0208 0 015 and 0 0080 mg l s and half saturation coefficient of 600 462 236 and 80 mg l respectively for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene with a biomass content of 2 2 mgvss l lower results to the reported in this work mohammed and allayla 43 studied the biodegradation of btex compounds in batch mode with sand particles and obtained a degradation rate of 1 21 10 4 1 07 10 4 and 0 98 10 4 mg l s for benzene toluene and o xylene respectively and a half saturation coefficient ka of 30 mg l for all the compounds these results are close to that found in the present work but different from those obtained by shim and yang 33 possibly due to the fact that the authors employed pure cultures with lower substrate affinity the half saturation coefficient ka is related to the biofilm substrate and high values can negatively affect the biodegradation of the compounds 44 according to song et al 45 the half saturation coefficient is strongly dependent on the type of microorganisms and on the physiological stages when the degradation rate is compared with the reported results in the literature it is important to mention that the quality of biomass is also an important characteristic to be evaluated 1 6 13 3 3 study of btx degradation fixed bed column the results for the btx compounds removal by biodegradation process using a fixed bed column with biofilm for different concentrations and feed flow rates are shown in fig 3 the btx compounds in the mixture are biodegraded by the previously adapted biofilm with a more accentuated reduction at the beginning of the column fig 3a shows that o xylene is the compound with the lower biodegradation by the microorganisms followed by benzene and toluene it was also verified that for the studied initial concentration 40 mg l of each compound and high flow rate 5 0 ml min the btx concentration at the end of the column remaining high requiring an increase in the bioreactor length or the reduction of the flow rate thus fig 3b shows the btx removal for different initial concentration of benzene 78 mgb l toluene 58 mgt l and o xylene 29 mgx l with a flow rate of 3 0 ml min the results showed that o xylene was more resistant to biodegradation than toluene and benzene and that the biofilm preferentially consumed toluene compared to o xylene and benzene corroborating to the batch tests deeb and alvarez cohen 23 evaluated three different cultures two pure and one mixture of pure culture and showed that all cultures were able to completely biotransform btex compounds and reported a biodegradation order as follow toluene benzene ethylbenzene and ortho meta para xylene the authors related that the pure cultures are not able to biodegrade simultaneously and efficiently all btex compounds the authors concluded that the mixture of cultures was more efficient than the pure culture in the mineralization of btex compounds and the results can be related to the presence of different microbial species allowing the use of several metabolic pathways as well also the effects of synergism between species similar results as reported by deeb and alvarez cohen 23 were obtained in this work demonstrating that biomass obtained from the wastewater treatment plant was efficiently adapted to biodegrade the btex compounds these results indicate that microorganisms are able to adapt and survive to different conditions 3 4 evaluation of acute toxicity in order to verify if the studied procedure was also efficient in term of toxicity reducing the btex compounds collected from each bioreactor after the btex biodegradation period approximately 6 h after feeding were evaluated against daphnia magna table 3 the brazilian federal law 46 establish a maximal dilution factor limit df as 2 for the petrochemical effluents where dilution factor higher than 2 are considered toxic the results indicate that all treated btex compounds analyzed had acute toxicity as observed see table 3 o xylene was the most toxic compound and toluene the lowest toxicity after the treatment process these results are in accordance with the compounds removal since the o xylene showed the lower removal by the biofilm however it is important to note the reduction of the acute toxicity after treatment process becoming less toxic peng et al 47 examined the growth rate morphological changes and chlorophyll contents in e gracilis treated with single and the mixture of btex and observed that btex induced morphological change lipofuscin formation and decreased of chlorophyll content in addition the authors reported that the toxicity of individual btex on cell growth and chlorophyll inhibition is in the order of xylenes ethylbenzene toluene benzene in some cases the toxicity of an effluent after treatment can be related to the formation of toxic intermediary compounds from the microorganism pathway as in the biodegradation of toluene where intermediates such as benzoic acid and phenolic compounds with biocide activity catechol is the intermediate most commonly formed during the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and it can be completely degraded through cleavage of the aromatic ring 29 48 these intermediate compounds may be produced during the btex compounds biodegradation suggesting that in a sludge sewage treatment an additional polishing process is required to remove the intermediates or to increase the residence time of these compounds in order to reduce the toxicity after the treatment 4 conclusions in this study the kinetic parameters of the btex compounds were obtained in a batch bioreactor containing activated carbon with immobilized biomass from the results the biomass was able to degrade the btex compounds in the bioreactor in a concentration of 49 97 79 40 11 88 and 8 84 mg of cells per gram of support for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene respectively in addition the experiments carried out in the column approach showed high efficiency the results indicate that the processes reduce the acute toxicity ranging from 93 to 99 after studied treatment the formation of intermediary compounds remaining after the treatment of the synthetic effluent may be responsible for the toxicity based on the results presented in this work was verified that the removal of toxic compounds presents in petrochemical effluents using biofilms immobilized on activated carbon showed good efficiency and the process could be used as one of the stages in the liquid effluents treatment plant from petroleum refineries declaration of competing interest all authors agreed that there is no

14232,acidic mine drainage is known to have a low ph and contain high concentrations of heavy metals and constitute a serious risk for the receiving environment because of the fact that factors affecting the formation and mineralogy of acidic mine drainage vary a lot treatment of it is difficult and costly in this study the treatment of acidic mine drainage together with the ph neutralization and metal precipitation fe cu co mn zn ni in two stage ethanol fed up flow anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor were investigated the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 30 c at a hrt of 1 day for 245 days the cod so4 2 mass ratio was 0 67 0 87 sulfide and alkalinity produced in the reactor were recycled to a pre treatment unit where ph was neutralized and metals were precipitated throughout the study up to 4000 mg l sulfate was added to feed and the effluent sulfate was 325 9 75 mg l corresponding to 91 25 removal the feed was contained 400 mg l fe 200 mg l cu 50 mg l co mn zn and ni and over 87 fe over 98 cu co zn and ni and 49 mn removals were achieved in the pre treatment unit the remaining metals were also filtered in the sulfidogenic reactor this study demonstrated that by setting a reactor configuration ph neutralization metal precipitation as well as sulfate reduction can be achieved in two stage reactor system keywords sulfate reduction acidic mine drainage metal precipitation ph neutralization 1 introduction acidic mine drainage amd is formed during mining activities by the contact of sulfate and metal containing minerals i e pyrite with water and air they are characterized by low ph and high metal and sulfate content amd formation by pyrite oxidation is shown in the following reaction 1 1 2fes2 7 o2 2 h2o 2 fe2 4 so4 2 4 h as a result acidic drainages with high metal and sulfate are formed some metals that may be present in amd can be toxic or low ph of amd may damage the ecological balance in the receiving environment in the mine drainage at a mining site located in elazığ turkey low ph 3 04 together with 391 60 mg l fe 44 9 2 8 mg l cu 8 99 0 48 mg l co and varying concentrations of ni cd and mn were reported 2 amd treatment is generally based on the neutralization of its ph and the precipitation of metals active and passive abiotic methods such as lime addition or diverting amd to an anoxic lime bed for neutralization of low ph are used in amd treatment 3 in this way neutralization of the ph is achieved and metals are precipitated in metal hydroxide forms at elevated phs aerobic wetlands compost reactors permeable reactive barriers package bed oxidizing bioreactors and sulfate reducing bioreactors are among the traditional treatment methods used for the neutralization of amd and the precipitation of metals 4 however new bioprocesses emerged in recent years allowing sulfate reduction in column reactors with separate precipitation of metals 5 6 and even membrane processes for higher efficiency amd treatment 7 8 the treatment of amd in a sulfate reducing bioreactor is based on the reduction of sulfate to sulfide in the presence of an electron donor in this process alkalinity is also produced as an example ethanol based sulfate reduction is presented below 9 2 2c2h5oh 3 so4 2 4hco3 3 hs h 2h2o the sulfate reduction process has a number of advantages in the treatment of amd the neutralization of the acidic ph of amd can be achieved by the produced alkalinity additionally metals in the amd can be precipitated in metal sulfide form by produced sulfide 10 metal sulfide formation is shown in reaction 3 3 h2s m2 ms 2h formation of sulfide is very useful in metal precipitation in comparison to hydroxide precipitation of metals metal sulfide precipitation has several advantages for example metal sulfides have a very low solubility over a broad range of ph and they are more dense and stable compared to metal hydroxide sludge additionally utilization of sulfide when amd contains complexes and chelating agents is more useful and effective 1 metal sulfide precipitation is largely dependent on the ph of the water for example in ph 2 the dissolved concentration of cus in water approximately lower than 0 001 mg l whereas 0 10 mg l cds 1 mg l pbs 6 mg l zns and 100 mg l nis can be dissolved at this ph at neutral phs the dissolved concentrations of cus cds zns was lower than 0 001 mg l whereas the dissolved concentration of nis was approximately 0 01 11 at decreasing ph values higher sulfide concentrations are required to initiate metal sulfide precipitation even small changes in ph lead to a significant change in the required sulfide concentration for example in a study the total required sulfide concentration at ph 2 5 for the initiation of 120 mg l iron precipitation is 280 mg l while at ph 2 26 required sulfide increases to 845 mg l 6 similarly in another study to precipitate 100 mg l zn the total required sulfide concentrations for ph 1 87 and 1 75 were 3 and 5 2 mg l respectively 5 the amount of sulfide required to start metal precipitation in the amd may increase dramatically when the acidic ph of amd increased the optimum ph value for many known sulfate reducing species is around 7 12 and many species are inhibited at acidic phs many species are inhibited at ph 5 5 13 therefore various engineering solutions are required to prevent the direct contact of amd with microorganisms directly introducing amd into the reactor may result in poor performance in the reactor anaerobic baffled reactors can be used to solve this problem in column reactors in a study with four chamber anaerobic baffled reactor acidic ph 3 and various concentrations of metal co cu fe mn ni and zn containing amd was treated successfully however the effluent ph and alkalinity of the 1 st compartment were found to be 4 5 and below detectable level respectively while the majority of the metals were precipitated in the 1 st compartment 14 for column reactors this can be achieved with a high recycle ratio in this way the wastewater may be neutralized before entering the reactor but the accumulation of metals in the reactor in the form of metal sulfide is inevitable in a study conducted by sahinkaya et al metals in the real amd were kept along the reactor filling material in order to reduce the effect of low ph the reactor was operated at high recycle rate and fluidized 2 in more recent studies different reactor configurations have also been used 15 17 godoi et al used a downstream fixed bed reactor to prevent the accumulation of metal in the reactor bed in the study the free cross sectional area provided in the reactor bed prevented the accumulation of excess biomass in the reactor while the metal sulfide precipitates were separated from the reactor 18 apart from above mentioned studies amd treatment has been studied in continuously stirred tank reactors 19 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors 20 off line sulfidogenic bioreactors 21 fixed bed reactor 22 and permeable reactive barriers 23 most of these studies were conducted with synthetic amd because the composition of real amd could vary a lot especially in ph and metal content amds with low phs and having a mixed metal composition is still needed to study in the market there are several companies working on sulfate reduction and metal precipitation with biogenic sulfide for example paques biotechnology netherlands https en paques nl is working on sulfate reduction and metal recovery from waste streams and several successful applications in the field 24 one of the full scale applications is as follows sulfate and metal containing water first pumped into the anaerobic sulfidogenic reactor and produced sulfide is used to form metal sulfides in the effluent of the reactor excess sulfide is then processed in a second aerobic reactor to form elemental sulfur in order to remove sulfide from the effluent the treated water is then recycled to system influent to provide alkalinity in some of the applications for example the one in the pueblo viejo mine is located in the dominican republic sulfur containing feed together with some electron donors were processed in a bioreactor to form h2s gas and this gas was used to precipitate metals in the waste streams to form metal sulfides a coarse cost estimated was conducted by foucher et al 2001 based on the composition of chessy mine effluent 5 m3 h flow rate according to their calculations the operating cost without personnel was 30000 usd and the investment cost was 450000 usd the benefit associated with cus and zns production was 12000 usd and shows that the process was not economically feasible however since that times the studies show that the costs could be reduced by optimizing the system parameters as foucher et al predicted for example activated sludge as carbon source was utilized in a study to reduce operational costs 25 although the total costs associated with the amd treatment are high they are still low in comparison with the costs of cleaning spills after environmental spills due to the requirement for the protection of bacteria from acidic nature of amd and metal precipitation separate from sulfidogenic reactor new reactor configurations are needed in this study the hypothesis was the alkalinity produced in sulfidogenic reactor can be used to neutralize the acidic amd additionally while neutralizing the amd before the sulfidogenic reactor metals could be precipitated with the biogenic sulfide hence neutral and non metal containing amd could be treated in a sulfidogenic reactor in an efficient way amd treatment was carried out in a two stage reactor system metals contained in the amd were precipitated in a pre treatment unit prior to sulfate reducing bioreactor the neutralization of the extremely acidic water ph 2 was also carried out prior to the reactor necessary sulfide and alkalinity were provided from the reactor 2 materials and method 2 1 the experimental setup the research question in this study was the effective ph neutralization and mixed metal precipitation in a pre settling tank metal sulfide precipitation is highly ph dependent and different metal sulfides precipitate in different ph ranges it was aimed to elevate the ph from 2 to neutral levels in a pre settling tank during this elevation each metal sulfide forms are expected to precipitate in relevant ph therefore a laboratory scale anaerobic up flow column reactor made of glass was used as sulfate reducing bioreactor additionally a pre treatment unit was placed prior to the reactor the schematic representation of the experimental set up is given in fig 1 the column reactor 7 cm internal diameter and 40 cm height has a working volume of 500 ml aquarium sand 1 2 mm was used as reactor filling material the reactor was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the phototrophic growth the volume of the pre treatment unit was 250 ml and the reactors were operated in a temperature controlled room at 35 c a recycle pipe and pump were connected to recycle the sulfide and alkalinity produced in the sulfidogenic reactor to the pre treatment unit a desulfurization unit aeration was installed after the sulfidogenic reactor similar to that operated in previous studies 14 the volume of desulfurization unit was 1 l and aerated at a flow rate of 187 5 3 12 ml min 2 2 the operational conditions the reactor was inoculated with a sludge obtained from an anaerobic digester treating pulp and paper industry wastewater for more than 300 days the sulfidogenic reactor was operated for 245 days during the study hydraulic retention time hrt was kept constant at 1 day and an adjustable peristaltic pump ismatec compact pump 2 channels 60 rpm 230 vac was used to pump 500 ml of synthetic amd per day the reactor was supplied with ethanol as electron and carbon source the system was operated in 4 different operating conditions table 1 sulfate reduction conditions were provided at period 1 in this period sulfate reducing bacteria in the reactor was expected to adapt to the environment in the period 2 pre treatment unit was mounted and ph was reduced to represent amd additionally ethanol in the feed was increased by 30 in the third stage metals fe co cu mn zn and ni were added to feed and a coarse filter with a pore size of 20 30 μm was installed between the pre treatment unit and the reactor to filter the un precipitated metal sulfide forms in the 4th period sulfate and cod were increased to produce higher sulfide and alkalinity in the reactor and a desulfurization unit was installed to control the effluent sulfide from the system throughout the study the synthetic amd was prepared by adding the required amounts of mgso4 7h2o naso4 kh2po4 nh4cl ascorbic acid and yeast extract to the tap water the reactors were sampled three times a week for sulfate cod alkalinity and dissolved sulfide and metal analyses the feed was also sampled once a week for measurement of the same parameters except for dissolved sulfide 2 3 analytical conditions prior to the all analyzes the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm 3024 rfc for 10 min with rotanta 460s centrifuge hanna instruments ph 211 ph meter was used for ph measurement alkalinity was measured according to method 2320 b described in standard methods 26 in order to remove sulfide in the cod measurements the ph was decreased to 2 with h2so4 and samples were aerated for 5 min chemical oxygen demand was measured according to 5220 a closed reflux titrimetric method method described in standard methods 26 sulfate was measured at 420 nm using a turbidimetric method at spectrophotometer merck spectroquant pharo 100 27 total sulfide was measured spectrophotometrically at 480 nm by the method described by cord ruwisch 28 total and dissolved metal samples were measured by coupled plasma spectrometry with relevant wavelengths for each metal icp oes optical emission spectrometer perkins elmer optima 8000 the detection limit was 0 01 mg l samples of dissolved metal were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane syringe filter and then acidified with hcl to reduce ph below 1 5 for total metal samples samples were first acidified and then filtered through 0 45 μm identification of the precipitates formed in the pre treatment unit was done with wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry panalytical axios advanced 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor acclimation period 1 in the first period of the study sulfate reduction process was aimed to reach equilibrium the influent sulfate and cod concentrations were 2000 and 1340 mg l corresponding to cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 the influent and effluent sulfate concentrations are presented in fig 2 accordingly in the first 20 day period the influent and effluent sulfate was 2069 5 163 67 and 1359 16 248 23 mg l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 32 in the following days the effluent sulfate concentration decreased further to 713 10 249 48 mg l at the end of the period 64 35 removal efficiency the alkalinity in the reactor is also shown in fig 2 in the first period the influent ph was 7 02 1 52 and the average alkalinity was 134 37 38 15 mg l caco3 throughout the first period effluent alkalinity was increased gradually at the beginning of the study 810 16 mg l caco3 alkalinity increased to 1746 181 mg l caco3 at the end of the first period in parallel with the sulfate and alkalinity concentrations the sulfide in the reactor followed a steady upward trend because sulfide can be adsorbed on various surfaces including reactor filling material low concentration of sulfide 97 3 40 63 mg l was measured in the start up period and its concentration was increased to 583 95 176 29 mg l at the end of the period the average sulfide concentration during the entire period was 290 88 60 12 mg l cod removal efficiency increased during the first period and its concentration decreased to 313 6 73 84 mg l at the end of the period 76 96 removal efficiency the average effluent cod concentration during the period was 592 7 316 58 mg l ethanol is an attractive electron source high sulfate reduction rates have been reported in studies using ethanol bekmezci et al obtained 88 sulfate removal rate in an anaerobic baffled reactor at 3 5 g l influent sulfate concentrations and 0 737 cod so4 2 mass ratio 14 similarly sahinkaya et al obtained 90 sulfate removal in fluidized bed reactor at 2 5 g l influent sulfate conditions and 0 85 cod so4 2 mass ratio 2 there are different acclimatization regimes in the literature for different reactor configurations and different inoculums very fast acclimization period is reported by duyar et al 2018 over 90 sulfate reduction is observed even in the initial days of reactor operation with ethanol based anaerobic baffled reactor hrt 1 day influent sulfate 1500 mg l 29 in another recent study sahinkaya et al 2018 operated anaerobic membrane bioreactor and 90 sulfate removal was achieved within 45 days of operation hrt 2 days influent sulfate was 2000 mg l 7 in another study two column reactors were operated in parallel and during 70 days of operation 2000 mg l influent sulfate was decreased to 1457 352 and 1397 310 mg l for acetate and ethanol based reactors respectively 9 3 2 ph neutralization by a pre treatment unit period 2 in the second period of the study ph was reduced to 2 in order to represent real acidic mine drainage in studies with real amd ph levels in the range of 2 3 to 3 have been reported 15 however due to the low tolerance of the sulfate reducing bacteria to the acidic ph 13 a pre treatment unit was placed prior to the reactor in this period for the neutralization of the ph by recycling water from the reactor to this pre treatment unit ph neutralization is provided with the produced alkalinity in the result of sulfate reduction the phs of system s influent and pre treatment unit s effluent in this period were 2 0 38 and 6 46 0 88 respectively the feed was not containing alkalinity and the alkalinity was increased to 322 252 mg l caco3 in the effluent of pre treatment unit in this period the cod in the feed was partially oxidized without entering the reactor due to the retention in the pretreatment unit data not presented for this reason cod so4 2 ratio was increased to 0 87 by increasing the influent cod by 30 in this period pre treatment unit influent and effluent sulfide concentrations were also monitored and the presence of sufficient sulfide in the case of metal precipitation was monitored for the following periods in this period the sulfide concentration in the effluent of the reactor was 218 99 mg l while the pre treatment effluent sulfide was diluted with the system feed to 87 7 39 1 mg l levels the cod entering the system during this period was 1740 mg l and the effluent cod was 577 2 287 mg l corresponding to 67 36 removal efficiency the sulfide entering the reactor after the pre treatment unit was 88 33 2 and it was increased to 218 9 99 1 in the reactor effluent likewise the alkalinity after the pretreatment unit was 322 2 252 1 mg l and at the reactor effluent this alkalinity increased to 901 1 272 2 thus it was determined that the required alkalinity and sulfide were produced in the subsequent periods for the metal precipitation from amd there are several strategies in some of the studies separate precipitation was applied 5 however this is only possible if certain metal groups are present in the wastewater the solubilities of metal sulfide compounds are ph dependent and hence separate metal recovery is possible with the ph adjustment while cus can precipitate at ph 2 other metals remain soluble at this ph combine precipitation is another option in the literature there are studies for the separate precipitation of copper and zinc 5 iron 6 and nickel 9 in precipitation units however these studies are based only on the sequential precipitation of two metals in addition an inert gas is required to transfer sulfide to cu precipitation unit 10 yıldız et al aerated the sulfidogenic reactor effluent and transported sulfide to metal precipitation unit however due to the high solubility of sulfide at neutral phs acid addition required to decrease the ph and solubility to transfer more sulfide to metal precipitation 9 the optimum ph for most known sulfate reducing bacteria is around 7 12 many species are inhibited even at ph 5 5 in order to eliminate these disadvantages of the srbs ph neutralization must be performed although some acid tolerant species were also identified 30 31 these species may require a long time to become dominant xingyu et al studied the sulfate reduction under low ph conditions the acidic mine drainage was diluted with water and this water was gradually decreased although acclimation of sulfate reducing species was aimed sulfate reduction was remained at 40 1000 2450 the authors explained this performance not only with low ph but also with the type of organic substrate as well as sulfide toxicity 25 in the acidic phs biological macromolecules are destabilized and proteins may denaturate in addition metabolites h2s and organic acids may become toxic depending on the ph 32 3 3 metal precipitation in pre treatment unit with biogenic sulfide period 3 acidic mine drainage may contain several different metals in soluble form various concentrations of al ca cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn were found in an amd obtained from a mining site in turkey 2 it is practically not possible for all these metals to be separately precipitated by ph adjustment in the form of metal sulfide therefore precipitation of metals in a mixed form could be another option in the third period various concentrations of presented in table 1 fe co cu mn zn and ni were added to the feed at this stage the sulfide concentration entering the pretreatment unit was 36 4 45 mg l and the alkalinity was 274 3 106 mg l caco3 with this alkalinity from the reactor it was aimed to neutralize the acidic influent before entering the reactor the influent and effluent ph of the pre treatment unit was 1 94 0 06 and 4 14 1 6 respectively the transported sulfide was likely used for metal precipitation and its concentration was decreased to 2 12 1 mg l in the effluent the consumption of sulfide in this period in the pre treatment unit was approximately 34 2 mg l when compared with the previous period the pre treatment unit effluent sulfide concentration decreased sharply with the addition of metals to the feed 87 8 33 2 mg l in the previous period and 2 12 1 mg l in the current period corresponding to 97 5 decrease a similar decrease trend for alkalinity is also shown in fig 2 as metal sulfide precipitation produces acidity the entire alkalinity entering the pre treatment unit was consumed on this unit fig 3 shows the total and dissolved metal concentrations in the influent and effluent of the pre precipitation unit in this stage the influent total metal concentrations were fe 400 cu 200 mn 50 co 50 zn 50 ve ni 50 mg l and the removal efficiencies of soluble metal were 62 71 87 98 72 59 11 94 67 05 and 59 22 respectively total metal removal efficiencies on the other hand were 59 94 86 75 72 09 5 43 59 16 and 58 53 respectively after the pre treatment unit remaining metal entering the bioreactor was filtered throughout the reactor filling material although the metal sulfide precipitates could be precipitated in the reactor and prevent the uniform water flow a metal sulfide toxicity or inhibition on sulfate reduction was not observed in order to reduce the escaping metal sulfide from the precipitation reactor a filter was installed before the sulfidogenic reactor for real scale applications commercially available mechanical filters are present on the market for that purpose cartridge filters provide practical solutions in full scale applications the total metal concentrations in the reactor effluent were fe 2 27 2 65 cu 0 32 0 26 co 0 03 0 02 mn 46 01 7 5 zn 1 44 2 23 and ni 0 04 0 05 mg l and the removal efficiencies were 99 43 99 84 99 94 7 99 97 12 and 99 92 for all sampling ports soluble and total metal concentrations were presented in table 2 in this period the total cod of the system was 1740 mg l 1338 40 mg l of this concentration was added to feed and the rest was injected to the influent of the reactor the main reason for this situation was the consumption of a part of influent cod before the bioreactor with the dilution of influent with the recycled reactor effluent reactor influent cod concentration was approximately 668 mg l and in the effluent it was decreased to 68 4 19 5 mg l the amount of cod consumed in the reactor was 600 mg l and theoretically it could reduce 890 mg l sulfate the influent and effluent sulfate concentrations were 1095 118 and 420 182 7 respectively 675 mg l which is in accordance with the calculated values many heavy metals are toxic to sulfate reducing bacteria some heavy metals deactivate enzymes by reacting with their functional groups and denature proteins and compete with essential cations 33 the heavy metals can be stimulatory at lower concentrations and toxic inhibitory at higher concentrations the amd treatment units therefore must be designed according to their type of heavy metals and their quantification in the anaerobic baffled reactors first compartment of abr is the place where most of the metals are precipitated as metal sulfide forms however microorganisms in the other compartments remain stable and continue sulfate reduction utgikar et al studied the effect of metal sulfides to sulfate reducing bacteria and found that insoluble metal sulfide forms can inhibit the sulfate reducing bacterial activity 14 in the amd treatment heavy metal precipitation should be performed before the sulfidogenic reactor it is not only because of the toxic inhibiting nature of metal sulfide precipitates but also metal sulfides can precipitate throughout the reactor filling material that can decrease the efficient mass transfer hurtado et al designed a novel configuration for metal and sulfate removal from amd in their system metal toxicity on sulfate reducing bacteria was prevented by a separate metal biosorption reactor amd was first subjected to neutralization with lime addition that forms metal hydroxide a second metal biosorption reactor was used to filter metal precipitates then neutralized and metal free effluent was mixed with low cost electron donor and pumped into the sulfidogenic reactor to sulfate reduction in the present study lime addition was eliminated with the biogenically produced alkalinity and metals are precipitated in metal sulfide forms which are more dense and stable than hydroxide forms of metals 34 3 4 high sulfate reduction and sulfide alkalinity production period 4 sulfate concentrations in acidic mine drainage are generally higher than 2000 mg l in a study conducted in a mine site in turkey 3360 mg l sulfate concentrations were determined 2 due to the need for the production of real cases and higher sulfide and alkalinity production sulfate and cod in the influent were increased to 4000 and 3480 mg l respectively as a result of this increase the average sulfide produced in the reactor increased from 72 7 mg l in the previous period to 393 199 mg l alkalinity also increased from 548 6 mg l to 1746 8 mg l as shown in table 2 mn removal efficiencies are relatively low compared with other metals according to the reaction 3 2 mol of acidity and 1 mol of h2s are used per 1 mol of metal however required sulfide concentrations to start the precipitation each metal is ph dependent the ph of the pre treatment unit was approximately 6 5 and total sulfide required for metal precipitation was calculated as reported before 6 by using ksp values for each metal sulfide form for fe cu zn co and ni required sulfide concentration to start precipitation was below 0 001 mg l for ph 6 5 however for mn using the ksp value of 1 10 11 required sulfide concentration was calculated as 130 78 mg l due to higher required sulfide of mn precipitation its main removal was achieved within the reactor when compared with other metals such as fe cu zn co and ni mn has lower precipitation properties in a recent study with biogenic sulfide over 99 fe cu zn co and ni precipitation 76 91 mn and 41 67 as removal were observed 8 precipitate of the pre treatment unit was collected and dried in 105 c for xrf measurement the percentage of each metal detected in xrf was presented in table 3 in this process the sulfide concentration in the reactor effluent was 393 199 mg l which was diluted with the feed and decreased to 196 5 mg l before the pre treatment unit pre treatment unit effluent sulfide was 14 35 16 77 and the amount of sulfide consumed was 182 15 mg l the alkalinity entering and leaving the pre treatment unit was 738 22 14 and 311 115 mg l respectively and the effluent ph increased to 5 9 0 37 with the increase in the amount of cod and sulfate entering the reactor the metal precipitation yield of the pre treatment unit was also increased table 2 in order to remove sulfide a desulfurization unit was installed on day 237 for the oxidation of high sulfide in the system effluent air was supplied at a rate of 187 5 3 12 ml min and sulfide concentration in the system effluent was decreased from 538 278 05 to 3 53 1 87 mg l 4 conclusions in this study acidic ph 1 94 0 06 mine drainage containing up to 4000 mg l sulfate and various concentrations of metals fe 400 cu 200 mn 50 co 50 zn 50 and ni 50 mg l was successfully treated in an up flow anaerobic sulfidogenic reactor the cod so4 2 ratio in the reactor was 0 67 and 0 87 and the highest sulfate reduction ratio was 1 94 g l d the corresponding so4 2 and cod removal efficiencies were 91 25 and 94 66 respectively with an average of 1113 425 mg l caco3 produced in the reactor the influent water was neutralized by recirculation of the reactor effluent to a pretreatment unit placed before the reactor the metals were also precipitated as metal sulfide in this unit with the 131 91 mg l average sulfide in the recycled effluent in the pretreatment unit higher than 87 fe over 98 cu co zn and ni and 49 mn removals were observed remaining metals were filtered in the reactor and high metal removals were achieved over 98 fe cu co and ni 97 zn and 76 mn 
14232,acidic mine drainage is known to have a low ph and contain high concentrations of heavy metals and constitute a serious risk for the receiving environment because of the fact that factors affecting the formation and mineralogy of acidic mine drainage vary a lot treatment of it is difficult and costly in this study the treatment of acidic mine drainage together with the ph neutralization and metal precipitation fe cu co mn zn ni in two stage ethanol fed up flow anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor were investigated the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 30 c at a hrt of 1 day for 245 days the cod so4 2 mass ratio was 0 67 0 87 sulfide and alkalinity produced in the reactor were recycled to a pre treatment unit where ph was neutralized and metals were precipitated throughout the study up to 4000 mg l sulfate was added to feed and the effluent sulfate was 325 9 75 mg l corresponding to 91 25 removal the feed was contained 400 mg l fe 200 mg l cu 50 mg l co mn zn and ni and over 87 fe over 98 cu co zn and ni and 49 mn removals were achieved in the pre treatment unit the remaining metals were also filtered in the sulfidogenic reactor this study demonstrated that by setting a reactor configuration ph neutralization metal precipitation as well as sulfate reduction can be achieved in two stage reactor system keywords sulfate reduction acidic mine drainage metal precipitation ph neutralization 1 introduction acidic mine drainage amd is formed during mining activities by the contact of sulfate and metal containing minerals i e pyrite with water and air they are characterized by low ph and high metal and sulfate content amd formation by pyrite oxidation is shown in the following reaction 1 1 2fes2 7 o2 2 h2o 2 fe2 4 so4 2 4 h as a result acidic drainages with high metal and sulfate are formed some metals that may be present in amd can be toxic or low ph of amd may damage the ecological balance in the receiving environment in the mine drainage at a mining site located in elazığ turkey low ph 3 04 together with 391 60 mg l fe 44 9 2 8 mg l cu 8 99 0 48 mg l co and varying concentrations of ni cd and mn were reported 2 amd treatment is generally based on the neutralization of its ph and the precipitation of metals active and passive abiotic methods such as lime addition or diverting amd to an anoxic lime bed for neutralization of low ph are used in amd treatment 3 in this way neutralization of the ph is achieved and metals are precipitated in metal hydroxide forms at elevated phs aerobic wetlands compost reactors permeable reactive barriers package bed oxidizing bioreactors and sulfate reducing bioreactors are among the traditional treatment methods used for the neutralization of amd and the precipitation of metals 4 however new bioprocesses emerged in recent years allowing sulfate reduction in column reactors with separate precipitation of metals 5 6 and even membrane processes for higher efficiency amd treatment 7 8 the treatment of amd in a sulfate reducing bioreactor is based on the reduction of sulfate to sulfide in the presence of an electron donor in this process alkalinity is also produced as an example ethanol based sulfate reduction is presented below 9 2 2c2h5oh 3 so4 2 4hco3 3 hs h 2h2o the sulfate reduction process has a number of advantages in the treatment of amd the neutralization of the acidic ph of amd can be achieved by the produced alkalinity additionally metals in the amd can be precipitated in metal sulfide form by produced sulfide 10 metal sulfide formation is shown in reaction 3 3 h2s m2 ms 2h formation of sulfide is very useful in metal precipitation in comparison to hydroxide precipitation of metals metal sulfide precipitation has several advantages for example metal sulfides have a very low solubility over a broad range of ph and they are more dense and stable compared to metal hydroxide sludge additionally utilization of sulfide when amd contains complexes and chelating agents is more useful and effective 1 metal sulfide precipitation is largely dependent on the ph of the water for example in ph 2 the dissolved concentration of cus in water approximately lower than 0 001 mg l whereas 0 10 mg l cds 1 mg l pbs 6 mg l zns and 100 mg l nis can be dissolved at this ph at neutral phs the dissolved concentrations of cus cds zns was lower than 0 001 mg l whereas the dissolved concentration of nis was approximately 0 01 11 at decreasing ph values higher sulfide concentrations are required to initiate metal sulfide precipitation even small changes in ph lead to a significant change in the required sulfide concentration for example in a study the total required sulfide concentration at ph 2 5 for the initiation of 120 mg l iron precipitation is 280 mg l while at ph 2 26 required sulfide increases to 845 mg l 6 similarly in another study to precipitate 100 mg l zn the total required sulfide concentrations for ph 1 87 and 1 75 were 3 and 5 2 mg l respectively 5 the amount of sulfide required to start metal precipitation in the amd may increase dramatically when the acidic ph of amd increased the optimum ph value for many known sulfate reducing species is around 7 12 and many species are inhibited at acidic phs many species are inhibited at ph 5 5 13 therefore various engineering solutions are required to prevent the direct contact of amd with microorganisms directly introducing amd into the reactor may result in poor performance in the reactor anaerobic baffled reactors can be used to solve this problem in column reactors in a study with four chamber anaerobic baffled reactor acidic ph 3 and various concentrations of metal co cu fe mn ni and zn containing amd was treated successfully however the effluent ph and alkalinity of the 1 st compartment were found to be 4 5 and below detectable level respectively while the majority of the metals were precipitated in the 1 st compartment 14 for column reactors this can be achieved with a high recycle ratio in this way the wastewater may be neutralized before entering the reactor but the accumulation of metals in the reactor in the form of metal sulfide is inevitable in a study conducted by sahinkaya et al metals in the real amd were kept along the reactor filling material in order to reduce the effect of low ph the reactor was operated at high recycle rate and fluidized 2 in more recent studies different reactor configurations have also been used 15 17 godoi et al used a downstream fixed bed reactor to prevent the accumulation of metal in the reactor bed in the study the free cross sectional area provided in the reactor bed prevented the accumulation of excess biomass in the reactor while the metal sulfide precipitates were separated from the reactor 18 apart from above mentioned studies amd treatment has been studied in continuously stirred tank reactors 19 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors 20 off line sulfidogenic bioreactors 21 fixed bed reactor 22 and permeable reactive barriers 23 most of these studies were conducted with synthetic amd because the composition of real amd could vary a lot especially in ph and metal content amds with low phs and having a mixed metal composition is still needed to study in the market there are several companies working on sulfate reduction and metal precipitation with biogenic sulfide for example paques biotechnology netherlands https en paques nl is working on sulfate reduction and metal recovery from waste streams and several successful applications in the field 24 one of the full scale applications is as follows sulfate and metal containing water first pumped into the anaerobic sulfidogenic reactor and produced sulfide is used to form metal sulfides in the effluent of the reactor excess sulfide is then processed in a second aerobic reactor to form elemental sulfur in order to remove sulfide from the effluent the treated water is then recycled to system influent to provide alkalinity in some of the applications for example the one in the pueblo viejo mine is located in the dominican republic sulfur containing feed together with some electron donors were processed in a bioreactor to form h2s gas and this gas was used to precipitate metals in the waste streams to form metal sulfides a coarse cost estimated was conducted by foucher et al 2001 based on the composition of chessy mine effluent 5 m3 h flow rate according to their calculations the operating cost without personnel was 30000 usd and the investment cost was 450000 usd the benefit associated with cus and zns production was 12000 usd and shows that the process was not economically feasible however since that times the studies show that the costs could be reduced by optimizing the system parameters as foucher et al predicted for example activated sludge as carbon source was utilized in a study to reduce operational costs 25 although the total costs associated with the amd treatment are high they are still low in comparison with the costs of cleaning spills after environmental spills due to the requirement for the protection of bacteria from acidic nature of amd and metal precipitation separate from sulfidogenic reactor new reactor configurations are needed in this study the hypothesis was the alkalinity produced in sulfidogenic reactor can be used to neutralize the acidic amd additionally while neutralizing the amd before the sulfidogenic reactor metals could be precipitated with the biogenic sulfide hence neutral and non metal containing amd could be treated in a sulfidogenic reactor in an efficient way amd treatment was carried out in a two stage reactor system metals contained in the amd were precipitated in a pre treatment unit prior to sulfate reducing bioreactor the neutralization of the extremely acidic water ph 2 was also carried out prior to the reactor necessary sulfide and alkalinity were provided from the reactor 2 materials and method 2 1 the experimental setup the research question in this study was the effective ph neutralization and mixed metal precipitation in a pre settling tank metal sulfide precipitation is highly ph dependent and different metal sulfides precipitate in different ph ranges it was aimed to elevate the ph from 2 to neutral levels in a pre settling tank during this elevation each metal sulfide forms are expected to precipitate in relevant ph therefore a laboratory scale anaerobic up flow column reactor made of glass was used as sulfate reducing bioreactor additionally a pre treatment unit was placed prior to the reactor the schematic representation of the experimental set up is given in fig 1 the column reactor 7 cm internal diameter and 40 cm height has a working volume of 500 ml aquarium sand 1 2 mm was used as reactor filling material the reactor was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the phototrophic growth the volume of the pre treatment unit was 250 ml and the reactors were operated in a temperature controlled room at 35 c a recycle pipe and pump were connected to recycle the sulfide and alkalinity produced in the sulfidogenic reactor to the pre treatment unit a desulfurization unit aeration was installed after the sulfidogenic reactor similar to that operated in previous studies 14 the volume of desulfurization unit was 1 l and aerated at a flow rate of 187 5 3 12 ml min 2 2 the operational conditions the reactor was inoculated with a sludge obtained from an anaerobic digester treating pulp and paper industry wastewater for more than 300 days the sulfidogenic reactor was operated for 245 days during the study hydraulic retention time hrt was kept constant at 1 day and an adjustable peristaltic pump ismatec compact pump 2 channels 60 rpm 230 vac was used to pump 500 ml of synthetic amd per day the reactor was supplied with ethanol as electron and carbon source the system was operated in 4 different operating conditions table 1 sulfate reduction conditions were provided at period 1 in this period sulfate reducing bacteria in the reactor was expected to adapt to the environment in the period 2 pre treatment unit was mounted and ph was reduced to represent amd additionally ethanol in the feed was increased by 30 in the third stage metals fe co cu mn zn and ni were added to feed and a coarse filter with a pore size of 20 30 μm was installed between the pre treatment unit and the reactor to filter the un precipitated metal sulfide forms in the 4th period sulfate and cod were increased to produce higher sulfide and alkalinity in the reactor and a desulfurization unit was installed to control the effluent sulfide from the system throughout the study the synthetic amd was prepared by adding the required amounts of mgso4 7h2o naso4 kh2po4 nh4cl ascorbic acid and yeast extract to the tap water the reactors were sampled three times a week for sulfate cod alkalinity and dissolved sulfide and metal analyses the feed was also sampled once a week for measurement of the same parameters except for dissolved sulfide 2 3 analytical conditions prior to the all analyzes the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm 3024 rfc for 10 min with rotanta 460s centrifuge hanna instruments ph 211 ph meter was used for ph measurement alkalinity was measured according to method 2320 b described in standard methods 26 in order to remove sulfide in the cod measurements the ph was decreased to 2 with h2so4 and samples were aerated for 5 min chemical oxygen demand was measured according to 5220 a closed reflux titrimetric method method described in standard methods 26 sulfate was measured at 420 nm using a turbidimetric method at spectrophotometer merck spectroquant pharo 100 27 total sulfide was measured spectrophotometrically at 480 nm by the method described by cord ruwisch 28 total and dissolved metal samples were measured by coupled plasma spectrometry with relevant wavelengths for each metal icp oes optical emission spectrometer perkins elmer optima 8000 the detection limit was 0 01 mg l samples of dissolved metal were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane syringe filter and then acidified with hcl to reduce ph below 1 5 for total metal samples samples were first acidified and then filtered through 0 45 μm identification of the precipitates formed in the pre treatment unit was done with wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry panalytical axios advanced 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor acclimation period 1 in the first period of the study sulfate reduction process was aimed to reach equilibrium the influent sulfate and cod concentrations were 2000 and 1340 mg l corresponding to cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 the influent and effluent sulfate concentrations are presented in fig 2 accordingly in the first 20 day period the influent and effluent sulfate was 2069 5 163 67 and 1359 16 248 23 mg l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 32 in the following days the effluent sulfate concentration decreased further to 713 10 249 48 mg l at the end of the period 64 35 removal efficiency the alkalinity in the reactor is also shown in fig 2 in the first period the influent ph was 7 02 1 52 and the average alkalinity was 134 37 38 15 mg l caco3 throughout the first period effluent alkalinity was increased gradually at the beginning of the study 810 16 mg l caco3 alkalinity increased to 1746 181 mg l caco3 at the end of the first period in parallel with the sulfate and alkalinity concentrations the sulfide in the reactor followed a steady upward trend because sulfide can be adsorbed on various surfaces including reactor filling material low concentration of sulfide 97 3 40 63 mg l was measured in the start up period and its concentration was increased to 583 95 176 29 mg l at the end of the period the average sulfide concentration during the entire period was 290 88 60 12 mg l cod removal efficiency increased during the first period and its concentration decreased to 313 6 73 84 mg l at the end of the period 76 96 removal efficiency the average effluent cod concentration during the period was 592 7 316 58 mg l ethanol is an attractive electron source high sulfate reduction rates have been reported in studies using ethanol bekmezci et al obtained 88 sulfate removal rate in an anaerobic baffled reactor at 3 5 g l influent sulfate concentrations and 0 737 cod so4 2 mass ratio 14 similarly sahinkaya et al obtained 90 sulfate removal in fluidized bed reactor at 2 5 g l influent sulfate conditions and 0 85 cod so4 2 mass ratio 2 there are different acclimatization regimes in the literature for different reactor configurations and different inoculums very fast acclimization period is reported by duyar et al 2018 over 90 sulfate reduction is observed even in the initial days of reactor operation with ethanol based anaerobic baffled reactor hrt 1 day influent sulfate 1500 mg l 29 in another recent study sahinkaya et al 2018 operated anaerobic membrane bioreactor and 90 sulfate removal was achieved within 45 days of operation hrt 2 days influent sulfate was 2000 mg l 7 in another study two column reactors were operated in parallel and during 70 days of operation 2000 mg l influent sulfate was decreased to 1457 352 and 1397 310 mg l for acetate and ethanol based reactors respectively 9 3 2 ph neutralization by a pre treatment unit period 2 in the second period of the study ph was reduced to 2 in order to represent real acidic mine drainage in studies with real amd ph levels in the range of 2 3 to 3 have been reported 15 however due to the low tolerance of the sulfate reducing bacteria to the acidic ph 13 a pre treatment unit was placed prior to the reactor in this period for the neutralization of the ph by recycling water from the reactor to this pre treatment unit ph neutralization is provided with the produced alkalinity in the result of sulfate reduction the phs of system s influent and pre treatment unit s effluent in this period were 2 0 38 and 6 46 0 88 respectively the feed was not containing alkalinity and the alkalinity was increased to 322 252 mg l caco3 in the effluent of pre treatment unit in this period the cod in the feed was partially oxidized without entering the reactor due to the retention in the pretreatment unit data not presented for this reason cod so4 2 ratio was increased to 0 87 by increasing the influent cod by 30 in this period pre treatment unit influent and effluent sulfide concentrations were also monitored and the presence of sufficient sulfide in the case of metal precipitation was monitored for the following periods in this period the sulfide concentration in the effluent of the reactor was 218 99 mg l while the pre treatment effluent sulfide was diluted with the system feed to 87 7 39 1 mg l levels the cod entering the system during this period was 1740 mg l and the effluent cod was 577 2 287 mg l corresponding to 67 36 removal efficiency the sulfide entering the reactor after the pre treatment unit was 88 33 2 and it was increased to 218 9 99 1 in the reactor effluent likewise the alkalinity after the pretreatment unit was 322 2 252 1 mg l and at the reactor effluent this alkalinity increased to 901 1 272 2 thus it was determined that the required alkalinity and sulfide were produced in the subsequent periods for the metal precipitation from amd there are several strategies in some of the studies separate precipitation was applied 5 however this is only possible if certain metal groups are present in the wastewater the solubilities of metal sulfide compounds are ph dependent and hence separate metal recovery is possible with the ph adjustment while cus can precipitate at ph 2 other metals remain soluble at this ph combine precipitation is another option in the literature there are studies for the separate precipitation of copper and zinc 5 iron 6 and nickel 9 in precipitation units however these studies are based only on the sequential precipitation of two metals in addition an inert gas is required to transfer sulfide to cu precipitation unit 10 yıldız et al aerated the sulfidogenic reactor effluent and transported sulfide to metal precipitation unit however due to the high solubility of sulfide at neutral phs acid addition required to decrease the ph and solubility to transfer more sulfide to metal precipitation 9 the optimum ph for most known sulfate reducing bacteria is around 7 12 many species are inhibited even at ph 5 5 in order to eliminate these disadvantages of the srbs ph neutralization must be performed although some acid tolerant species were also identified 30 31 these species may require a long time to become dominant xingyu et al studied the sulfate reduction under low ph conditions the acidic mine drainage was diluted with water and this water was gradually decreased although acclimation of sulfate reducing species was aimed sulfate reduction was remained at 40 1000 2450 the authors explained this performance not only with low ph but also with the type of organic substrate as well as sulfide toxicity 25 in the acidic phs biological macromolecules are destabilized and proteins may denaturate in addition metabolites h2s and organic acids may become toxic depending on the ph 32 3 3 metal precipitation in pre treatment unit with biogenic sulfide period 3 acidic mine drainage may contain several different metals in soluble form various concentrations of al ca cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn were found in an amd obtained from a mining site in turkey 2 it is practically not possible for all these metals to be separately precipitated by ph adjustment in the form of metal sulfide therefore precipitation of metals in a mixed form could be another option in the third period various concentrations of presented in table 1 fe co cu mn zn and ni were added to the feed at this stage the sulfide concentration entering the pretreatment unit was 36 4 45 mg l and the alkalinity was 274 3 106 mg l caco3 with this alkalinity from the reactor it was aimed to neutralize the acidic influent before entering the reactor the influent and effluent ph of the pre treatment unit was 1 94 0 06 and 4 14 1 6 respectively the transported sulfide was likely used for metal precipitation and its concentration was decreased to 2 12 1 mg l in the effluent the consumption of sulfide in this period in the pre treatment unit was approximately 34 2 mg l when compared with the previous period the pre treatment unit effluent sulfide concentration decreased sharply with the addition of metals to the feed 87 8 33 2 mg l in the previous period and 2 12 1 mg l in the current period corresponding to 97 5 decrease a similar decrease trend for alkalinity is also shown in fig 2 as metal sulfide precipitation produces acidity the entire alkalinity entering the pre treatment unit was consumed on this unit fig 3 shows the total and dissolved metal concentrations in the influent and effluent of the pre precipitation unit in this stage the influent total metal concentrations were fe 400 cu 200 mn 50 co 50 zn 50 ve ni 50 mg l and the removal efficiencies of soluble metal were 62 71 87 98 72 59 11 94 67 05 and 59 22 respectively total metal removal efficiencies on the other hand were 59 94 86 75 72 09 5 43 59 16 and 58 53 respectively after the pre treatment unit remaining metal entering the bioreactor was filtered throughout the reactor filling material although the metal sulfide precipitates could be precipitated in the reactor and prevent the uniform water flow a metal sulfide toxicity or inhibition on sulfate reduction was not observed in order to reduce the escaping metal sulfide from the precipitation reactor a filter was installed before the sulfidogenic reactor for real scale applications commercially available mechanical filters are present on the market for that purpose cartridge filters provide practical solutions in full scale applications the total metal concentrations in the reactor effluent were fe 2 27 2 65 cu 0 32 0 26 co 0 03 0 02 mn 46 01 7 5 zn 1 44 2 23 and ni 0 04 0 05 mg l and the removal efficiencies were 99 43 99 84 99 94 7 99 97 12 and 99 92 for all sampling ports soluble and total metal concentrations were presented in table 2 in this period the total cod of the system was 1740 mg l 1338 40 mg l of this concentration was added to feed and the rest was injected to the influent of the reactor the main reason for this situation was the consumption of a part of influent cod before the bioreactor with the dilution of influent with the recycled reactor effluent reactor influent cod concentration was approximately 668 mg l and in the effluent it was decreased to 68 4 19 5 mg l the amount of cod consumed in the reactor was 600 mg l and theoretically it could reduce 890 mg l sulfate the influent and effluent sulfate concentrations were 1095 118 and 420 182 7 respectively 675 mg l which is in accordance with the calculated values many heavy metals are toxic to sulfate reducing bacteria some heavy metals deactivate enzymes by reacting with their functional groups and denature proteins and compete with essential cations 33 the heavy metals can be stimulatory at lower concentrations and toxic inhibitory at higher concentrations the amd treatment units therefore must be designed according to their type of heavy metals and their quantification in the anaerobic baffled reactors first compartment of abr is the place where most of the metals are precipitated as metal sulfide forms however microorganisms in the other compartments remain stable and continue sulfate reduction utgikar et al studied the effect of metal sulfides to sulfate reducing bacteria and found that insoluble metal sulfide forms can inhibit the sulfate reducing bacterial activity 14 in the amd treatment heavy metal precipitation should be performed before the sulfidogenic reactor it is not only because of the toxic inhibiting nature of metal sulfide precipitates but also metal sulfides can precipitate throughout the reactor filling material that can decrease the efficient mass transfer hurtado et al designed a novel configuration for metal and sulfate removal from amd in their system metal toxicity on sulfate reducing bacteria was prevented by a separate metal biosorption reactor amd was first subjected to neutralization with lime addition that forms metal hydroxide a second metal biosorption reactor was used to filter metal precipitates then neutralized and metal free effluent was mixed with low cost electron donor and pumped into the sulfidogenic reactor to sulfate reduction in the present study lime addition was eliminated with the biogenically produced alkalinity and metals are precipitated in metal sulfide forms which are more dense and stable than hydroxide forms of metals 34 3 4 high sulfate reduction and sulfide alkalinity production period 4 sulfate concentrations in acidic mine drainage are generally higher than 2000 mg l in a study conducted in a mine site in turkey 3360 mg l sulfate concentrations were determined 2 due to the need for the production of real cases and higher sulfide and alkalinity production sulfate and cod in the influent were increased to 4000 and 3480 mg l respectively as a result of this increase the average sulfide produced in the reactor increased from 72 7 mg l in the previous period to 393 199 mg l alkalinity also increased from 548 6 mg l to 1746 8 mg l as shown in table 2 mn removal efficiencies are relatively low compared with other metals according to the reaction 3 2 mol of acidity and 1 mol of h2s are used per 1 mol of metal however required sulfide concentrations to start the precipitation each metal is ph dependent the ph of the pre treatment unit was approximately 6 5 and total sulfide required for metal precipitation was calculated as reported before 6 by using ksp values for each metal sulfide form for fe cu zn co and ni required sulfide concentration to start precipitation was below 0 001 mg l for ph 6 5 however for mn using the ksp value of 1 10 11 required sulfide concentration was calculated as 130 78 mg l due to higher required sulfide of mn precipitation its main removal was achieved within the reactor when compared with other metals such as fe cu zn co and ni mn has lower precipitation properties in a recent study with biogenic sulfide over 99 fe cu zn co and ni precipitation 76 91 mn and 41 67 as removal were observed 8 precipitate of the pre treatment unit was collected and dried in 105 c for xrf measurement the percentage of each metal detected in xrf was presented in

effluent sulfide was 14 35 16 77 and the amount of sulfide consumed was 182 15 mg l the alkalinity entering and leaving the pre treatment unit was 738 22 14 and 311 115 mg l respectively and the effluent ph increased to 5 9 0 37 with the increase in the amount of cod and sulfate entering the reactor the metal precipitation yield of the pre treatment unit was also increased table 2 in order to remove sulfide a desulfurization unit was installed on day 237 for the oxidation of high sulfide in the system effluent air was supplied at a rate of 187 5 3 12 ml min and sulfide concentration in the system effluent was decreased from 538 278 05 to 3 53 1 87 mg l 4 conclusions in this study acidic ph 1 94 0 06 mine drainage containing up to 4000 mg l sulfate and various concentrations of metals fe 400 cu 200 mn 50 co 50 zn 50 and ni 50 mg l was successfully treated in an up flow anaerobic sulfidogenic reactor the cod so4 2 ratio in the reactor was 0 67 and 0 87 and the highest sulfate reduction

co bivo4 composites 1 introduction in the past decades with the rapid development of industries environmental pollution has attracted widely attention 1 3 especially some pollutants are difficult to remove owing to the stable chemical structure which have caused serious environmental pollution and threatened human health 4 6 a host of technologies have been developed to solve these problems 7 11 recently fenton like processes involving hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and fe2 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh have been an effective approach to remove organic pollutants containing wastewater unfortunately the half life of oh is too short to ensure react with pollutants besides the generation of oh is limited by the ph value 2 5 3 5 some researchers have found that sulfate radicals so4 can be an alternative radical this may be because it has a longer half life wider ph range 2 8 and higher redox potential than oh 12 13 in addition so4 can be produced by activating peroxymonosulfate pms 14 compared liquid h2o2 the solid pms is safer and more convenient to be used transported and stored pms react slowly with target pollutants at ambient temperature but it is easily activated by using uv irradiation heat carbon and transition metal catalysts 15 18 among these methods transition metal catalysis is regarded as the most promising technology owing to its strong activation ability and low energy consumption cobalt co2 is one of the most effective metals during pms activation processes 19 compared with fenton like processes the combination of co2 pms has some advantages such as without production of ferric hydroxide sludge and ph adjustment 20 co3o4 have been studied extensively as an effective catalyst for pms activation by the redox cycle of co2 co3 21 22 notably pms can be also activated by photogenerated electrons from photocatalyst 23 recently a large variety of bi based semiconductor photocatalysts such as bi2wo6 24 bivo4 25 and biox x cl 26 i 27 br 28 have been reported especially monoclinic scheelite bivo4 has received considerable interest owing to its non toxic high stability and excellent optical properties 29 however bivo4 still has some weaknesses such as narrow response range of visible light weak light absorption capacity and rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs 30 many efforts have been made to overcome these shortcomings 31 33 among these methods semiconductor coupling can greatly enhance visible light absorption and accelerate the separation and transportation of electrons holes 34 35 it is reported that co3o4 exhibit obviously visible light activity but has the inevitable problem of electrons holes recombination so it is usually used as co catalysts in the photocatalytic reaction 36 38 it is efficient to develop co3o4 bivo4 composites because co3o4 and bivo4 have the matched of valence and conduction band levels for facilitating electrons holes separation as another ideal method to enhance photocatalytic activity external electrons acceptor were added into photocatalytic system 39 more recently pms can trap photogenerated electrons to generate so4 and remarkably inhibit recombination of photogenerated

based on above discussion we designed co bivo4 composites used for the combining processes of photocatalysis and sulfate radical based oxidation processes to degrade high concentration of tc hcl subsequently co bivo4 composites catalytic performance was evaluated by degradation of tc hcl in presence of pms under visible light a possible reaction mechanism was comprehensively studied 2

purification 2 2 sample synthesis 2 2 1 the synthesis of bivo4 the bivo4 powder was synthesized by a hydrothermal method the fabrication processes were as followed 2 mmol bi no3 3 5h2o were dissolved in 20 ml ethylene glycol to obtain solution a and 2 mmol nh4vo3 were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water to form solution b then the solution b was added drop wise into solution a under magnetic stirring to get a stable mixture after 30 min of stirring the suspension was transferred to a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated at 100 for 15 h the yellowish precipitate from the reaction was washed with distilled water and pure ethanol for several times respectively finally the products were dried at 80 to remove residual organic solution 2 2 2 the synthesis of co bivo4 composites the 200 mg above prepared bivo4 powder was dispersed in 10 ml aqueous solution the desired amounts 9 9 49 5 99 mg of co no3 2 6h2o were added into the solution and slowly heated to 60 with slow stirring to evaporate water till the solvent was completely removed the mixture was taken into a muffle furnace subsequently and it was heated with a rate of 5 min from ambient temperature to 400 and maintained for 5 h under air the final samples was denoted as x co bivo4 x 1 5 10 wt where the x represents the mass percentage of co bivo4 2 3 characterization the crystal structure of the samples were characterized by an bruker d8 advance x ray diffraction xrd using cu ka irradiation and scanning rang was 5 to 90 the chemical composition and chemical states of the samples were performed with thermo fisher scientific escalab 250 xi x ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement xps the morphologies of the samples were conducted on zeiss sigma hd field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem the uv vis absorbance and diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs were analyzed by usa pe lambda 750 s photoluminescence pl spectra were recorded with an edinburgh fls 1000 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation light at 280 nm 2 4 degradation experiments of tc hcl photocatalytic activity of samples was investigated by the degradation of tc hcl for reaction photocatalyst sample 20 mg was dispersed in an aqueous solution of tc hcl 100 ml 40 mg l adsorption desorption equilibrium experiments were achieved by magnetically stirring the suspensions in the dark for 30 min afterward pms was added into the solution and the lamp was turned on at certain time intervals 3 ml of samples were withdrawn and methanol were added into samples to quench the radicals then samples were centrifuged to remove the particles visible light source was provided by xenon lamp with a 420 nm uv cutoff filter 420 780 nm the light source is located above the solution and the distance from the light source to solution was around 12 cm the concentration of tc hcl was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at maximum absorption wavelength 357 nm for tetracycline hydrochloride using a uv vis spectrophotometer to investigate the influence of pms concentration 0 5 2 5 8 mm pms were added into the reaction solution respectively in order to detect the free radicals radical scavengers were added into the reactor tert butyl alcohol tba was used for scavenging the oh and methanol meoh was used for scavenging both oh and so4 radicals for the stability and reusability experiments of co bivo4 the samples were collected after reaction and washed by distilled water and pure ethanol for several times respectively and dried at 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the co bivo4 composites the xrd patterns of the co3o4 bivo4 and co bivo4 composites with different ratio of co3o4 are shown in fig 1 for pristine co3o4 it can be seen that entire characteristic peaks can be well indexed into the standard cards of co3o4 pdf 43 1003 for pure bivo4 the characteristic diffraction patterns at 18 8 28 9 30 5 34 8 39 9 42 3 45 8 47 0 50 1 53 2 58 8 59 8 are observed corresponding to the 011 121 040 002 211 051 231 240 202 161 321 and 123 crystalline planes of bivo4 pdf 75 2481 respectively the narrow and sharp diffraction peaks indicates that bivo4 has good crystalline nature and large particle size 40 interestingly the xrd patterns of co bivo4 are similar to that of bivo4 with the increasing co3o4 content the diffraction peaks of bivo4 become weak while no characteristic peaks ascribed to co3o4 are observed which may be ascribed that good dispersion and low content in the composites the survey spectrum and high resolution xps spectra of 5 co bivo4 are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2a 5 co bivo4 composite mainly consists of bi v o co elements fig 2b presents bi 4f peaks the two peaks at 158 58 ev and 163 88 ev can be assigned to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 indicating that bi element are bi3 state 41 the v 2p is shown in fig 2c the two peaks at 516 28 ev and 523 78 ev can be assigned to v 2p3 2 and v 2p1 2 indicating that v element are v5 state 42 the o 1s spectra divided into three peaks at 528 85 ev 529 41 ev and 531 24 ev in fig 2d which may be assigned to the oxygen species of lattice oxygen of co3o4 bivo4 and the adsorbed oxygen respectively 43 44 the co 2p is shown in fig 2e the peaks at 793 38 ev and 795 28 ev are attributed to co3 and co2 of co 2p3 2 and the peaks at 778 78 ev and 780 48 ev are attributed to co3 and co2 of co 2p1 2 respectively besides the peaks at around 805 ev and 788 ev are attributed to satellite peaks of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively notably the binding energy distance of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 is about 15 ev which indicates the existence of the co3o4 phase 45 the morphology of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem it can be clearly seen that the pure bivo4 is peanut shaped micron particles formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles with smooth surface fig 3 a b after the loaded of co3o4 the bivo4 still retains peanut shaped but its surface becomes obviously rough and has a large number of closely connected small nanoparticles fig 3c d in order to further describe the element property composition and distribution of co3o4 species elemental mapping analysis fig 4 a e and the eds spectra fig 4f of 5 co bivo4 were performed respectively it is proved the existence of bi v o and co elements and the mapping image matches well with the sem image moreover the mapping image of co element verifies the uniform distribution of co3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of the bivo4 the uv vis diffuse reflection spectra drs of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 composite was carried out and shown in fig 5 a consistent with the reference bivo4 has an absorption edge at about 540 nm after the loading of co3o4 the absorption edge of 5 co bivo4 shows significant red shift and the continuous absorption of uv and visible light region have become more intense which could be owing to a charge transfer between the metal oxide and bivo4 notably 5 co bivo4 composite has two absorption bands that can be attributed to the two transitions of co3o4 corresponding respectively to edges of o2 co3 excitation and o2 co2 charge transfer 34 this result clearly also confirms the presence of co3o4 in 5 co bivo4 composite apart from that the color of the co bivo4 composites powder also change from yellowish to dark green by enhancing the co3o4 content suggesting that co bivo4 can make better use of visible light as a crystalline semiconductor the band gap value can be measured by the following equation eq 1 1 αhν a hν eg n 2 where hν α eg and a represent the photon energy optical absorption coefficient band gap and proportionality constant respectively additionally n 1 and 4 means that the material is direct semiconductor and indirect semiconductor respectively as shown in fig 5b the calculation of direct energies of pure bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 composite estimated from a plot of αhν 2 versus hν were 2 28 ev and 2 16 ev respectively according to the k m model 46 consistent with the reference the band gap of bivo4 is 2 28 ev 5 co bivo4 in our experiment is 2 16 ev indicating the co3o4 loaded can shorten the band gap of bivo4 to enhance light harvesting and visible light utilization the band edge positions of bivo4 and co3o4 are estimated in this study based on the electronegativity the conduction band cb and valence band vb potentials of bivo4 and co3o4 can be evaluated by the formula as follows eqs 2 and 3 2 ecb x ee 0 5eg 3 evb ecb eg where evb and ecb are the vb and cb potentials x is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor x value for bivo4 is 6 036 ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor according to the uv vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra the band gap energy of bivo4 are 2 28 ev hence the calculated evb and ecb of bivo4 is 2 67 ev and 0 39 ev respectively the pl spectra is an efficient technique to reveal the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs 47 the pl spectra of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 are shown in fig 6 the 5 co bivo4 sample shows weaker intensity than bivo4 indicating that co3o4 loading can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs so 5 co bivo4 has high photocatalytic activity moreover the phenomenon clearly reveals that the co3o4 and bivo4 form internal contact instead of just cover on the surface of bivo4 3 2 tc hcl degradation 3 2 1 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of bivo4 and the co bivo4 composites were determined by the degradation of tc hcl under visible light irradiation a plot of c c0 versus t is set up where c0 is concentration after adsorption and c is the actual concentration of tc hcl it can be clearly seen in fig 7 a only 30 of tc hcl was degraded after 80 min reaction with pure bivo4 under visible light the photocatalytic activity was improved after modification by co3o4 and 5 co bivo4 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among all samples however when the contents of co3o4 species was increased to 10 photocatalyst exhibited lower photocatalytic activity this may be due to the agglomeration and lower dispersibility of co3o4 species resulting in the low migration and separation rate of the photogenerated charge therefore an appropriate loading level and dispersion of co3o4 in the co bivo4 composites are critical after the reaction for 80 min it was found the degradation date were well consistent with a pseudo first order kinetic in fig 7b according to eq 4 4 ln c c 0 kt where k is the apparent rate constant for the tc hcl degradation min 1 which were obtained from the slope of plot ln c c0 versus t 48 the k value increased gradually when the contents of co3o4 increased from 1 to 5 further increasing the amounts of co3o4 from 5 to 10 the k value of tc hcl decreased it indicated that the 5 co bivo4 sample had the highest photocatalytic activity and was selected for further studies 3 2 2 enhanced degradation of tc hcl as shown in fig 8 a performance comparison between different systems was conducted by the degradation of tc hcl the degradation rate of tc hcl was lightly increased in co bivo4 vis system indicating that the photocatalytic degradation ability of co bivo4 for tc hcl was unsatisfactory if only pms was introduced into system the tc hcl solution could hardly be degraded under visible light the degradation rate of tc hcl was increased in co bivo4 pms system indicating that co bivo4 have potential ability to activate pms tc hcl was more degraded in bivo4 vis pms system indicating photogenerated electron can help pms to produce so4 radicals significantly tc hcl was completely and rapidly degraded in the co bivo4 vis pms system the influence of pms concentration on tc hcl degradation is exhibited in fig 8b when 0 5 mm pms was added the degradation rate of tc hcl increased obviously tc hcl was completely degraded when the pms concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 5 0 mm obviously the higher pms concentration would generate more so4 radicals when pms concentration was increased from 5 0 mm to 8 0 mm only a slight improvement of the degradation rate of tc hcl was observed this was because too many so4 radicals could be scavenged as shown in eq 12 13 it is worth noting that the s2o8 is less reactive than so4s 12 and 13 it is worth noting that the s2o8 is less reactive than so4 is less reactive than so4 thus the degradation rate had only a slight improvement therefore 5 0 mm pms concentration was selected as the most appropriate concentration 3 3 proposed enhanced degradation mechanism to further identify the mechanism of tc hcl degradation free radicals trapping experiments were conducted fig 9 tba was used as an effective radical scavenger for oh while meoh was applied as an effective radical scavenger for both oh and so4 a slightly decrease of tc hcl degradation efficiency was observed after tba scavenger was added in the co bivo4 vis pms system which indicated that the oh was a minor factor contributing to tc hcl degradation by contrast tc hcl degradation efficiency was remarkable reduced when meoh was added indicating that so4 plays an important role in the degradation of tc hcl it is well known that bivo4 and co3o4 are typical semiconductor materials according to the above calculation results evb and ecb of bivo4 are 2 67 ev and 0 39 ev respectively according to previous articles the evb and ecb of co3o4 are 2 44 ev and 0 37 ev respectively 34 hence the potential difference between the two semiconductors created a feasible path which favoring the enrichment of electrons on the surface of bivo4 while the accumulation of holes in co3o4 when the bivo4 is coupled with the co3o4 a heterojunction is formed as demonstrated by the drs and pl results the xps spectra of co 2p on 5 co bivo4 surface before and after reaction were further studied to clarify reaction mechanism fig 2e f the peaks with binding energy positioned at 793 38 ev and 778 78 ev can be attributed to co3 and the peaks with binding energy positioned at 795 28 ev and 780 48 ev can be attributed to co2 the relative area of the four peaks is 43 17 27 and 12 respectively for the xps spectra of co 2p after reaction the peaks with binding energy positioned at 794 38 ev and 779 38 ev can be attributed to co3 and the peaks with binding energy positioned at 796 18 ev and 781 68 ev can be attributed to co2 the relative area of the peaks as mentioned above are 52 18 18 and 10 respectively this variation indicates that the degradation reaction initializes on the surface of co bivo4 whereby the co2 possibly reacted with hso5 and further caused an increase of co3 to maintain the electrons charge balance on the surface of catalyst the co3 would react with hso5 and afterward turned back to co2 this explanation implies a redox cycle of the co3o4 co2 co3 during the pms activation process 49 according to above discussions a synergistic mechanism of advanced oxidation processes coupling photocatalysis degradation for tc hcl was illustrated in fig 10 firstly after the loaded with co3o4 the ability of visible light absorption of photocatalysts was enhanced and more electron hole pairs could be produced secondly photogenerated electrons was trapped by pms to generate so4 and electron hole pairs recombination was suppressed eq 6 thirdly co3o4 from co bivo4 composites could activate pms to generate so4 and so5 radicals eq 8 9 the above xps results clarified the redox cycle of the co3o4 co2 co3 during the pms activation process lastly the vb potential of co3o4 is higher than the standard redox potential of oh oh 2 4 ev vs nhe so holes on the surface of catalysts were able to react with oh to produce oh or oxidize directly pollutant 50 the so4 and oh species generated from above mentioned approach has strong oxidation properties which can oxidize effectively the target organic pollutant tc hcl reaction process is as follows 5 co bivo4 hν e h 6 hso5 e so4 oh 7 hso5 h so5 h 8 co2 hso5 co3 so4 oh 9 co3 hso5 co2 so5 h 10 2so5 2so4 o2 11 so4 h2o hso4 oh 12 2so4 s2o8 2 13 so4 s2o8 2 so4 2 s2o8 14 oh h oh 15 so4 oh h tc hcl products 3 4 reusability of co bivo4 it is worth noting that the reusability and stability of photocatalyst has a significant influence on the actual application the result of cyclic experiments of co bivo4 composites is shown in fig 11 after four cyclic experiments there was no distinct reduction of tc hcl degradation rate the little reduction might be result from the loss of catalyst during recycling 4 conclusions in this work the high efficiency co bivo4 composites were successfully prepared by wet impregnation method and used for degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl as we can saw that 100 ml 40 mg l tc hcl was completely degraded within only 25 min when combining of photocatalysis and sulfate radical based oxidation processes based on free radicals trapping experiments it was found that so4 was main free radicals for the degradation of tc hcl oh played the minor role on it the results indicated that the introduction of pms and co3o4 suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs moreover the pms not only can be activated by photogenerated electrons but also by co3o4 to generate so4 which leaded to the efficient degradation of tc hcl besides the co bivo4 catalysts show good stability after 4 cycles this work may provide a new insight into the design of catalyst used to combine photocatalysis and sulfate radical based oxidation processes for refractory organic pollutants degradation acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21277108

the excitation light at 280 nm 2 4 degradation experiments of tc hcl photocatalytic activity of samples was investigated by the degradation of tc hcl for reaction photocatalyst sample 20 mg was dispersed in an aqueous solution of tc hcl 100 ml 40 mg l adsorption desorption equilibrium experiments were achieved by magnetically stirring the suspensions in the dark for 30 min afterward pms was added into the solution and the lamp was turned on at certain time intervals 3 ml of samples were withdrawn and methanol were added into samples to quench the radicals then samples were centrifuged to remove the particles visible light source was provided by xenon lamp with a 420 nm uv cutoff filter 420 780 nm the light source is located above the solution and the distance from the light source to solution was around 12 cm the concentration of tc hcl was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at maximum absorption wavelength 357 nm for tetracycline hydrochloride using a uv vis spectrophotometer to investigate the influence of pms concentration 0 5 2 5 8 mm pms were added into the reaction solution respectively in order to detect the free radicals radical scavengers were added into the reactor tert butyl alcohol tba was used for scavenging the oh and methanol meoh was used for scavenging both oh and so4 radicals for the stability and reusability experiments of co bivo4 the samples were collected after reaction and washed by distilled water and pure ethanol for several times respectively and dried at 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the co bivo4 composites the xrd patterns of the co3o4 bivo4 and co bivo4 composites with different ratio of co3o4 are shown in fig 1 for pristine co3o4 it can be seen that entire characteristic peaks can be well indexed into the standard cards of co3o4 pdf 43 1003 for pure bivo4 the characteristic diffraction patterns at 18 8 28 9 30 5 34 8 39 9 42 3 45 8 47 0 50 1 53 2 58 8 59 8 are observed corresponding to the 011 121 040 002 211 051 231 240 202 161 321 and 123 crystalline planes of bivo4 pdf 75 2481 respectively the narrow and sharp diffraction peaks indicates that bivo4 has good crystalline nature and large particle size 40 interestingly the xrd patterns of co bivo4 are similar to that of bivo4 with the increasing co3o4 content the diffraction peaks of bivo4 become weak while no characteristic peaks ascribed to co3o4 are observed which may be ascribed that good dispersion and low content in the composites the survey spectrum and high resolution xps spectra of 5 co bivo4 are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2a 5 co bivo4 composite mainly consists of bi v o co elements fig 2b presents bi 4f peaks the two peaks at 158 58 ev and 163 88 ev can be assigned to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 indicating that bi element are bi3 state 41 the v 2p is shown in fig 2c the two peaks at 516 28 ev and 523 78 ev can be assigned to v 2p3 2 and v 2p1 2 indicating that v element are v5 state 42 the o 1s spectra divided into three peaks at 528 85 ev 529 41 ev and 531 24 ev in fig 2d which may be assigned to the oxygen species of lattice oxygen of co3o4 bivo4 and the adsorbed oxygen respectively 43 44 the co 2p is shown in fig 2e the peaks at 793 38 ev and 795 28 ev are attributed to co3 and co2 of co 2p3 2 and the peaks at 778 78 ev and 780 48 ev are attributed to co3 and co2 of co 2p1 2 respectively besides the peaks at around 805 ev and 788 ev are attributed to satellite peaks of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively notably the binding energy distance of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 is about 15 ev which indicates the existence of the co3o4 phase 45 the morphology of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem it can be clearly seen that the pure bivo4 is peanut shaped micron particles formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles with smooth surface fig 3 a b after the loaded of co3o4 the bivo4 still retains peanut shaped but its surface becomes obviously rough and has a large number of closely connected small nanoparticles fig 3c d in order to further describe the element property composition and distribution of co3o4 species elemental mapping analysis fig 4 a e and the eds spectra fig 4f of 5 co bivo4 were performed respectively it is proved the existence of bi v o and co elements and the mapping image matches well with the sem image moreover the mapping image of co element verifies the uniform distribution of co3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of the bivo4 the uv vis diffuse reflection spectra drs of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 composite was carried out and shown in fig 5 a consistent with the reference bivo4 has an absorption edge at about 540 nm after the loading of co3o4 the absorption edge of 5 co bivo4 shows significant red shift and the continuous absorption of uv and visible light region have become more intense which could be owing to a charge transfer between the metal oxide and bivo4 notably 5 co bivo4 composite has two absorption bands that can be attributed to the two transitions of co3o4 corresponding respectively to edges of o2 co3 excitation and o2 co2 charge transfer 34 this result clearly also confirms the presence of co3o4 in 5 co bivo4 composite apart from that the color of the co bivo4 composites powder also change from yellowish to dark green by enhancing the co3o4 content suggesting that co bivo4 can make better use of visible light as a crystalline semiconductor the band gap value can be measured by the following equation eq 1 1 αhν a hν eg n 2 where hν α eg and a represent the photon energy optical absorption coefficient band gap and proportionality constant respectively additionally n 1 and 4 means that the material is direct semiconductor and indirect semiconductor respectively as shown in fig 5b the calculation of direct energies of pure bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 composite estimated from a plot of αhν 2 versus hν were 2 28 ev and 2 16 ev respectively according to the k m model 46 consistent with the reference the band gap of bivo4 is 2 28 ev 5 co bivo4 in our experiment is 2 16 ev indicating the co3o4 loaded can shorten the band gap of bivo4 to enhance light harvesting and visible light utilization the band edge positions of bivo4 and co3o4 are estimated in this study based on the electronegativity the conduction band cb and valence band vb potentials of bivo4 and co3o4 can be evaluated by the formula as follows eqs 2 and 3 2 ecb x ee 0 5eg 3 evb ecb eg where evb and ecb are the vb and cb potentials x is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor x value for bivo4 is 6 036 ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor according to the uv vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra the band gap energy of bivo4 are 2 28 ev hence the calculated evb and ecb of bivo4 is 2 67 ev and 0 39 ev respectively the pl spectra is an efficient technique to reveal the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs 47 the pl spectra of bivo4 and 5 co bivo4 are shown in fig 6 the 5 co bivo4 sample shows weaker intensity than bivo4 indicating that co3o4 loading can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs so 5 co bivo4 has high photocatalytic activity moreover the phenomenon clearly reveals that the co3o4 and bivo4 form internal contact instead of just cover on the surface of bivo4 3 2 tc hcl degradation 3 2 1 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of bivo4 and the co bivo4 composites were determined by the degradation of tc hcl under visible light irradiation a plot of c c0 versus t is set up where c0 is concentration after adsorption and c is the actual concentration of tc hcl it can be clearly seen in fig 7 a only 30 of tc hcl was degraded after 80 min reaction with pure bivo4 under visible light the photocatalytic activity was improved after modification by co3o4 and 5 co bivo4 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among all samples however when the contents of co3o4 species was increased to 10 photocatalyst exhibited lower photocatalytic activity this may be due to the agglomeration and lower dispersibility of co3o4 species resulting in the low migration and separation rate of the photogenerated charge therefore an appropriate loading level and dispersion of co3o4 in the co bivo4 composites are critical after the reaction for 80 min it was found the degradation date were well consistent with a pseudo first order kinetic in fig 7b according to eq 4 4 ln c c 0 kt where k is the apparent rate constant for the tc hcl degradation min 1 which were obtained from the slope of plot ln c c0 versus t 48 the k value increased gradually when the contents of co3o4 increased from 1 to 5 further increasing the amounts of co3o4 from 5 to 10 the k value of tc hcl decreased it indicated that the 5 co bivo4 sample had the highest photocatalytic activity and was selected for further studies 3 2 2 enhanced degradation of tc hcl as shown in fig 8 a performance comparison between different systems was conducted by the degradation of tc hcl the degradation rate of tc hcl was lightly increased in co bivo4 vis system indicating that the photocatalytic degradation ability of co bivo4 for tc hcl was unsatisfactory if only pms was introduced into system the tc hcl solution could hardly be degraded under visible light the degradation rate of tc hcl was increased in co bivo4 pms system indicating that co bivo4 have potential ability to activate pms tc hcl was more degraded in bivo4 vis pms system indicating photogenerated electron can help pms to produce so4 radicals significantly tc hcl was completely and rapidly degraded in the co bivo4 vis pms system the influence of pms concentration on tc hcl degradation is exhibited in fig 8b when 0 5 mm pms was added the degradation rate of tc hcl increased obviously tc hcl was completely degraded when the pms concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 5 0 mm obviously the higher pms concentration would generate more so4 radicals when pms concentration was increased from 5 0 mm to 8 0 mm only a slight improvement of the degradation rate of tc hcl was observed this was because too many so4 radicals could be scavenged as shown in eq 12 13 it is worth noting that the s2o8 is less reactive than so4s 12 and 13 it is worth noting that the s2o8 is less reactive than so4 is less reactive than so4 thus the degradation rate had only a slight improvement therefore 5 0 mm pms concentration was selected as the most appropriate concentration 3 3 proposed enhanced degradation mechanism to further identify the mechanism of tc hcl degradation free radicals trapping experiments were conducted fig 9 tba was used as an effective radical scavenger for oh while meoh was applied as an effective radical scavenger for both oh and so4 a slightly decrease of tc hcl degradation efficiency was observed after tba scavenger was added in the co bivo4 vis pms system which indicated that the oh was a minor factor contributing to tc hcl degradation by contrast tc hcl degradation efficiency was remarkable reduced when meoh was added indicating that so4 plays an important role in the degradation of tc hcl it is well known that bivo4 and co3o4 are typical semiconductor materials according to the above calculation results evb and ecb of bivo4 are 2 67 ev and 0 39 ev respectively according to previous articles the evb and ecb of co3o4 are 2 44 ev and 0 37 ev respectively 34 hence the potential difference between the two semiconductors created a feasible path which favoring the enrichment of electrons on the surface of bivo4 while the accumulation of holes in co3o4 when the bivo4 is coupled with the co3o4 a heterojunction is formed as demonstrated by the drs and pl results the xps spectra of co 2p on 5 co bivo4 surface before and after reaction were further studied to clarify reaction mechanism fig 2e f the peaks with binding energy positioned at 793 38 ev and 778 78 ev can be attributed to co3 and the peaks with binding energy positioned at 795 28 ev and 780 48 ev can be attributed to co2 the relative area of the four peaks is 43 17 27 and 12 respectively for the xps spectra of co 2p after reaction the peaks with binding energy positioned at 794 38 ev and 779 38 ev can be attributed to co3 and the peaks with binding energy positioned at 796 18 ev and 781 68 ev can be attributed to co2 the relative area of the peaks as mentioned above are 52 18 18 and 10 respectively this variation indicates that the degradation reaction initializes on the surface of co bivo4 whereby the co2 possibly reacted with hso5 and further caused an increase of co3 to maintain the electrons charge balance on the surface of catalyst the co3 would react with hso5 and afterward turned back to co2 this explanation implies a redox cycle of the co3o4 co2 co3 during the pms activation process 49 according to above discussions a synergistic mechanism of advanced oxidation processes coupling photocatalysis degradation for tc hcl was illustrated in fig 10 firstly after the loaded with co3o4 the ability of visible light absorption of photocatalysts was enhanced and more electron hole pairs could be produced secondly photogenerated electrons was trapped by pms to generate so4 and electron hole pairs recombination was suppressed eq 6 thirdly co3o4 from co bivo4 composites could activate pms to generate so4 and so5 radicals eq 8 9 the above xps results clarified the redox cycle of the co3o4 co2 co3 during the pms activation process lastly the vb potential of co3o4 is higher than the standard redox potential of oh oh 2 4 ev vs nhe so holes on the surface of catalysts were able to react with oh to produce oh or oxidize directly pollutant 50 the so4 and oh species generated from above mentioned approach has strong oxidation properties which can oxidize effectively the target organic pollutant tc hcl reaction process is as follows 5 co bivo4 hν e h 6 hso5 e so4 oh 7 hso5 h so5 h 8 co2 hso5 co3 so4 oh 9 co3 hso5 co2 so5 h 10 2so5 2so4 o2 11 so4 h2o hso4 oh 12 2so4 s2o8 2 13 so4 s2o8 2 so4 2 s2o8 14 oh h oh 15 so4 oh h tc hcl products 3 4 reusability of co bivo4 it is worth noting that the reusability and stability of photocatalyst has a significant influence on the actual application the result of cyclic experiments of co bivo4 composites is shown in fig 11 after four cyclic experiments there was no distinct reduction of tc hcl degradation rate the little reduction might be result from the loss of catalyst during recycling 4 conclusions in this work the high efficiency co bivo4 composites were successfully prepared by wet impregnation method and used for degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl as we can saw that 100 ml 40 mg l tc hcl was completely degraded within only 25 min when combining of photocatalysis and sulfate radical based oxidation processes based on free radicals trapping experiments it was found that so4 was main free radicals for the degradation of tc hcl oh played the minor role on it the results indicated that the introduction of pms and co3o4 suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs moreover the pms not only can be activated by photogenerated electrons but also by co3o4 to generate so4 which leaded to the efficient degradation of tc hcl besides the co bivo4 catalysts show good stability after 4 cycles this work may provide a new insight into the design of catalyst used to combine photocatalysis and sulfate radical based oxidation processes for refractory organic pollutants degradation acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21277108 
14234,chitosan alginate nanosorbents were prepared by cross linking of chitosan and alginate with tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride respectively following the water in oil w o microemulsion cross linking technique the prepared nanosorbents were characterized by ftir spectral analysis that provided spectral evidences for interactions between the chitosan and alginate biopolymers and binding of arsenic ions with the nanosorbent the transmission electron microscopy tem revealed that the size of nanosorbent fell into the range of 20 110 nm whereas the scanning electron microscopy sem indicated almost spherical morphology of the nanosorbents the size of the nanosorbents was determined by dynamic light scattering measurements which also confirmed the nanosize of the sorbent particles the nanosorbents were employed for removal of arsenic ions from aqueous solutions and the effect of various experimental conditions such as varying metal ion concentration ph and temperature of the metal ion solutions doses of the nanosorbent and chemical composition of the nanosorbents were studied on the percent removal of arsenic ions the adsorption data was applied to langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models and the kinetics of the adsorption process was also studied a plausible mechanism of adsorption of arsenic ions was also proposed keywords nanosorbents alginate chitosan arsenic removal 1 introduction among various toxic metal ions the arsenic ranks at the top level due to its severe hazardous effects on human lives 1 this metal causes serious physiological disorders such as skin cancer liver kidney and bladder cancers conjunctivitis melanosis hyperkeratosis black foot and the limbs and malignant neoplasm and this is the reason the arsenic has been one of the most studied metal ions by chemists and environmentalists 2 a b the intensity of toxicity of arsenic can be realized from the fact that the maximum contamination limit mcl of arsenic in drinking water has been fixed at 0 5 mg l by the world health organization 3 the major pathway of ingestion of arsenic into human blood is via drinking water which is recognized as a huge sink for this pollutant there are however various sources also that discharge this toxic metal into water bodies and cause environmental pollution the major sources of arsenic include metallurgical operations in smelting of cobalt lead and copper agricultural active agents like arsenic trioxide calcium arsenate as herbicides and lead arsenate as insecticide 4 6 arsenic is also known to function as metabolic inhibitor and develops iron deficiency in the body as far as the toxicity potential of arsenic is concerned it mainly exists in as iii and as v oxidation states whereas the former oxidation state of arsenic occurs as h3aso3 in the reducing environment the later form of arsenic exists as h2aso 4 and haso4 2 in the oxidizing environments it is also known that as iii is more toxic than as v and has greater mobility in the environment 7 the severe toxic effects of arsenic have motivated researchers worldwide to explore new technical know how for its economical and efficient removal from drinking water 8 some of the traditional techniques employed for arsenic removal include filtration sedimentation solvent extraction coagulation foam flotation electrolysis and membrane process 9 15 most of these removal techniques are less efficient time consuming and comparative expensive and moreover the removal efficiency greatly varies with ph of the metal ion solution 16 thus it is essential to have an appropriate removal method that should be fast inexpensive and efficient over a wide range of ph one of the simplest options to achieve such a removal technique is the adsorption method which has been extensively used in removal of toxic metal ions due its ease of simplicity high efficiency cost effectiveness and reusability of the adsorbent for instance alqadami et al designed an adsorbent with unique combination of magnetic nanoparticles and metal organic framework and carried out removal of u vi and th iv ions from aqueous solutions 17 al othman et al 18 prepared activated carbon form peanut shell and studied the removal of cr vi ions through the adsorption technique a new and efficient nanocomposite adsorbents composed of fe3o4 and 3 2 2 aminoethylamino ethylamino propyl trimethoxysilane tas were prepared by alqadami et al 19 following a silanization reaction and removal of cd ii cr iii and co ii ions was studied by carrying out adsorption of these three toxic metal ions onto the newly synthesized adsorbent fe3o4 ats liang et al 20 synthesized composite hydrogel beads of aminopropyltriethoxysilane modified magnetic attapulgite chitosan apts fe3o4 apt cs and studied the adsorption of pb ii the authors observed that the modification of fe3o4 apt improved its adsorption capacity fan et al 21 synthesized core shell nanospheres of polyethylenimine functionalized sodium alginate cellulose nanocrystal polyvinyl alcohol pva sa cnc pei and employed them for the adsorption of diclofenac sodium in another study zhang et al 22 prepared magnetic beads of bentonite carboxymethyl chitosan sodium alginate and studied the adsorption of cu ii ions from aqueous solution although the subject of arsenic removal has been excellently reviewed 23 24 some of the key studies undertaken for the removal of arsenic using different adsorbents may be highlighted as follows deng et al 25 prepared titanium oxide anchored magnetic sheets of iron oxide and investigated the removal of arsenic iii and v ions from aqueous solution di lorio et al 26 synthesized magnetite nanoparticles by partial oxidation of hot iron nitrate solution and studied the removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions the authors reported that the magnetic nanoparticles prepared at ph 6 56 exhibited much higher removal capacity of arsenic verduzco et al 27 prepared solid graphene composites by electrodeposition technique and studied the removal of chromium and arsenic ions from water ma et al 28 fabricated iron oxide coated single walled carbon nanotubes and obtained high adsorption capacity of arsenic ions at ph 4 wang et al 29 prepared magnetic nanoparticles embedded chitosan beads and employed them for the removal of arsenic ions in an interesting study the copolymers of vinyl imidazole and methacrylic acid were synthesized by microwave synthesis and arsenic removal was investigated under different experimental conditions 30 shim et al 31 fabricated manganese oxide impregnated alginate beads and used the prepared nanocomposites for removal of cadmium and arsenic ions the authors reported that the surface area of the prepared adsorbent was twofold higher than that of the native alginate beads the survey of literature reveals that in most of the studies the adsorbents were either the oxide materials or oxide impregnated polymers the use of nanostructures composed of naturally occurring ionic polymers in removal of arsenic are less studied in a study by chen and chung 32 the adsorption of as v and as iii were performed on chitosan by batch and column methods and the effect of various experimental factors on the removal of arsenic was examined an adsorption capacity of 1 9 mg g was reported for as v adsorption the use of alginate an anionic biopolymer for removal of arsenic was attempted by hussain et al 33 and an adsorption capacity of 39 4 mg g was obtained at 20 c the lower values of adsorption capacities of chitosan and alginate respectively led the authors to explore the possibility of getting higher adsorption capacity for arsenic if both the biopolymers are integrated to yield nanoparticles thus the major objectives of the present study include preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles can by water in oil w o microemulsion mediated crosslinking of biopolymers characterization of nanoparticles using analytical techniques like ftir tem and sem edx determination of porosity and surface area and study of the removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions through adsorption under different experimental conditions 2 experimental 2 1 materials sodium alginate and chitosan were purchased from merck india and used as received sodium tri polyphosphate loba chemie mumbai india was used to crosslink positively charged chitosan macromolecules while calcium chloride high media india was used to crosslink alginate polyanion via ionotropic gelation reaction in order to prepare water in oil microemulsion the required oil phase was prepared from liquid paraffin oil merck india other chemicals used such as rhodamine b indicator sodium arsenate potassium iodate were of analytical grade all the required solutions were prepared in bi distilled water 2 2 methods 2 2 1 preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps the chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps were prepared following a microemulsion crosslinking method as reported elsewhere 34 in a typical experiment 2 g chitosan was dissolved in 25 ml acetic acid 2 and 2 g sodium alginate was separately dissolved in 25 ml hot distilled water both the solutions were thoroughly mixed and agitated for 1 h to achieve a completely homogeneous mixture now this aqueous mixture of chitosan and alginate was added to 50 ml of paraffin oil and vigorously shaken for 1 h to prepare a stable w o microemulsion containing small sized aqueous droplets dispersed in oil phase to this stable microemulsion of chitosan and alginate 10 ml each of 1 m sodium tripolyphosphate and 1 m calcium chloride were added dropwise for crosslinking of chitosan and alginate respectively and shaken for 3 h at room temperature after the crosslinking reaction was over the canps were collected at the bottom of the reaction flask which were filtered and cleaned by repeatedly washing with distilled water and acetone the extensively washed nanoparticles were dried at room temperature for a week and stored in air tight polyethylene bags for further study 2 2 2 optimization of nanosorbent size since the purpose of the present study was to prepare the nanosorbent for removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions due emphasis was given to obtain nanoparticles of larger surface area or small dimensions in order to achieve this goal the experimental conditions like time of agitation of aqueous and oil phases and volume ratio of water to oil phases were adjusted in such a way that the size of the prepared chitosan alginate nanoparticles was minimum under the existing experimental protocols 2 3 characterization of canps the as prepared chitosan alginate nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical techniques for determination of size and surface charge of the nanoparticles the dynamic light scattering dls method was used zetasizer zs90 malvern instruments uk the ftir spectra of native chitosan and alginate canps and arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles were recorded on a ftir spectrophotometer shimadzu 2100 the pellets were prepared by grinding the sample with kbr in the ratio 1 10 and the spectra were scanned in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 2 cm 1 the transmission electron microscopy tem was used to study morphology and size of chitosan alginate nanoparticles using a morgagni 268 d transmission electron microscope working with an acceleration voltage of 80 0 kv a dilute dispersion of nanoparticles was prepared in water and a drop was put on formvar coated c grids the elemental analysis and surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using a scanning electron microscope with an electron dispersive x ray spectrometer sem edx jeo jsm 5800lv 2 4 preparation of synthetic adsorbate solution 177 33 mg of sodium arsenate was dissolved in 100 ml distilled water to prepare a stock solution of arsenic v having a concentration of 1 mg ml which was further diluted with distilled water to obtain arsenic solutions of desired concentrations 2 5 adsorption experiments the adsorption of arsenic onto the prepared nanosorbents was conducted following a batch contact method which is a frequently adopted technique for carrying out removal of metal ions 35 in a typical adsorption experiment 10 ml arsenic solution of definite concentration was shaken with 0 03 g canps at definite ph and temperature the shaking was continued for 60 min in a thermostat shaker rivotech india after shaking was over the arsenic ion canps suspension was centrifuged remi india and the amount of arsenic remaining in the supernatant was assayed spetrophotometrically following a reported rhodamine b method 36 the adsorbed amount mg g and percent removal of arsenic were calculated with the help of following equations 1 adsorbed amount c i c f m v 2 r e m o v a l c i c f x 100 c i where ci and cf represent the initial and final concentrations of arsenic solution mg ml respectively v is the volume of arsenic solution and m is weight of the canps nanosorbent 2 6 desorption reuse experiments desorption experiments were performed to check the recovery of arsenic from the arsenic adsorbed chitosan alginate nanoparticles and it was also attempted to determine the reuse potential of the recovered adsorbent for this purpose both the adsorption and desorption experiments were performed successively as follows in a typical experiment 0 5 g of adsorbent was added into 25 ml of as v solution of known concentration and shaken mildly for 2 h so that the arsenic adsorbed onto the adsorbent now the adsorbent was separated by filtration washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature for a week now the dried adsorbent was added to 25 ml of 0 5 m naoh solution and again shaken mildly for 2 h to allow the desorption of arsenic to take place the suspension was filtered and the amount of arsenic present was assayed spetrophotometrically as explained earlier similar type of desorption experiments were carried out with eluants like 0 1 m hcl and 1 nacl solution the desorption was quantified in terms of percent desorption using the following eq 2 3 p e r c e t n d e s o r p t i o n d e s o r b e d a s v mg ml i n i t i a l l y a d s o r b e d a s v mg ml 100 the adsorbent obtained after desorption of arsenic was again tested for adsorption following the adsorption method described previously 2 7 statistical analysis all the experiments were repeated at least thrice and the graphs and data have been expressed along with respective error bars and standard deviations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of canps size since the nanoparticles were prepared following a water in oil microemulsion technique the knowledge about the experimental factors that influence the size of the droplets of the microemulsion is of great significance as it would be helpful in preparing nanoparticles of desired dimension in the present study therefore the effect of agitation tine and volume ratio of aqueous to oil phases on the size of canps was studied as discussed below 3 1 1 effect of agitation time in order to prepare an emulsion of two immiscible liquid phases it is essential to supply mechanical energy to the liquid mixture so that the interphases of the two liquids could be deformed and transformed into droplets the required condition for the formation of droplets is that the supplied mechanical energy must overcome the laplace pressure which is the pressure build up inside the droplet it is also known that the applied external pressure gradient δp and radius of the droplet are related by the following relation 4 r 2 2 γ δ p which reveals that grater the external pressure gradient δp smaller would be the size of the nanoparticles here γ represents the interfacial tension n m kg s2 between the two immiscible liquids 37 it is clear from the above relationship that greater is the external gradient pressure smaller would be the size of nanoparticles in the present study the time of agitation was varied in the range from 20 to 100 min and the size of the chitosan alginate nanoparticles formed was determined the results are shown in fig 1 which clearly indicate that as the agitation time increases from 20 to 60 min the size of nanoparticles decreases from 100 to 60 nm whereas beyond 60 min of agitation time the size of nanoparticles increases up to 150 nm the observed decrease in size of can may be attributed to the fact that as the agitation time increases the emulsion droplets spend more time in the disruption zone of the agitation system thus resulting in fragmentation of the droplets that eventually results in a reduction in the size of nanoparticles similar type of results has also been reported elsewhere 38 at higher agitation time however a small increase in nanoparticles can be noticed which may be explained by the fact that at much higher agitation time it is likely that the smaller droplets coalesce and form bigger droplets which leads to nanoparticles of slightly greater dimension thus in the present study an agitation time of 60 min was chosen for the formation of canps 3 1 2 effect of volume of aqueous and oil phases another factor of great importance is the volume of aqueous and oil phases which also influences the size of droplets and consequently the nanoparticles also in order to study this effect the volumes of aqueous and oil phases was varied in the range 50 to 80 ml at a fixed volume of oil phase and 30 to 60 ml at fixed volume of aqueous phase respectively the results are presented in figs 2 and 3 which respectively indicate that as the volume of aqueous phase increases the size of nanoparticles increases from 70 to 300 nm the observed increase in the size of nanoparticles is also reflected by the tem images shown in the inset of fig 2 the observed increase in the size of canps may be attributed to the reason that with increase in volume of aqueous phase the probability of coalescence of droplets increases with ultimately results in an increase in the size of nanoparticles in case of the oil phase the observed results indicate that the size of nanoparticles decreases from 150 to 70 nm when the volume of oil phase increases from 20 to 50 ml the obtained decrease in the size of nanoparticles may be explained by the fact that with increasing volume of oil phase the chances of coalescence of droplets decreases that results in the reduction in the size of nanoparticles similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 39 an alternate explanation may be that with increase in the volume of oil phase paraffin oil the viscosity of continuous phase increases which restrains the movement of droplets and results in the lower probability of coalescence of droplets it is worth to notice from the figures that the size distribution curves widen with increasing size of the nanoparticles which in turn indicates that polydispersity index also increases with increasing size of the nanoparticles the observed higher polydispersity index may be attributed to the fact that the presence of larger particles results in a wide size distribution profile which is further evidenced from the tem images shown in the inset of fig 2 the optimization of size of nanoparticles led us to choose 50 ml each of aqueous and oil phases with agitation time of 60 min 3 1 3 effect of molecular weight of chitosan the molecular weight of chitosan is expected to exert a significant impact on the size and charge of the produced nanoparticles as a variation in molecular weight of chitosan will certainly affect the reactivity of chitosan to alginate availability of functional groups along the macromolecules diffusivity of chitosan chains into the alginate solution etc in the present study therefore low medium and high molecular weight chitosan were taken and the size and charge of the as obtained chitosan alginate nanoparticles were determined the results are summarized in table 1 which reveals that as the molecular weight of chitosan increases from 48 to 234 kda both the size and positive zeta potential goes on increasing from 80 to 144 nm and 34 6 to 38 6 mv respectively the results also indicate that it is favorable to use low molecular weight chitosan if the nanoparticles are to be used for adsorption purpose the obtained results may be explained by the fact that low molecular weight chitosan chains can properly diffuse into alginate macromolecular network resulting in the formation of nanoparticles with smaller sizes however when the molecular weight of chitosan increases the chitosan chains do not diffuse smoothly into macromolecular network of alginate thus increasing the size of the nanoparticles the positive charge over the chitosan alginate nanoparticles may be attributed to the reason that pka of chitosan is about 6 5 and therefore below this ph the amine groups of chitosan will be in protonated state thus imparting a positive zeta potential to the nanoparticles the increase in positive surface charge with increasing molecular weight is also convincing as greater the molecular weight of chitosan larger will be the number of protonated amine groups thus enhancing the positive zeta potential similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 40 41 3 2 characterization of the chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps 3 2 1 ftir spectral analysis the ftir spectra was used to explore the existing interactions between the arsenic ions and canps and for this purpose the ftir spectra of native chitosan alginate canps and as iii adsorbed canps were recorded and shown in fig 4 a d respectively the spectra a of native chitosan shows a prominent peak at 3424 cm 1 which may be attributed to the mixed impact of stretching vibration of oh extension vibration of nh and the inter hydrogen bonds of the polysaccharide the spectra also exhibits a strong peak at 2922 cm 1 which may be assigned to the ch stretching vibration of the chitosan backbone whereas the two characteristic peaks appeared at 1655 cm 1 and 1599 cm 1 may be assigned to co stretching vibration of nhco amide i along with an nh deformation and bending of nh2 group respectively the spectra a also shows two bands at 1423 and 1381 cm 1 which may be attributed to nh stretching of the amide and ether bonds and nh stretching amide iii band respectively some more characteristic peaks of chitosan may be assigned to 1131 cm 1 1 4 glucosidic bond in polysaccharide unit 1028 cm 1 stretching vibration of coc in the glucose circle and at 1060 and 1015 cm 1 choh in cyclic compounds respectively the spectra b show a band around 1030 cm 1 that may be attributed to coc stretching of saccharide structure of sodium alginate furthermore the peaks appeared at 1617 cm 1 and 1417 cm 1 may be due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of carboxylate salt groups of sodium alginate respectively the spectra c represents canps and shows a broad band at 3448 cm 1 which may be attributed to the fact that due to the reaction of chitosan and alginate the original band of chitosan which appeared at 3424 cm 1 stretching vibration of oh and nh2 has shifted to 3448 cm 1 these spectral changes suggest that the anionically charged carboxylic groups of alginate associate with positively charged ammonium groups of chitosan through electrostatic interactions and form polyelectrolyte complex additional spectral evidences for ionotropic gelation of chitosan with alginate are revealed by shifting of peaks from 1655 cm 1 of chitosan to 1647 cm 1 one can also notice that asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of coo of alginate is shifted to 1543 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 respectively in the spectra d of as iii adsorbed canps it can be seen that the intensity of the peaks assigned to nh group are reduced which suggest that nitrogen atoms are the major active sites for adsorption of as iii an additional evidence for chelation of as iii with nitrogen comes from the shifting of peak of nhco from 1655 cm 1 to 1647 cm 1 the presence of arsenic in the canps is also confirmed by the appearance of a peak around 667 cm 1 3 2 2 tem transmission electron microscopy analysis the tem images of chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps at higher and lower magnifications are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the images clearly reveal that most of the nanoparticles are nearly spherical in shape and have dimensions ranging from 50 to 100 nm these results confirm the formation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles some of the nanoparticles have irregular shape and appear in aggregated state also which is a common phenomenon in nanoparticle systems in the present case since the prepared nanoparticles are comprised of oppositely charged macromolecules the presence of charges of opposite nature could be a cause of their aggregation 3 2 3 scanning electron microscope with electron dispersive x rays spectroscopy sem edx the surface morphology and elemental composition of canps before and after arsenic adsorption are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively the sem image a shows that the nanoparticles have almost spherical shape and are present as highly aggregated state furthermore the surface also seems to have wide pores and cracks which may probably be the cause of efficient adsorption capacity of these nanoparticles a close examination of image b shows that after the adsorption of arsenic ions the surface of nanoparticles acquires more compactness as evident from the disappearance of wide pores and cracks on the surfaces the elemental mapping of the nanoparticles before and after arsenic adsorption was performed by the edx technique and the spectra of canps before and after arsenic adsorption are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively the presence of c o ca and n in the spectra c provides evidences that chitosan and alginate and their respective crosslinking agents are present in the nanoparticles the presence of arsenic in the spectra d confirms its adsorption onto the nanoparticles surfaces the images show that the weight percentage of carbon oxygen nitrogen and arsenic are 49 75 49 46 0 33 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 effect of chemical composition on arsenic removal the phenomenon of adsorption is known to be intimately related to the chemical composition of the adsorbent and therefore in the present work the effect of chemical composition of canps on the removal of arsenic has been studied by varying the amounts of chitosan alginate and respective crosslinking agents in the feed mixture of the nanoparticles 3 3 1 effect of biopolymers in order to see how the chitosan and alginate contents in the nanoparticles affect the potential of arsenic removal of the nanosorbents the amounts of chitosan and alginate were varied from 0 5 to 3 g in the feed mixture while keeping the amount of respective crosslinkers at fixed concentrations the as prepared nanoparticles of respective compositions were studied for their capacity to remove arsenic from aqueous solutions of arsenic of definite concentration the results are presented in fig 7 which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the amounts of chitosan and alginate increase from 0 5 to 1 5 g while beyond 1 5 g of both the biopolymers a fall in the percent removal of arsenic is noticed it is also to notice that in case of alginate the percent removal increases from 66 to 80 percent and thereafter decreases from 80 to 55 percent on the other hand in case of chitosan the percent removal increases from 66 to 80 and then decreases up to 70 percent the observed initial increase in arsenic removal with increasing amounts of chitosan and alginate may be explained by the fact that with increased content of both the biopolymers the number of active sites in the nanoparticles also increases which consequently results in an enhanced adsorption of arsenic and its percent removal also the results also indicate that beyond 2 5 g of chitosan and alginate contents the percent removal of arsenic decreases the observed fall in the arsenic removal may be attributed to the reason that at much higher content of chitosan and alginate the possibility of aggregation of nanoparticles increases with gives rise to nanoparticles of larger dimension and therefore smaller surface area the reduced surface area of nanosorbents clearly results in a decreased percent removal of arsenic in order to support this logic the dimensions of canps were determined for all compositions and the results are presented in fig 7 a which reveals that up to 2 0 g of added biopolymers chitosan and alginate the size of nanoparticles marginally increases while beyond 2 0 g of added chitosan and alginate the size of nanoparticles increases significantly the size of nanoparticles determined from dls measurements has been shown against the respective content of the biopolymers in the graph the obtained significant increase in size of the nanoparticles may be attributed to the reason that after a definite content of biopolymer the charged macromolecular chains repeal each other which results in an increase in size of the nanoparticles the results also support the data of arsenic removal and indicate that smaller the size of nanoparticles greater is the removal of arsenic however the initial low percent removal of arsenic at smaller size of nanoparticles may be attributed to the fact that due to quite low content of biopolymers chitosan and alginate although the surface area may be greater the number of active sites may be less in number which results in lower percent removal of arsenic 3 3 2 effect of crosslinkers in the present work both the inter macromolecular and intra macromolecular type of crosslinking was used for the preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles since the chitosan and alginate are oppositely charged they produce inter macromolecular crosslinking while the tripolyphosphate tpp and calcium chloride cause intra macromolecular crosslinking of chitosan and alginate respectively in this way the role of tpp and calcium chloride becomes significant in controlling the size and other associated properties of the resulting nanoparticles in this study the concentrations of tpp and calcium chloride was varied from 0 5 to 3 0 m and the obtained nanoparticles were used for removal of arsenic ions the results obtained are presented in fig 7 b which indicates that up to a definite concentration of tpp 2 m and calcium chloride 2 m the percent removal increases while beyond these concentrations of tpp and calcium chloride the arsenic removal decreases the observed results may be explained as below in case of tpp the initial increase in its concentration results in greater crosslinking of chitosan thus decreasing their size and resulting in an increase in their surface area this clearly brings about an increase in the percent removal of arsenic however beyond 2 m of tpp their diffusivity into the canps network becomes unlikely and the reduced charges of nanoparticles leads to enhanced probability of their aggregation which results in an increase in their size thus an increase in size of nanoparticles produces a smaller surface area and results in a lower removal of arsenic similar kind of explanation may also be provided for the effect of variation of calcium chloride concentration on the extent of arsenic removal in order to support the logic of change in the size of nanoparticles the nanoparticles were subjected to dynamic light scattering measurements for determining size and the obtained results are shown in fig 7 b which clearly reveal that up to a definite concentration of tpp and calcium chloride 2 m the size of canps decreases while beyond these specific concentrations of crosslinking agents 2 m the size of nanoparticles increases 3 3 3 effect of ph the role of ph is of great significance particularly in those systems in which both the adsorbate and adsorbent are ionic in nature and their ionic charge is highly ph dependent in the present study also the ph exerts a large impact on the charge profiles of arsenic species and chitosan alginate nanoparticles in order to study the ph effect on the percent removal of arsenic the ph of arsenic solution was varied from 2 to 11 and the percent removal of arsenic was determined the results are shown in fig 8 a which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the ph changes from 1 3 to 4 2 and thereafter decrease up to ph 11 6 the obtained results clearly indicate that the percent removal of arsenic is optimum at ph 4 2 the observed dependence of percent removal of arsenic on ph may be explained as below the arsenic v exists in various ionic species in solutions of different ph and these equilibria may be depicted as follows 42 5 h3aso4 h h2aso 4 pk1 2 3 6 h2aso 4 h haso2 4 pk2 6 8 7 haso2 4 h aso3 4 pk3 11 6 it is clear that below ph 2 3 the arsenic exists as unionized h3aso4 while at ph 2 3 it starts dissociating and forms negatively charged h2aso 4 ions which adsorb strongly on the negatively charged chitosan alginate nanoparticles having zeta potential of 31 1 mv upon further increasing ph of the solution the remaining h2aso 4 species dissociates into haso2 and adsorb onto nanoparticles via electrostatic attractive forces as ph of the solution if further increased the number of ionic species of arsenic goes on decreasing thus resulting in a reduced percent removal of arsenic it is interesting to see that at the same time the positive zeta potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles also decreases which results in a continuous decreasing percent removal of arsenic it is also clear from the fig that at ph 11 2 the percent removal drops to just 8 6 which may be attributed to the presence of similar charges over the arsenic species and nanoparticles which because of forces of repulsion results in a significantly low value of arsenic removal similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 43 3 3 4 the effect of adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent present in an adsorption system is quite significant as it not only drastically affects the removal of metal ions but also determines economic viability of the removal process in the present study the amount of chitosan alginate nanoparticles was varied in the range 50 300 mg at a fixed metal ions concentration and the percent removal of arsenic was estimated the results are shown in fig 8 b which clearly reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the nanoparticles dose increases up to 200 mg while beyond 200 mg of added nanoparticles the percent removal slightly decreases the observed increase in arsenic removal may be explained by the fact that addition of increasing amount of nanoparticles provides an enhanced surface area of the adsorbent and number of active sites over the adsorbent surfaces thus greater availability of surface area and number of active sites results in an increased percent removal of arsenic it is however noticed that beyond 200 mg of added adsorbent there is almost no change in the percent removal of arsenic which may be attributed to the reason that due to almost complete removal of arsenic from the solution there is obviously no observable removal of arsenic similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 44 it is also likely that at much greater amount of the added adsorbent the collisions among the arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles may result in desorption of arsenic thus bringing about a small decrease in the percent removal of arsenic the mutual collision of nanoparticles is also likely to result in aggregation of nanoparticles which will provide a smaller surface area to arsenic ions and gives rise to slightly lower removal of arsenic 3 3 5 effect of contact time the effect of contact time between the chitosan alginate nanoparticles and arsenic solution on arsenic removal has been studied by agitating the adsorbate adsorbent system from 10 to 90 min the results are presented in fig 8 c which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases up to 60 min of contact and thereafter a decrease in arsenic removal is noticed the obtained initial increase in percent removal of arsenic may be explained by the fact that as the contact time increases the arsenic and nanoparticles interact with each other for greater time and therefore the removal of arsenic increases this is an expected finding and has been largely reported 45 similar time dependent behavior of adsorption of toxic metal ions has also been reported by naushad et al while studying adsorption of metal ions onto nickel ferrite bearing nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon 46 however beyond 60 min if contact time is further increased the interaction between the arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles and bare nanoparticles may lead to desorption of arsenic which results in a marginal fall in the removal of arsenic 3 3 6 effect of the temperature the role of temperature is quite important in regulating the adsorption of metal ions as a change in temperature affects mobility of metal ions viscosity of the metal ions solution binding forces between the metal ions and adsorbent particles in the present study also the effect of temperature has been investigated on the percent removal of arsenic by varying the temperature of the arsenic solution from 15 to 40 c the results are presented in fig 8 d which clearly shows that when temperature increases from 15 to 30 c the percent removal of arsenic increases whereas a further increase in temperature beyond 30 c the percent removal of arsenic decreases the obtained results may be explained by the fact that in the initial range of temperature increase the mobility of metal ions increases which results in greater interactions between the nanoparticles and arsenic the observed findings suggest that up to 30 c the nature of the adsorption process is endothermic similar type of increase in adsorption of mercury ions has also been reported by naushad et al who studied the adsorption of hg2 ions on the surfaces of the starch sno2 nanocomposites 47 however on increasing the temperature beyond 30 c the binding forces between the nanoparticles and arsenic ions decreases due to increased kinetic energy of the nanoparticles and arsenic which results in a fall in the percent removal similar type of results has also been reported elsewhere 48 3 3 7 effect of the initial metal ion concentration the initial concentration of metal ions prominently affects on its removal by an adsorbent in the present study the effect of initial concentration of arsenic on its removal by has been investigated by varying the concentration of arsenic solution in the range 4 12 μg at fixed dose of the adsorbent and definite temperature the contact time was also fixed at 60 min for all arsenic solutions the results are presented in fig 8 e which shows that the percent removal of arsenic decreases as the concentration of arsenic solution increases in the studied range the obtained results may be explained by the fact that as the concentration of arsenic solution increases the arsenic adsorbent ratio also increases which results in saturation of higher energy sites on the nanoparticles surfaces and thereafter the arsenic occupies the lower energy sites thus lowering the adsorption efficiency of the nanoparticles naushad 49 also observed that in case of adsorption of lead ions onto a nanocomposite cation exchanger the adsorption of lead ions deceases with increasing concentration of metal ion concentration similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 50 3 3 8 desorption and reuse of adsorbent the economic viability of an adsorption process is greatly contributed by the processes of desorption of already adsorbed species and the reusability of the adsorbent in the present study the desorption experiments were performed using 0 1 n hcl 1 nacl and 0 5 m naoh solutions respectively the desorption and reuse of adsorbent for adsorption of as v are summarized in table 2 which reveal that up to 80 recovery of as v can be achieved by using the three eluants the optimum desorption of arsenic is obtained with naoh which may be explained by the fact that in naoh solution the protonated amine groups nh3 get de protonated thus releasing negatively charged as species into the eluant solution similarly in acidic medium 0 5 m hcl the already adsorbed h2aso 4 ions get protonated and convert into h3aso4 molecules and released into hcl medium the reuse of adsorbent freed from already adsorbed as v ions also shows the arsenic removal up to 75 and thus established reuse potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles 3 3 9 adsorption isotherm 3 3 9 1 adsorption isotherm modeling the correlation between the amount of arsenic adsorbed and the equilibrium concentration of the metal ions solution can be best described by adsorption isotherm models in the present study also the adsorption experiments were performed by varying the initial concentration of arsenic solution in the range 4 12 μg ml or 4 12 mg l for the fixed dose of the adsorbent contact time and temperature the adsorption data were dealt with two adsorption isotherm models viz langmuir 51 and freundlich 52 adsorption isotherm equations these models may be mathematically expresses by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m 9 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where ce represents the equilibrium concentration μg ml of arsenic solution qe is the amount of arsenic adsorbed at equilibrium adsorption qm represents the predicted quantity μg ml of arsenic adsorbed kf is the adsorption constant of the freundlich equation and 1 n and 1 b are the langmuir and freundlich constants respectively the results are depicted in fig 9 a and b and the adsorption isotherm parameters are summarized in table 3 which clearly indicate that the adsorption data fits better to langmuir model as compared to freundlich one which is evidenced by the large value of correlation coefficients r2 0 98 of langmuir model in comparison to those for freundlich model the value of adsorption capacity qe at 303 k was found to be 337 8 mg g which is much higher than those obtained for other adsorbents as summarized in table 3 the langmuir adsorption isotherms at 283 and 293 k and the respective adsorption capacities have also been depicted in fig 9 a and table 3 respectively the adsorption capacity of chitosan alginate nanoparticles has been compared with other adsorbents 53 56 and summarized in table 4 it is clear from the data summarized in table 4 that the adsorption capacity is high enough and the biodegradable nature of the adsorbent and its reusability are some of the qualities that favor its application in arsenic removal 3 3 10 adsorption kinetics the progress of the adsorption process often coined as adsorption kinetics is one of the most significant aspects of the adsorption process which regulates the amount of adsorbed species on the time scale and overall determines the efficiency of adsorbent for design operation and optimization in the present work the kinetics of the adsorption of as v onto chitosan alginate nanoparticles has been investigated by applying three kinetic models to the adsorption data viz pseudo first order model lagergren equation and pseudo second order kinetic model represented by the eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 11 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q t where qt and qe represent the amounts of as v adsorbed mg g at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k1 1 min k2 g mg min are the rate constants of first order second order models respectively in order to determine k1 the values of log qe qt are plotted against t not shown and the value of k1 can be calculated in pseudo second order adsorption process the value of k2 and qe can be directly obtained from the intercept and slope of the plot of t qt vs t the kinetic parameters representing first and second order pseudo kinetic models are summarized in table 5 it is clear from the data that the correlation coefficient r2 for the pseudo second order adsorption model is relatively high 99 8 which suggests for the pseudo second order kinetic nature of the adsorption process 3 3 11 mechanism of adsorption in the present study both the chitosan alginate nanoparticles and as v species are of ionic nature and therefore the adsorption of arsenic onto chitosan alginate nanoparticles is purely physical in nature and involves mainly electrostatic interaction between the anionic arsenic species and cationic chitosan groups the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent are depicted in fig 10 3 3 12 adsorption thermodynamics the temperature plays an important role in affecting an adsorption process and in the present investigation the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity of adsorbent has been studied by performing adsorption experiments at temperatures 283 293 and 303 k respectively the thermodynamic parameters like δg δh and δs may be determined with the help of the following eq 12 57 12 δ g r t l n q e c e r t δ h r t δ s r where r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature the values of the thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 6 which reveals that the negative value of δg implies for spontaneous adsorption of as v onto the chitosan alginate nanoparticles the positive values of both δh and δs indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and entropy driven respectively 4 conclusions the inter and intra molecular crosslinking of chitosan and alginate in w o microemulsion by tripolyphosphate tpp and calcium chloride produces nanoparticles of chitosan alginate canps which can be optimized for their sizes by varying the experimental conditions like speed of agitation and volumes of aqueous and oil phases the speed of agitation up to 60 min results in an increase in the size while beyond 60 min the size of nanoparticles decreases the increase in volume of aqueous and oil phases results in an increase and decrease in the size of nanoparticles respectively the size and zeta potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles are affected by the molecular weights of chitosan the small size 80 nm nanoparticles with a positive zeta potential of 34 6 mv are obtained for medium molecular weight of the chitosan the ftir spectral analysis provides evidences for inter and intra macromolecular crosslinking of biopolymer macromolecules in the nanoparticles network the tem sem and edx analysis confirm the nanosize of the particles and their elemental mapping an optimum percent removal of arsenic is obtained at definite content of chitosan alginate and crosslinking agents in the feed mixture the percent removal of arsenic initially increases and thereafter decreases marginally when the adsorbent dose contact time temperature and ph of the arsenic solution are varied in the studied range the removal of arsenic continuously decreases with increasing initial concentration of arsenic solution the adsorption of arsenic follows langmuir isotherm model rather than the freundlich one and the kinetic nature of adsorption process obeys a pseudo second order kinetic scheme furthermore the process of adsorption is spontaneous endothermic and entropy driven in nature declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no conflict of interest of any type 
14234,chitosan alginate nanosorbents were prepared by cross linking of chitosan and alginate with tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride respectively following the water in oil w o microemulsion cross linking technique the prepared nanosorbents were characterized by ftir spectral analysis that provided spectral evidences for interactions between the chitosan and alginate biopolymers and binding of arsenic ions with the nanosorbent the transmission electron microscopy tem revealed that the size of nanosorbent fell into the range of 20 110 nm whereas the scanning electron microscopy sem indicated almost spherical morphology of the nanosorbents the size of the nanosorbents was determined by dynamic light scattering measurements which also confirmed the nanosize of the sorbent particles the nanosorbents were employed for removal of arsenic ions from aqueous solutions and the effect of various experimental conditions such as varying metal ion concentration ph and temperature of the metal ion solutions doses of the nanosorbent and chemical composition of the nanosorbents were studied on the percent removal of arsenic ions the adsorption data was applied to langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models and the kinetics of the adsorption process was also studied a plausible mechanism of adsorption of arsenic ions was also proposed keywords nanosorbents alginate chitosan arsenic removal 1 introduction among various toxic metal ions the arsenic ranks at the top level due to its severe hazardous effects on human lives 1 this metal causes serious physiological disorders such as skin cancer liver kidney and bladder cancers conjunctivitis melanosis hyperkeratosis black foot and the limbs and malignant neoplasm and this is the reason the arsenic has been one of the most studied metal ions by chemists and environmentalists 2 a b the intensity of toxicity of arsenic can be realized from the fact that the maximum contamination limit mcl of arsenic in drinking water has been fixed at 0 5 mg l by the world health organization 3 the major pathway of ingestion of arsenic into human blood is via drinking water which is recognized as a huge sink for this pollutant there are however various sources also that discharge this toxic metal into water bodies and cause environmental pollution the major sources of arsenic include metallurgical operations in smelting of cobalt lead and copper agricultural active agents like arsenic trioxide calcium arsenate as herbicides and lead arsenate as insecticide 4 6 arsenic is also known to function as metabolic inhibitor and develops iron deficiency in the body as far as the toxicity potential of arsenic is concerned it mainly exists in as iii and as v oxidation states whereas the former oxidation state of arsenic occurs as h3aso3 in the reducing environment the later form of arsenic exists as h2aso 4 and haso4 2 in the oxidizing environments it is also known that as iii is more toxic than as v and has greater mobility in the environment 7 the severe toxic effects of arsenic have motivated researchers worldwide to explore new technical know how for its economical and efficient removal from drinking water 8 some of the traditional techniques employed for arsenic removal include filtration sedimentation solvent extraction coagulation foam flotation electrolysis and membrane process 9 15 most of these removal techniques are less efficient time consuming and comparative expensive and moreover the removal efficiency greatly varies with ph of the metal ion solution 16 thus it is essential to have an appropriate removal method that should be fast inexpensive and efficient over a wide range of ph one of the simplest options to achieve such a removal technique is the adsorption method which has been extensively used in removal of toxic metal ions due its ease of simplicity high efficiency cost effectiveness and reusability of the adsorbent for instance alqadami et al designed an adsorbent with unique combination of magnetic nanoparticles and metal organic framework and carried out removal of u vi and th iv ions from aqueous solutions 17 al othman et al 18 prepared activated carbon form peanut shell and studied the removal of cr vi ions through the adsorption technique a new and efficient nanocomposite adsorbents composed of fe3o4 and 3 2 2 aminoethylamino ethylamino propyl trimethoxysilane tas were prepared by alqadami et al 19 following a silanization reaction and removal of cd ii cr iii and co ii ions was studied by carrying out adsorption of these three toxic metal ions onto the newly synthesized adsorbent fe3o4 ats liang et al 20 synthesized composite hydrogel beads of aminopropyltriethoxysilane modified magnetic attapulgite chitosan apts fe3o4 apt cs and studied the adsorption of pb ii the authors observed that the modification of fe3o4 apt improved its adsorption capacity fan et al 21 synthesized core shell nanospheres of polyethylenimine functionalized sodium alginate cellulose nanocrystal polyvinyl alcohol pva sa cnc pei and employed them for the adsorption of diclofenac sodium in another study zhang et al 22 prepared magnetic beads of bentonite carboxymethyl chitosan sodium alginate and studied the adsorption of cu ii ions from aqueous solution although the subject of arsenic removal has been excellently reviewed 23 24 some of the key studies undertaken for the removal of arsenic using different adsorbents may be highlighted as follows deng et al 25 prepared titanium oxide anchored magnetic sheets of iron oxide and investigated the removal of arsenic iii and v ions from aqueous solution di lorio et al 26 synthesized magnetite nanoparticles by partial oxidation of hot iron nitrate solution and studied the removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions the authors reported that the magnetic nanoparticles prepared at ph 6 56 exhibited much higher removal capacity of arsenic verduzco et al 27 prepared solid graphene composites by electrodeposition technique and studied the removal of chromium and arsenic ions from water ma et al 28 fabricated iron oxide coated single walled carbon nanotubes and obtained high adsorption capacity of arsenic ions at ph 4 wang et al 29 prepared magnetic nanoparticles embedded chitosan beads and employed them for the removal of arsenic ions in an interesting study the copolymers of vinyl imidazole and methacrylic acid were synthesized by microwave synthesis and arsenic removal was investigated under different experimental conditions 30 shim et al 31 fabricated manganese oxide impregnated alginate beads and used the prepared nanocomposites for removal of cadmium and arsenic ions the authors reported that the surface area of the prepared adsorbent was twofold higher than that of the native alginate beads the survey of literature reveals that in most of the studies the adsorbents were either the oxide materials or oxide impregnated polymers the use of nanostructures composed of naturally occurring ionic polymers in removal of arsenic are less studied in a study by chen and chung 32 the adsorption of as v and as iii were performed on chitosan by batch and column methods and the effect of various experimental factors on the removal of arsenic was examined an adsorption capacity of 1 9 mg g was reported for as v adsorption the use of alginate an anionic biopolymer for removal of arsenic was attempted by hussain et al 33 and an adsorption capacity of 39 4 mg g was obtained at 20 c the lower values of adsorption capacities of chitosan and alginate respectively led the authors to explore the possibility of getting higher adsorption capacity for arsenic if both the biopolymers are integrated to yield nanoparticles thus the major objectives of the present study include preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles can by water in oil w o microemulsion mediated crosslinking of biopolymers characterization of nanoparticles using analytical techniques like ftir tem and sem edx determination of porosity and surface area and study of the removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions through adsorption under different experimental conditions 2 experimental 2 1 materials sodium alginate and chitosan were purchased from merck india and used as received sodium tri polyphosphate loba chemie mumbai india was used to crosslink positively charged chitosan macromolecules while calcium chloride high media india was used to crosslink alginate polyanion via ionotropic gelation reaction in order to prepare water in oil microemulsion the required oil phase was prepared from liquid paraffin oil merck india other chemicals used such as rhodamine b indicator sodium arsenate potassium iodate were of analytical grade all the required solutions were prepared in bi distilled water 2 2 methods 2 2 1 preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps the chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps were prepared following a microemulsion crosslinking method as reported elsewhere 34 in a typical experiment 2 g chitosan was dissolved in 25 ml acetic acid 2 and 2 g sodium alginate was separately dissolved in 25 ml hot distilled water both the solutions were thoroughly mixed and agitated for 1 h to achieve a completely homogeneous mixture now this aqueous mixture of chitosan and alginate was added to 50 ml of paraffin oil and vigorously shaken for 1 h to prepare a stable w o microemulsion containing small sized aqueous droplets dispersed in oil phase to this stable microemulsion of chitosan and alginate 10 ml each of 1 m sodium tripolyphosphate and 1 m calcium chloride were added dropwise for crosslinking of chitosan and alginate respectively and shaken for 3 h at room temperature after the crosslinking reaction was over the canps were collected at the bottom of the reaction flask which were filtered and cleaned by repeatedly washing with distilled water and acetone the extensively washed nanoparticles were dried at room temperature for a week and stored in air tight polyethylene bags for further study 2 2 2 optimization of nanosorbent size since the purpose of the present study was to prepare the nanosorbent for removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions due emphasis was given to obtain nanoparticles of larger surface area or small dimensions in order to achieve this goal the experimental conditions like time of agitation of aqueous and oil phases and volume ratio of water to oil phases were adjusted in such a way that the size of the prepared chitosan alginate nanoparticles was minimum under the existing experimental protocols 2 3 characterization of canps the as prepared chitosan alginate nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical techniques for determination of size and surface charge of the nanoparticles the dynamic light scattering dls method was used zetasizer zs90 malvern instruments uk the ftir spectra of native chitosan and alginate canps and arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles were recorded on a ftir spectrophotometer shimadzu 2100 the pellets were prepared by grinding the sample with kbr in the ratio 1 10 and the spectra were scanned in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 2 cm 1 the transmission electron microscopy tem was used to study morphology and size of chitosan alginate nanoparticles using a morgagni 268 d transmission electron microscope working with an acceleration voltage of 80 0 kv a dilute dispersion of nanoparticles was prepared in water and a drop was put on formvar coated c grids the elemental analysis and surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using a scanning electron microscope with an electron dispersive x ray spectrometer sem edx jeo jsm 5800lv 2 4 preparation of synthetic adsorbate solution 177 33 mg of sodium arsenate was dissolved in 100 ml distilled water to prepare a stock solution of arsenic v having a concentration of 1 mg ml which was further diluted with distilled water to obtain arsenic solutions of desired concentrations 2 5 adsorption experiments the adsorption of arsenic onto the prepared nanosorbents was conducted following a batch contact method which is a frequently adopted technique for carrying out removal of metal ions 35 in a typical adsorption experiment 10 ml arsenic solution of definite concentration was shaken with 0 03 g canps at definite ph and temperature the shaking was continued for 60 min in a thermostat shaker rivotech india after shaking was over the arsenic ion canps suspension was centrifuged remi india and the amount of arsenic remaining in the supernatant was assayed spetrophotometrically following a reported rhodamine b method 36 the adsorbed amount mg g and percent removal of arsenic were calculated with the help of following equations 1 adsorbed amount c i c f m v 2 r e m o v a l c i c f x 100 c i where ci and cf represent the initial and final concentrations of arsenic solution mg ml respectively v is the volume of arsenic solution and m is weight of the canps nanosorbent 2 6 desorption reuse experiments desorption experiments were performed to check the recovery of arsenic from the arsenic adsorbed chitosan alginate nanoparticles and it was also attempted to determine the reuse potential of the recovered adsorbent for this purpose both the adsorption and desorption experiments were performed successively as follows in a typical experiment 0 5 g of adsorbent was added into 25 ml of as v solution of known concentration and shaken mildly for 2 h so that the arsenic adsorbed onto the adsorbent now the adsorbent was separated by filtration washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature for a week now the dried adsorbent was added to 25 ml of 0 5 m naoh solution and again shaken mildly for 2 h to allow the desorption of arsenic to take place the suspension was filtered and the amount of arsenic present was assayed spetrophotometrically as explained earlier similar type of desorption experiments were carried out with eluants like 0 1 m hcl and 1 nacl solution the desorption was quantified in terms of percent desorption using the following eq 2 3 p e r c e t n d e s o r p t i o n d e s o r b e d a s v mg ml i n i t i a l l y a d s o r b e d a s v mg ml 100 the adsorbent obtained after desorption of arsenic was again tested for adsorption following the adsorption method described previously 2 7 statistical analysis all the experiments were repeated at least thrice and the graphs and data have been expressed along with respective error bars and standard deviations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of canps size since the nanoparticles were prepared following a water in oil microemulsion technique the knowledge about the experimental factors that influence the size of the droplets of the microemulsion is of great significance as it would be helpful in preparing nanoparticles of desired dimension in the present study therefore the effect of agitation tine and volume ratio of aqueous to oil phases on the size of canps was studied as discussed below 3 1 1 effect of agitation time in order to prepare an emulsion of two immiscible liquid phases it is essential to supply mechanical energy to the liquid mixture so that the interphases of the two liquids could be deformed and transformed into droplets the required condition for the formation of droplets is that the supplied mechanical energy must overcome the laplace pressure which is the pressure build up inside the droplet it is also known that the applied external pressure gradient δp and radius of the droplet are related by the following relation 4 r 2 2 γ δ p which reveals that grater the external pressure gradient δp smaller would be the size of the nanoparticles here γ represents the interfacial tension n m kg s2 between the two immiscible liquids 37 it is clear from the above relationship that greater is the external gradient pressure smaller would be the size of nanoparticles in the present study the time of agitation was varied in the range from 20 to 100 min and the size of the chitosan alginate nanoparticles formed was determined the results are shown in fig 1 which clearly indicate that as the agitation time increases from 20 to 60 min the size of nanoparticles decreases from 100 to 60 nm whereas beyond 60 min of agitation time the size of nanoparticles increases up to 150 nm the observed decrease in size of can may be attributed to the fact that as the agitation time increases the emulsion droplets spend more time in the disruption zone of the agitation system thus resulting in fragmentation of the droplets that eventually results in a reduction in the size of nanoparticles similar type of results has also been reported elsewhere 38 at higher agitation time however a small increase in nanoparticles can be noticed which may be explained by the fact that at much higher agitation time it is likely that the smaller droplets coalesce and form bigger droplets which leads to nanoparticles of slightly greater dimension thus in the present study an agitation time of 60 min was chosen for the formation of canps 3 1 2 effect of volume of aqueous and oil phases another factor of great importance is the volume of aqueous and oil phases which also influences the size of droplets and consequently the nanoparticles also in order to study this effect the volumes of aqueous and oil phases was varied in the range 50 to 80 ml at a fixed volume of oil phase and 30 to 60 ml at fixed volume of aqueous phase respectively the results are presented in figs 2 and 3 which respectively indicate that as the volume of aqueous phase increases the size of nanoparticles increases from 70 to 300 nm the observed increase in the size of nanoparticles is also reflected by the tem images shown in the inset of fig 2 the observed increase in the size of canps may be attributed to the reason that with increase in volume of aqueous phase the probability of coalescence of droplets increases with ultimately results in an increase in the size of nanoparticles in case of the oil phase the observed results indicate that the size of nanoparticles decreases from 150 to 70 nm when the volume of oil phase increases from 20 to 50 ml the obtained decrease in the size of nanoparticles may be explained by the fact that with increasing volume of oil phase the chances of coalescence of droplets decreases that results in the reduction in the size of nanoparticles similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 39 an alternate explanation may be that with increase in the volume of oil phase paraffin oil the viscosity of continuous phase increases which restrains the movement of droplets and results in the lower probability of coalescence of droplets it is worth to notice from the figures that the size distribution curves widen with increasing size of the nanoparticles which in turn indicates that polydispersity index also increases with increasing size of the nanoparticles the observed higher polydispersity index may be attributed to the fact that the presence of larger particles results in a wide size distribution profile which is further evidenced from the tem images shown in the inset of fig 2 the optimization of size of nanoparticles led us to choose 50 ml each of aqueous and oil phases with agitation time of 60 min 3 1 3 effect of molecular weight of chitosan the molecular weight of chitosan is expected to exert a significant impact on the size and charge of the produced nanoparticles as a variation in molecular weight of chitosan will certainly affect the reactivity of chitosan to alginate availability of functional groups along the macromolecules diffusivity of chitosan chains into the alginate solution etc in the present study therefore low medium and high molecular weight chitosan were taken and the size and charge of the as obtained chitosan alginate nanoparticles were determined the results are summarized in table 1 which reveals that as the molecular weight of chitosan increases from 48 to 234 kda both the size and positive zeta potential goes on increasing from 80 to 144 nm and 34 6 to 38 6 mv respectively the results also indicate that it is favorable to use low molecular weight chitosan if the nanoparticles are to be used for adsorption purpose the obtained results may be explained by the fact that low molecular weight chitosan chains can properly diffuse into alginate macromolecular network resulting in the formation of nanoparticles with smaller sizes however when the molecular weight of chitosan increases the chitosan chains do not diffuse smoothly into macromolecular network of alginate thus increasing the size of the nanoparticles the positive charge over the chitosan alginate nanoparticles may be attributed to the reason that pka of chitosan is about 6 5 and therefore below this ph the amine groups of chitosan will be in protonated state thus imparting a positive zeta potential to the nanoparticles the increase in positive surface charge with increasing molecular weight is also convincing as greater the molecular weight of chitosan larger will be the number of protonated amine groups thus enhancing the positive zeta potential similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 40 41 3 2 characterization of the chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps 3 2 1 ftir spectral analysis the ftir spectra was used to explore the existing interactions between the arsenic ions and canps and for this purpose the ftir spectra of native chitosan alginate canps and as iii adsorbed canps were recorded and shown in fig 4 a d respectively the spectra a of native chitosan shows a prominent peak at 3424 cm 1 which may be attributed to the mixed impact of stretching vibration of oh extension vibration of nh and the inter hydrogen bonds of the polysaccharide the spectra also exhibits a strong peak at 2922 cm 1 which may be assigned to the ch stretching vibration of the chitosan backbone whereas the two characteristic peaks appeared at 1655 cm 1 and 1599 cm 1 may be assigned to co stretching vibration of nhco amide i along with an nh deformation and bending of nh2 group respectively the spectra a also shows two bands at 1423 and 1381 cm 1 which may be attributed to nh stretching of the amide and ether bonds and nh stretching amide iii band respectively some more characteristic peaks of chitosan may be assigned to 1131 cm 1 1 4 glucosidic bond in polysaccharide unit 1028 cm 1 stretching vibration of coc in the glucose circle and at 1060 and 1015 cm 1 choh in cyclic compounds respectively the spectra b show a band around 1030 cm 1 that may be attributed to coc stretching of saccharide structure of sodium alginate furthermore the peaks appeared at 1617 cm 1 and 1417 cm 1 may be due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of carboxylate salt groups of sodium alginate respectively the spectra c represents canps and shows a broad band at 3448 cm 1 which may be attributed to the fact that due to the reaction of chitosan and alginate the original band of chitosan which appeared at 3424 cm 1 stretching vibration of oh and nh2 has shifted to 3448 cm 1 these spectral changes suggest that the anionically charged carboxylic groups of alginate associate with positively charged ammonium groups of chitosan through electrostatic interactions and form polyelectrolyte complex additional spectral evidences for ionotropic gelation of chitosan with alginate are revealed by shifting of peaks from 1655 cm 1 of chitosan to 1647 cm 1 one can also notice that asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of coo of alginate is shifted to 1543 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 respectively in the spectra d of as iii adsorbed canps it can be seen that the intensity of the peaks assigned to nh group are reduced which suggest that nitrogen atoms are the major active sites for adsorption of as iii an additional evidence for chelation of as iii with nitrogen comes from the shifting of peak of nhco from 1655 cm 1 to 1647 cm 1 the presence of arsenic in the canps is also confirmed by the appearance of a peak around 667 cm 1 3 2 2 tem transmission electron microscopy analysis the tem images of chitosan alginate nanoparticles canps at higher and lower magnifications are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the images clearly reveal that most of the nanoparticles are nearly spherical in shape and have dimensions ranging from 50 to 100 nm these results confirm the formation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles some of the nanoparticles have irregular shape and appear in aggregated state also which is a common phenomenon in nanoparticle systems in the present case since the prepared nanoparticles are comprised of oppositely charged macromolecules the presence of charges of opposite nature could be a cause of their aggregation 3 2 3 scanning electron microscope with electron dispersive x rays spectroscopy sem edx the surface morphology and elemental composition of canps before and after arsenic adsorption are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively the sem image a shows that the nanoparticles have almost spherical shape and are present as highly aggregated state furthermore the surface also seems to have wide pores and cracks which may probably be the cause of efficient adsorption capacity of these nanoparticles a close examination of image b shows that after the adsorption of arsenic ions the surface of nanoparticles acquires more compactness as evident from the disappearance of wide pores and cracks on the surfaces the elemental mapping of the nanoparticles before and after arsenic adsorption was performed by the edx technique and the spectra of canps before and after arsenic adsorption are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively the presence of c o ca and n in the spectra c provides evidences that chitosan and alginate and their respective crosslinking agents are present in the nanoparticles the presence of arsenic in the spectra d confirms its adsorption onto the nanoparticles surfaces the images show that the weight percentage of carbon oxygen nitrogen and arsenic are 49 75 49 46 0 33 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 effect of chemical composition on arsenic removal the phenomenon of adsorption is known to be intimately related to the chemical composition of the adsorbent and therefore in the present work the effect of chemical composition of canps on the removal of arsenic has been studied by varying the amounts of chitosan alginate and respective crosslinking agents in the feed mixture of the nanoparticles 3 3 1 effect of biopolymers in order to see how the chitosan and alginate contents in the nanoparticles affect the potential of arsenic removal of the nanosorbents the amounts of chitosan and alginate were varied from 0 5 to 3 g in the feed mixture while keeping the amount of respective crosslinkers at fixed concentrations the as prepared nanoparticles of respective compositions were studied for their capacity to remove arsenic from aqueous solutions of arsenic of definite concentration the results are presented in fig 7 which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the amounts of chitosan and alginate increase from 0 5 to 1 5 g while beyond 1 5 g of both the biopolymers a fall in the percent removal of arsenic is noticed it is also to notice that in case of alginate the percent removal increases from 66 to 80 percent and thereafter decreases from 80 to 55 percent on the other hand in case of chitosan the percent removal increases from 66 to 80 and then decreases up to 70 percent the observed initial increase in arsenic removal with increasing amounts of chitosan and alginate may be explained by the fact that with increased content of both the biopolymers the number of active sites in the nanoparticles also increases which consequently results in an enhanced adsorption of arsenic and its percent removal also the results also indicate that beyond 2 5 g of chitosan and alginate contents the percent removal of arsenic decreases the observed fall in the arsenic removal may be attributed to the reason that at much higher content of chitosan and alginate the possibility of aggregation of nanoparticles increases with gives rise to nanoparticles of larger dimension and therefore smaller surface area the reduced surface area of nanosorbents clearly results in a decreased percent removal of arsenic in order to support this logic the dimensions of canps were determined for all compositions and the results are presented in fig 7 a which reveals that up to 2 0 g of added biopolymers chitosan and alginate the size of nanoparticles marginally increases while beyond 2 0 g of added chitosan and alginate the size of nanoparticles increases significantly the size of nanoparticles determined from dls measurements has been shown against the respective content of the biopolymers in the graph the obtained significant increase in size of the nanoparticles may be attributed to the reason that after a definite content of biopolymer the charged macromolecular chains repeal each other which results in an increase in size of the nanoparticles the results also support the data of arsenic removal and indicate that smaller the size of nanoparticles greater is the removal of arsenic however the initial low percent removal of arsenic at smaller size of nanoparticles may be attributed to the fact that due to quite low content of biopolymers chitosan and alginate although the surface area may be greater the number of active sites may be less in number which results in lower percent removal of arsenic 3 3 2 effect of crosslinkers in the present work both the inter macromolecular and intra macromolecular type of crosslinking was used for the preparation of chitosan alginate nanoparticles since the chitosan and alginate are oppositely charged they produce inter macromolecular crosslinking while the tripolyphosphate tpp and calcium chloride cause intra macromolecular crosslinking of chitosan and alginate respectively in this way the role of tpp and calcium chloride becomes significant in controlling the size and other associated properties of the resulting nanoparticles in this study the concentrations of tpp and calcium chloride was varied from 0 5 to 3 0 m and the obtained nanoparticles were used for removal of arsenic ions the results obtained are presented in fig 7 b which indicates that up to a definite concentration of tpp 2 m and calcium chloride 2 m the percent removal increases while beyond these concentrations of tpp and calcium chloride the arsenic removal decreases the observed results may be explained as below in case of tpp the initial increase in its concentration results in greater crosslinking of chitosan thus decreasing their size and resulting in an increase in their surface area this clearly brings about an increase in the percent removal of arsenic however beyond 2 m of tpp their diffusivity into the canps network becomes unlikely and the reduced charges of nanoparticles leads to enhanced probability of their aggregation which results in an increase in their size thus an increase in size of nanoparticles produces a smaller surface area and results in a lower removal of arsenic similar kind of explanation may also be provided for the effect of variation of calcium chloride concentration on the extent of arsenic removal in order to support the logic of change in the size of nanoparticles the nanoparticles were subjected to dynamic light scattering measurements for determining size and the obtained results are shown in fig 7 b which clearly reveal that up to a definite concentration of tpp and calcium chloride 2 m the size of canps decreases while beyond these specific concentrations of crosslinking agents 2 m the size of nanoparticles increases 3 3 3 effect of ph the role of ph is of great significance particularly in those systems in which both the adsorbate and adsorbent are ionic in nature and their ionic charge is highly ph dependent in the present study also the ph exerts a large impact on the charge profiles of arsenic species and chitosan alginate nanoparticles in order to study the ph effect on the percent removal of arsenic the ph of arsenic solution was varied from 2 to 11 and the percent removal of arsenic was determined the results are shown in fig 8 a which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the ph changes from 1 3 to 4 2 and thereafter decrease up to ph 11 6 the obtained results clearly indicate that the percent removal of arsenic is optimum at ph 4 2 the observed dependence of percent removal of arsenic on ph may be explained as below the arsenic v exists in various ionic species in solutions of different ph and these equilibria may be depicted as follows 42 5 h3aso4 h h2aso 4 pk1 2 3 6 h2aso 4 h haso2 4 pk2 6 8 7 haso2 4 h aso3 4 pk3 11 6 it is clear that below ph 2 3 the arsenic exists as unionized h3aso4 while at ph 2 3 it starts dissociating and forms negatively charged h2aso 4 ions which adsorb strongly on the negatively charged chitosan alginate nanoparticles having zeta potential of 31 1 mv upon further increasing ph of the solution the remaining h2aso 4 species dissociates into haso2 and adsorb onto nanoparticles via electrostatic attractive forces as ph of the solution if further increased the number of ionic species of arsenic goes on decreasing thus resulting in a reduced percent removal of arsenic it is interesting to see that at the same time the positive zeta potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles also decreases which results in a continuous decreasing percent removal of arsenic it is also clear from the fig that at ph 11 2 the percent removal drops to just 8 6 which may be attributed to the presence of similar charges over the arsenic species and nanoparticles which because of forces of repulsion results in a significantly low value of arsenic removal similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 43 3 3 4 the effect of adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent present in an adsorption system is quite significant as it not only drastically affects the removal of metal ions but also determines economic viability of the removal process in the present study the amount of chitosan alginate nanoparticles was varied in the range 50 300 mg at a fixed metal ions concentration and the percent removal of arsenic was estimated the results are shown in fig 8 b which clearly reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases when the nanoparticles dose increases up to 200 mg while beyond 200 mg of added nanoparticles the percent removal slightly decreases the observed increase in arsenic removal may be explained by the fact that addition of increasing amount of nanoparticles provides an enhanced surface area of the adsorbent and number of active sites over the adsorbent surfaces thus greater availability of surface area and number of active sites results in an increased percent removal of arsenic it is however noticed that beyond 200 mg of added adsorbent there is almost no change in the percent removal of arsenic which may be attributed to the reason that due to almost complete removal of arsenic from the solution there is obviously no observable removal of arsenic similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 44 it is also likely that at much greater amount of the added adsorbent the collisions among the arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles may result in desorption of arsenic thus bringing about a small decrease in the percent removal of arsenic the mutual collision of nanoparticles is also likely to result in aggregation of nanoparticles which will provide a smaller surface area to arsenic ions and gives rise to slightly lower removal of arsenic 3 3 5 effect of contact time the effect of contact time between the chitosan alginate nanoparticles and arsenic solution on arsenic removal has been studied by agitating the adsorbate adsorbent system from 10 to 90 min the results are presented in fig 8 c which reveals that the percent removal of arsenic increases up to 60 min of contact and thereafter a decrease in arsenic removal is noticed the obtained initial increase in percent removal of arsenic may be explained by the fact that as the contact time increases the arsenic and nanoparticles interact with each other for greater time and therefore the removal of arsenic increases this is an expected finding and has been largely reported 45 similar time dependent behavior of adsorption of toxic metal ions has also been reported by naushad et al while studying adsorption of metal ions onto nickel ferrite bearing nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon 46 however beyond 60 min if contact time is further increased the interaction between the arsenic adsorbed nanoparticles and bare nanoparticles may lead to desorption of arsenic which results in a marginal fall in the removal of arsenic 3 3 6 effect of the temperature the role of temperature is quite important in regulating the adsorption of metal ions as a change in temperature affects mobility of metal ions viscosity of the metal ions solution binding forces between the metal ions and adsorbent particles in the present study also the effect of temperature has been investigated on the percent removal of arsenic by varying the temperature of the arsenic solution from 15 to 40 c the results are presented in fig 8 d which clearly shows that when temperature increases from 15 to 30 c the percent removal of arsenic increases whereas a further increase in temperature beyond 30 c the percent removal of arsenic decreases the obtained results may be explained by the fact that in the initial range of temperature increase the mobility of metal ions increases which results in greater interactions between the nanoparticles and arsenic the observed findings suggest that up to 30 c the nature of the adsorption process is endothermic similar type of increase in adsorption of mercury ions has also been reported by naushad et al who studied the adsorption of hg2 ions on the surfaces of the starch sno2 nanocomposites 47 however on increasing the temperature beyond 30 c the binding forces between the nanoparticles and arsenic ions decreases due to increased kinetic energy of the nanoparticles and arsenic which results in a fall in the percent removal similar type of results has also been reported elsewhere 48 3 3 7 effect of the initial metal ion concentration the initial concentration of metal ions prominently affects on its removal by an adsorbent in the present study the effect of initial concentration of arsenic on its removal by has been investigated by varying the concentration of arsenic solution in the range 4 12 μg at fixed dose of the adsorbent and definite temperature the contact time was also fixed at 60 min for all arsenic solutions the results are presented in fig 8 e which shows that the percent removal of arsenic decreases as the concentration of arsenic solution increases in the studied range the obtained results may be explained by the fact that as the concentration of arsenic solution increases the arsenic adsorbent ratio also increases which results in saturation of higher energy sites on the nanoparticles surfaces and thereafter the arsenic occupies the lower energy sites thus lowering the adsorption efficiency of the nanoparticles naushad 49 also observed that in case of adsorption of lead ions onto a nanocomposite cation exchanger the adsorption of lead ions deceases with increasing concentration of metal ion concentration similar type of results has also been reported by other workers 50 3 3 8 desorption and reuse of adsorbent the economic viability of an adsorption process is greatly contributed by the processes of desorption of already adsorbed species and the reusability of the adsorbent in the present study the desorption experiments were performed using 0 1 n hcl 1 nacl and 0 5 m naoh solutions respectively the desorption and reuse of adsorbent for adsorption of as v are summarized in table 2 which reveal that up to 80 recovery of as v can be achieved by using the three eluants the optimum desorption of arsenic is obtained with naoh which may be explained by the fact that in naoh solution the protonated amine groups nh3 get de protonated thus releasing negatively charged as species into the eluant solution similarly in acidic medium 0 5 m hcl the already adsorbed h2aso 4 ions get protonated and convert into h3aso4 molecules and released into hcl medium the reuse of adsorbent freed from already adsorbed as v ions also shows the arsenic removal up to 75 and thus established reuse potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles 3 3 9 adsorption isotherm 3 3 9 1 adsorption isotherm modeling the correlation between the amount of arsenic adsorbed and the equilibrium concentration of the metal ions solution can be best described by adsorption isotherm models in the present study also the adsorption experiments were performed by varying the initial concentration of arsenic solution in the range 4 12 μg ml or 4 12 mg l for the fixed dose of the adsorbent contact time and temperature the adsorption data were dealt with two adsorption isotherm models viz langmuir 51 and freundlich 52 adsorption isotherm equations these models may be mathematically expresses by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m 9 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where ce represents the equilibrium concentration μg ml of arsenic solution qe is the amount of arsenic adsorbed at equilibrium adsorption qm represents the predicted quantity μg ml of arsenic adsorbed kf is the adsorption constant of the freundlich equation and 1 n and 1 b are the langmuir and freundlich constants respectively the results are depicted in fig 9 a and b and the adsorption isotherm parameters are summarized in table 3 which clearly indicate that the adsorption data fits better to langmuir model as compared to freundlich one which is evidenced by the large value of correlation coefficients r2 0 98 of langmuir model in comparison to those for freundlich model the value of adsorption capacity qe at 303 k was found to be 337 8 mg g which is much higher than those obtained for other adsorbents as summarized in table 3 the langmuir adsorption isotherms at 283 and 293 k and the respective adsorption capacities have also been depicted in fig 9 a and table 3 respectively the adsorption capacity of chitosan alginate nanoparticles has been compared with other adsorbents 53 56 and summarized in table 4 it is clear from the data summarized in table 4 that the adsorption capacity is high enough and the biodegradable nature of the adsorbent and its reusability are some of the qualities that favor its application in arsenic removal 3 3 10 adsorption kinetics the progress of the adsorption process often coined as adsorption kinetics is one of the most significant aspects of the adsorption process which regulates the amount of adsorbed species on the time scale and overall determines the efficiency of adsorbent for design operation and optimization in the present work the kinetics of the adsorption of as v onto chitosan alginate nanoparticles has been investigated by applying three kinetic models to the adsorption data viz pseudo first order model lagergren equation and pseudo second order kinetic model represented by the eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 11 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q t where qt and qe represent the amounts of as v adsorbed mg g at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k1 1 min k2 g mg min are the rate constants of first order second order models respectively in order to determine k1 the values of log qe qt are plotted against t not shown and the value of k1 can be calculated in pseudo second order adsorption process the value of k2 and qe can be directly obtained from the intercept and slope of the plot of t qt vs t the kinetic parameters representing first and second order pseudo kinetic models are summarized in table 5 it is clear from the data that the correlation coefficient r2 for the pseudo second order adsorption model is relatively high 99 8 which suggests for the pseudo second order kinetic nature of the adsorption process 3 3 11 mechanism of adsorption in the present study both the chitosan alginate nanoparticles and as v species are of ionic nature and therefore the adsorption of arsenic onto chitosan alginate nanoparticles is purely physical in nature and involves mainly electrostatic interaction between the anionic arsenic species and cationic chitosan groups the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent are depicted in fig 10 3 3 12 adsorption thermodynamics the temperature plays an important role in affecting an adsorption process and in the present investigation the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity of adsorbent has been studied by performing adsorption experiments at temperatures 283 293 and 303 k respectively the thermodynamic parameters like δg δh and δs may be determined with the help of the following eq 12 57 12 δ g r t l n q e c e r t δ h r t δ s r where r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature the values of the thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 6 which reveals that the negative value of δg implies for spontaneous adsorption of as v onto the chitosan alginate nanoparticles the positive values of both δh and δs indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and entropy driven respectively 4 conclusions the inter and intra molecular crosslinking of chitosan and alginate in w o microemulsion by tripolyphosphate tpp and calcium chloride produces nanoparticles of chitosan alginate canps which can be optimized for their sizes by varying the experimental conditions like speed of agitation and volumes of aqueous and oil phases the speed of agitation up to 60 min results in an increase in the size while beyond 60 min the size of nanoparticles decreases the increase in volume of aqueous and oil phases results in an increase and decrease in the size of nanoparticles respectively the size and zeta potential of chitosan alginate nanoparticles are affected by the molecular weights of chitosan the small size 80 nm nanoparticles with a positive zeta potential of 34 6 mv are obtained for medium molecular weight of the chitosan the ftir spectral analysis provides evidences for inter and intra macromolecular crosslinking of biopolymer macromolecules in the nanoparticles network the tem sem and edx analysis confirm the nanosize of the particles and their elemental mapping an optimum percent removal of arsenic is obtained at definite content of chitosan alginate and crosslinking agents in the feed mixture the percent removal of arsenic initially increases and thereafter decreases marginally when the adsorbent dose contact time temperature and ph of the arsenic solution are varied in the studied range the removal of arsenic continuously decreases with increasing initial concentration of arsenic solution the adsorption of arsenic follows langmuir isotherm model rather than the freundlich one and the kinetic nature of adsorption process obeys a pseudo second order kinetic scheme furthermore the process of adsorption is spontaneous endothermic and entropy driven in nature declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no conflict of interest of any type
