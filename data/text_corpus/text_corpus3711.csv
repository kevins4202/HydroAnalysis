18555,constructed wetlands coupled with a micro electric field cw mef is a novel and efficient water treatment technology the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism and performance of trace metals tms removal for cw mef systems during summer and winter the mass distribution of tms in plants and biofilms physiological indices of wetland plants and bacterial community structures on electrodes and in the rhizospheres were analyzed as well as to explore further the tm removal mechanism results show that the electric field intensities efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 had a significantly promoting effect on tm removal maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co ni and pb were 95 6 80 1 74 0 67 1 69 8 and 99 6 respectively in summer with a 5d hydraulic retention time hrt an efi of 100 mv cm 1 could alleviate the oxidative damage in plant cells by promoting the synthesis of reduced glutathione and an activity increase of catalase thus increasing the phytoextraction for cu zn and cd for biofilms the mef caused shifts in the bacterial community structures and an efi of 50 to 200 mv cm 1 significantly promoted the enrichment of cu zn cd and co by biofilms moreover microorganisms related to tm tolerance and enrichment exhibited a high abundance with an efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 it can be concluded that introducing mef to cws could intensify the tms removal via the biological process and result in more efficient purification for tm containing wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords trace elements electrokinetic remediation phytoremediation biofilm accumulation wastewater 1 introduction water contamination by trace metals tms poses a serious threat to the survival of human beings and aquatic organisms rajeshkumar et al 2018 due to the characteristics of tm pollution such as permanent pollution and slow removal it is necessary to find an efficient and low cost treatment method for cleaning tm containing wastewater fu and wang 2011 constructed wetlands cws are reliable wastewater treatment technology with low investment and low energy consumption here the substrates wetland plants and acclimated microbial communities have the potential to remove a wide variety of pollutants including tms vymazal 2014 the removal mechanism for metals in wetland mesocosm is complex and including interactions between substrates wetland plants biofilms and pollutants in water galletti et al 2010 maine et al 2009 although the substrates such as limestone zeolite gravel and sodium titanate nanofiber are verified removal potential for tms lizama allende et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 the tms removal by substrates is unsustainable after saturated adsorption therefore the major pathway for tm removal in cws is a biological process the wetland plants and biofilms are the two major factors affecting tm removal efficiency in cws dunbabin and bowmer 1992a guo et al 2017 phytoremediation is considered to be a powerful possibility for tm removal in cw systems the tms removal by wetland plants varies widely associated with plant species plant physiological status and tm concentrations in the contaminated water rezania et al 2016 yadav et al 2012 previous studies had reported that plants of typha latifolia pistia stratiotes carex aquatilis phragmites australis alisma plantago aquatica showed considerable removal efficiencies for tms in wastewater calheiros et al 2008 sardar et al 2009 the technique of phytoremediation is typically used together with bioremediation which microorganisms in biofilms remove tms from wastewater by valence transformation extracellular biosorption and or bioaccumulation pani et al 2017 consequently the richness and species diversity of microbial communities are related to tms removal efficiency arroyo et al 2013 garbisu and alkorta 2003 in a wetland mesocosm the rhizosphere effect of wetland plants generally results in a shift in the microbial community structure clairmont et al 2019 accordingly several rhizosphere microorganisms are involved in alleviating tm stress on plants and promote plant growth el meihy et al 2019 mishra et al 2017 over the past research for tm removal via cws mainly focus on the screening of hyperaccumulator for tm the selecting of wetland substrates with efficient tms adsorption performance and the optimizing for structure and operation conditions of cws galletti et al 2010 maine et al 2009 pedescoll et al 2015 rezania et al 2016 whereas to improve the tm removal efficiency from wastewater using assistant technology is still rarely reported in cws electrokinetic remediation has been successfully utilized to the purification of trace metal contaminated soil ma et al 2018 selvi and aruliah 2018 vocciante et al 2017 wang et al 2018 but with scarce reference to the remediation of metal contained wastewater previously studies have shown that the plant physiological status could be affected by the electric field particularly in regulating the activity of antioxidant defense systems dannehl 2018 he et al 2017 moreover the microbial community structure in a bioreactor could be changed with the presence of an electric field which lead to more efficient and improved reactors for the removal of nh4 h no3 n and cod and po4 3 elnaker et al 2019 ju et al 2014 zeyoudi et al 2015 since the plant physiological status microbial communities as well as nutrients removal efficiencies were all affected by an electric field it is reasonable to speculate that the trace metal removal performance could be regulated by an electric field for a cw to date the promoting effect of electric field on cu zn and cd removal has been detected in a subsurface flow cws song et al 2011 and they inferred that the increasing removal performance of tm attributed to the improvement of wetland plant s ability to resist adverse environmental conditions however the tms enrichment and transportation characteristic for wetland plant and the shifts in microbial communities under the stress of tms still need to be investigated in an electric field coupled cw herein continuously operated cws were developed to investigate the tms cu zn cd co ni and pb removal mechanism and performance the main work are 1 to examine the seasonal performances summer and winter of mef cws on the treatment of tm polluted wastewater 2 to evaluate the correlation between tm removal and water quality parameters operating conditions and nutrient consumption in the mef cws 3 to characterize the distribution of tms in cws and 4 to clarify the effects of mef on physiological responses of wetland plants and shifts in bacterial community structure under the tms stress 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental devices and operating conditions black polyethylene plastic containers height 20 cm inner diameter 22 cm were used to simulate vertical down flow cws figs 1a and s1 each container was divided into three layers with an average porosity of 32 a gravel layer particle size 4 6 mm of 4 cm thickness was firstly filled on the bottom followed by a layer of quartz sand particle size 0 5 1 mm of 10 cm and finally a 4 cm layer of gravel particle size 4 6 mm was put on top graphite rods gr 1 cm diameter by 20 cm length jinglongtetan ltd china were used as electrodes for cathode and anode the electrode distance was 20 cm and both electrodes were inserted into the bottom of the container the electrodes were connected with copper wires with the positive and negative contacts respectively of the dc power supply aps3005si atten china the wetland plant type scirpus validus vahl was purchased from the local flower market songjiang district shanghai the plants were then cultured hydroponically for 15 days with hoagland s nutrient solution in a humidity climate incubator bic 250 boxun china after that the disease free emergent plants of similar height approximately 80 cm and fresh weight approximately 350 g were planted between anode and cathode the continuously stirring tank consisted of a black opaque plastic tank with an effective volume of 250 l a blender stirring speed 35 r min 1 placed on the top of the tank was used to prepare homogenized simulated wastewater fig 1 b the influents of all the cws were continuously and uniformly fed onto the surface of the cws by a multi channel peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer china a total of 15 constructed wetlands were divided into 5 experimental groups 3 replicates each micro electric fields of 0 50 100 or 200 mv cm 1 were applied to constructed wetlands cw 0 cw 50 cw 100 and cw 200 which had been planted with scirpus validus vahl ck cw was left unplanted and without micro electric field application as the control fig 1b all experimental devices were placed on an open air balcony north facing of the college building at donghua university the experiment lasted over 8 months from july 2016 to february 2017 it was divided into five campaigns acclimation period before summer sampling 30 days in july 2016 summer sampling period average air temperature approximately 30 c from august to september 2016 autumn period from october to november 2016 acclimation period before winter sampling 30 days in december 2016 and winter sampling period average air temperature approximately 7 c from january to february 2017 the same simulated wastewater was used in the acclimation and sampling periods while simulated wastewater without tm cu zn cr co ni and pb was used in the autumn period moreover five hydraulic retention times 0 5 1 2 4 5 day were tested during each sampling period and each hrt was repeated three times simulated wastewater was prepared with distilled water and the details are shown in supporting information text s1 briefly the concentrations of cu zn cd ni and pb were higher than the emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21900 2008 while the influent co concentration was higher than the emission standards for pollutants of china gb25467 2010 2 2 sample collection effluents were collected from the bottom of the reactors through a perforated plastic pipe with each sampling approximately 1 0 l effluent was collected into a polyethylene bottle after 8 months of experiment the plants were harvested and divided into rhizomes and stems plant tissues were rinsed with distilled water to remove adsorbed tms and biofilms from the surface stems 0 5 g fresh weight fw were collected for physiological analysis the substrates in the cws were also collected for analysis of tm concentrations biofilms associated with the rhizospheres anodes and the cathodes in the duplicated cws were extracted by a modified method according to previously described lv et al 2017 10 g substrate was dispersed in 100 ml of phosphate buffer solution 10 mmol l 1 ph 7 0 in a 250 ml sterilized conical flask the conical flask was shaken subsequently in a thermostated oscillator at 150 r min 1 for 1 h at 4 c the suspension was used further for genomic dna extraction the biofilm samples of anodes cathodes and rhizosphere for pyrosequencing were collected from triplicate cws and mixed to homogenize for dna extraction and further bacterial communities analysis and the procedure and primers used were shown in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the ph do and electrical conductivity ec of influent and effluent were measured immediately with a dual probe multi parameter meter hq40d hach usa cod was measured by a multi parameter portable colorimeter dr900 hach usa a spectrometry with nessler s reagent to measure the nh4 n concentration was used effluent no3 n was measured according to the standard method gb3838 2002 with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 2000 unico china tms in substrates were extracted by an optimized three step sequential extraction procedure while for plant tissues were oven dried and extracted using microwave digestion method pueyo et al 2001 török et al 2015 an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap rq icp ms thermo scientific usa was used to measure the concentrations of the tms measurements of reduced glutathione gsh soluble protein malondialdehyde mda and the antioxidant enzymes including peroxidase pod catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod were using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from mlbio biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and performed with a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo fisher usa 2 4 calculation and data analysis the bioconcentration factors bcfs l kg 1 were calculated as follows 1 bcf cp cs where cp is the metal concentration mg kg 1 in plants and cs is the metal concentration mg kg 1 in the wetland substrates respectively a high bcf value indicates an improved phytoextraction capability macfarlane et al 2007 2 5 the translocation factors tfs were calculated as 2 tf cst cr where cst and cr are the metal concentrations mg kg 1 in stems and rhizomes respectively a high tf value implies an increased translocation capability for tm yeh et al 2009 statistical analyses were done using spss 20 0 the one way anova test was used to compare the tm removal physiological index of plants water quality parameters ph and do and nutrient nh4 n no3 n and cod removal efficiency in different cws significant differences were assessed by duncan s multiple range test at the 0 05 significance level the student t test was used to compare mass distribution differences in plant tissues and biofilms for the same metal the relations between tm removal and water quality parameters operating conditions and nutrient removal efficiencies for different experimental groups and seasons were compared by the principal component analyses pca using spss 20 0 principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance and calculation of alpha diversity indices was performed by qiime software to assess the differences of microbial communities in different samples a heatmap graph based on microbial community compositions at genus level was generated via pheatmap package in r software version 3 3 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of tms as shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were improved considerably by the application of a mef and increased with the hrt throughout the experiments moreover the tms were better removed in the summer period than in the winter period compared with the unplanted control cw ck all planted cws showed statistically increased tm removal efficiencies at five hrts in the summer period the removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were 69 3 95 6 52 9 80 1 15 8 74 0 19 5 67 1 18 2 69 8 respectively for a 5d hrt cw 100 produced the maximum removal efficiencies for cu co and ni the maximum cd and zn removal efficiencies were observed in cw 200 moreover the pb removal efficiency was greater than 94 0 in all cws at various hrts whereas the application of different efi showed no significant effect on the pb removal p 0 05 during the winter campaign the maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were in cw 100 at the hrt of 5 days they decreased by 31 5 33 3 30 5 40 4 and 43 2 as compared with the corresponding values for the summer period for pb the removal efficiency ranged from 86 2 cw ck to 99 6 cw 100 at a 5d hrt thus the pb removal efficiency was not significantly lower than that in the summer period however all cws in the winter period produced a lower pb removal efficiency compared with the summer period at the hrts of 0 5 1 2 and 4 days compared with the unplanted cw ck an effective tm removal occurred in the planted cw reactors this indicates that phytoextraction is a crucial factor for tm removal dunbabin and bowmer 1992b for each cw reactor the metal removal performance was affected by seasonal changes table s1 during the summer period the effluent concentrations for cu zn ni and pb from cw mef can meet the emission standards for electroplating of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb 21900 2008 more concretely the effluent pb concentration met the emission standards at 0 5d hrt in all experimental groups the cu concentrations in the effluent of all planted cws met the emission standards at 1d hrt the effluent zn and ni concentrations both met the emission standards at 5d hrt with an efi of 100 mv cm 1 and the effluent zn concentration can also meet the discharge standard with an efi of 200 mv cm 1 moreover the effluent co concentrations met the emission standards for pollutants of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb25467 2010 with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 however the cd purification efficiency was not satisfactory the effluent cd concentration exceeded the emission standards in all experimental groups similarly a decreasing removal performance for cd than that for cu zn and pb was also observed in previous research using semi natural wetland maddison et al 2009 during winter although the mef considerably intensified the tm removal performance in cw reactors only the effluent pb concentration met emission standards among all experimental groups this can be ascribed to the senescence of the wetland plants and a reduced microbial activity due to the low temperature bhargava et al 2012 kadlec and reddy 2001 3 2 correlation between metal removal and other influencing factors the average ph significantly p 0 05 increased from 6 2 0 1 in the influent to 7 0 0 1 in the effluent meanwhile effluents also showed higher ec values than the influents whereas the average do significantly decreased p 0 05 from 11 9 0 6 to 6 1 0 7 mg l 1 fig s2 the effluent ph and do values were not significantly different p 0 05 for the 5 treatment groups and remained almost unaffected by the different hrts while the ec values increased with an increasing hrt concentrations for nh4 n no3 n and cod were 7 5 0 4 mg l 1 44 3 1 7 mg l 1 and 64 7 3 1 mg l 1 respectively in the influent throughout the experiment in general all treatment groups exhibited a relatively higher removal performance for nh4 n no3 n and cod in the summer than in the winter period the highest nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiencies in the summer period 49 2 and 57 4 respectively and winter period 36 2 and 32 6 respectively were achieved in cw 100 at 5d hrt a significantly higher nh4 n and no3 n removal performance was observed in the planted cws than in the unplanted ones fig s3 in addition all treatment groups had a high cod removal performance at 81 4 98 8 during the summer period and 80 2 97 8 during the winter period fig s4 the correlation between tm removal and operating conditions efi and hrt water quality ph do and ec and nutrient cod nh4 n and no3 n removal were assessed by principal component analysis pca pca analysis during the summer period is shown in fig 3 a a strong positive correlation was detected for cd ni and co removal with nh4 n and no3 n removal the zn removal showed a strong positive correlation with cod removal however the cu and pb removal exhibited a weak correlation with the removal of nutrients moreover the tms of ni cd zn and co had a positive correlation with efi hrt and ec during the winter period the tm removal was strongly positively correlated with nutrient removal cod nh4 n and no3 n while efi showed a lower level of correlation with tm removal compared with that in the summer period fig 3b also ph and do had low levels of correlation with tm removal both in winter and summer periods 3 3 distribution characteristics of tms in cws tm accumulation in plant tissues and biofilms was analyzed after the winter sampling period table 1 wetland plants in different experimental groups showed a similar dry weight of rhizomes and stems fig s5 in general the accumulation of various tms in biofilms was higher than those in plant tissues rhizomes stems meanwhile the quantities of tms in rhizomes were higher than those in stems this finding was consistent with the tms bioaccumulation characteristic for phragmites australis bonanno and lo giudice 2010 moreover the quantities of various tms in stems showed no significant differences for the planted cws the rhizomes in cw 100 produced a significantly higher extraction performance for cu zn and cd than other ones the rhizomes in cw 0 cw 50 and cw 100 had similar contents of co ni and pb in addition the rhizomes in cw 200 had the lowest extraction performance for various tms the enrichment of cu zn cd and co in biofilms was significantly improved with an increase of efi the contents of cu zn cd and co in the biofilm of cw 200 were 1 3 1 4 1 3 and 2 0 times over those in cw 0 respectively a similar content of pb in biofilms of cw 0 cw 50 and cw 100 was detected while the maximum pb content in a biofilm was observed for cw 200 the contents of ni in the biofilms of cw 0 and cw 50 were quite similar however the ni contents in the biofilms of cw 100 and cw 200 were 4 2 and 5 1 times increased over those of cw 0 respectively phytoextraction is considered to be a process for tm removal however the tm accumulation and translocation capability of plants were affected by the external mef long et al 2011 a previous study reported that an external electric field promoted the accumulation of cu pb and zn in the roots of plant luo et al 2019 the present study also found that an efi of 100 mv cm 1 significantly promoted the accumulation of cu zn and cd in rhizomes of scirpus validus vahl however tm accumulation was inhibited in rhizomes by an efi of 200 mv cm 1 table 1 thus a high efi can cause a reduced tm accumulation in plant rhizomes previous research also reported that although a dc electric field had a positive effect on accelerating cd cu and pb uptake by the roots of plant the tm transport from roots to shoots was not promoted luo et al 2018 this finding corresponds well with the data of our present study that different efis had no promoting effect on tm transfer from rhizomes to aerial parts of scirpus validus vahl table 1 the bcfs and tfs of wetland plants in the planted cws are presented in table 2 a high bcf value is related to an enhanced phytoaccumulation capability the largest bcf values for zn cd co ni and pb in the plants were obtained in cw 0 while the largest bcf values for cu were achieved in cw 100 and cw 0 furthermore the lowest bcf values for various tms in plants were obtained in cw 200 in contrast the tf values for various tms in plants of cw 200 were higher than those in the other cws considering that a mef may affect the tm enrichment efficiency of wetland plants and biofilms simultaneously cameselle and gouveia 2019 the bcf and tf values in this study cannot be used to assess the effects of a mef on phytoremediation for instance the lowest bcf value for cu was obtained in cw 200 this was due to the fact that the efi of 200 mv cm 1 promoted the enrichment of cu in biofilms but the cu enrichment by rhizomes was reduced based on the data for cu contents in stems between different experimental groups table 1 the mef had no effect on the tm translocation from the rhizomes to aerial parts however an efi of 200 mv cm 1 allowed the largest tf value for cu which was caused by the decreased accumulation capacity of cu in rhizomes also tms were enriched more in biofilms than in plant tissues under the stimulation of a mef table 2 hence the bcf values for zn cd co ni and pb were decreasing with the increase of the efi table 2 in addition the largest tf value for tms in cw 200 was also due to the low tm enrichment efficiency in rhizomes 3 4 physiological indices of wetland plants plant senescence was observed during the winter period therefore physiological indices of oxidation damage characterization by mda contents antioxidants characterization by gsh contents and antioxidant enzymes pod sod and cat were investigated only after the summer period as shown in fig 4 the mda contents in the stems of scirpus validus vahl treated with different efi 0 50 and 200 mv cm 1 respectively were similar fig 4a while the plants in cw 100 had a remarkable lower mda content than those of the other groups the gsh contents in the plants of cw 100 were by 11 6 statistically lower than those of cw 0 however no significant differences of gsh contents in the plants of cw 50 cw 200 and cw 0 were measurable fig 4b the soluble protein contents in the plants of cw 50 cw 100 and cw 200 were significantly lower than the one in cw 0 which was run without mef application the values were 34 6 62 8 and 21 8 reduced respectively fig 4c plant antioxidant enzymes including pod cat and sod play a vital role for the response to environmental stress gong et al 2017 the results show that the pod and sod activity in plants of cw 100 and cw 200 was remarkably lower than in cw 0 fig 4d and e the cat activity in cw 50 and cw 100 was significantly higher than in cw 0 however the cat activity in plants of cw 0 and cw 200 was not statistically different fig 4f according to the physiological indices of scirpus validus vahl stems fig 4 an external mef of 100 mv cm 1 alleviated the mda accumulation in plant cells it is reasonable to infer that the increasing tm removal performance in plants of cw 100 was due to the alleviation of the oxidative stress for plant cells by the external mef 100 mv cm 1 song et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 the antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants which are involved in stress response were also strongly affected by the external electric field berni et al 2018 dannehl 2018 in the present research values for pod activities were found to be much higher in the plant cells of cw 0 than those under the cw mef system however the gsh contents were remarkably enhanced at 100 mv cm 1 thus it seems likely that the mechanism of stress response to tms in plant cells was changed by the application of a mef dannehl et al 2009 in the absence of an electric field an alleviation of tm stress in plant cells was achieved probably by increasing the content of intracellular soluble proteins and the enhancement of the activities for pod and sod ozuna et al 2018 however the oxidative damage of plant cells in a cw mef system was alleviated by synthesizing gsh and an activity increase of cat 3 5 diversity analysis of bacterial communities a comparison of the alpha diversity indices of the bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere and electrodes in the triplicated cws is shown in table 3 briefly the application of a mef increased species evenness but decreased species richness of the bacterial communities on anode cathode and rhizosphere samples a comprehensive analysis of α diversity indices revealed that the presence of wetland plants had an active role in the enhancement of the bacterial biodiversity berendsen et al 2012 this finding was also observed for wetland microbial fuel cell systems planted with j effuses t orientalis and s validus wang et al 2017 according to the mass distribution of tms in cws table 1 the accumulation by biofilms removed a large amount of cu zn cd co and pb from simulated wastewater additionally the accumulation of cu zn cd and co in biofilms was enhanced significantly by the efi of 50 200 mv cm 1 meanwhile the accumulation of ni and pb was improved with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 table 1 therefore it may be possible that the application of a mef enriched the microorganisms associated with tm adsorption thus improving the tm removal efficiency in cws the beta diversity analysis was used mainly to investigate the similarity of the microbial community structures among different samples the variability of the bacterial community structure at the genus level is shown in fig 5 axes pc1 and pc2 accounted for 84 2 of the variability determined for the bacterial community structures at the anode fig 5a data show that the community of cw ck was distinctly separate from the ones of the other four samples from mef coupled cws similar bacterial community structures were detected in cw 0e and cw 50a notably the bacterial community structures of cw 50a cw 100a and cw 200a were separated distinctly these findings suggest that the bacterial community structures on the anode samples changed obviously because of the relatively high efi 100 and 200 mv cm 1 the axes pc1 and pc2 account for 68 9 of the variability in the samples of the bacterial biocoenoses at the cathode fig 5b the analytical results show that cw 0c cw 100c and cw 200c clustered together conversely cw 50c was distinctly separate from these 3 samples these observations demonstrate that the bacterial community structure on the cathodes can be changed significantly by a relatively low efi 50 mv cm 1 while it was less affected by a relatively high efi 100 and 200 mv cm 1 in the rhizosphere the axes pc1 and pc2 accounted for 84 2 of the variability calculated for the bacterial community structures fig 5c cw 100r was detected to be near to cw 0r moreover cw 50r and cw 200r were quite distinctly separate from cw 0r and also from cw 100r these findings indicate that the efi of 50 and 200 mv cm 1 caused significant effects for the bacterial community structures in the rhizosphere 3 6 comparative analysis of bacterial community the bacterial community structures at the phylum level are shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria were basically the dominant phyla in all samples they exhibited a similar bacterial species composition and relative abundance in cw cke and cw ckm with the increase of the efi the relative abundance of proteobacteria in samples from the anodes and cathodes sharply increased except for cw 50c which decreased by 13 8 compared with cw cke bacteroidetes were observed with a similar abundance in cw 50a 12 2 and cw 100a 11 6 however the abundance of bacteroidetes decreased sharply in cw 0e constituted 5 4 and in cw 200a 4 6 actinobacteria for cw 100r showed with an abundance of 21 0 was much more abundant than in other samples the abundance of the acidobacteria decreased gradually from 18 5 cw 0e to 1 8 cw 200a in the anode samples in contrast values for acidobacteria increased in all the rhizosphere samples from mef coupled cws additionally firmicutes was also the abundant phylum in cathode samples the abundance varied from 1 4 cw 0e to 18 8 cw 200c as shown in fig 6b the classes alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were the most abundant classes in all samples their relative abundance values were ranged from 30 2 cw 100r to 65 6 cw 200r a reduced abundance for betaproteobacteria was detected in cw 50r and cw 100r with 18 4 and 14 6 respectively compared with cw ckm 26 3 however in cw 200r they were enriched with 38 5 the average abundance of gammaproteobacteria in anode samples 22 2 was much higher than in cathode samples 2 8 the data show that gammaproteobacteria notably was enriched in cw 100a and cw 200a accounting for 32 5 and 25 8 of the total population respectively furthermore cw 50c exhibited a quite different bacterial community composition from the other samples at the class level bacteroidia spirochaetes clostridia and acidobacteria were detected to be highly enriched at the class level and accounted for 12 0 5 7 14 6 and 9 7 respectively the major tm removal mechanism by microorganisms was probably biosorption and or bioaccumulation dobrowolski et al 2017 furthermore the resistance mechanisms of microorganisms to tms can be categorized as intracellular or extracellular sequestration and active excretion wei et al 2017 yin et al 2018 in order to screen for microorganisms involved in tm removal and or microorganisms with increased tolerance to tms in the presence of an external mef a hierarchy clustered heat map was generated with the top 50 genera which accounted for the most read sequences fig 7 in general most of the genera showed a different abundance in different samples for example the genus methylosinus exhibited a high abundance 2 1 in the electrode samples without electric field application cw 0e and had a good adsorption capacity for cu zn ni co pb and mn matsushita et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 also the relative abundance of anaeromyxobacter in cw 0e was 3 1 this species is generally found to be highly abundant in soils containing a high concentration of various tms li et al 2017 magnetospirillum can be used to enrich metal ions such as au fe cu zn and ni from wastewater according to several reports kundu and kale aabanpurkar 2009 li et al 2013 here this genus also occurred significantly enriched in the anode samples with a mef of 50 mv cm 1 moreover nitrospira a nitrifying genus which normally co exists with tms wu et al 2017 abundant occurred in cw 50a the relative abundance of ochrobactrum was 13 8 in the anode samples with a 200 mv cm 1 electric field previous studies showed that ochrobactrum might be considered a heavy metal resistant microorganism it excretes exopolysaccharides to adsorb tms like cu cd and pb ozdemir et al 2003 waranusantigul et al 2011 additionally members of the genus dyella and herbaspirillum were also enriched in the anode samples with an electric field of 200 mv cm 1 dyella has been described for effective adsorption of cu in soil remediation cmr et al 2017 while herbaspirillum is a genus exhibiting strong resistance to pb govarthanan et al 2016 also the genus acidovorax was significantly enriched in cathode samples with electric fields of 100 9 5 and 200 mv cm 1 9 8 acidovorax has been reported to be enriched under high concentrations of cd stress belimov et al 2005 other studies have shown that acidovorax promoted ni removal from soil abou shanab et al 2006 however this genus has been reported rarely to be associated with a tm removal agrobacterium has been shown to further the removal of cu and zn vigliotta et al 2016 while sphingobium may play an active role in the remediation of cu and cd pollution chen et al 2016 both genera were found to be enriched in cw 50r anaeromyxobacter was found to be highly abundant in cw 0e and was also significantly enriched in cw 100r 2 6 sphingomonas was obviously enriched in rhizosphere samples 12 0 with the 200 mv cm 1 electric field application earlier studies have shown that sphingomonas has the capacity to adsorb cd tangaromsuk et al 2002 moreover the relative abundance of sphingomonas has been identified to correlate positively with an increased metal concentration other studies have shown that sphingomonas was more abundant than other genera of proteobacteria in heavy metal contaminated soils beattie et al 2018 guo et al 2017 therefore the occurrence of sphingomonas is certainly related to the occurrence of tms in our experiments our analysis of bacterial communities at the genus level provides a valuable insight for the understanding of the microbial remediation for tm under the influence of a mef 4 conclusion this work aims to investigate the tm removal from wastewater via a cw mef system and provides a better understanding of the tm removal processes with the presence of a micro electric field the present research suggests that the mef generally improve the purification efficiency for trace metal containing wastewater high tm removal performance for cw mef system was achieved by the enhancement of phytoextraction and biofilm accumulation phytoextraction for cu zn and cd was improved by an efi of 100 mv cm 1 microorganisms related to tm tolerance and enrichment exhibited a high abundance with an efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 the accumulation of cu zn ni and co in biofilms was most increased by an efi of 200 mv cm 1 maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co ni and pb were 95 6 80 1 74 0 67 1 69 8 and 99 6 respectively in summer with a 5d hrt except for pb the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 had a significantly improved tm removal in cws the cw mef system exhibited better tm removal performance in summer than that in winter during the summer period the effluent concentrations for cu zn ni and pb from cw mef can meet the emission standards for electroplating of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb 21900 2008 moreover the effluent co concentrations met the emission standards for pollutants of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb25467 2010 with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 further study should focus on the structure optimization of cw mef system to realize engineering application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18555,constructed wetlands coupled with a micro electric field cw mef is a novel and efficient water treatment technology the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism and performance of trace metals tms removal for cw mef systems during summer and winter the mass distribution of tms in plants and biofilms physiological indices of wetland plants and bacterial community structures on electrodes and in the rhizospheres were analyzed as well as to explore further the tm removal mechanism results show that the electric field intensities efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 had a significantly promoting effect on tm removal maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co ni and pb were 95 6 80 1 74 0 67 1 69 8 and 99 6 respectively in summer with a 5d hydraulic retention time hrt an efi of 100 mv cm 1 could alleviate the oxidative damage in plant cells by promoting the synthesis of reduced glutathione and an activity increase of catalase thus increasing the phytoextraction for cu zn and cd for biofilms the mef caused shifts in the bacterial community structures and an efi of 50 to 200 mv cm 1 significantly promoted the enrichment of cu zn cd and co by biofilms moreover microorganisms related to tm tolerance and enrichment exhibited a high abundance with an efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 it can be concluded that introducing mef to cws could intensify the tms removal via the biological process and result in more efficient purification for tm containing wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords trace elements electrokinetic remediation phytoremediation biofilm accumulation wastewater 1 introduction water contamination by trace metals tms poses a serious threat to the survival of human beings and aquatic organisms rajeshkumar et al 2018 due to the characteristics of tm pollution such as permanent pollution and slow removal it is necessary to find an efficient and low cost treatment method for cleaning tm containing wastewater fu and wang 2011 constructed wetlands cws are reliable wastewater treatment technology with low investment and low energy consumption here the substrates wetland plants and acclimated microbial communities have the potential to remove a wide variety of pollutants including tms vymazal 2014 the removal mechanism for metals in wetland mesocosm is complex and including interactions between substrates wetland plants biofilms and pollutants in water galletti et al 2010 maine et al 2009 although the substrates such as limestone zeolite gravel and sodium titanate nanofiber are verified removal potential for tms lizama allende et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 the tms removal by substrates is unsustainable after saturated adsorption therefore the major pathway for tm removal in cws is a biological process the wetland plants and biofilms are the two major factors affecting tm removal efficiency in cws dunbabin and bowmer 1992a guo et al 2017 phytoremediation is considered to be a powerful possibility for tm removal in cw systems the tms removal by wetland plants varies widely associated with plant species plant physiological status and tm concentrations in the contaminated water rezania et al 2016 yadav et al 2012 previous studies had reported that plants of typha latifolia pistia stratiotes carex aquatilis phragmites australis alisma plantago aquatica showed considerable removal efficiencies for tms in wastewater calheiros et al 2008 sardar et al 2009 the technique of phytoremediation is typically used together with bioremediation which microorganisms in biofilms remove tms from wastewater by valence transformation extracellular biosorption and or bioaccumulation pani et al 2017 consequently the richness and species diversity of microbial communities are related to tms removal efficiency arroyo et al 2013 garbisu and alkorta 2003 in a wetland mesocosm the rhizosphere effect of wetland plants generally results in a shift in the microbial community structure clairmont et al 2019 accordingly several rhizosphere microorganisms are involved in alleviating tm stress on plants and promote plant growth el meihy et al 2019 mishra et al 2017 over the past research for tm removal via cws mainly focus on the screening of hyperaccumulator for tm the selecting of wetland substrates with efficient tms adsorption performance and the optimizing for structure and operation conditions of cws galletti et al 2010 maine et al 2009 pedescoll et al 2015 rezania et al 2016 whereas to improve the tm removal efficiency from wastewater using assistant technology is still rarely reported in cws electrokinetic remediation has been successfully utilized to the purification of trace metal contaminated soil ma et al 2018 selvi and aruliah 2018 vocciante et al 2017 wang et al 2018 but with scarce reference to the remediation of metal contained wastewater previously studies have shown that the plant physiological status could be affected by the electric field particularly in regulating the activity of antioxidant defense systems dannehl 2018 he et al 2017 moreover the microbial community structure in a bioreactor could be changed with the presence of an electric field which lead to more efficient and improved reactors for the removal of nh4 h no3 n and cod and po4 3 elnaker et al 2019 ju et al 2014 zeyoudi et al 2015 since the plant physiological status microbial communities as well as nutrients removal efficiencies were all affected by an electric field it is reasonable to speculate that the trace metal removal performance could be regulated by an electric field for a cw to date the promoting effect of electric field on cu zn and cd removal has been detected in a subsurface flow cws song et al 2011 and they inferred that the increasing removal performance of tm attributed to the improvement of wetland plant s ability to resist adverse environmental conditions however the tms enrichment and transportation characteristic for wetland plant and the shifts in microbial communities under the stress of tms still need to be investigated in an electric field coupled cw herein continuously operated cws were developed to investigate the tms cu zn cd co ni and pb removal mechanism and performance the main work are 1 to examine the seasonal performances summer and winter of mef cws on the treatment of tm polluted wastewater 2 to evaluate the correlation between tm removal and water quality parameters operating conditions and nutrient consumption in the mef cws 3 to characterize the distribution of tms in cws and 4 to clarify the effects of mef on physiological responses of wetland plants and shifts in bacterial community structure under the tms stress 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental devices and operating conditions black polyethylene plastic containers height 20 cm inner diameter 22 cm were used to simulate vertical down flow cws figs 1a and s1 each container was divided into three layers with an average porosity of 32 a gravel layer particle size 4 6 mm of 4 cm thickness was firstly filled on the bottom followed by a layer of quartz sand particle size 0 5 1 mm of 10 cm and finally a 4 cm layer of gravel particle size 4 6 mm was put on top graphite rods gr 1 cm diameter by 20 cm length jinglongtetan ltd china were used as electrodes for cathode and anode the electrode distance was 20 cm and both electrodes were inserted into the bottom of the container the electrodes were connected with copper wires with the positive and negative contacts respectively of the dc power supply aps3005si atten china the wetland plant type scirpus validus vahl was purchased from the local flower market songjiang district shanghai the plants were then cultured hydroponically for 15 days with hoagland s nutrient solution in a humidity climate incubator bic 250 boxun china after that the disease free emergent plants of similar height approximately 80 cm and fresh weight approximately 350 g were planted between anode and cathode the continuously stirring tank consisted of a black opaque plastic tank with an effective volume of 250 l a blender stirring speed 35 r min 1 placed on the top of the tank was used to prepare homogenized simulated wastewater fig 1 b the influents of all the cws were continuously and uniformly fed onto the surface of the cws by a multi channel peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer china a total of 15 constructed wetlands were divided into 5 experimental groups 3 replicates each micro electric fields of 0 50 100 or 200 mv cm 1 were applied to constructed wetlands cw 0 cw 50 cw 100 and cw 200 which had been planted with scirpus validus vahl ck cw was left unplanted and without micro electric field application as the control fig 1b all experimental devices were placed on an open air balcony north facing of the college building at donghua university the experiment lasted over 8 months from july 2016 to february 2017 it was divided into five campaigns acclimation period before summer sampling 30 days in july 2016 summer sampling period average air temperature approximately 30 c from august to september 2016 autumn period from october to november 2016 acclimation period before winter sampling 30 days in december 2016 and winter sampling period average air temperature approximately 7 c from january to february 2017 the same simulated wastewater was used in the acclimation and sampling periods while simulated wastewater without tm cu zn cr co ni and pb was used in the autumn period moreover five hydraulic retention times 0 5 1 2 4 5 day were tested during each sampling period and each hrt was repeated three times simulated wastewater was prepared with distilled water and the details are shown in supporting information text s1 briefly the concentrations of cu zn cd ni and pb were higher than the emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21900 2008 while the influent co concentration was higher than the emission standards for pollutants of china gb25467 2010 2 2 sample collection effluents were collected from the bottom of the reactors through a perforated plastic pipe with each sampling approximately 1 0 l effluent was collected into a polyethylene bottle after 8 months of experiment the plants were harvested and divided into rhizomes and stems plant tissues were rinsed with distilled water to remove adsorbed tms and biofilms from the surface stems 0 5 g fresh weight fw were collected for physiological analysis the substrates in the cws were also collected for analysis of tm concentrations biofilms associated with the rhizospheres anodes and the cathodes in the duplicated cws were extracted by a modified method according to previously described lv et al 2017 10 g substrate was dispersed in 100 ml of phosphate buffer solution 10 mmol l 1 ph 7 0 in a 250 ml sterilized conical flask the conical flask was shaken subsequently in a thermostated oscillator at 150 r min 1 for 1 h at 4 c the suspension was used further for genomic dna extraction the biofilm samples of anodes cathodes and rhizosphere for pyrosequencing were collected from triplicate cws and mixed to homogenize for dna extraction and further bacterial communities analysis and the procedure and primers used were shown in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the ph do and electrical conductivity ec of influent and effluent were measured immediately with a dual probe multi parameter meter hq40d hach usa cod was measured by a multi parameter portable colorimeter dr900 hach usa a spectrometry with nessler s reagent to measure the nh4 n concentration was used effluent no3 n was measured according to the standard method gb3838 2002 with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 2000 unico china tms in substrates were extracted by an optimized three step sequential extraction procedure while for plant tissues were oven dried and extracted using microwave digestion method pueyo et al 2001 török et al 2015 an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap rq icp ms thermo scientific usa was used to measure the concentrations of the tms measurements of reduced glutathione gsh soluble protein malondialdehyde mda and the antioxidant enzymes including peroxidase pod catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod were using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from mlbio biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and performed with a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo fisher usa 2 4 calculation and data analysis the bioconcentration factors bcfs l kg 1 were calculated as follows 1 bcf cp cs where cp is the metal concentration mg kg 1 in plants and cs is the metal concentration mg kg 1 in the wetland substrates respectively a high bcf value indicates an improved phytoextraction capability macfarlane et al 2007 2 5 the translocation factors tfs were calculated as 2 tf cst cr where cst and cr are the metal concentrations mg kg 1 in stems and rhizomes respectively a high tf value implies an increased translocation capability for tm yeh et al 2009 statistical analyses were done using spss 20 0 the one way anova test was used to compare the tm removal physiological index of plants water quality parameters ph and do and nutrient nh4 n no3 n and cod removal efficiency in different cws significant differences were assessed by duncan s multiple range test at the 0 05 significance level the student t test was used to compare mass distribution differences in plant tissues and biofilms for the same metal the relations between tm removal and water quality parameters operating conditions and nutrient removal efficiencies for different experimental groups and seasons were compared by the principal component analyses pca using spss 20 0 principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance and calculation of alpha diversity indices was performed by qiime software to assess the differences of microbial communities in different samples a heatmap graph based on microbial community compositions at genus level was generated via pheatmap package in r software version 3 3 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of tms as shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were improved considerably by the application of a mef and increased with the hrt throughout the experiments moreover the tms were better removed in the summer period than in the winter period compared with the unplanted control cw ck all planted cws showed statistically increased tm removal efficiencies at five hrts in the summer period the removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were 69 3 95 6 52 9 80 1 15 8 74 0 19 5 67 1 18 2 69 8 respectively for a 5d hrt cw 100 produced the maximum removal efficiencies for cu co and ni the maximum cd and zn removal efficiencies were observed in cw 200 moreover the pb removal efficiency was greater than 94 0 in all cws at various hrts whereas the application of different efi showed no significant effect on the pb removal p 0 05 during the winter campaign the maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co and ni were in cw 100 at the hrt of 5 days they decreased by 31 5 33 3 30 5 40 4 and 43 2 as compared with the corresponding values for the summer period for pb the removal efficiency ranged from 86 2 cw ck to 99 6 cw 100 at a 5d hrt thus the pb removal efficiency was not significantly lower than that in the summer period however all cws in the winter period produced a lower pb removal efficiency compared with the summer period at the hrts of 0 5 1 2 and 4 days compared with the unplanted cw ck an effective tm removal occurred in the planted cw reactors this indicates that phytoextraction is a crucial factor for tm removal dunbabin and bowmer 1992b for each cw reactor the metal removal performance was affected by seasonal changes table s1 during the summer period the effluent concentrations for cu zn ni and pb from cw mef can meet the emission standards for electroplating of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb 21900 2008 more concretely the effluent pb concentration met the emission standards at 0 5d hrt in all experimental groups the cu concentrations in the effluent of all planted cws met the emission standards at 1d hrt the effluent zn and ni concentrations both met the emission standards at 5d hrt with an efi of 100 mv cm 1 and the effluent zn concentration can also meet the discharge standard with an efi of 200 mv cm 1 moreover the effluent co concentrations met the emission standards for pollutants of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb25467 2010 with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 however the cd purification efficiency was not satisfactory the effluent cd concentration exceeded the emission standards in all experimental groups similarly a decreasing removal performance for cd than that for cu zn and pb was also observed in previous research using semi natural wetland maddison et al 2009 during winter although the mef considerably intensified the tm removal performance in cw reactors only the effluent pb concentration met emission standards among all experimental groups this can be ascribed to the senescence of the wetland plants and a reduced microbial activity due to the low temperature bhargava et al 2012 kadlec and reddy 2001 3 2 correlation between metal removal and other influencing factors the average ph significantly p 0 05 increased from 6 2 0 1 in the influent to 7 0 0 1 in the effluent meanwhile effluents also showed higher ec values than the influents whereas the average do significantly decreased p 0 05 from 11 9 0 6 to 6 1 0 7 mg l 1 fig s2 the effluent ph and do values were not significantly different p 0 05 for the 5 treatment groups and remained almost unaffected by the different hrts while the ec values increased with an increasing hrt concentrations for nh4 n no3 n and cod were 7 5 0 4 mg l 1 44 3 1 7 mg l 1 and 64 7 3 1 mg l 1 respectively in the influent throughout the experiment in general all treatment groups exhibited a relatively higher removal performance for nh4 n no3 n and cod in the summer than in the winter period the highest nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiencies in the summer period 49 2 and 57 4 respectively and winter period 36 2 and 32 6 respectively were achieved in cw 100 at 5d hrt a significantly higher nh4 n and no3 n removal performance was observed in the planted cws than in the unplanted ones fig s3 in addition all treatment groups had a high cod removal performance at 81 4 98 8 during the summer period and 80 2 97 8 during the winter period fig s4 the correlation between tm removal and operating conditions efi and hrt water quality ph do and ec and nutrient cod nh4 n and no3 n removal were assessed by principal component analysis pca pca analysis during the summer period is shown in fig 3 a a strong positive correlation was detected for cd ni and co removal with nh4 n and no3 n removal the zn removal showed a strong positive correlation with cod removal however the cu and pb removal exhibited a weak correlation with the removal of nutrients moreover the tms of ni cd zn and co had a positive correlation with efi hrt and ec during the winter period the tm removal was strongly positively correlated with nutrient removal cod nh4 n and no3 n while efi showed a lower level of correlation with tm removal compared with that in the summer period fig 3b also ph and do had low levels of correlation with tm removal both in winter and summer periods 3 3 distribution characteristics of tms in cws tm accumulation in plant tissues and biofilms was analyzed after the winter sampling period table 1 wetland plants in different experimental groups showed a similar dry weight of rhizomes and stems fig s5 in general the accumulation of various tms in biofilms was higher than those in plant tissues rhizomes stems meanwhile the quantities of tms in rhizomes were higher than those in stems this finding was consistent with the tms bioaccumulation characteristic for phragmites australis bonanno and lo giudice 2010 moreover the quantities of various tms in stems showed no significant differences for the planted cws the rhizomes in cw 100 produced a significantly higher extraction performance for cu zn and cd than other ones the rhizomes in cw 0 cw 50 and cw 100 had similar contents of co ni and pb in addition the rhizomes in cw 200 had the lowest extraction performance for various tms the enrichment of cu zn cd and co in biofilms was significantly improved with an increase of efi the contents of cu zn cd and co in the biofilm of cw 200 were 1 3 1 4 1 3 and 2 0 times over those in cw 0 respectively a similar content of pb in biofilms of cw 0 cw 50 and cw 100 was detected while the maximum pb content in a biofilm was observed for cw 200 the contents of ni in the biofilms of cw 0 and cw 50 were quite similar however the ni contents in the biofilms of cw 100 and cw 200 were 4 2 and 5 1 times increased over those of cw 0 respectively phytoextraction is considered to be a process for tm removal however the tm accumulation and translocation capability of plants were affected by the external mef long et al 2011 a previous study reported that an external electric field promoted the accumulation of cu pb and zn in the roots of plant luo et al 2019 the present study also found that an efi of 100 mv cm 1 significantly promoted the accumulation of cu zn and cd in rhizomes of scirpus validus vahl however tm accumulation was inhibited in rhizomes by an efi of 200 mv cm 1 table 1 thus a high efi can cause a reduced tm accumulation in plant rhizomes previous research also reported that although a dc electric field had a positive effect on accelerating cd cu and pb uptake by the roots of plant the tm transport from roots to shoots was not promoted luo et al 2018 this finding corresponds well with the data of our present study that different efis had no promoting effect on tm transfer from rhizomes to aerial parts of scirpus validus vahl table 1 the bcfs and tfs of wetland plants in the planted cws are presented in table 2 a high bcf value is related to an enhanced phytoaccumulation capability the largest bcf values for zn cd co ni and pb in the plants were obtained in cw 0 while the largest bcf values for cu were achieved in cw 100 and cw 0 furthermore the lowest bcf values for various tms in plants were obtained in cw 200 in contrast the tf values for various tms in plants of cw 200 were higher than those in the other cws considering that a mef may affect the tm enrichment efficiency of wetland plants and biofilms simultaneously cameselle and gouveia 2019 the bcf and tf values in this study cannot be used to assess the effects of a mef on phytoremediation for instance the lowest bcf value for cu was obtained in cw 200 this was due to the fact that the efi of 200 mv cm 1 promoted the enrichment of cu in biofilms but the cu enrichment by rhizomes was reduced based on the data for cu contents in stems between different experimental groups table 1 the mef had no effect on the tm translocation from the rhizomes to aerial parts however an efi of 200 mv cm 1 allowed the largest tf value for cu which was caused by the decreased accumulation capacity of cu in rhizomes also tms were enriched more in biofilms than in plant tissues under the stimulation of a mef table 2 hence the bcf values for zn cd co ni and pb were decreasing with the increase of the efi table 2 in addition the largest tf value for tms in cw 200 was also due to the low tm enrichment efficiency in rhizomes 3 4 physiological indices of wetland plants plant senescence was observed during the winter period therefore physiological indices of oxidation damage characterization by mda contents antioxidants characterization by gsh contents and antioxidant enzymes pod sod and cat were investigated only after the summer period as shown in fig 4 the mda contents in the stems of scirpus validus vahl treated with different efi 0 50 and 200 mv cm 1 respectively were similar fig 4a while the plants in cw 100 had a remarkable lower mda content than those of the other groups the gsh contents in the plants of cw 100 were by 11 6 statistically lower than those of cw 0 however no significant differences of gsh contents in the plants of cw 50 cw 200 and cw 0 were measurable fig 4b the soluble protein contents in the plants of cw 50 cw 100 and cw 200 were significantly lower than the one in cw 0 which was run without mef application the values were 34 6 62 8 and 21 8 reduced respectively fig 4c plant antioxidant enzymes including pod cat and sod play a vital role for the response to environmental stress gong et al 2017 the results show that the pod and sod activity in plants of cw 100 and cw 200 was remarkably lower than in cw 0 fig 4d and e the cat activity in cw 50 and cw 100 was significantly higher than in cw 0 however the cat activity in plants of cw 0 and cw 200 was not statistically different fig 4f according to the physiological indices of scirpus validus vahl stems fig 4 an external mef of 100 mv cm 1 alleviated the mda accumulation in plant cells it is reasonable to infer that the increasing tm removal performance in plants of cw 100 was due to the alleviation of the oxidative stress for plant cells by the external mef 100 mv cm 1 song et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 the antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants which are involved in stress response were also strongly affected by the external electric field berni et al 2018 dannehl 2018 in the present research values for pod activities were found to be much higher in the plant cells of cw 0 than those under the cw mef system however the gsh contents were remarkably enhanced at 100 mv cm 1 thus it seems likely that the mechanism of stress response to tms in plant cells was changed by the application of a mef dannehl et al 2009 in the absence of an electric field an alleviation of tm stress in plant cells was achieved probably by increasing the content of intracellular soluble proteins and the enhancement of the activities for pod and sod ozuna et al 2018 however the oxidative damage of plant cells in a cw mef system was alleviated by synthesizing gsh and an activity increase of cat 3 5 diversity analysis of bacterial communities a comparison of the alpha diversity indices of the bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere and electrodes in the triplicated cws is shown in table 3 briefly the application of a mef increased species evenness but decreased species richness of the bacterial communities on anode cathode and rhizosphere samples a comprehensive analysis of α diversity indices revealed that the presence of wetland plants had an active role in the enhancement of the bacterial biodiversity berendsen et al 2012 this finding was also observed for wetland microbial fuel cell systems planted with j effuses t orientalis and s validus wang et al 2017 according to the mass distribution of tms in cws table 1 the accumulation by biofilms removed a large amount of cu zn cd co and pb from simulated wastewater additionally the accumulation of cu zn cd and co in biofilms was enhanced significantly by the efi of 50 200 mv cm 1 meanwhile the accumulation of ni and pb was improved with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 table 1 therefore it may be possible that the application of a mef enriched the microorganisms associated with tm adsorption thus improving the tm removal efficiency in cws the beta diversity analysis was used mainly to investigate the similarity of the microbial community structures among different samples the variability of the bacterial community structure at the genus level is shown in fig 5 axes pc1 and pc2 accounted for 84 2 of the variability determined for the bacterial community structures at the anode fig 5a data show that the community of cw ck was distinctly separate from the ones of the other four samples from mef coupled cws similar bacterial community structures were detected in cw 0e and cw 50a notably the bacterial community structures of cw 50a cw 100a and cw 200a were separated distinctly these findings suggest that the bacterial community structures on the anode samples changed obviously because of the relatively high efi 100 and 200 mv cm 1 the axes pc1 and pc2 account for 68 9 of the variability in the samples of the bacterial biocoenoses at the cathode fig 5b the analytical results show that cw 0c cw 100c and cw 200c clustered together conversely cw 50c was distinctly separate from these 3 samples these observations demonstrate that the bacterial community structure on the cathodes can be changed significantly by a relatively low efi 50 mv cm 1 while it was less affected by a relatively high efi 100 and 200 mv cm 1 in the rhizosphere the axes pc1 and pc2 accounted for 84 2 of the variability calculated for the bacterial community structures fig 5c cw 100r was detected to be near to cw 0r moreover cw 50r and cw 200r were quite distinctly separate from cw 0r and also from cw 100r these findings indicate that the efi of 50 and 200 mv cm 1 caused significant effects for the bacterial community structures in the rhizosphere 3 6 comparative analysis of bacterial community the bacterial community structures at the phylum level are shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria were basically the dominant phyla in all samples they exhibited a similar bacterial species composition and relative abundance in cw cke and cw ckm with the increase of the efi the relative abundance of proteobacteria in samples from the anodes and cathodes sharply increased except for cw 50c which decreased by 13 8 compared with cw cke bacteroidetes were observed with a similar abundance in cw 50a 12 2 and cw 100a 11 6 however the abundance of bacteroidetes decreased sharply in cw 0e constituted 5 4 and in cw 200a 4 6 actinobacteria for cw 100r showed with an abundance of 21 0 was much more abundant than in other samples the abundance of the acidobacteria decreased gradually from 18 5 cw 0e to 1 8 cw 200a in the anode samples in contrast values for acidobacteria increased in all the rhizosphere samples from mef coupled cws additionally firmicutes was also the abundant phylum in cathode samples the abundance varied from 1 4 cw 0e to 18 8 cw 200c as shown in fig 6b the classes alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were the most abundant classes in all samples their relative abundance values were ranged from 30 2 cw 100r to 65 6 cw 200r a reduced abundance for betaproteobacteria was detected in cw 50r and cw 100r with 18 4 and 14 6 respectively compared with cw ckm 26 3 however in cw 200r they were enriched with 38 5 the average abundance of gammaproteobacteria in anode samples 22 2 was much higher than in cathode samples 2 8 the data show that gammaproteobacteria notably was enriched in cw 100a and cw 200a accounting for 32 5 and 25 8 of the total population respectively furthermore cw 50c exhibited a quite different bacterial community composition from the other samples at the class level bacteroidia spirochaetes clostridia and acidobacteria were detected to be highly enriched at the class level and accounted for 12 0 5 7 14 6 and 9 7 respectively the major tm removal mechanism by microorganisms was probably biosorption and or bioaccumulation dobrowolski et al 2017 furthermore the resistance mechanisms of microorganisms to tms can be categorized as intracellular or extracellular sequestration and active excretion wei et al 2017 yin et al 2018 in order to screen for microorganisms involved in tm removal and or microorganisms with increased tolerance to tms in the presence of an external mef a hierarchy clustered heat map was generated with the top 50 genera which accounted for the most read sequences fig 7 in general most of the genera showed a different abundance in different samples for example the genus methylosinus exhibited a high abundance 2 1 in the electrode samples without electric field application cw 0e and had a good adsorption capacity for cu zn ni co pb and mn matsushita et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 also the relative abundance of anaeromyxobacter in cw 0e was 3 1 this species is generally found to be highly abundant in soils containing a high concentration of various tms li et al 2017 magnetospirillum can be used to enrich metal ions such as au fe cu zn and ni from wastewater according to several reports kundu and kale aabanpurkar 2009 li et al 2013 here this genus also occurred significantly enriched in the anode samples with a mef of 50 mv cm 1 moreover nitrospira a nitrifying genus which normally co exists with tms wu et al 2017 abundant occurred in cw 50a the relative abundance of ochrobactrum was 13 8 in the anode samples with a 200 mv cm 1 electric field previous studies showed that ochrobactrum might be considered a heavy metal resistant microorganism it excretes exopolysaccharides to adsorb tms like cu cd and pb ozdemir et al 2003 waranusantigul et al 2011 additionally members of the genus dyella and herbaspirillum were also enriched in the anode samples with an electric field of 200 mv cm 1 dyella has been described for effective adsorption of cu in soil remediation cmr et al 2017 while herbaspirillum is a genus exhibiting strong resistance to pb govarthanan et al 2016 also the genus acidovorax was significantly enriched in cathode samples with electric fields of 100 9 5 and 200 mv cm 1 9 8 acidovorax has been reported to be enriched under high concentrations of cd stress belimov et al 2005 other studies have shown that acidovorax promoted ni removal from soil abou shanab et al 2006 however this genus has been reported rarely to be associated with a tm removal agrobacterium has been shown to further the removal of cu and zn vigliotta et al 2016 while sphingobium may play an active role in the remediation of cu and cd pollution chen et al 2016 both genera were found to be enriched in cw 50r anaeromyxobacter was found to be highly abundant in cw 0e and was also significantly enriched in cw 100r 2 6 sphingomonas was obviously enriched in rhizosphere samples 12 0 with the 200 mv cm 1 electric field application earlier studies have shown that sphingomonas has the capacity to adsorb cd tangaromsuk et al 2002 moreover the relative abundance of sphingomonas has been identified to correlate positively with an increased metal concentration other studies have shown that sphingomonas was more abundant than other genera of proteobacteria in heavy metal contaminated soils beattie et al 2018 guo et al 2017 therefore the occurrence of sphingomonas is certainly related to the occurrence of tms in our experiments our analysis of bacterial communities at the genus level provides a valuable insight for the understanding of the microbial remediation for tm under the influence of a mef 4 conclusion this work aims to investigate the tm removal from wastewater via a cw mef system and provides a better understanding of the tm removal processes with the presence of a micro electric field the present research suggests that the mef generally improve the purification efficiency for trace metal containing wastewater high tm removal performance for cw mef system was achieved by the enhancement of phytoextraction and biofilm accumulation phytoextraction for cu zn and cd was improved by an efi of 100 mv cm 1 microorganisms related to tm tolerance and enrichment exhibited a high abundance with an efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 the accumulation of cu zn ni and co in biofilms was most increased by an efi of 200 mv cm 1 maximum removal efficiencies for cu zn cd co ni and pb were 95 6 80 1 74 0 67 1 69 8 and 99 6 respectively in summer with a 5d hrt except for pb the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 had a significantly improved tm removal in cws the cw mef system exhibited better tm removal performance in summer than that in winter during the summer period the effluent concentrations for cu zn ni and pb from cw mef can meet the emission standards for electroplating of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb 21900 2008 moreover the effluent co concentrations met the emission standards for pollutants of china special limit values for water pollutant discharge gb25467 2010 with the efi of 100 and 200 mv cm 1 further study should focus on the structure optimization of cw mef system to realize engineering application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18556,activated carbon is the most common electrode material used in electrosorption processes such as water desalination with capacitive deionization cdi cdi is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by transferring charge from one electrode to another when multiple salts are present in a solution the removal of each ionic species can be different resulting in selective ion separations this ion selectivity is the result of combined effects such as differences in the hydrated size and valence of the ions in the present work we study ion selectivity from salt mixtures with two different monovalent ions chloride and nitrate we run adsorption experiment in microporous carbons i e without applying a voltage as well as electrosorption experiments i e based on applying a voltage between two carbon electrodes our results show that i during adsorption and electrosorption activated carbon removes much more nitrate than chloride ii at equilibrium ion selectivity does not depend strongly on the composition of the water but does depend on charging voltage in cdi and iii during electrosorption ion selectivity is time dependent we modify the amphoteric donnan model by including an additional affinity of nitrate to carbon we find good agreement between our experimental results and the theory both show very high selectivity towards nitrate over chloride β no 3 cl 10 when no voltage is applied or when the voltage is low the selectivity gradually decreases with increasing charging voltage to β no 3 cl 6 at v ch 1 2 v despite this decrease the affinity effect for nitrate continues to play an important role also at a high voltage in general we can conclude that our work provides new insights in the importance of carbon ion interactions for electrochemical water desalination graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization ion electrosorption nitrate selectivity amphoteric donnan model 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by electrostatic interactions with charged electrodes often made of porous carbon johnson and newman 1971 tang et al 2019 this cyclic process is performed by alternatingly charging and discharging the electrodes during charging ions are electrosorbed from the feed water and a desalinated stream is produced the ions are temporarily stored in electrical double layers edls which are formed at the electrode solution interface han et al 2014 porada et al 2013 wang et al 2018 during discharge ions are released from the electrodes and a concentrated stream is produced when multiple salts are present in the feed water the adsorption of each ionic species can be different resulting in selective removal of ions mossad and zou 2012 suss 2017 tang et al 2015 several factors influence the ion adsorption capacity of individual ions from salt mixtures including i the material of the electrode for instance an intercalation material singh et al 2018 or porous carbons as we will focus on in this work ii for carbons the pore characteristics such as size hawks et al 2019 and chemical surface charge han et al 2014 iii ion properties such as ion valence hou and huang 2013 hydrated size gabelich et al 2002 electronegativity sun et al 2018 and the affinity of the ion to the carbon and iv operational conditions such as charging and discharge voltage and initial ion concentration fig 1 a when ions have different valencies it has been shown that a large selectivity can be obtained zhao et al 2012b however for mixtures with two anions or two cations with the same valency namely both monovalent the results are more ambivalent in some cases the selectivity is quite small dykstra et al 2016a suss 2017 and in some cases much more significant oyarzun et al 2018 it would seem that an affinity difference between the two ions i e their non electrostatic interaction with the carbon micropores can play a significant role when the carbon is uncharged in an adsorption experiment song et al 2019 but most likely is overruled when two carbons are charged in a cdi cell electrosorption in the second case the electrostatic forces are strong the voltage applied is many times the thermal voltage and this is expected to overwhelm the affinity effect which is voltage independent our findings as we will report below are that indeed with increasing voltage the selectivity between two ions of the same valency decreases when the charging voltage increases in line with this expectation however as we also show both experimentally and theoretically the selectivity β for the ion pair no 3 cl remains very high also at a voltage of v ch 1 2 v where a value of β n o 3 c l 6 is found dropping from a value 10 in an adsorption experiment before discussing our theoretical and experimental results in the next sections we first present a literature overview of several experimental studies on selective ion removal from solutions containing two monovalent salts or a mixture of one mono and one divalent salt using electrodes made of carbon materials firstly we describe studies on pore characteristics then on ion properties and lastly on system operation early studies on preferential ion electrosorption in cdi focused on tuning the pore size distribution of the carbon material avraham et al 2008 modified carbon fiber electrodes by chemical vapor deposition cvd and studied the effect of pore size distribution on the ion adsorption capacity using solutions containing one type of cation which was either monovalent or divalent their results showed that after cvd treatment the capacity for divalent ions such as calcium ca 2 and magnesium mg 2 decreased whereas the capacity for monovalent ions such as sodium na did not change they concluded that only ions that are smaller than the pore opening could enter the pores which they called the ion sieving effect in a follow up study electrodes modified by cvd were used to promote the electrosorption of nitrate no 3 over chloride cl noked et al 2009 the preference towards no 3 was attributed to the formation of narrow pore openings that allowed the passage of no 3 with planar shape and hindered the passage of cl with sphere like shape the so called stereoselectivity effect was observed pore characteristics as a factor determining ion selectivity has also been studied by others han et al 2014 indicated that ion selectivity largely depends on both pore size characteristics and ion hydrated size eliad et al 2001 concluded that if the pores of the materials are considerably larger than the ion hydrated size the adsorption capacity of the material is independent of the size and charge of the ions apart from the pore size ion properties influence selectivity in cdi gabelich et al 2002 used carbon aerogel electrodes with a pore size larger than 4 nm to study the effect of valence mass and ion size on electrosorption capacity gabelich et al found that ion valence was the main parameter determining ion selectivity in solutions containing ions with different valences selectivity is observed towards the ion with the highest valence zhao et al 2012b and hou and huang 2013 reported preferential electrosorption of ca 2 over na ions and li et al 2016 reported preferential electrosorption of sulfate so 4 2 over no 3 in zhao et al 2012b experiments were conducted with an initial concentration of na that was five times higher than of ca 2 initially na ions were preferentially electrosorbed but after some time ca 2 replaced the na ions the separation factor of ca 2 over na eq 12 for this experiment was 7 when the adsorption time was extended from one to 5 h the separation factor increased to 25 furthermore zhao et al 2012b also showed that the separation factor can be increased up to 300 when several desalination cycles are performed this study illustrates that ion selectivity can be increased by adjusting the system operation for monovalent ions with different size preferential ion electrosorption is often explained by a size affinity trend i e smaller ions are preferentially electrosorbed over larger ions dykstra et al 2016a hou and huang 2013 suss 2017 for ions with the same valence and similar hydrated size e g no 3 and cl ion selectivity cannot be related to ion size preferential separation of no 3 over cl ions was studied by chen et al 2015 who reported that in the early stage of an adsorption step cl ions were preferentially adsorbed in the edls while at later stage cl ions were replaced by no 3 this result indicates that time dependent selectivity also occurs with mixtures of monovalent ions li et al 2016 introduced the hydrated ratio which is the ratio of the hydrated over the bare ion radius to evaluate the preferential electrosorption of monovalent ions this work reported selectivity towards anions with a higher hydrated ratio furthermore sun et al 2018 tried to correlate selectivity with electronegativity they found that ions with higher electronegativity are preferentially electrosorbed ion selectivity between monovalent ions has also been studied in modified carbon electrodes oyarzun et al 2018 used carbon electrodes functionalized with quaternary amines cathode and benzene sulphonate anode to increase selectivity towards no 3 over cl guyes et al 2019 reported enhanced selectivity towards potassium ions with chemically oxidized cathodes the aforementioned studies are based on cdi with only carbon electrodes preferential electrosorption of ions can also be promoted with ion exchange membranes kim and choi 2012 increased the selectivity towards no 3 by coating the anode surface of carbon electrodes with a polymeric solution containing no 3 selective ion exchange resins with this approach kim et al achieved a separation factor between no 3 and cl β no 3 cl of 3 2 which was higher than the separation obtained with commercial ion exchange membranes fig 1b preferential so 4 2 removal was reported by tang et al 2017 using membrane capacitive deionization cation selectivity in intercalation materials for cdi such as using prussian blue analogues is reviewed by singh et al 2019 lastly new electrode materials have been developed to not only adsorb no 3 but also reduce it to nitrogen gas during electrode regeneration hu et al 2018 in the present work we study selective removal of no 3 and cl by porous carbons we perform two different types of experiment i adsorption to study selective removal without electrically charging the carbon material and ii electrosorption with charging the carbon i e cdi the cdi experiments are performed as function of the no 3 over cl ratio in the water and charging voltage for both types of experiments we find significant preferential removal of no 3 over cl we show that in both cases experimental data can be well described with the amphoteric donnan model for ion adsorption in edls in the model we include a term to account for the affinity of the carbon surface for no 3 we show that this affinity term leads to a high selectivity between the two ions in case of absence of a charging voltage or a low voltage furthermore we show that the affinity effect remains important at a high voltage v ch 1 2 v where electrostatic effects also come to play a role 2 theory to describe ion adsorption in the edls formed in microporous carbon materials we use the amphoteric donnan amph d model this model takes into account edl overlap in sufficiently small micropores smaller than the debye length which is typically the case for cdi with microporous carbons and the model includes the presence of chemical charge on the surface of the carbon i e lining the micropore regions arulrajan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 kim et al 2019 mubita et al 2018 the amph d model considers that there are two types of surface charge located in two different regions in the micropores one region with acidic groups region a and one region with basic groups region b the two regions are expected to be near one another well mixed throughout the electrode but nevertheless each has its own distinct ionic composition resulting from the difference in nearby surface charge chemical interactions between ions and chemical groups present at the carbon surface can be included in the amph d model e g positively charged chemical groups at the surface for which we use the general symbol b can chemically bind ions for example no 3 according to the reaction b no 3 b no 3 this adsorption process can be modelled in equilibrium using a pk constant which describes the state of the equilibrium as function of the concentration of ionic species and the number of free and occupied adsorption sites hiemstra et al 1989 1999 these chemical interactions between ions and chemical groups affect the adsorption of specific ions as well as the chemical surface charge related is the ph dependency of the acidic and basic groups as considered by hemmatifar et al 2017 in a model with acidic and basic groups co existing in the same micropore region no separation in a and b regions instead of considering the binding constants of ions with the different chemical groups in the present work we use a simplified approach to describe chemical interactions by making use of a term μ that describes the affinity of the micropore for certain ions this term is incorporated in the description of the ion concentration in the micropores c mi i j according to the boltzmann equilibrium the resulting expression is 1 c m i i j c ma i exp z i δ ϕ d j μ i where subscript i refers to the ionic species and subscript j to the micropore region which can be either a or b the concentration in the macropores is c ma i z i is the valence of the ion and δ ϕ d j is the dimensionless donnan potential for all species except for no 3 we set μ to zero thus only for no 3 we assume that the binding to chemical groups can be appreciable for the other ions cl and k we assume they do not have a significant chemical binding to the surface and that they behave as inert species for which the normal boltzmann distribution applies i e eq 1 with μ 0 we use the same value of μ in both the a and b regions i e the present model assumes the affinity effect for no 3 does not depend on the nature of the chemical charge in each region in the micropores the amph d model describes three types of charge electronic charge in the carbon matrix σelec ionic charge in solution σionic and chemical charge at the carbon surface σchem overall each region in the micropores is charge neutral and thus 2 σ elec j σ chem j σ ionic j 0 the acidic region has a negative value of σ chem whereas the basic region has a positive value of σ chem to calculate σ ionic j in each region we use 3 σ ionic j i z i c mi i j in the micropores the ionic charge and electronic charge cannot come infinitely close therefore a dielectric layer is considered in between which is called the stern layer the potential over this layer δϕs j is related to the stern layer capacitance c s and σ elec j according to 4 σ elec j f v t δ ϕ s j c s where f is the faraday s constant and v t the thermal voltage given by v t rt f with r the gas constant and t the temperature in each electrode anode or cathode the potential drop over the edls δ ϕ edl is the sum of δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s and is equal for region a and b biesheuvel et al 2015 5 δ ϕ edl δ ϕ d a δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d b δ ϕ s b in addition for each electrode we calculate the average value for σ elec and σ ionic using 6 σ elec j a b α j σ elec j and σ ionic j a b α j σ ionic j where α j is the fraction of each region relative to the total micropore volume υ mi ac ml g electrode at equilibrium no transport of ions the cell voltage is related to δ ϕ edl in the anode an and in the cathode ca by 7 v cell v t δ ϕ edl an δ ϕ edl ca the ion adsorption capacity of the electrodes iac is calculated from the difference between the ion concentration in the micropore c i at the end of the adsorption step superscript ads end and the concentration at the end of the desorption step superscript des end and when both electrodes have the same mass is given by biesheuvel et al 2014 8 iac i 1 2 υ mi ac c i ads end c i des end ca c i ads end c i des end an where 9 c i j a b α j c mi i j the electrode charge in c g defined per gram of two electrodes combined is given by 10 σ f ½ f υ mi ac σ elec ads end σ elec des end next we define the charge efficiency for a mixture of monovalent ions as the ratio of the total number of ions adsorbed divided by a factor 2 over the charge transferred 11 λ f 2 i iac i σ f where i runs over all adsorbed ions finally to describe ion selectivity in the edls we use the separation factor β which is explained in detail by suss 2017 and is expressed as 12 β 1 2 iac 1 iac 2 c ma 2 c ma 1 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two different ionic species e g no 3 and cl the set of equations 1 12 describes ion adsorption in the micropores for a process that at the end of each step charging step discharge step reaches equilibrium i e there is no longer transport of ions into the micropores and is valid irrespective of the valences of the participating ions except eq 11 3 experimental 3 1 adsorption experiments batch experiments were conducted to study the adsorption of ions in activated carbon ac powder which is equilibrated with a salt solution a mass of 2 g of dry ac yp 50f kuraray chemical japan were immersed in 20 ml of multi ionic solutions containing either i one dissolved salt either 20 mm kno 3 or 20 mm kcl or ii salt mixtures with different no 3 to cl concentration ratios such as 1 2 and 2 1 21 mm total ionic strength and 1 3 1 1 and 3 1 20 mm total ionic strength the solution was continuously stirred for 24 h which is sufficiently long to reach equilibrium in the ion transport between bulk solution and micropores after this time the solution was filtered and the concentration of each ion in the filtrate was analyzed by ion chromatography ic the ion concentration in the micropores c mi i was calculated from the ion mass balance 13 v sol c initial i υ mi ac m ac c mi i v sol υ mi ac m ac c final i where v sol is the volume of solution m ac the mass of ac υ mi ac the ac micropore volume c initial i the initial concentration of ion i and c final i the concentration of ion i at the end of the adsorption experiment 3 2 electrosorption experiments cdi experiments were conducted in a stack with four cells each cell consisted of two graphite current collectors a pair of carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca electrode area 33 8 cm2 and a spacer channel glass fiber filter cat no ap2029325 millipore δsp 250 μm placed in between the electrodes through which an aqueous solution flows the electrodes used in the present study have been electrochemically characterized by other researchers oyarzun et al 2018 zhao et al 2012a the stack was ensembled as described by porada et al 2012 in which an aqueous solution flows in between the electrodes through the spacer channel the aqueous solution with a total volume of 160 ml was pumped through the stack with a flow rate of 30 ml min the system was operated in batch wise mode the solution was pumped from the feed container into the stack and the effluent of the stack was recirculated to the feed container the charging voltage v ch and discharge voltage v dch were controlled and the current was measured using a potentiostat ivium technologies the netherlands for each experiment we ran three cycles charging discharge to achieve dynamic equilibrium i e when the dynamic data of effluent concentration and current of a particular cycle is the same as of the previous cycle thereafter the fourth cycle was performed and we took samples from the feed container at different times during charging and discharge the ion concentration in solution was measured by ic with this concentration and the volume of solution we obtain the mole of ions in solution the difference between the mole of ions at the beginning of the electrosorption experiment and at equilibrium is the total ion adsorption this total ion adsorption was divided by the total mass of electrodes to obtain iac in mol g the half cycle time hct which is the duration of each step charging or discharge was always 90 min unless otherwise noted we present an overview of experimental conditions in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption experiments activated carbon is selective towards no 3 fig 2 shows the no 3 and cl concentration in the micropores of the carbon particles as function of the no 3 to cl equilibrium concentration ratio in solution preferential no 3 adsorption is observed even when the concentration of cl is three times higher than that of no 3 experiments performed with single salt solutions either no 3 or cl in solution showed that the concentration of cl ions in the micropores is 34 lower than that of no 3 c mi cl 86 mm and c mi no 3 130 mm these results show that commercial activated carbon materials which are often used to fabricate electrodes for cdi dykstra et al 2016b hatzell et al 2014 reale and smith 2018 have an affinity that favors the adsorption of no 3 in carbon micropores pore size and surface chemistry are affected by the fabrication and activation method of ac and play an important role on the adsorption capacity of ac chen and wu 2004 li et al 2002 seredych et al 2008 in the present work we report data obtained with microporous ac 80 of the total pore volume is due to pores with a size between 0 6 and 2 nm porada et al 2013 these pores are larger than the hydrated size of the ions used in this study and thus are accessible for ions therefore we consider that the surface chemistry rather than the pore size has an effect on the preferential adsorption of ions the surface chemistry of the ac is related to the presence of functional groups which are i acidic groups primarily oxygen containing groups such as phenolic carboxylic and lactonic and ii basic groups such as nitrogen containing functional groups or π electrons on the graphene layer boehm 1994 shafeeyan et al 2010 depending on the conditions such as the ph and solvent characteristics these functional groups can be dissociated or protonated thereby inducing attractive or repulse interactions with the ions in solution sun et al 2017 as the strength of the interactions between ions and functional groups is not the same for all ions we observe an effect on the preferential adsorption of ions ota et al 2013 in fig 2 we also show four theory curves two curves for no 3 and two for cl we used the affinity term μ which describes the interaction between each ion in solution with the uncharged carbon material as a fitting parameter theory describes our data very closely when the value of μ no 3 is 2 46 table 2 4 2 effect of the initial ion concentration and charging voltage on ion selectivity in cdi fig 3 a and fig 3b show equilibrium electrosorption data of β no 3 cl and the ion adsorption capacity iac as function of the no 3 to cl concentration ratio in the feed solution we observe that β no 3 cl increases with the no 3 to cl concentration ratio in feed solution fig 3a in fig 3b we see that with increasing initial no 3 to cl concentration ratio the difference between the concentration of no 3 and cl in the micropores increases before equilibrium is reached however preferential ion electrosorption is determined by the initial concentration ratio the ion with the highest concentration in solution was predominantly electrosorbed data not shown fig 4 a shows that β no 3 cl decreases with charging voltage but the affinity effect does not diminish much and continues to play an important role also at a high voltage charge and iac increase with charging voltage fig 4b and c fig 4d shows that the charge efficiency is much lower than unity which can be explained by the desorption of co ions ions with the same charge as the electrode from the carbon surface at the beginning of the charging step dykstra et al 2016b hassanvand et al 2018 zhao et al 2010 to describe the experimental data in figs 3 and 4 we use the theory outlined in section 2 for the calculations values for parameters σ chem υ mi ac c s and μ i are required the parameter value for σ chem was obtained from biesheuvel 2015 while the other parameters were fitted see table 2 we find that both the adsorption and electrosorption data are theoretically described using the same value for μ i for the adsorption experiments for which activated carbon powder was used we found a micropore volume significantly higher than the micropore volume of the electrosorption experiments for which electrodes were used this finding is supported by previous work that showed that the micropore volume of activated carbon kuraray yp 50f 0 67 ml g ac was significantly higher than the micropore volume of the electrode material per gram of dry activated carbon used for synthesis 0 56 ml g ac dykstra et al 2016b 4 3 electrosorption of nitrate and chloride ion selectivity is controlled by kinetics and equilibria next we analyze the dynamics of preferential electrosorption table 1 fig 5 a shows that the no 3 concentration continuously decreases for about 30 min until it reaches a constant value whereas the cl concentration decreases only for about 15 min thereafter we observe an increase of the cl concentration in solution which means that no 3 ions gradually displace cl ions this phenomenon was previously reported by chen et al 2015 for the same mixture of ions according to hassanvand et al 2018 ion selectivity can be explained as a two step phenomenon the first step is controlled by ion kinetics and the second by adsorption equilibria we will analyze both phenomena to quantify ion selectivity we use the separation factor β no 3 cl which we show in fig 5a as function of time values of β no 3 cl higher than 1 indicate that no 3 ions are preferentially electrosorbed over cl ions as fig 5a shows the separation factor increases over time which indicates that preferential ion electrosorption is a time dependent process at the beginning of the charging step more cl than no 3 is electrosorbed in the edls β no 3 cl 0 7 at this stage it is likely that ion selectivity is governed by ion transport to the micropores the faster ion in this case cl is preferentially electrosorbed see diffusion coefficients of the ions in table 3 as electrosorption progresses β no 3 cl increases as a consequence of the displacement of cl by no 3 at equilibrium β no 3 cl reaches a maximum value of 6 0 at v ch 1 2 v ions in aqueous solution are surrounded by layers of water molecules that form the hydration shell marcus 2012 the ion hydration energy indicates how strong the ions hold these water molecules tansel 2012 the structure of the hydration shell can suffer rearrangements partial dehydration or complete loss of the water molecules depending on the interaction of ions with the surface through which they flow collins 1995 epsztein et al 2018 ions with lower hydration energy can more easily rearrange their hydration shell compared to ions with higher hydration energy it has been shown that ions need to strip off or deform their hydration shell to enter pores with smaller size than the ion hydrated size kalluri et al 2013 the mean size of the pores contained in our electrodes is larger than the ion hydrated size thus the pore size might not induce large perturbations in the hydration shell of no 3 and cl when these ions enter the pores therefore structural changes on the hydration shell are probably not the main cause of preferential electrosorption of no 3 ion carbon surface interactions may play a more important role in determining ion selectivity to support our findings of preferential adsorption of no 3 over cl at equilibrium we also conducted two stage electrosorption experiments fig 5b in the first stage we charged the cell to 1 2 v with only k and cl ions in solution after 30 min a 20 mm kno3 solution was added to the feed container same volume as the kcl solution in the feed container thus the resulting ion concentrations in the feed container are k 20 mm cl 10 mm and no 3 10 mm and the charging voltage was maintained for another 90 min as fig 5a shows cl starts to desorb from the edls immediately after no 3 is added to the solution we observe an increase in the cl concentration while the no 3 concentration decreases approximately 15 min after the addition of no 3 we observe only minor concentration changes 5 conclusions in this work we present adsorption and electrosorption data for nitrate and chloride ions at equilibrium we observe preferential adsorption of nitrate over chloride in the micropores several factors can contribute to the preferential electrosorption of ions such as the hydrated size of the ions and the interactions between the ions and the carbon surface as the hydrated size of nitrate and chloride are equal we conclude that the preferential adsorption of nitrate over chloride is due to chemical interactions between the ions and the carbon surface we also presented theory based on the amphoteric donnan amph d model to predict selectivity between nitrate and chloride in the micropores the theory can be extended to describe preferential adsorption of other monovalent ions as well until now the amph d model has not been used to describe ion selectivity we included an affinity term to describe the preferential adsorption of nitrate into the micropores although this affinity term is not associated to any particular property of the ion or micropore it certainly describes the interaction between ions and the uncharged carbon particles we acknowledge that this interaction is influenced by the surface chemistry and ion properties both

18556,activated carbon is the most common electrode material used in electrosorption processes such as water desalination with capacitive deionization cdi cdi is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by transferring charge from one electrode to another when multiple salts are present in a solution the removal of each ionic species can be different resulting in selective ion separations this ion selectivity is the result of combined effects such as differences in the hydrated size and valence of the ions in the present work we study ion selectivity from salt mixtures with two different monovalent ions chloride and nitrate we run adsorption experiment in microporous carbons i e without applying a voltage as well as electrosorption experiments i e based on applying a voltage between two carbon electrodes our results show that i during adsorption and electrosorption activated carbon removes much more nitrate than chloride ii at equilibrium ion selectivity does not depend strongly on the composition of the water but does depend on charging voltage in cdi and iii during electrosorption ion selectivity is time dependent we modify the amphoteric donnan model by including an additional affinity of nitrate to carbon we find good agreement between our experimental results and the theory both show very high selectivity towards nitrate over chloride β no 3 cl 10 when no voltage is applied or when the voltage is low the selectivity gradually decreases with increasing charging voltage to β no 3 cl 6 at v ch 1 2 v despite this decrease the affinity effect for nitrate continues to play an important role also at a high voltage in general we can conclude that our work provides new insights in the importance of carbon ion interactions for electrochemical water desalination graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization ion electrosorption nitrate selectivity amphoteric donnan model 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by electrostatic interactions with charged electrodes often made of porous carbon johnson and newman 1971 tang et al 2019 this cyclic process is performed by alternatingly charging and discharging the electrodes during charging ions are electrosorbed from the feed water and a desalinated stream is produced the ions are temporarily stored in electrical double layers edls which are formed at the electrode solution interface han et al 2014 porada et al 2013 wang et al 2018 during discharge ions are released from the electrodes and a concentrated stream is produced when multiple salts are present in the feed water the adsorption of each ionic species can be different resulting in selective removal of ions mossad and zou 2012 suss 2017 tang et al 2015 several factors influence the ion adsorption capacity of individual ions from salt mixtures including i the material of the electrode for instance an intercalation material singh et al 2018 or porous carbons as we will focus on in this work ii for carbons the pore characteristics such as size hawks et al 2019 and chemical surface charge han et al 2014 iii ion properties such as ion valence hou and huang 2013 hydrated size gabelich et al 2002 electronegativity sun et al 2018 and the affinity of the ion to the carbon and iv operational conditions such as charging and discharge voltage and initial ion concentration fig 1 a when ions have different valencies it has been shown that a large selectivity can be obtained zhao et al 2012b however for mixtures with two anions or two cations with the same valency namely both monovalent the results are more ambivalent in some cases the selectivity is quite small dykstra et al 2016a suss 2017 and in some cases much more significant oyarzun et al 2018 it would seem that an affinity difference between the two ions i e their non electrostatic interaction with the carbon micropores can play a significant role when the carbon is uncharged in an adsorption experiment song et al 2019 but most likely is overruled when two carbons are charged in a cdi cell electrosorption in the second case the electrostatic forces are strong the voltage applied is many times the thermal voltage and this is expected to overwhelm the affinity effect which is voltage independent our findings as we will report below are that indeed with increasing voltage the selectivity between two ions of the same valency decreases when the charging voltage increases in line with this expectation however as we also show both experimentally and theoretically the selectivity β for the ion pair no 3 cl remains very high also at a voltage of v ch 1 2 v where a value of β n o 3 c l 6 is found dropping from a value 10 in an adsorption experiment before discussing our theoretical and experimental results in the next sections we first present a literature overview of several experimental studies on selective ion removal from solutions containing two monovalent salts or a mixture of one mono and one divalent salt using electrodes made of carbon materials firstly we describe studies on pore characteristics then on ion properties and lastly on system operation early studies on preferential ion electrosorption in cdi focused on tuning the pore size distribution of the carbon material avraham et al 2008 modified carbon fiber electrodes by chemical vapor deposition cvd and studied the effect of pore size distribution on the ion adsorption capacity using solutions containing one type of cation which was either monovalent or divalent their results showed that after cvd treatment the capacity for divalent ions such as calcium ca 2 and magnesium mg 2 decreased whereas the capacity for monovalent ions such as sodium na did not change they concluded that only ions that are smaller than the pore opening could enter the pores which they called the ion sieving effect in a follow up study electrodes modified by cvd were used to promote the electrosorption of nitrate no 3 over chloride cl noked et al 2009 the preference towards no 3 was attributed to the formation of narrow pore openings that allowed the passage of no 3 with planar shape and hindered the passage of cl with sphere like shape the so called stereoselectivity effect was observed pore characteristics as a factor determining ion selectivity has also been studied by others han et al 2014 indicated that ion selectivity largely depends on both pore size characteristics and ion hydrated size eliad et al 2001 concluded that if the pores of the materials are considerably larger than the ion hydrated size the adsorption capacity of the material is independent of the size and charge of the ions apart from the pore size ion properties influence selectivity in cdi gabelich et al 2002 used carbon aerogel electrodes with a pore size larger than 4 nm to study the effect of valence mass and ion size on electrosorption capacity gabelich et al found that ion valence was the main parameter determining ion selectivity in solutions containing ions with different valences selectivity is observed towards the ion with the highest valence zhao et al 2012b and hou and huang 2013 reported preferential electrosorption of ca 2 over na ions and li et al 2016 reported preferential electrosorption of sulfate so 4 2 over no 3 in zhao et al 2012b experiments were conducted with an initial concentration of na that was five times higher than of ca 2 initially na ions were preferentially electrosorbed but after some time ca 2 replaced the na ions the separation factor of ca 2 over na eq 12 for this experiment was 7 when the adsorption time was extended from one to 5 h the separation factor increased to 25 furthermore zhao et al 2012b also showed that the separation factor can be increased up to 300 when several desalination cycles are performed this study illustrates that ion selectivity can be increased by adjusting the system operation for monovalent ions with different size preferential ion electrosorption is often explained by a size affinity trend i e smaller ions are preferentially electrosorbed over larger ions dykstra et al 2016a hou and huang 2013 suss 2017 for ions with the same valence and similar hydrated size e g no 3 and cl ion selectivity cannot be related to ion size preferential separation of no 3 over cl ions was studied by chen et al 2015 who reported that in the early stage of an adsorption step cl ions were preferentially adsorbed in the edls while at later stage cl ions were replaced by no 3 this result indicates that time dependent selectivity also occurs with mixtures of monovalent ions li et al 2016 introduced the hydrated ratio which is the ratio of the hydrated over the bare ion radius to evaluate the preferential electrosorption of monovalent ions this work reported selectivity towards anions with a higher hydrated ratio furthermore sun et al 2018 tried to correlate selectivity with electronegativity they found that ions with higher electronegativity are preferentially electrosorbed ion selectivity between monovalent ions has also been studied in modified carbon electrodes oyarzun et al 2018 used carbon electrodes functionalized with quaternary amines cathode and benzene sulphonate anode to increase selectivity towards no 3 over cl guyes et al 2019 reported enhanced selectivity towards potassium ions with chemically oxidized cathodes the aforementioned studies are based on cdi with only carbon electrodes preferential electrosorption of ions can also be promoted with ion exchange membranes kim and choi 2012 increased the selectivity towards no 3 by coating the anode surface of carbon electrodes with a polymeric solution containing no 3 selective ion exchange resins with this approach kim et al achieved a separation factor between no 3 and cl β no 3 cl of 3 2 which was higher than the separation obtained with commercial ion exchange membranes fig 1b preferential so 4 2 removal was reported by tang et al 2017 using membrane capacitive deionization cation selectivity in intercalation materials for cdi such as using prussian blue analogues is reviewed by singh et al 2019 lastly new electrode materials have been developed to not only adsorb no 3 but also reduce it to nitrogen gas during electrode regeneration hu et al 2018 in the present work we study selective removal of no 3 and cl by porous carbons we perform two different types of experiment i adsorption to study selective removal without electrically charging the carbon material and ii electrosorption with charging the carbon i e cdi the cdi experiments are performed as function of the no 3 over cl ratio in the water and charging voltage for both types of experiments we find significant preferential removal of no 3 over cl we show that in both cases experimental data can be well described with the amphoteric donnan model for ion adsorption in edls in the model we include a term to account for the affinity of the carbon surface for no 3 we show that this affinity term leads to a high selectivity between the two ions in case of absence of a charging voltage or a low voltage furthermore we show that the affinity effect remains important at a high voltage v ch 1 2 v where electrostatic effects also come to play a role 2 theory to describe ion adsorption in the edls formed in microporous carbon materials we use the amphoteric donnan amph d model this model takes into account edl overlap in sufficiently small micropores smaller than the debye length which is typically the case for cdi with microporous carbons and the model includes the presence of chemical charge on the surface of the carbon i e lining the micropore regions arulrajan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 kim et al 2019 mubita et al 2018 the amph d model considers that there are two types of surface charge located in two different regions in the micropores one region with acidic groups region a and one region with basic groups region b the two regions are expected to be near one another well mixed throughout the electrode but nevertheless each has its own distinct ionic composition resulting from the difference in nearby surface charge chemical interactions between ions and chemical groups present at the carbon surface can be included in the amph d model e g positively charged chemical groups at the surface for which we use the general symbol b can chemically bind ions for example no 3 according to the reaction b no 3 b no 3 this adsorption process can be modelled in equilibrium using a pk constant which describes the state of the equilibrium as function of the concentration of ionic species and the number of free and occupied adsorption sites hiemstra et al 1989 1999 these chemical interactions between ions and chemical groups affect the adsorption of specific ions as well as the chemical surface charge related is the ph dependency of the acidic and basic groups as considered by hemmatifar et al 2017 in a model with acidic and basic groups co existing in the same micropore region no separation in a and b regions instead of considering the binding constants of ions with the different chemical groups in the present work we use a simplified approach to describe chemical interactions by making use of a term μ that describes the affinity of the micropore for certain ions this term is incorporated in the description of the ion concentration in the micropores c mi i j according to the boltzmann equilibrium the resulting expression is 1 c m i i j c ma i exp z i δ ϕ d j μ i where subscript i refers to the ionic species and subscript j to the micropore region which can be either a or b the concentration in the macropores is c ma i z i is the valence of the ion and δ ϕ d j is the dimensionless donnan potential for all species except for no 3 we set μ to zero thus only for no 3 we assume that the binding to chemical groups can be appreciable for the other ions cl and k we assume they do not have a significant chemical binding to the surface and that they behave as inert species for which the normal boltzmann distribution applies i e eq 1 with μ 0 we use the same value of μ in both the a and b regions i e the present model assumes the affinity effect for no 3 does not depend on the nature of the chemical charge in each region in the micropores the amph d model describes three types of charge electronic charge in the carbon matrix σelec ionic charge in solution σionic and chemical charge at the carbon surface σchem overall each region in the micropores is charge neutral and thus 2 σ elec j σ chem j σ ionic j 0 the acidic region has a negative value of σ chem whereas the basic region has a positive value of σ chem to calculate σ ionic j in each region we use 3 σ ionic j i z i c mi i j in the micropores the ionic charge and electronic charge cannot come infinitely close therefore a dielectric layer is considered in between which is called the stern layer the potential over this layer δϕs j is related to the stern layer capacitance c s and σ elec j according to 4 σ elec j f v t δ ϕ s j c s where f is the faraday s constant and v t the thermal voltage given by v t rt f with r the gas constant and t the temperature in each electrode anode or cathode the potential drop over the edls δ ϕ edl is the sum of δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s and is equal for region a and b biesheuvel et al 2015 5 δ ϕ edl δ ϕ d a δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d b δ ϕ s b in addition for each electrode we calculate the average value for σ elec and σ ionic using 6 σ elec j a b α j σ elec j and σ ionic j a b α j σ ionic j where α j is the fraction of each region relative to the total micropore volume υ mi ac ml g electrode at equilibrium no transport of ions the cell voltage is related to δ ϕ edl in the anode an and in the cathode ca by 7 v cell v t δ ϕ edl an δ ϕ edl ca the ion adsorption capacity of the electrodes iac is calculated from the difference between the ion concentration in the micropore c i at the end of the adsorption step superscript ads end and the concentration at the end of the desorption step superscript des end and when both electrodes have the

electrodes combined is given by 10 σ f ½ f υ mi ac σ elec ads end σ elec des end next we define the charge efficiency for a mixture of monovalent ions as the ratio of the total number of ions adsorbed divided by a factor 2 over the charge transferred 11 λ f 2 i iac i σ f where i runs over all adsorbed ions finally to describe ion selectivity in the edls we use the separation factor β which is explained in detail by suss 2017 and is expressed as 12 β 1 2 iac 1 iac 2 c ma 2 c ma 1 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two different ionic species e g no 3 and cl the set of equations 1 12 describes ion adsorption in the micropores for a process that at the end of each step charging step discharge step reaches equilibrium i e there is no longer transport of ions into the micropores and is valid irrespective of the valences of the participating ions except eq 11 3 experimental 3 1 adsorption experiments batch experiments were conducted to study the adsorption of ions in activated carbon ac powder which is equilibrated with a salt solution a mass of 2 g of dry ac yp 50f kuraray chemical japan were immersed in 20 ml of multi ionic solutions containing either i one dissolved salt either 20 mm kno 3 or 20 mm kcl or ii salt mixtures with different no 3 to cl concentration ratios such as 1 2 and 2 1 21 mm total ionic strength and 1 3 1 1 and 3 1 20 mm total ionic strength the solution was continuously stirred for 24 h which is sufficiently long to reach equilibrium in the ion transport between bulk solution and micropores after this time the solution was filtered and the concentration of each ion in the filtrate was analyzed by ion chromatography ic the ion concentration in the micropores c mi i was calculated from the ion mass balance 13 v sol c initial i υ mi ac m ac c mi i v sol υ mi ac m ac c final i where v sol is the volume of solution m ac the mass of ac υ mi ac the ac micropore volume c initial i the initial concentration of ion i and c final i the concentration of ion i at the end of the adsorption experiment 3 2 electrosorption experiments cdi experiments were conducted in a stack with four cells each cell consisted of two graphite current collectors a pair of carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca electrode area 33 8 cm2 and a spacer channel glass fiber filter cat no ap2029325 millipore δsp 250 μm placed in between the electrodes through which an aqueous solution flows the electrodes used in the present study have been electrochemically characterized by other researchers oyarzun et al 2018 zhao et al 2012a the stack was ensembled as described by porada et al 2012 in which an aqueous solution flows in between the electrodes through the spacer channel the aqueous solution with a total volume of 160 ml was pumped through the stack with a flow rate of 30 ml min the system was operated in batch wise mode the solution was pumped from the feed container into the stack and the effluent of the stack was recirculated to the feed container the charging voltage v ch and discharge voltage v dch were controlled and the current was measured using a potentiostat ivium technologies the netherlands for each experiment we ran three cycles charging discharge to achieve dynamic equilibrium i e when the dynamic data of effluent concentration and current of a particular cycle is the same as of the previous cycle thereafter the fourth cycle was performed and we took samples from the feed container at different times during charging and discharge the ion concentration in solution was measured by ic with this concentration and the volume of solution we obtain the mole of ions in solution the difference between the mole of ions at the beginning of the electrosorption experiment and at equilibrium is the total ion adsorption this total ion adsorption was divided by the total mass of electrodes to obtain iac in mol g the half cycle time hct which is the duration of each step charging or discharge was always 90 min unless otherwise noted we present an overview of experimental conditions in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption experiments activated carbon is selective towards no 3 fig 2 shows the no 3 and cl concentration in the micropores of the carbon particles as function of the no 3 to cl equilibrium concentration ratio in solution preferential no 3 adsorption is observed even when the concentration of cl is three times higher than that of no 3 experiments performed with single salt solutions either no 3 or cl in solution showed that the concentration of cl ions in the micropores is 34 lower than that of no 3 c mi cl 86 mm and c mi no 3 130 mm these results show that commercial activated carbon materials which are often used to fabricate electrodes for cdi dykstra et al 2016b hatzell et al 2014 reale and smith 2018 have an affinity that favors the adsorption of no 3 in carbon micropores pore size and surface chemistry are affected by the fabrication and activation method of ac and play an important role on the adsorption capacity of ac chen and wu 2004 li et al 2002 seredych et al 2008 in the present work we report data obtained with microporous ac 80 of the total pore volume is due to pores with a size between 0 6 and 2 nm porada et al 2013 these pores are larger than the hydrated size of the ions used in this study and thus are accessible for ions therefore we consider that the surface chemistry rather than the pore size has an effect on the preferential adsorption of ions the surface chemistry of the ac is related to the presence of functional groups which are i acidic groups primarily oxygen containing groups such as phenolic carboxylic and lactonic and ii basic groups such as nitrogen containing functional groups or π electrons on the graphene layer boehm 1994 shafeeyan et al 2010 depending on the conditions such as the ph and solvent characteristics these functional groups can be dissociated or protonated thereby inducing attractive or repulse interactions with the ions in solution sun et al 2017 as the strength of the interactions between ions and functional groups is not the same for all ions we observe an effect on the preferential adsorption of ions ota et al 2013 in fig 2 we also show four theory curves two curves for no 3 and two for cl we used the affinity term μ which describes the interaction between each ion in solution with the uncharged carbon material as a fitting parameter theory describes our data very closely when the value of μ no 3 is 2 46 table 2 4 2 effect of the initial ion concentration and charging voltage on ion selectivity in cdi fig 3 a and fig 3b show equilibrium electrosorption data of β no 3 cl and the ion adsorption capacity iac as function of the no 3 to cl concentration ratio in the feed solution we observe that β no 3 cl increases with the no 3 to cl concentration ratio in feed solution fig 3a in fig 3b we see that with increasing initial no 3 to cl concentration ratio the difference between the concentration of no 3 and cl in the micropores increases before equilibrium is reached however preferential ion electrosorption is determined by the initial concentration ratio the ion with the highest concentration in solution was predominantly electrosorbed data not shown fig 4 a shows that β no 3 cl decreases with charging voltage but the affinity effect does not diminish much and continues to play an important role also at a high voltage charge and iac increase with charging voltage fig 4b and c fig 4d shows that the charge efficiency is much lower than unity which can be explained by the desorption of co ions ions with the same charge as the electrode from the carbon surface at the beginning of the charging step dykstra et al 2016b hassanvand et al 2018 zhao et al 2010 to describe the experimental data in figs 3 and 4 we use the theory outlined in section 2 for the calculations values for parameters σ chem υ mi ac c s and μ i are required the parameter value for σ chem was obtained from biesheuvel 2015 while the other parameters were fitted see table 2 we find that both the adsorption and electrosorption data are theoretically described using the same value for μ i for the adsorption experiments for which activated carbon powder was used we found a micropore volume significantly higher than the micropore volume of the electrosorption experiments for which electrodes were used this finding is supported by previous work that showed that the micropore volume of activated carbon kuraray yp 50f 0 67 ml g ac was significantly higher than the micropore volume of the electrode material per gram of dry activated carbon used for synthesis 0 56 ml g ac dykstra et al 2016b 4 3 electrosorption of nitrate and chloride ion selectivity is controlled by kinetics and equilibria next we analyze the dynamics of preferential electrosorption table 1 fig 5 a shows that the no 3 concentration continuously decreases for about 30 min until it reaches a constant value whereas the cl concentration decreases only for about 15 min thereafter we observe an increase of the cl concentration in solution which means that no 3 ions gradually displace cl ions this phenomenon was previously reported by chen et al 2015 for the same mixture of ions according to hassanvand et al 2018 ion selectivity can be explained as a two step phenomenon the first step is controlled by ion kinetics and the second by adsorption equilibria we will analyze both phenomena to quantify ion selectivity we use the separation factor β no 3 cl which we show in fig 5a as function of time values of β no 3 cl higher than 1 indicate that no 3 ions are preferentially electrosorbed over cl ions as fig 5a shows the separation factor increases over time which indicates that preferential ion electrosorption is a time dependent process at the beginning of the charging step more cl than no 3 is electrosorbed in the edls β no 3 cl 0 7 at this stage it is likely that ion selectivity is governed by ion transport to the micropores the faster ion in this case cl is preferentially electrosorbed see diffusion coefficients of the ions in table 3 as electrosorption progresses β no 3 cl increases as a consequence of the displacement of cl by no 3 at equilibrium β no 3 cl reaches a maximum value of 6 0 at v ch 1 2 v ions in aqueous solution are surrounded by layers of water molecules that form the hydration shell marcus 2012 the ion hydration energy indicates how strong the ions hold these water molecules tansel 2012 the structure of the hydration shell can suffer rearrangements partial dehydration or complete loss of the water molecules depending on the interaction of ions with the surface through which they flow collins 1995 epsztein et al 2018 ions with lower hydration energy can more easily rearrange their hydration shell compared to ions with higher hydration energy it has been shown that ions need to strip off or deform their hydration shell to enter pores with smaller size than the ion hydrated size kalluri et al 2013 the mean size of the pores contained in our electrodes is larger than the ion hydrated size thus the pore size might not induce large perturbations in the hydration shell of no 3 and cl when these ions enter the pores therefore structural changes on the hydration shell are probably not the main cause of preferential electrosorption of no 3 ion carbon surface interactions may play a more important role in determining ion selectivity to support our findings of preferential adsorption of no 3 over cl at equilibrium we also conducted two stage electrosorption experiments fig 5b in the first stage we charged the cell to 1 2 v with only k and cl ions in solution after 30 min a 20 mm kno3 solution was added to the feed container same volume as the kcl solution in the feed container thus the resulting ion concentrations in the feed container are k 20 mm cl 10 mm and no 3 10 mm and the charging voltage was maintained for another 90 min as fig 5a shows cl starts to desorb from the edls immediately after no 3 is added to the solution we observe an increase in the cl concentration while the no 3 concentration decreases approximately 15 min after the addition of no 3 we observe only minor concentration changes 5 conclusions in this work we present adsorption and electrosorption data for nitrate and chloride ions at equilibrium we observe preferential adsorption of nitrate over chloride in the micropores several factors can contribute to the preferential electrosorption of ions such as the hydrated size of the ions and the interactions between the ions and the carbon surface as the hydrated size of nitrate and chloride are equal we conclude that the preferential adsorption of nitrate over chloride is due to chemical interactions between the ions and the carbon surface we also presented theory based on the amphoteric donnan amph d model to predict selectivity between nitrate and chloride in the micropores the theory can be extended to describe preferential adsorption of other monovalent ions as well until now the amph d model has not been used to describe ion selectivity we included an affinity term to describe the preferential adsorption of nitrate into the micropores although this affinity term is not associated to any particular property of the ion or micropore it certainly describes the interaction between ions and the uncharged carbon particles we acknowledge that this interaction is influenced by the surface chemistry and ion properties both

measured by ion chromatography combined with suppressed conductivity detection an ag19 4 μm guard and an as19 4 μm analytical column thermo fisher scientific were used for the separation the quantification limits for se iv se vi and br were about 5 5 and 10 μg l 1 respectively most of the anions mentioned above were measured in duplicate and the standard deviation of the method was 10 in the natural water experiment the residual oxidant concentration during chlorination representing the sum of the concentrations of chlorine and bromine was measured by the dpd method apha 1998 dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined with a toc vpn analyzer shimadzu japan 2 3 determination of reaction stoichiometries the stoichiometries of the reactions between se iv and each oxidant o3 in presence of 0 2 mm tert butanol to suppress hydroxyl radical reactions were measured with se iv in excess in each case increasing concentrations of the oxidant were added under rapid stirring to buffered se iv containing solutions with 10 mm or 50 mm acetate ph 6 0 phosphate ph range 6 0 8 5 and borate ph range 9 0 11 0 analyses of the samples were performed after complete depletion of the oxidants 2 4 kinetic experiments second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 in presence of 0 2 mm tert butanol mn vii and h2o2 were measured by various techniques selected according to the reactant characteristics and the magnitude of the second order rate constants all kinetic measurements were performed under pseudo first order conditions where the se iv was always in a 10 fold molar excess over the oxidant at a constant temperature of 23 1 c the ph was controlled by buffering the oxidant and se iv solutions with 10 or 50 mm acetate ph range 4 0 5 5 phosphate ph range 3 0 6 0 8 5 or 11 0 or borate ph range 9 0 11 0 buffers a quench flow apparatus sfm400 q bio logic sas france was employed to conduct rapid kinetic experiments individual experimental procedures are summarized in table s1 and are described in detail in text s1 2 5 kinetic simulation the chemical kinetic simulator kintecus ianni 2014 was used to simulate the evolution of se iv and se vi during selected oxidation processes reaction equations involving se iv oxidation kinetics acid base equilibria and oxidant decay were used see models s1 and s2 si for more information 2 6 natural water experiments natural water was collected from lake greifensee switzerland and its main characteristics are summarized in table s2 the collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters cellulose nitrate membrane satorius stedim biotech gmbh germany and stored at 4 c until use natural water was spiked with se iv 100 μg l 1 0 78 μm and br concentration range 0 200 μg l 1 0 2 5 μm at ph 7 0 no buffer used and controlled by 0 1 m hcl and naoh and treated with chlorine and o3 doses in the range of 0 2 0 mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction order and stoichiometries of se iv oxidation pseudo first order rate constants k obs were obtained for the reactions of se iv in excess 10 fold with each oxidant by linear regression of plots of ln oxidant oxidant o versus time se iv reaction orders were determined by evaluating the dependence of k obs on se iv for each reaction correlations between log k obs and log se iv for chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 with high correlation coefficients r 2 0 99 indicate that the reactions can be considered first order with respect to se iv and the oxidant fig 1 in addition stoichiometries of se iv oxidation by chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 and h2o2 were found to be 1 1 whereas the reaction stoichiometry for the ratios of δ se iv to δ mn vii were found to be 5 2 3 2 and 1 2 for acidic neutral and alkaline conditions respectively si fig s1 the overall rate equations for the reactions can thus be expressed by a second order kinetic model eq 3 3 d se iv t dt 1 η d ox t dt k app se iv t ox t k obs ox t where k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of se iv with oxidants at a particular ph calculated by dividing k obs by se iv t se iv t h2seo3 hseo3 seo3 2 and can be considered constant because se iv was applied in a large excess over the oxidant pseudo first order conditions accordingly k app ox is given by eq 4 4 k app ox i 1 2 j 1 2 3 k i j α i β j where α i and β j are the molar fractions of oxidant and se iv present as species i and j at a given ph k ij represents the specific second order rate constant for oxidant species i and se iv species j 3 2 reaction kinetics of se iv oxidation chlorine the kinetics of the reaction of se iv with chlorine was measured under pseudo first order conditions with se iv in large molar excess over chlorine 10 μm si fig s2a and table s3 a plot of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with chlorine k app chlorine as a function of the ph is shown in fig 2 a k app chlorine is 61 0 3 6m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 and corresponds to a half life time t1 2 for se iv of 13 5 min in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 chlorine 14 μm the ph dependence of k app chlorine can be explained by reactions between various chlorine and se iv species as described in eq s1 s9 of si text s2 hseo3 and seo3 2 are the major forms of se iv near neutral ph whereas the concentration of h2seo3 is low it can be expected that the deprotonated species are stronger nucleophiles and have higher reactivity with the electrophilic hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 which itself has a pka of 7 53 morris 1966 eq 5 5 hocl ocl h pka hocl 7 53 k app chlorine is defined by eq 4 and the species specific second order rate constants k ij calculated for the reactions by fitting the experimental data using nonlinear least square regression are shown in table 1 the model fit shown in fig 2a was obtained by using these k ij and it is demonstrated that eq 4 describes the measured k app chlorine well the value k 23 is negligible in the ph range studied and chlorine se iv reactivity is governed by k 12 k 13 and k 22 under these conditions for nomenclature of k values see tables 1 and si text s2 bromine because the second order rate constant for the reaction of chlorine with se iv is only moderate bromine may play a role as a secondary oxidant for se iv oxidation during chlorination bromide which occurs naturally and its concentration in aquatic systems may increase by anthropogenic activities pan and zhang 2013 soltermann et al 2016 reacts rapidly with chlorine to produce hobr bro pka hobr 8 8 haag and hoigné 1983 heeb et al 2014 during chlorination k hocl br 1550 m 1 s 1 k ocl br 9 10 4 m 1 s 1 kumar and margerum 1987 zhu and zhang 2016 thus the kinetics of the bromine se iv reaction was investigated under pseudo first order conditions molar se iv bromine tot 10 in batch and continuous flow systems si figs s2b and s2c and table s4 the ph dependence of k app bromine is shown in fig 2b k app bromine for the reaction of se iv with bromine at ph 7 0 is 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 t1 2 11 6 s in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 bromine 10 3 μm which is about a factor of 100 higher than the corresponding apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of se iv with chlorine the ph dependence of k app bromine can be formulated analogously to the chlorine se iv reaction system si eq s1 s9 text s2 and the species specific second order rate constants for the hobr se iv reaction system are shown in table 1 the contribution of each bromine se iv species pair is also shown in fig 2b dashed lines and it can be concluded that the kinetics for the oxidation of se iv by bromine is controlled by k 12 k 13 and k 22 analogous to the reaction between chlorine and se iv table 1 monochloramine k app nh 2 cl for the reaction of se iv with nh2cl is shown as a function of the ph 5 0 11 0 in figs 2c and si fig s2d se iv reacts very slowly with nh2cl si table s5 with k app nh 2 cl 1 3 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 which corresponds to a t1 2 for se iv of 441 days in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nh2cl 14 μm the increase of k app nh 2 cl with decreasing ph fig 2c suggests an acid catalysis in analogy to the reactions of nh2cl with so3 2 no2 and i yiin et al 1987 the plateau of k app nh 2 cl at around ph 6 0 is due to the canceling effects of increased h concentration and formation of hseo3 which is a weaker nucleophile than seo3 2 at ph 5 0 the oxidation rate increases because hseo3 reaches a plateau and the acid catalysis increases the trends in fig 2c can be attributed to h catalyzed reactions of nh2cl with one or more anionic se iv species according to eq 6 6 k app nh 2 cl h j 1 2 3 4 k j β j where k j represents the specific third order h catalysis rate constant for each of the two anionic se iv species the k j values were obtained from a model fit using the k obs si eq s13 s16 text s3 and are listed in table 1 the kinetic data indicates that the reaction of se iv with nh2cl is negligible under typical drinking water disinfection conditions ozone the ph dependence of apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of o3 with se iv k app o 3 is shown in fig 2d with the numerical values in si table s6 the k app o 3 is 513 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 yielding a t1 2 of about 64 3 s for se iv in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 o3 21 μm since o3 does not undergo acid base speciation k app o 3 is determined by the se iv speciation alone si eqs s18 and s19 text s4 k app o 3 is mostly controlled by the o3 seo3 2 reaction the contribution of h2seo3 and hseo3 to the reaction with o3 is negligible i e k hseo 3 o 3 0 5 m 1 s 1 the species specific second order rate constants for the o3 se iv reaction system are provided in table 1 permanganate the kinetics of the mn vii se iv reactions were investigated in the ph range 2 0 10 0 and the ph dependence of k app mn vii is shown in figs 2e s2e s2f and si table s7 the observed trend to higher k app mn vii with increasing h is caused by an increase in the reduction potential eo of mn vii with decreasing ph speight 2004 k app mn vii at ph 7 0 was 2 1 0 1 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a t1 2 of 14 6 h for se iv in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 mn vii 6 3 μm within the ph range of 8 0 10 0 k app mn vii exhibits a decreasing trend due to the presence of seo3 2 p k a h s e o 3 8 50 which is less reactive than hseo3 with permanganate based on a higher electrostatic repulsion this was demonstrated previously for the permanganate sulfite reaction simandi et al 1985 based on the kinetic behavior observed in fig 2e the ph dependence of k app mn vii can be explained by seven parallel reactions si eqs s22 s28 text s5 between the three se iv species and two mn vii species hmno4 and mno4 the determined species specific rate constants for the relevant reactions are k 12 5 4 0 4 105 m 1 s 1 k 13 6 9 0 1 1010 m 1 s 1 k 21 4 8 0 4 m 1 s 1 k 22 1 2 0 1 m 1 s 1 and k 23 0 4 0 1 m 1 s 1 see table 1 for explanation of individual k values the regression results show that in the tested ph range 2 0 10 0 the overall reaction is controlled by reactions of hmno4 with hseo3 and seo3 2 in si eqs s24 and s25 text s5 the contribution of the reactions of hmno4 and mno4 with h2seo3 was small because of the smaller overlap of these species at any given ph the reaction of hmno4 with h2seo3 was also found to be negligible it should be noted that deviations of the fitting at higher ph 10 can be attributed to mn iv as the final product which can adsorb co precipitate and react with se iv resulting in higher rate constants compared to the calculated values h 2 o 2 fig 2f shows the apparent second order rate constants k app h 2 o 2 for the reactions of h2o2 with se iv as a function of ph also see si fig s2g and table s8 in addition to the se iv speciation the ph speciation of h2o2 also needs to be considered eq 7 staehelin and hoigne 1982 7 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h pk a h 2 o 2 11 6 the calculated species specific second order rate constants for the reactions in eqs s31 s35 si text s6 are shown in table 1 the species specific rate constants determined using nonlinear curve fitting are k 12 2 4 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k 13 7 6 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k 22 negligible k 23 2 1 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k app h 2 o 2 is 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 fig 2f table 1 and corresponds to a t1 2 for se iv of about 31 years for a h2o2 concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 29 4 μm overall the reaction of h2o2 with seo3 2 controls the kinetics in the tested ph range 8 0 11 0 and the reaction of hseo3 with ho2 becomes important for ph 11 0 and the reaction between hseo3 and h2o2 for ph 8 0 this is a consequence of h2o2 being a stronger electrophile than ho2 and seo3 2 being a stronger nucleophile than hseo3 which is analogous to the reaction between h2o2 and hocl or hobr held et al 1978 von gunten and oliveras 1997 the species specific and apparent ph 7 0 second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with the selected oxidants chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 are summarized in table 1 the results show 8 orders of magnitude difference between the apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 0 ranging from 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 for hobr to 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 for h2o2 for typical water treatment conditions the secondorder rate constants for the oxidation of se iv follow the order bromine o3 chlorine mn vii nh2cl h2o2 3 3 mechanistic considerations chlorine or bromine a halogen transfer followed by hydrolysis is quite common for the reactions of inorganic oxyanions with chlorine and bromine deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 therefore on the basis of the reaction of so3 2 with chlorine or bromine by hydrolysis of a clso3 or brso3 intermediate fogelman et al 1989 troy and margerum 1991 we assumed that analogous reactions occur with se iv the formation of brseo3 was expected to be faster than clseo3 because the partial positive charge on br is higher than on cl in hox and the o br bond is weaker than the o cl bond deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 weast 1984 this is illustrated by the significantly higher second order rate constants for the reaction of se iv with hobr than with hocl monochloramine nh2cl is known to react with a number of inorganic nucleophiles e g so3 2 no2 i and br via acid catalyzed cl transfer to yield the same chloro intermediates produced in the corresponding hocl reactions yiin et al 1987 based on the reaction order and the 1 1 stoichiometry of the nh2cl se iv reaction together with a ph dependence of k app nh2cl the oxidation of se iv by nh2cl is consistent with a mechanism which involves a proton transfer to nh2cl to form nh3cl and a cl transfer to seo3 2 yielding clseo3 which then hydrolyzes rapidly in water yiin et al 1987 ozone o3 often reacts with inorganic oxyanions by o transfer to the nucleophile via a primary ozonide adduct involving a two electron transfer process this adduct decomposes to yield the oxidized substrate and 1o2 liu et al 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction order and the 1 1 stoichiometry of the o3 se iv reaction supports this hypothesis permangnate oxidation of se iv by mn vii involves a series of reactions which depend on the ph dependent speciation of the two reaction partners detailed investigations of the mechanisms involved in mn vii oxidation have been presented previously nadimpalli et al 1993 simandi et al 1985 similar to its reactions with other anions i e so3 2 and no2 halperin and tauber 1952 song et al 2017 mn vii reacts with se iv generally to manganate vi by a one electron transfer which is the rate determining step however subsequent ph dependent reactions may then occur under acidic conditions manganate is unstable and a series of disproportionation and reduction reactions occur leading ultimately to mn ii as the final product under neutral and alkaline conditions mn iv is the final product of the mn vii reaction with se iv h 2 o 2 analogous to its role in sulfite oxidation lagrange et al 1996 h2o2 acts by an oxygen atom transfer reaction in the oxidation of se iv with a transfer of two electrons the reaction of h2o2 with se iv forms a peroxyselenous acid intermediate hooseo2h which dehydrates to se vi hughes and martin 1955 3 4 effects of br on the kinetics of se vi formation during chlorination and ozonation the oxidation kinetics of se iv by chlorine and o3 was investigated in the presence of br concentrations of 0 2 5 μm which are typical concentration in natural waters pan and zhang 2013 soltermann et al 2016 during chlorination 2 0 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 50 of the se iv was oxidized to se vi after about 12 7 4 and 1 5 min for br concentrations of 0 0 625 1 25 and 2 5 μm respectively thus the presence of br significantly enhanced se vi formation during chlorination fig 3 furthermore the kinetics of se vi formation increases slightly with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 for chlorination of se iv containing water 100 μg l 1 fig s3 this is due to a combination of a slower oxidation of bromide to hobr by chlorine and the higher rate of se iv oxidation by bromine with a maximum at around ph 9 0 in contrast to chlorination br has a negligible effect on se iv oxidation during ozonation because the second order rate constant for the reaction of o3 with br is lower than that for the reaction of o3 with se iv the evolution of se vi during chlorination and ozonation of br containing waters were further investigated by simulations using the kintecus software details in si model 1 fig 3 si model 2 fig s4 this model was able to predict the formation of se vi during chlorination in the absence and presence of br fig 3 and the increase in the rate of se vi formation in the presence of br which is caused by the formation of hobr through the reaction of hocl and br si model 1 eq e4a and e4b the subsequent oxidation of se iv to se vi by bromine apparent second order rate constant at ph 7 0 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than for chlorine with a reduction of hobr to br si model 1 eqs r4 r7 which acts as a catalyst in the formation of se vi during chlorination this acceleration of se iv oxidation during chlorination of bromide containing waters is similar to the chlorine induced oxidation of other in organic constituents such as n n dimethylsulfamide mn ii hoi or cr iii in presence of bromide von gunten et al 2010 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2013 chebeir et al 2016 3 5 oxidation of se iv in a natural water chlorination and ozonation based on the kinetic studies above the efficiency of se iv oxidation in lake greifensee water si table s2 was explored for chlorination and ozonation fig 4 a and b shows the measured se iv losses and the se vi formation as a function of the hocl and o3 doses at 30 min reaction time respectively the yields of se vi in natural water were 100 for oxidant doses 1 5 mg l 1 si table s9 on a molar basis both oxidants exhibit similar oxidation efficiencies for se iv oxidation in the selected natural water 3 5 1 kinetics of the oxidation of se iv during chlorination of a natural water in presence of br to further test the efficiency of se iv oxidation a chlorination experiment was performed with a natural water sample spiked with se iv 100 μg l 1 0 78 μm and various br concentrations in the range of 50 μg l 1 0 625 μm to 200 μg l 1 2 5 μm the natural background bromide concentration is 15 μg l 1 si table s2 the formation of se vi is presented as a function of the oxidant exposure hox t hocl hobr in fig 5 the corresponding kinetics of the decrease in oxidant concentrations are shown in si fig s5 and are represented as the sum of hocl tot hobr tot with hox tot hox xo with x cl and br this representation takes into account the differences in oxidant stability due to the different molar hocl br ratios the overall oxidant stability is lower for higher br levels because of the higher reactivity of bromine with dissolved organic matter compared to chlorine as shown in fig 5 increasing the br concentrations in natural water significantly enhance the rate of se vi formation if it is normalized to the oxidant exposure 3 5 2 role of hydroxyl radical for the oxidation of se iv during ozonation in contrast to the determination of stoichiometries and reaction kinetics the ozonation experiments with natural waters were performed in absence of tert butanol during ozonation hydroxyl radical oh is generated as secondary oxidant by o3 decomposition reactions von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently the role of oh in the oxidation of se iv during ozonation has to be evaluated as well to estimate the contribution of oh the r ct which represents the ratio between the concentrations of oh and o3 at any time t during the reaction i e r ct oh o3 typical range of 10 9 r ct 10 8 during ozonation of natural waters can be used elovitz and von gunten 1999 se iv transformation during ozonation can be characterized by eq 8 and the contributions of o3 and oh to the oxidation of se iv were evaluated according to eqs 9 and 10 the second order rate constant for the reaction of oh with se iv as seo3 2 at high ph is quite high k oh hseo 3 2 9 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 and k oh seo 3 2 3 5 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 tamba and badiello 1977 the fraction of the se iv oxidized by oh calculated from eqs 9 and 10 von gunten 2003 shows that the contributions of oh to the observed se iv abatement were very low i e 0 5 5 of total observed loss for gf water wherefore se iv oxidation by oh can be neglected 8 ln se iv t

kinetics of the oxidation of se iv s iv and as iii table 2 summarizes the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv s iv and as iii with various oxidants at ph 7 0 for the selected oxyanions i e se iv s iv as iii s iv has the highest reactivity with the selected oxidants followed by as iii and then se iv table 2 the data in table 2 show that the apparent second order rate constants decrease typically in the order bromine o3 chlorine mn vii nh2cl h2o2 with half life values ranging from microseconds to years fig 6 shows the half lives for se iv oxidation except for oh for a typical oxidant concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 o3 was the most efficient primary oxidant during the oxidation of se iv containing waters according to the kinetic data presented in table 2 hobr reacts fast with s iv as iii and se iv in the order s iv as iii se iv which leads to an enhanced transformation of the corresponding anions even though hobr is normally formed in low concentrations low levels of br in natural waters the contribution of the oxidation by hobr during typical treatment conditions can still be important 4 conclusions the kinetics and mechanisms for the oxidation of se iv with various oxidants were determined based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for the various oxidants studied i e chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 the apparent second order rate constants for the oxidation of se iv at ph 7 0 vary over about 8 orders of magnitude from 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 for hobr to 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 for h2o2 2 for typical water treatment process conditions the order of oxidant reactivity is o3 hocl mn vii nh2cl h2o2 3 the presence of br significantly enhanced the se iv oxidation efficiency during chlorination however it had no effect during ozonation 4 a comparison between the oxidation of se iv s iv and as iii with the selected oxidants showed that s iv exhibited the highest reactivity followed by as iii and se iv 5 it can be expected that se iv is oxidized to se vi to a significant extent during drinking water chlorination or ozonation this leads to a significant reduction in the

also investigated during chlorination and ozonation of se iv containing water during chlorination bromide catalysis enhances the rate of the oxidation of se iv to se vi from 50 to nearly 90 with bromide concentrations of 50 μg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 respectively at ph 7 0 and a chlorine dose of 2 0 mg l 1 within 15 min during ozonation bromide had no effect on se iv oxidation based on the determined second order rate constants the oxidation of se iv by chlorine and ozone were successfully predicted in a natural water by a kinetic model the second order rate constants for the same

organisms has received wide attention raptis et al 1983 winkel et al 2012 in natural waters se can exist in different oxidation states ii 0 iv and vi of which selenite se iv or seo3 2 and selenate se vi or seo4 2 are the primary dissolved inorganic selenium species depending on the ph and redox conditions code and alaejos 1997 se iv e g in anaerobic groundwater has a higher bioavailability and its acute toxicity is approximately 5 10 times higher than for se vi which is usually present e g in well oxygenated surface waters frankenberger and engberg 1998 leblanc et al 2018 generally dissolved selenium in natural waters is present at concentrations 100 μg l 1 torres et al 2011 but concentrations of 200 500 μg l 1 can occur in groundwaters as a result of special geological formations agricultural runoff mining activities various industrial activities and via flue gas desulfurization lemly 2004 leblanc et al 2018 se iv but not se vi can be slowly within several weeks transformed by micro organisms to organo selenium compounds e g dimethyl selenide dimethyl diselenide with higher toxicity which can also cause taste and odour problems guadayol et al 2016 drinking water standards recommendations for selenium are 10 μg l 1 in the european union eu council 1998 40 μg l 1 world health organization 2011 and 50 μg l 1 in the usa us epa 2014 however based on new toxicological evidence it has recently been suggested that the drinking water standard should be lowered to 1 μg l 1 vinceti et al 2013 the biogeochemical cycling of se in atmospheric aqueous and soil environments involves complex biogeochemical processes and multiple se oxidation states which range from ii to vi winkel et al 2012 microbial transformations in both aqueous and terrestrial environments lead to the formation of dimethyl selenide and dimethyl diselenide which are also supplemented by se released as a result of fossil fuel combustion and volcanic activity however these low oxidation states of se are readily oxidized and se iv and se vi are the major selenium species deposited from the atmosphere winkel et al 2015 selenous acid h2seo3 behaves as a diprotic acid with pk a h 2 seo 3 2 74 and pk a hseo 3 8 50 eq 1 and 2 martell and smith 1974 th se iv occurs mainly in anionic forms as hseo3 and seo3 2 at circumneutral ph more than 99 of the dissolved se iv is present as hseo3 torres et al 2011 1 h 2 seo 3 h hseo 3 pk a h 2 seo 3 2 74 2 hseo 3 h seo 3 2 pk a hseo 3 8 50 because of the higher toxicity of se iv and the less efficient removal of se vi by e g coagulation hu et al 2015 it is necessary to understand the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidation reactions of se iv in water as a basis for elucidating its fate during oxidative water treatment or other environmental oxidation processes although a few previous studies have investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidation of se iv using mn vii and h2o2 under strong acidic neutral or alkaline conditions gruebel et al 1992 nadimpalli et al 1993 there is no systematic kinetic and mechanistic information for the oxidation of se iv by common oxidants used for water treatment e g chlorine ozone o3 monochloramine nh2cl etc additionally considering similarities in the chemistry of selenium arsenic and sulfur a comparative evaluation of the chemical reactivity with the selected oxidants provides further insights into the fate of these elements during water treatment the goal of the present study was to determine the apparent and species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with various water treatment oxidants chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 in the ph range 2 0 13 0 the reaction orders and stoichiometries were also measured to elucidate the possible oxidation mechanisms in addition the effects of bromide br on the kinetics of se vi formation during chlorination and ozonation were studied furthermore the kinetics of the species specific oxidation of se iv by chlorine and o3 was modeled and validated for a natural water finally kinetic information was used to compare the kinetics of the oxidation of se iv as iii and s iv with the selected oxidants 2 materials and

h2o2 and standardized by uv absorption ε 240nm 40 m 1 cm 1 miller and kester 1988 2 2 analytical methods chlorine was determined by reaction with the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd apha 1998 bromine was determined with the 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylben zothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts pinkernell et al 2000 and h2o2 with the titanium oxalate method sellers 1980 nh2cl o3 and mn vii were monitored directly by its absorbance at 243 nm ε 461 m 1 cm 1 yiin et al 1987 260 nm ε 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 525 nm ε 2500 m 1 cm 1 jiang et al 2012 respectively se iv se vi and br were measured by ion chromatography combined with suppressed conductivity detection an ag19 4 μm guard and an as19 4 μm analytical column thermo fisher scientific were used for the separation the quantification limits for se iv se vi and br were about 5 5 and 10 μg l 1 respectively most of the anions mentioned above were measured in duplicate and the standard deviation of the method was 10 in the natural water experiment the residual oxidant concentration during chlorination representing the sum of the concentrations of chlorine and bromine was measured by the dpd method apha 1998 dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined with a toc vpn analyzer shimadzu japan 2 3 determination of reaction stoichiometries the stoichiometries of the reactions between se iv and each oxidant o3 in presence of 0 2 mm tert butanol to suppress hydroxyl radical reactions were measured with se iv in excess in each case increasing concentrations of the oxidant were added under rapid stirring to buffered se iv containing solutions with 10 mm or 50 mm acetate ph 6 0 phosphate ph range 6 0 8 5 and borate ph range 9 0 11 0 analyses of the samples were performed after complete depletion of the oxidants 2 4 kinetic experiments second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 in presence of 0 2 mm tert butanol mn vii and h2o2 were measured by various techniques selected according to the reactant characteristics and the magnitude of the second order rate constants all kinetic measurements were performed under pseudo first order conditions where the se iv was always in a 10 fold molar excess over the oxidant at a constant temperature of 23 1 c the ph was controlled by buffering the oxidant and se iv solutions with 10 or 50 mm acetate ph range 4 0 5 5 phosphate ph range 3 0 6 0 8 5 or 11 0 or borate ph range 9 0 11 0 buffers a quench flow apparatus sfm400 q bio logic sas france was employed to conduct rapid kinetic experiments individual experimental procedures are summarized in table s1 and are described in detail in text s1 2 5 kinetic simulation the chemical kinetic simulator kintecus ianni 2014 was used to simulate the evolution of se iv and se vi during selected oxidation processes reaction equations involving se iv oxidation kinetics acid base equilibria and oxidant decay were used see models s1 and s2 si for more information 2 6 natural water experiments natural water was collected from lake greifensee switzerland and its main characteristics are summarized in table s2 the collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters cellulose nitrate membrane satorius stedim biotech gmbh germany and stored at 4 c until use natural water was spiked with se iv 100 μg l 1 0 78 μm and br concentration range 0 200 μg l 1 0 2 5 μm at ph 7 0 no buffer used and controlled by 0 1 m hcl and naoh and treated with chlorine and o3 doses in the range of 0 2 0 mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction order and stoichiometries of se iv oxidation pseudo first order rate constants k obs were obtained for the reactions of se iv in excess 10 fold with each oxidant by linear regression of plots of ln oxidant oxidant o versus time se iv reaction orders were determined by evaluating the dependence of k obs on se iv for each reaction correlations between log k obs and log se iv for chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 with high correlation coefficients r 2 0 99 indicate that the reactions can be considered first order with respect to se iv and the oxidant fig 1 in addition stoichiometries of se iv oxidation by chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 and h2o2 were found to be 1 1 whereas the reaction stoichiometry for the ratios of δ se iv to δ mn vii were found to be 5 2 3 2 and 1 2 for acidic neutral and alkaline conditions respectively si fig s1 the overall rate equations for the reactions can thus be expressed by a second order kinetic model eq 3 3 d se iv t dt 1 η d ox t dt k app se iv t ox t k obs ox t where k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of se iv with oxidants at a particular ph calculated by dividing k obs by se iv t se iv t h2seo3 hseo3 seo3 2 and can be considered constant because se iv was applied in a large excess over the oxidant pseudo first order conditions accordingly k app ox is given by eq 4 4 k app ox i 1 2 j 1 2 3 k i j α i β j where α i and β j are the molar fractions of oxidant and se iv present as species i and j at a given ph k ij represents the specific second order rate constant for oxidant species i and se iv species j 3 2 reaction kinetics of se iv oxidation chlorine the kinetics of the reaction of se iv with chlorine was measured under pseudo first order conditions with se iv in large molar excess over chlorine 10 μm si fig s2a and table s3 a plot of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with chlorine k app chlorine as a function of the ph is shown in fig 2 a k app chlorine is 61 0 3 6m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 and corresponds to a half life time t1 2 for se iv of 13 5 min in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 chlorine 14 μm the ph dependence of k app chlorine can be explained by reactions between various chlorine and se iv species as described in eq s1 s9 of si text s2 hseo3 and seo3 2 are the major forms of se iv near neutral ph whereas the concentration of h2seo3 is low it can be expected that the deprotonated species are stronger nucleophiles and have higher reactivity with the electrophilic hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 which itself has a pka of 7 53 morris 1966 eq 5 5 hocl ocl h pka hocl 7 53 k app chlorine is defined by eq 4 and the species specific second order rate constants k ij calculated for the reactions by fitting the experimental data using nonlinear least square regression are shown in table 1 the model fit shown in fig 2a was obtained by using these k ij and it is demonstrated that eq 4 describes the measured k app chlorine well the value k 23 is negligible in the ph range studied and chlorine se iv reactivity is governed by k 12 k 13 and k 22 under these conditions for nomenclature of k values see tables 1 and si text s2 bromine because the second order rate constant for the reaction of chlorine with se iv is only moderate bromine may play a role as a secondary oxidant for se iv oxidation during chlorination bromide which occurs naturally and its concentration in aquatic systems may increase by anthropogenic activities pan and zhang 2013 soltermann et al 2016 reacts rapidly with chlorine to produce hobr bro pka hobr 8 8 haag and hoigné 1983 heeb et al 2014 during chlorination k hocl br 1550 m 1 s 1 k ocl br 9 10 4 m 1 s 1 kumar and margerum 1987 zhu and zhang 2016 thus the kinetics of the bromine se iv reaction was investigated under pseudo first order conditions molar se iv bromine tot 10 in batch and continuous flow systems si figs s2b and s2c and table s4 the ph dependence of k app bromine is shown in fig 2b k app bromine for the reaction of se iv with bromine at ph 7 0 is 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 t1 2 11 6 s in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 bromine 10 3 μm which is about a factor of 100 higher than the corresponding apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of se iv with chlorine the ph dependence of k app bromine can be formulated analogously to the chlorine se iv reaction system si eq s1 s9 text s2 and the species specific second order rate constants for the hobr se iv reaction system are shown in table 1 the contribution of each bromine se iv species pair is also shown in fig 2b dashed lines and it can be concluded that the kinetics for the oxidation of se iv by bromine is controlled by k 12 k 13 and k 22 analogous to the reaction between chlorine and se iv table 1 monochloramine k app nh 2 cl for the reaction of se iv with nh2cl is shown as a function of the ph 5 0 11 0 in figs 2c and si fig s2d se iv reacts very slowly with nh2cl si table s5 with k app nh 2 cl 1 3 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 which corresponds to a t1 2 for se iv of 441 days in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nh2cl 14 μm the increase of k app nh 2 cl with decreasing ph fig 2c suggests an acid catalysis in analogy to the reactions of nh2cl with so3 2 no2 and i yiin et al 1987 the plateau of k app nh 2 cl at around ph 6 0 is due to the canceling effects of increased h concentration and formation of hseo3 which is a weaker nucleophile than seo3 2 at ph 5 0 the oxidation rate increases because hseo3 reaches a plateau and the acid catalysis increases the trends in fig 2c can be attributed to h catalyzed reactions of nh2cl with one or more anionic se iv species according to eq 6 6 k app nh 2 cl h j 1 2 3 4 k j β j where k j represents the specific third order h catalysis rate constant for each of the two anionic se iv species the k j values were obtained from a model fit using the k obs si eq s13 s16 text s3 and are listed in table 1 the kinetic data indicates that the reaction of se iv with nh2cl is negligible under typical drinking water disinfection conditions ozone the ph dependence of apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of o3 with se iv k app o 3 is shown in fig 2d with the numerical values in si table s6 the k app o 3 is 513 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 yielding a t1 2 of about 64 3 s for se iv in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 o3 21 μm since o3 does not undergo acid base speciation k app o 3 is determined by the se iv speciation alone si eqs s18 and s19 text s4 k app o 3 is mostly controlled by the o3 seo3 2 reaction the contribution of h2seo3 and hseo3 to the reaction with o3 is negligible i e k hseo 3 o 3 0 5 m 1 s 1 the species specific second order rate constants for the o3 se iv reaction system are provided in table 1 permanganate the kinetics of the mn vii se iv reactions were investigated in the ph range 2 0 10 0 and the ph dependence of k app mn vii is shown in figs 2e s2e s2f and si table s7 the observed trend to higher k app mn vii with increasing h is caused by an increase in the reduction potential eo of mn vii with decreasing ph speight 2004 k app mn vii at ph 7 0 was 2 1 0 1 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a t1 2 of 14 6 h for se iv in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 mn vii 6 3 μm within the ph range of 8 0 10 0 k app mn vii exhibits a decreasing trend due to the presence of seo3 2 p k a h s e o 3 8 50 which is less reactive than hseo3 with permanganate based on a higher electrostatic repulsion this was demonstrated previously for the permanganate sulfite reaction simandi et al 1985 based on the kinetic behavior observed in fig 2e the ph dependence of k app mn vii can be explained by seven parallel reactions si eqs s22 s28 text s5 between the three se iv species and two mn vii species hmno4 and mno4 the determined species specific rate constants for the relevant reactions are k 12 5 4 0 4 105 m 1 s 1 k 13 6 9 0 1 1010 m 1 s 1 k 21 4 8 0 4 m 1 s 1 k 22 1 2 0 1 m 1 s 1 and k 23 0 4 0 1 m 1 s 1 see table 1 for explanation of individual k values the regression results show that in the tested ph range 2 0 10 0 the overall reaction is controlled by reactions of hmno4 with hseo3 and seo3 2 in si eqs s24 and s25 text s5 the contribution of the reactions of hmno4 and mno4 with h2seo3 was small because of the smaller overlap of these species at any given ph the reaction of hmno4 with h2seo3 was also found to be negligible it should be noted that deviations of the fitting at higher ph 10 can be attributed to mn iv as the final product which can adsorb co precipitate and react with se iv resulting in higher rate constants compared to the calculated values h 2 o 2 fig 2f shows the apparent second order rate constants k app h 2 o 2 for the reactions of h2o2 with se iv as a function of ph also see si fig s2g and table s8 in addition to the se iv speciation the ph speciation of h2o2 also needs to be considered eq 7 staehelin and hoigne 1982 7 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h pk a h 2 o 2 11 6 the calculated species specific second order rate constants for the reactions in eqs s31 s35 si text s6 are shown in table 1 the species specific rate constants determined using nonlinear curve fitting are k 12 2 4 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k 13 7 6 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k 22 negligible k 23 2 1 0 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 k app h 2 o 2 is 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 fig 2f table 1 and corresponds to a t1 2 for se iv of about 31 years for a h2o2 concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 29 4 μm overall the reaction of h2o2 with seo3 2 controls the kinetics in the tested ph range 8 0 11 0 and the reaction of hseo3 with ho2 becomes important for ph 11 0 and the reaction between hseo3 and h2o2 for ph 8 0 this is a consequence of h2o2 being a stronger electrophile than ho2 and seo3 2 being a stronger nucleophile than hseo3 which is analogous to the reaction between h2o2 and hocl or hobr held et al 1978 von gunten and oliveras 1997 the species specific and apparent ph 7 0 second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv with the selected oxidants chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 are summarized in table 1 the results show 8 orders of magnitude difference between the apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 0 ranging from 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 for hobr to 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 for h2o2 for typical water treatment conditions the secondorder rate constants for the oxidation of se iv follow the order bromine o3 chlorine mn vii nh2cl h2o2 3 3 mechanistic considerations chlorine or bromine a halogen transfer followed by hydrolysis is quite common for the reactions of inorganic oxyanions with chlorine and bromine deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 therefore on the basis of the reaction of so3 2 with chlorine or bromine by hydrolysis of a clso3 or brso3 intermediate fogelman et al 1989 troy and margerum 1991 we assumed that analogous reactions occur with se iv the formation of brseo3 was expected to be faster than clseo3 because the partial positive charge on br is higher than on cl in hox and the o br bond is weaker than the o cl bond deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 weast 1984 this is illustrated by the significantly higher second order rate constants for the reaction of se iv with hobr than with hocl monochloramine nh2cl is known to react with a number of inorganic nucleophiles e g so3 2 no2 i and br via acid catalyzed cl transfer to yield the same chloro intermediates produced in the corresponding hocl reactions yiin et al 1987 based on the reaction order and the 1 1 stoichiometry of the nh2cl se iv reaction together with a ph dependence of k app nh2cl the oxidation of se iv by nh2cl is consistent with a mechanism which involves a proton transfer to nh2cl to form nh3cl and a cl transfer to seo3 2 yielding clseo3 which then hydrolyzes rapidly in water yiin et al 1987 ozone o3 often reacts with inorganic oxyanions by o transfer to the nucleophile via a primary ozonide adduct involving a two electron transfer process this adduct decomposes to yield the oxidized substrate and 1o2 liu et al 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction order and the 1 1 stoichiometry of the o3 se iv reaction supports this hypothesis permangnate oxidation of se iv by mn vii involves a series of reactions which depend on the ph dependent speciation of the two reaction partners detailed investigations of the mechanisms involved in mn vii oxidation have been presented previously nadimpalli et al 1993 simandi et al 1985 similar to its reactions with other anions i e so3 2 and no2 halperin and tauber 1952 song et al 2017 mn vii reacts with se iv generally to manganate vi by a one electron transfer which is the rate determining step however subsequent ph dependent reactions may then occur under acidic conditions manganate is unstable and a series of disproportionation and reduction reactions occur leading ultimately to mn ii as the final product under neutral and alkaline conditions mn iv is the final product of the mn vii reaction with se iv h 2 o 2 analogous to its role in sulfite oxidation lagrange et al 1996 h2o2 acts by an oxygen atom transfer reaction in the oxidation of se iv with a transfer of two electrons the reaction of h2o2 with se iv forms a peroxyselenous acid intermediate hooseo2h which dehydrates to se vi hughes and martin 1955 3 4 effects of br on the kinetics of se vi formation during chlorination and ozonation the oxidation kinetics of se iv by chlorine and o3 was investigated in the presence of br concentrations of 0 2 5 μm which are typical concentration in natural waters pan and zhang 2013 soltermann et al 2016 during chlorination 2 0 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 50 of the se iv was oxidized to se vi after about 12 7 4 and 1 5 min for br concentrations of 0 0 625 1 25 and 2 5 μm respectively thus the presence of br significantly enhanced se vi formation during chlorination fig 3 furthermore the kinetics of se vi formation increases slightly with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 for chlorination of se iv containing water 100 μg l 1 fig s3 this is due to a combination of a slower oxidation of bromide to hobr by chlorine and the higher rate of se iv oxidation by bromine with a maximum at around ph 9 0 in contrast to chlorination br has a negligible effect on se iv oxidation during ozonation because the second order rate constant for the reaction of o3 with br is lower than that for the reaction of o3 with se iv the evolution of se vi during chlorination and ozonation of br containing waters were further investigated by simulations using the kintecus software details in si model 1 fig 3 si model 2 fig s4 this model was able to predict the formation of se vi during chlorination in the absence and presence of br fig 3 and the increase in the rate of se vi formation in the presence of br which is caused by the formation of hobr through the reaction of hocl and br si model 1 eq e4a and e4b the subsequent oxidation of se iv to se vi by bromine apparent second order rate constant at ph 7 0 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than for chlorine with a reduction of hobr to br si model 1 eqs r4 r7 which acts as a catalyst in the formation of se vi during chlorination this acceleration of se iv oxidation during chlorination of bromide containing waters is similar to the chlorine induced oxidation of other in organic constituents such as n n dimethylsulfamide mn ii hoi or cr iii in presence of bromide von gunten et al 2010 criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2013 chebeir et al 2016 3 5 oxidation of se iv in a natural water chlorination and ozonation based on the kinetic studies above the efficiency of se iv oxidation in lake greifensee water si table s2 was explored for chlorination and ozonation fig 4 a and b shows the measured se iv losses and the se vi formation as a function of the hocl and o3 doses at 30 min reaction time respectively the yields of se vi in natural water were 100 for oxidant doses 1 5 mg l 1 si table s9 on a molar basis both oxidants exhibit similar oxidation efficiencies for se iv oxidation in the selected natural water 3 5 1 kinetics of the oxidation of se iv during chlorination of a natural water in presence of br to further test the efficiency of se iv oxidation a chlorination experiment was performed with a natural water sample spiked with se iv 100 μg l 1 0 78 μm and various br concentrations in the range of 50 μg l 1 0 625 μm to 200 μg l 1 2 5 μm the natural background bromide concentration is 15 μg l 1 si table s2 the formation of se vi is presented as a function of the oxidant exposure hox t hocl hobr in fig 5 the corresponding kinetics of the decrease in oxidant concentrations are shown in si fig s5 and are represented as the sum of hocl tot hobr tot with hox tot hox xo with x cl and br this representation takes into account the differences in oxidant stability due to the different molar hocl br ratios the overall oxidant stability is lower for higher br levels because of the higher reactivity of bromine with dissolved organic matter compared to chlorine as shown in fig 5 increasing the br concentrations in natural water significantly enhance the rate of se vi formation if it is normalized to the oxidant exposure 3 5 2 role of hydroxyl radical for the oxidation of se iv during ozonation in contrast to the determination of stoichiometries and reaction kinetics the ozonation experiments with natural waters were performed in absence of tert butanol during ozonation hydroxyl radical oh is generated as secondary oxidant by o3 decomposition reactions von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently the role of oh in the oxidation of se iv during ozonation has to be evaluated as well to estimate the contribution of oh the r ct which represents the ratio between the concentrations of oh and o3 at any time t during the reaction i e r ct oh o3 typical range of 10 9 r ct 10 8 during ozonation of natural waters can be used elovitz and von gunten 1999 se iv transformation during ozonation can be characterized by eq 8 and the contributions of o3 and oh to the oxidation of se iv were evaluated according to eqs 9 and 10 the second order rate constant for the reaction of oh with se iv as seo3 2 at high ph is quite high k oh hseo 3 2 9 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 and k oh seo 3 2 3 5 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 tamba and badiello 1977 the fraction of the se iv oxidized by oh calculated from eqs 9 and 10 von gunten 2003 shows that the contributions of oh to the observed se iv abatement were very low i e 0 5 5 of total observed loss for gf water wherefore se iv oxidation by oh can be neglected 8 ln se iv t

kinetics of the oxidation of se iv s iv and as iii table 2 summarizes the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of se iv s iv and as iii with various oxidants at ph 7 0 for the selected oxyanions i e se iv s iv as iii s iv has the highest reactivity with the selected oxidants followed by as iii and then se iv table 2 the data in table 2 show that the apparent second order rate constants decrease typically in the order bromine o3 chlorine mn vii nh2cl h2o2 with half life values ranging from microseconds to years fig 6 shows the half lives for se iv oxidation except for oh for a typical oxidant concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 o3 was the most efficient primary oxidant during the oxidation of se iv containing waters according to the kinetic data presented in table 2 hobr reacts fast with s iv as iii and se iv in the order s iv as iii se iv which leads to an enhanced transformation of the corresponding anions even though hobr is normally formed in low concentrations low levels of br in natural waters the contribution of the oxidation by hobr during typical treatment conditions can still be important 4 conclusions the kinetics and mechanisms for the oxidation of se iv with various oxidants were determined based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for the various oxidants studied i e chlorine bromine nh2cl o3 mn vii and h2o2 the apparent second order rate constants for the oxidation of se iv at ph 7 0 vary over about 8 orders of magnitude from 5 8 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 for hobr to 2 3 0 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 for h2o2 2 for typical water treatment process conditions the order of oxidant reactivity is o3 hocl mn vii nh2cl h2o2 3 the presence of br significantly enhanced the se iv oxidation efficiency during

followed by as iii and se iv 5 it can be expected that se iv is oxidized to se vi to a significant extent during drinking water chlorination or ozonation this leads to a significant reduction in the

18558,the production of biologically stable drinking water is challenging in conventional surface water treatment plants however attainment of biological stability is essential to avoid regrowth in disinfectant free distribution systems a novel application of ultrafiltration as a posttreatment step to enhance biological stability of drinking water produced in an existing conventional surface water treatment plant was investigated the conventional full scale plant comprised coagulation sedimentation filtration uv disinfection biological activated carbon filtration and chlorine dioxide post disinfection the produced water exhibited substantial regrowth of aeromonads invertebrates and colony counts in the distribution network recent literature attributes this phenomenon to the specific presence of slowly biodegradable high molecular weight mw biopolymeric organic compounds hence the aim of this study is to enhance the biological stability of conventionally treated surface water by reducing the concentration of high mw organic compounds for this purpose biological active carbon filtrate was subjected to ultrafiltration with membrane pore sizes of 10 kda 150 kda and 0 12 μm respectively operating in parallel the uf performance was evaluated in terms of the achieved reduction in particulate and high mw organic carbon phmoc the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography organic carbon detection biomass cells atp assimilable organic carbon aoc by the aoc p17 nox method for easily biodegradable low mw compounds and by the aoc a3 method for slowly biodegradable high mw compounds and overall microbial growth potential mgp as assessed by biomass production potential bpp and bacterial growth potential bgp bio assays results showed increasing removal of high mw organic carbon with decreasing uf pore size i e 30 60 and 70 removal was observed for the 0 12 μm 150 kda and 10 kda membranes respectively biomass and particulates retention was more than 95 for all uf membranes aoc a3 bpp and bgp were substantially reduced by 90 70 and 50 respectively these respective reductions were similar for all three uf membranes despite their difference in pore size easily biodegradable organic compounds as aoc p17 nox were not reduced by any of the membranes which was in accordance with expectations considering the low mw of the compounds involved based on the obtained results growth potential appears to be largely attributable to high mw organic compounds which are retained by a 0 12 μm uf membrane furthermore the quality of all three uf permeates was equal to or better than in reference cases literature data which exhibit little regrowth in their disinfectant free distribution networks the results demonstrate that ultrafiltration posttreatment in conventional surface water treatment plants is a potentially promising approach to enhance the biological stability of drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological stability of drinking water high

has gained increased interest in the last decades as levels of taste odor and hazardous disinfection by products are minimized rook 1974 clark 2001 of prime importance here is the establishment of biological stability i e levels of biological activity sufficiently low to prevent undesirable regrowth in the distribution network rittmann and snoeyink 1984 excessive regrowth may result in elevated numbers of heterotrophic plate count hpc coliforms and aeromonas as well as increased consumer complaints of taste brown water or invertebrates van lieverloo et al 2012 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 hijnen et al 2018 the first requirement to attain biological stability in disinfectant free conditions is the production of drinking water of low microbial growth potential mgp hereto low residual levels of nutrients must be ensured van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 several case studies on mgp and regrowth in the distribution network in disinfectant free supply of ground water and surface water have been published in the last decade e g hammes et al 2010 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 vital et al 2012 liu et al 2014 prest et al 2014 2016 van der wielen and lut 2016 organic carbon oc is generally regarded to be the main nutrient limiting bacterial growth in drinking water although in some cases phosphorus may be the growth limiting nutrient lechevallier et al 1991 miettinen et al 1997 lehtola et al 2002 since the 1980s mgp has often been related to easily assimilable organic carbon aoc compounds of low molecular weight mw as determined with the aoc p17 nox bio assay van der kooij et al 1982 1992 hem and efraimsen 2001 however the importance of specifically high mw oc substances as major contributor to mgp and regrowth of drinking water produced from surface water has gained prominence recently sack et al 2010 2011 van der kooij et al 2015 elhadidy et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 this high mw oc fraction comprises comparatively slowly biodegradable biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins and possibly other substances which may be seasonally present at considerable levels 0 5 mg l in eutrophic surface waters subject to algal blooms siembida lösch et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 several in vitro analytical methods to determine high mw oc and mgp have become available in the latter decades high mw oc is quantifiable physico chemically as the biopolymer fraction in lc ocd liquid chromatography organic carbon detection huber et al 2011 and as particular and high mw organic carbon phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 improved mgp bioassays to predict regrowth conditions which include these compounds have been introduced in recent years the aoc a3 bio assay signifies the presence of specifically slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds sack et al 2010 2011 methods to quantify the overall mgp i e on all present biodegradable oc fractions include amongst others the biomass production potential bpp van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 and bacterial growth potential bgp hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 sousi et al 2018 however the framework of guideline values for these mgp parameters to predict low regrowth conditions is not yet complete and is still in development 1 2 biological stability in conventional surface water treatment a challenge in the south west of the netherlands drinking water is produced by several surface water treatment plants the deployed treatment is of conventional lay out encompassing raw water storage coagulation separation filtration uv disinfection biologically activated carbon filtration bacf and momentary clo2 post disinfection as shown in fig 1 a survey of these plants and their distribution networks by hijnen et al 2018 found that some networks featured substantial regrowth elevated numbers of hpc invertebrates and aeromonas which coincided with elevated levels of high mw oc as phmoc in the water produced by the involved plants several other studies also point out that similar conventional surface water treatment trains fail to completely remove high mw oc van der kooij et al 2015 2017 park et al 2016 furthermore bacf is widely applied as final treatment step in conventional surface water trains but the filtrate contains appreciable amounts of released biomass bacteria biofilm and invertebrates and inorganic particulates residual coagulant carbon fines velten et al 2011 siembida lösch et al 2015 these compounds may cause regrowth directly in the water phase and may aggravate regrowth additionally by formation of biofilm and loose and settled deposits in the distribution network zacheus et al 2001 vreeburg et al 2008 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 liu et al 2014 hence the production of potable water low in mgp and suspended particulates from eutrophic surface water by solely conventional treatment processes is potentially challenging additional pre treatment by soil infiltration or posttreatment by slow sand filtration was shown to achieve low levels of high mw oc and mgp van der kooij et al 2017 but the required large spatial footprint restricts their application tight membrane filtration nanofiltration reverse osmosis extensively reduces biopolymer related mgp escobar et al 2000 meylan et al 2007 but their associated cost energy consumption need for remineralization and concentrate disposal issues are potential drawbacks of these technologies 1 3 the potential of ultrafiltration posttreatment in enhancing biological stability aforementioned issues highlight the need to identify a posttreatment process for conventional surface water treatment plants which is able to enhance the produced water s biological stability by reducing levels of high mw oc with limited environmental spatial and operational demands ultrafiltration uf is a prime candidate here as high mw oc biomass and particulates are retained by uf wang et al 2007 villacorte et al 2009 thayanukul et al 2013 jin et al 2014 wray and andrews 2014 park et al 2018 and therefore a concomitant reduction in mgp and regrowth is expected positioning the uf specifically as posttreatment to bacf has the additional benefits of fully eliminating carry over of biomass and particulates into the distribution network providing a chemical free post disinfection and enabling operation at high flux rates uf is already widely implemented in surface water treatment as post or intermediate disinfection treatment for drinking water production e g at roetgen germany clay lane uk mississauga canada lackarebäck sweden and männedorf switzerland however the deliberate targeting of mgp reduction without residual disinfectant constitutes a novel application of uf in surface water treatment consequently the study presented here aims to elucidate the enhancement of biological stability by uf posttreatment to bacf in a conventional surface water treatment plant with unfavorable mgp and regrowth characteristics the following objectives are addressed establishing the performance of uf in improving biological stability of bacf filtrate in terms of reduction in slowly biodegradable high mw oc easily assimilable low mw oc microbial growth potential biomass and particles comparing the uf permeate quality with reference values provided by literature for full scale surface water treatment plants with disinfectant free distribution which feature low levels of mgp and little regrowth in their distribution network determining the impact of uf pore size on uf permeate quality investigating the impact of operational aspects of uf filtration flux fouling long term effects on uf permeate quality for this purpose ultrafiltration membranes of various pore sizes 0 12 μm 150 kda and 10 kda were field tested at pilot scale feed to the uf was the bacf filtrate of a full scale conventional surface water treatment plant characterized by high levels of mgp high mw oc and regrowth the extensive monitoring program covered a two year period and deployed a broad suit of analytical methods 2 methods and materials 2 1 research outline test configuration and comparison with reference cases the study presented here features the operation sampling and monitoring of a uf pilot installation positioned as posttreatment to the bacf step of a full scale conventional surface water treatment plant of the evides water company in the south western netherlands the overall setup of the full scale plant and the uf pilot installation is shown graphically in fig 1 raw river water was taken in and subsequently stored in open reservoirs here seasonal algal blooms caused fluctuating biopolymer contents next the stored water was conveyed to the treatment plant after transport chlorination 0 5 mg l cl2 treatment encompassed consecutively microstraining 35 μm coagulation 6 mg l fe and in winter 1 mg l coagulant aid clariflocculation rapid dual media filtration uv disinfection bacf 20 minutes contact time and final low dose 0 08 mg l clo2 filtrate post disinfection aeration and ph correction the plants produced water exhibited elevated levels of high mw oc mgp and regrowth in the distribution network as elaborated by hijnen et al 2018 denoted as plant 1 in that paper the feed to the uf pilot installation was abstracted from the combined filtrate of nine full scale bacf filters uf feed bacf filtrate and uf permeates were sampled in tandem and compared for the relevant parameters to assess the efficacy of uf the experiments lasted for a two year period to cover seasonal variations in bacf filtrate quality and uf membrane fouling and operation the obtained uf permeate quality was compared with other cases of surface water treatment with disinfectant free distribution reported in literature the most important reference here involved a treated water characterized by simultaneous low levels of regrowth phmoc and mgp as described by hijnen et al 2018 as plant 2 this water s properties were assumed as the target to be attained by the uf permeates this quality is presented in table 1 and is henceforth denoted here as the reference quality 2 2 uf field piloting experimental setup sampling and monitoring of operational aspects the uf pilot setup comprised three parallel uf membrane modules to investigate the effect of uf membrane pore size the modules were provided by pentair with pore sizes defined as 90 retention of 10 kda hfs type 150 kda ufc type and 0 12 μm mf02 type respectively this selection was commercially available and covered the pore size range where retention of high mw oc was expected to happen in varying degrees the modules featured comparable membrane polymer chemistry 10 kda modified pes pes 150 kda and 0 12 μm pes pvp configuration hollow fiber inside out dead end filtration and dimensions 6 2 m2 4 diameter all modules were operated automatically and simultaneously with identical flux backwash and chemically enhanced backwash in the first year of operation year 1 running from april to the following march filtration and sampling were conducted at 80 l m2 h flux in the year 1 december and march sample rounds additional samples were collected at a momentarily increased after hydraulic backwash flux of 120 l m2 h in year 2 filtration and sampling were only at 120 l m2 h filtration cycle time was 40 80 min backwash at 160 240 l m2 h for 60 40 s with 10 kda uf permeate and chemically enhanced backwash was at ph 11 and 200 ppm cl2 followed by ph 2 for 30 min soaking time every 17 50 h based on seasonally varying membrane fouling these settings were maintained constant for several weeks months the adopted operational regime resembled common practice for full scale treated water ultrafiltration in posttreatment position bacf filtrate uf feed and permeates were always sampled at the same time all samples were collected approximately 24 36 h after the preceding chemically enhanced backwash in the middle of the actual filtration cycle after ample sample tap stainless steel flushing samples for aoc mgp and biomass analyses were processed within 4 24 h after collection and storage at 4 c in the interim using aoc free materials greenberg et al 1992 hammes and egli 2005 the obtained reductions of high mw oc aoc and mgp were evaluated on the impact of uf operational aspects filtration flux membrane fouling transmembrane pressure and the feed concentration of high mw oc membrane fouling resistance r f was monitored by correcting the absolute transmembrane pressure δp for the applied flux j temperature dependent water viscosity η t and virgin membrane resistance r m 0 by r f δp j η t r m 0 in addition accumulation and release of biomass on the membranes permeate side during filtration at system restart after idle periods and after chemically enhanced backwash was assessed by dedicated timed sampling on atp and cell counts 2 3 high mw oc and biomass analytical methods high mw oc was determined both as the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography oc detection lc ocd huber et al 2011 and as particulate and high mw oc phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 in short the latter encompassed concentration of 100 l water to 0 5 1 l using cross flow ultrafiltration hemoflow membrane hf80s fresenius medical care 30 kda cut off subsequently the water sample s phmoc content was calculated from the total organic carbon toc of the water sample and its 30 kda concentrate determined by shimadzu toc v by tocconcentrate tocwater sample concentration factor thus phmoc encompasses all colloidal and particulate biopolymeric and biomass matter atp adenosine tri phosphate was obtained spectrophotometrically as total atp by the luciferine luciferase reaction van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 intact and total cell counts were enumerated by flow cytometry according to the protocol and equipment bd accuri c6 described by prest et al 2013 2 4 assimilable organic carbon aoc and microbial growth potential mgp analytical methods aoc was investigated by two separate pure strain bio assays as follows presence of easily assimilable low mw oc was assessed by the aoc p17 nox method van der kooij et al 1982 high mw slowly biodegradable oc was determined as aoc a3 sack et al 2010 2011 in short both methods encompassed duplicate sample collection and processing 600 ml in 1 l glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks pasteurization inoculation with pure cultures p17 and nox strains and strain a3 respectively addition of 0 3 mg l po4 p and 0 8 mg l no3 n to avoid growth limitation incubation at 15 c and eventual conversion of the attained maximum colony counts by calibration curves into equivalent μg c l of acetate and a mix of polysaccharides and proteins respectively mgp was evaluated separately by the biomass production potential bpp and the bacterial growth potential bgp methods both deploying the ambient indigenous microbial consortium the bpp assay was executed according to the protocol provided by van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 in short this involved the monitoring of atp concentrations of directly incubated samples at 25 c in duplicate 600 ml erlenmeyers flasks after addition of po4 p and no3 n the bpp was subsequently expressed as bpc14 i e the cumulative atp content during the 14 day incubation period in ng atp d l and represented the initial plus produced microbial biomass from the assimilable high mw and low mw oc all uf permeates were inoculated with 1 ml bacf filtrate to re introduce the original microbial consortium in a few specific cases addition of phosphate p was omitted to study the occurrence of phosphate growth limitation the bgp was conducted according to the protocol described by prest et al 2016 and sousi et al 2018 this involved sample collection in 250 ml schott duran bottles pouring of 20 ml in triplicate vials 40 ml supelco followed by direct i e no pasteurization incubation at 30 c for 21 days the bgp was defined here as the maximum intact cell count by flow cytometry see section 2 3 encountered during incubation and hence represented the maximum amount of cellular biomass sustainable by the given water all uf permeates were inoculated with 0 5 ml bacf filtrate to re introduce the original microbial consortium 2 5 particulate and inorganic analytical methods presence of particulates was assessed by particle counting 1 0 μm pamas waterviewer in addition cartridge filters 20 μm cut off meltblown polyproyene 255 mm 60 mm diameter holland filter were placed in the 150 kda permeate and a bacf filtrate side stream the cartridges were visually inspected on external surface discoloration every 4 weeks after passage of 450 m3 water inorganic characterizations encompassed iron icp ms and ortho phosphate spectrophotometrically unicam uv530 thermo spectronic 2 6 verification of uf piloting reliability the experimental results were considered to be vulnerable to membrane breach contamination and system artifacts therefore the reliability of the uf pilot installation was thoroughly verified throughout the experimental period as described in detail in the supplementary information section s1 in short membrane integrity was ascertained by means of air pressure hold tests and monitoring of permeate particle and cell counts absence of contamination was verified by immediate analysis of residuals of chemically enhanced backwash agents absence of other artifacts was evaluated by monitoring aoc p17 nox as well as by comparing mgp levels of uf feed uf permeates and uf backwash water akin to a mass balance approach all results confirmed the integrity of the uf system and absence of contamination or other artifacts 2 7 statistical data handling all statistical analyses were performed by spreadsheet ms excel 2013 the uf permeates were statistically evaluated on mutual similarity for each water quality parameter as follows firstly each data set was assessed on normality by shapiro wilk p 0 05 subsequently permeates were mutually compared for each quality parameter by the students t test 2 sided for normal distributed data and by kruskal wallis 2 degrees of freedom otherwise furthermore correlations between quality parameters and operational parameters section 2 2 were evaluated by least square regression analysis with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacf filtrate uf feed properties the water quality data of bacf filtrate and uf permeates encountered during the experimental period are presented in table 1 and fig 2 a f total doc of the bacf filtrate amounted to 2 0 mg l table 1 this comprised mainly humics building blocks and low mw compounds whereas biopolymers amounted to only 5 supplementary information table s1 biopolymer and phmoc concentrations ranged between 70 μg l and 170 μg l fig 2a and b aoc a3 ranged from 5 to 15 μg c l fig 2c aoc p17 nox fig 2d fluctuated between 7 and 12 μg l which was close to the 10 μg l level considered in literature as the recommended upper boundary for low mw aoc to limit regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij 1992 the bpc14 fig 2e varied between 100 and 225 ng d l the underlying bpp incubation curves typically showed an immediate rapid decline in atp followed by a continuous rise which persisted after the first week of incubation without exhibiting a clearly distinct atp peak in that first week before eventual stabilization at maximum values of 17 5 ng l supplementary information figure s1 this observed pattern indicated a relatively high proportion of slowly biodegradable compounds in the total assimilable oc matrix van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 maximum bgp cell counts amounted to 300 600 103 ml fig 2f and maxima were always reached after the first week of incubation supplementary information figure s2 bacf filtrate biomass concentrations as atp and cell counts ranged between 5 and 25 ng l and 200 800 103 ml respectively ortho phosphate levels were always close to or below the detection limit of 1 0 μg l p however phosphate limitation usually occurs at lower levels miettinen et al 1997 bpc14 values of bpp assays where the p addition had deliberately been omitted were slightly lower 11 8 n 7 than those of the regular assay i e including p addition between may and october and identical outside this period fig 2e hence phosphate limitation was considered to be absent or marginal importantly levels of high mw oc aoc and mgp encountered in the bacf filtrate clearly exceeded those of the low regrowth reference water quality as shown in table 1 furthermore the bacf filtrate high mw oc aoc and mgp levels were in the same range and temporal pattern as reported by hijnen et al 2018 and van der kooij et al 2015 for bacf filtrates of plants treating eutrophic surface water and exhibiting regrowth in their distribution networks 3 2 uf performance biopolymer and phmoc uf reduced biopolymer and phmoc by 30 for 0 12 μm 60 for 150 kda and 70 for 10 kda fig 2a and b table 1 and fig 3 moreover biopolymer and phmoc concentrations in the 10 kda and 150 kda permeate though not the 0 12 μm permeate were below those of the low regrowth reference water section 2 1 as shown in table 1 biopolymer and phmoc contents were statistically different for the three permeates supplementary information tables s2 and s3 and hence their retention depended on membrane pore size other oc fractions i e humics building blocks and low mw compounds fully passed the uf membranes independent of their pore size supplementary information table s1 these observed retentions were in line with the range provided in literature wray and andrews 2014 siembida lösch et al 2015 villacorte et al 2009 tabatabai 2014 retention of biopolymer and phmoc tended to decline slightly at low biopolymer pmhoc concentrations in the bacf filtrate 70 μg l e g july of year 1 and year 2 in fig 2a and b a finding also reported by siembida lösch et al 2015 it is hypothesized that the retained biopolymers act as dynamically formed additional filtration layer van den brink 2014 hence low feed biopolymer content and short chemically enhanced backwash intervals may result in lower rejections theoretically the complete absence of biopolymers might be expected in the 10 kda permeate because biopolymers are quantified in the lc ocd analysis as the fraction 20 kda huber et al 2011 whereas the integrity of the used membranes was already verified section 2 6 nevertheless the 10 kda permeate consistently contained low quantities of both phmoc and biopolymers one or more of the following hypotheses may explain this observation the flexibility of biopolymers which enables passage through pores smaller than their nominal dimensions passow 2000 a small percentage of the membrane pores possibly being larger than 20 kda at the membranes nominal 90 cut off tabatabai 2014 the presence of some permeate side regrowth see section 3 4 and or differences in the applied methods used to determine uf membrane pore sizes and biopolymer fractions 3 3 uf performance aoc and mgp as shown in fig 2c e and f and table 1 all three uf permeates were always substantially lower in aoc a3 bpc14 and bgp than the bacf filtrate achieved reductions amounted to 90 for aoc a3 70 for bpc14 and 50 for bgp fig 3 in contrast to the other parameters aoc p17 nox was not reduced by any of the tested membranes the complete passage of aoc p17 nox indicated that the involved substances were too low in mw to be rejected by uf hem and efraimsen 2001 zhou et al 2009 remarkably at any given point in time all three permeates featured similar levels of bpc14 bgp aoc a3 and aoc p17 nox respectively statistical evaluation supplementary information tables s2 and s3 confirmed that all permeates were indistinguishable in terms of these parameters hence the three permeates consistently resembled each other and thus all three uf membranes achieved similar reductions in each parameter except for biopolymers en phmoc importantly the uf permeates aoc and mgp levels were well below or equal to those of the low regrowth reference water section 2 1 as shown in table 1 permeate bpc14 was also close to the 40 ng d l level reported for surface water which was intensively treated by soil infiltration and slow sand filtration and exhibited no excessive regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij et al 2017 permeate bgp 240 60 103 ml was below that of treated lake water after slow sand filtration 250 500 103 ml hammes et al 2010 and only twice as high as spring water evian 80 220 103 ml prest et al 2016 sousi et al 2018 these results indicate that ultrafiltration as posttreatment for bacf is capable of significantly improving the water quality with respect to mgp 3 4 uf performance biomass and particulates uf permeate particle and cell counts were low in all samples yielding 95 99 removal respectively table 1 and fig 3 this further illustrated the integrity of the uf system in addition to other measures described in section 2 6 the observed reduction of cellular biomass was in the range reported by wang et al 2007 but was less than the complete removal reported by chan at al 2019 and what was theoretically expected based on the difference in size between cells μm order vis à vis pores nm order therefore plausibly a minor degree of permeate side microbial regrowth could have occurred to which the permeates residual aoc p17 nox and low but measurable residual mgp levels lend further support nevertheless permeate biomass levels remained well below those of the low regrowth reference water table 1 the cartridge filter in the 150 kda permeate discharge remained totally free of any visible discoloration even after prolonged exposure in contrast the cartridge filter in the bacf filtrate side stream clearly exhibited rapid grey blackish discoloration the observations on particle counts cell counts and cartridge filter appearances indicated the capacity of uf to retain particulate matter present in bacf filtrate hence uf posttreatment will minimize their load to the distribution network and thus contribute to reduce associated consumer complaints network flushing incidence and any regrowth conditions ensuing from interaction between sediment and organic matter as inferred from vreeburg et al 2008 groundwater uf posttreatment reduced sediments and associated oc van lieverloo et al 2012 invertebrate abundance correlates with sediment and organic matter and liu et al 2014 biomass is a major component of loose deposits a concomitant reduction in particulate iron by uf is probable but could not be determined here as the iron concentrations were below the detection limit 10 μg l of the applied analytical method determination with a more sensitive method detection limit 1 μg l is warranted since iron accumulation in the distribution network may stimulate regrowth by e g sediment formation and preferential adsorption of oc on iron sutherland 2001 camper 2004 parikh and chorover 2006 3 5 correlations between high mw oc aoc and mgp parameters concentrations and trends of the lc ocd biopolymer fraction and phmoc coincided well for bacf and uf permeates and the paired data were linearly correlated r2 0 91 as shown by fig 4 this correlation suggests that both analytical methods covered similar high mw oc compounds in the water samples tested here bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated for bacf filtrate p 0 01 r2 0 76 fig 5 whereas no correlation was observable for the uf permeates because their low bpc14 and aoc a3 levels approached the lower bounds of the methods sensitivity in contrast aoc p17 nox of bacf filtrate or uf permeates did not correlate with any other parameter both observations were qualitatively in line with findings by hijnen et al 2018 for various bacf filtrates and supported the relevance of slowly biodegradable high mw oc for mgp in the bacf filtrate tested here the importance of high mw oc as contributor to mgp is also in agreement with other recent studies on surface water van der kooij et al 2015 2017 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 2018 the clear difference between bacf filtrate and uf permeates in terms of high mw oc bpc14 bgp and aoc a3 as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 is illustrated by supplementary information figures s3a c regression analysis of the full data set comprising bacf filtrate and uf permeates confirmed the presence of a positive correlation between high mw oc and the other parameters p 0 004 for only the bacf filtrate data subset such correlations did not emerge p 0 34 however hijnen et al 2018 found a good correlation between phmoc and bpc14 for a large data set encompassing raw surface waters pre treated waters and bacf filtrates ranging up to 1000 μg l phmoc this apparent discrepancy is possibly explained by the comparatively low concentrations of high mw oc and bpc14 as applicable for the bacf filtrate used here as uf feed in combination with seasonal variations in the ambient microbial consortium and or biodegradability and chemistry of the high mw oc fraction such seasonal variations are plausible seen the changing temperatures and the biological origin of the high mw oc hijnen et al 2018 applicable for surface water treatment this variability may affect the resultant mgp see section 2 4 and thus potentially impair the emergence of a clear correlation between high mw oc and mgp in bacf filtrate hence the occurrence of seasonal variability of the microbial consortium and the high mw oc chemistry and biodegradability in bacf filtrate warrants further study 3 6 impact of uf pore size on mgp reduction as elaborated in section 3 3 the high reduction in aoc a3 bpc14 and bgp was similar for all uf pore sizes hence it is inferred that mgp of the tested bacf filtrate was predominantly associated with matter of relatively large size i e retainable by a 0 12 μm pore size membrane rather than the overall bulk of the high mw oc candidate constituents in the 0 12 μm size fraction encompass bacterial cells protozoa invertebrates biopolymers and undefined larger bio organic particles e g sloughed off biofilm in colloidal aggregated or associated state a further distinction between their respective contribution to and importance for overall mgp cannot yet be made with the available data and was not the subject of the present study it is thus of future interest to determine the respective reductions in mgp biomass and high mw oc accomplished by further separation of the 0 12 μm fraction by e g filtration with pores 0 12 μm centrifugation etc as well as chemical characterization of the obtained subfractions this will also provide a first indication of the potential of alternative posttreatment processes with pore sizes 0 12 μm e g microfiltration rapid sand filtration to reduce mgp furthermore the aoc and mgp methods level of detection in the low concentrations range of high mw oc applicable for the uf permeates is to be evaluated to assess the observed similarity in the permeates quality in more detail the high mgp reduction established by uf and other observations elaborated in sections 3 1 and 3 5 indicated that the overall mgp of the bacf filtrate tested here was dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds rather than the easily assimilable low mw oc fraction this highlights the importance of the total oc matrix of the specific water envisaged for uf posttreatment uf is likely less effective in reducing mgp for waters rich in low mw oc and deficient in high mw oc as the former compounds are not retained this is amongst methodological differences a possible explanation for the low to moderate improvement in biological stability observed by liu et al 2013 for uf posttreatment in groundwater where low phmoc levels prevail 20 μg l hijnen et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2017 as shown in this work the deployed in vitro biostability methods enabled useful comparison of the results obtained for uf posttreatment with other reference cases this approach is to be regarded as the first step in assessing the eventual potential of uf to reduce regrowth in the distribution network however the in vitro methods cannot provide the sole and ultimate prediction of the occurrence of regrowth in the distribution network as the microbial ecology of the distribution network is complex and still largely unknown and is influenced by numerous long and short term biotic and abiotic variables such as sediments biofilm invertebrates residence time flow patterns etc liu et al 2014 therefore the eventual impact of uf posttreatment on regrowth should be confirmed further by trials in true distribution network conditions 3 7 uf performance operational aspects the uf system operated continuously during the experimental period retentions remained unchanged 10 differential for all parameters when measured at both 80 and 120 l m2 h fluxes the average reduction in aoc and mgp was also similar for the periods of continuous filtration at respectively 80 l m2 h and 120 l m2 h table 2 presents the range of encountered transmembrane pressures δp and fouling layer resistance r f reductions of high mw oc aoc and mgp were independent of membrane resistance and pressure differential as well as influent concentration as typically illustrated for bpc14 in supplementary information figure s4 permeate cell counts and atp levels remained low after backwash or at restart of the uf system after prolonged idle periods only chemically enhanced backwash caused a short term lasting up to 4 h and limited 3 ng l increase in atp which could be attributed to release of free atp however the impact on mgp was considered to be negligible since the involved p and c quantities were small compared to the p and aoc concentrations of the matrix nescerecka et al 2016 hence operational settings were found not to compromise uf performance in mgp reduction in the tested range 4 conclusions ultrafiltration uf by membranes of 10 kda 150 kda and 0 12 μm pore size as a posttreatment step after conventional surface water treatment coagulation clariflocculation uv disinfection biologically activated carbon filtration reduced high mw molecular weight organic carbon and microbial growth potential mgp of the produced potable water tested as follows retention of biopolymers lc ocd and phmoc particulate and high mw organic carbon depended on the pore size of the membrane and was 30 0 12 μm 60 150 kda and 70 10 kda respectively biomass and particulates were retained almost completely 95 by all uf membranes microbial growth potential was reduced by 50 as bacterial growth potential bgp and by 70 as biomass production potential bpc14 respectively by all uf membranes slowly biodegradable organic carbon aoc a3 was reduced by 90 whereas easily assimilable carbon aoc p17 nox was not reduced and remained at moderate to low levels the reductions in microbial growth potential and aoc a3 were similar for all three uf membranes i e irrespective of membrane pore size this suggests that the organic matter fraction mainly responsible for mgp can be retained by 0 12 μm membrane filtration the achieved low levels of high mw organic carbon aoc a3 and microbial growth potential measured as bpc14 in the uf permeates were close to or below their respective levels in a reference water known to exhibit little regrowth in its distribution network the overall results showed the importance of the high mw organic carbon fraction for mgp in the water type tested here filtration flux membrane fouling and uf system down time did not adversely affect the achieved reductions hence the results demonstrate that ultrafiltration posttreatment in conventional surface water treatment plants is a potentially promising approach to enhance the biological stability of drinking water future study is to provide further elucidation on the characteristics of high mw oc and mgp in terms of distribution over sizes 0 12 μm biodegradability chemical composition and the methods level of detection

18558,the production of biologically stable drinking water is challenging in conventional surface water treatment plants however attainment of biological stability is essential to avoid regrowth in disinfectant free distribution systems a novel application of ultrafiltration as a posttreatment step to enhance biological stability of drinking water produced in an existing conventional surface water treatment plant was investigated the conventional full scale plant comprised coagulation sedimentation filtration uv disinfection biological activated carbon filtration and chlorine dioxide post disinfection the produced water exhibited substantial regrowth of aeromonads invertebrates and colony counts in the distribution network recent literature attributes this phenomenon to the specific presence of slowly biodegradable high molecular weight mw biopolymeric organic compounds hence the aim of this study is to enhance the biological stability of conventionally treated surface water by reducing the concentration of high mw organic compounds for this purpose biological active carbon filtrate was subjected to ultrafiltration with membrane pore sizes of 10 kda 150 kda and 0 12 μm respectively operating in parallel the uf performance was evaluated in terms of the achieved reduction in particulate and high mw organic carbon phmoc the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography organic carbon detection biomass cells atp assimilable organic carbon aoc by the aoc p17 nox method for easily biodegradable low mw compounds and by the aoc a3 method for slowly biodegradable high mw compounds and overall microbial growth potential mgp as assessed by biomass production potential bpp and bacterial growth potential bgp bio assays results showed increasing removal of high mw organic carbon with decreasing uf pore size i e 30 60 and 70 removal was observed for the 0 12 μm 150 kda and 10 kda membranes respectively biomass and particulates retention was more than 95 for all uf membranes aoc a3 bpp and bgp were substantially reduced by 90 70 and 50 respectively these respective reductions were similar for all three uf membranes despite their difference in pore size easily biodegradable organic compounds as aoc p17 nox were not reduced by any of the membranes which was in accordance with expectations considering the low mw of the compounds involved based on the obtained results growth potential appears to be largely attributable to high mw organic compounds which are retained by a 0 12 μm uf membrane furthermore the quality of all three uf permeates was equal to or better than in reference cases literature data which exhibit little regrowth in their disinfectant free distribution networks the results demonstrate that ultrafiltration posttreatment in conventional

has gained increased interest in the last decades as levels of taste odor and hazardous disinfection by products are minimized rook 1974 clark 2001 of prime importance here is the establishment of biological stability i e levels of biological activity sufficiently low to prevent undesirable regrowth in the distribution network rittmann and snoeyink 1984 excessive regrowth may result in elevated numbers of heterotrophic plate count hpc coliforms and aeromonas as well as increased consumer complaints of taste brown water or invertebrates van lieverloo et al 2012 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 hijnen et al 2018 the first requirement to attain biological stability in disinfectant free conditions is the production of drinking water of low microbial growth potential mgp hereto low residual levels of nutrients must be ensured van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 several case studies on mgp and regrowth in the distribution network in disinfectant free supply of ground water and surface water have been published in the last decade e g hammes et al 2010 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 vital et al 2012 liu et al 2014 prest et al 2014 2016 van der wielen and lut 2016 organic carbon oc is generally regarded to be the main nutrient limiting bacterial growth in drinking water although in some cases phosphorus may be the growth limiting nutrient lechevallier et al 1991 miettinen et al 1997 lehtola et al 2002 since the 1980s mgp has often been related to easily assimilable organic carbon aoc compounds of low molecular weight mw as determined with the aoc p17 nox bio assay van der kooij et al 1982 1992 hem and efraimsen 2001 however the importance of specifically high mw oc substances as major contributor to mgp and regrowth of drinking water produced from surface water has gained prominence recently sack et al 2010 2011 van der kooij et al 2015 elhadidy et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 this high mw oc fraction comprises comparatively slowly biodegradable biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins and possibly other substances which may be seasonally present at considerable levels 0 5 mg l in eutrophic surface waters subject to algal blooms siembida lösch et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 several in vitro analytical methods to determine high mw oc and mgp have become available in the latter decades high mw oc is quantifiable physico chemically as the biopolymer fraction in lc ocd liquid chromatography organic carbon detection huber et al 2011 and as particular and high mw organic carbon phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 improved mgp bioassays to predict regrowth conditions which include these compounds have been introduced in recent years the aoc a3 bio assay signifies the presence of specifically slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds sack et al 2010 2011 methods to quantify the overall mgp i e on all present biodegradable oc fractions include amongst others the biomass production potential bpp van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 and bacterial growth potential bgp hammes and egli 2005 prest et al 2016 sousi et al 2018 however the framework of guideline values for these mgp parameters to predict low regrowth conditions is not yet complete and is still in development 1 2 biological stability in conventional surface water treatment a challenge in the south west of the netherlands drinking water is produced by several surface water treatment plants the deployed treatment is of conventional lay out encompassing raw water storage coagulation separation filtration uv disinfection biologically activated carbon filtration bacf and momentary clo2 post disinfection as shown in fig 1 a survey of these plants and their distribution networks by hijnen et al 2018 found that some networks featured substantial regrowth elevated numbers of hpc invertebrates and aeromonas which coincided with elevated levels of high mw oc as phmoc in the water produced by the involved plants several other studies also point out that similar conventional surface water treatment trains fail to completely remove high mw oc van der kooij et al 2015 2017 park et al 2016 furthermore bacf is widely applied as final treatment step in conventional surface water trains but the filtrate contains appreciable amounts of released biomass bacteria biofilm and invertebrates and inorganic particulates residual coagulant carbon fines velten et al 2011 siembida lösch et al 2015 these compounds may cause regrowth directly in the water phase and may aggravate regrowth additionally by formation of biofilm and loose and settled deposits in the distribution network zacheus et al 2001 vreeburg et al 2008 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 liu et al 2014 hence the production of potable water low in mgp and suspended particulates from eutrophic surface water by solely conventional treatment processes is potentially challenging additional pre treatment by soil infiltration or posttreatment by slow sand filtration was shown to achieve low levels of high mw oc and mgp van der kooij et al 2017 but the required large spatial footprint restricts their application tight membrane filtration nanofiltration reverse osmosis extensively reduces biopolymer related mgp escobar et al 2000 meylan et al 2007 but their associated cost energy consumption need for remineralization and concentrate disposal issues are potential drawbacks of these technologies 1 3 the potential of ultrafiltration posttreatment in enhancing biological stability aforementioned issues highlight the need to identify a posttreatment process for conventional surface water treatment plants which is able to enhance the produced water s biological stability by reducing levels of high mw oc with limited environmental spatial and operational demands ultrafiltration uf is a prime candidate here as high mw oc biomass and particulates are retained by uf wang et al 2007 villacorte et al 2009 thayanukul et al 2013 jin et al 2014 wray and andrews 2014 park et al 2018 and therefore a concomitant reduction in mgp and regrowth is expected positioning the uf specifically as posttreatment to bacf has the additional benefits of fully eliminating carry over of biomass and particulates into the distribution network providing a chemical free post disinfection and enabling operation at high flux rates uf is already widely implemented in surface water treatment as post or intermediate disinfection treatment for drinking water production e g at roetgen germany clay lane uk mississauga canada lackarebäck sweden and männedorf switzerland however the deliberate targeting of mgp reduction without residual disinfectant constitutes a novel application of uf in surface water treatment consequently the study presented here aims to elucidate the enhancement of biological stability by uf posttreatment to bacf in a conventional surface water treatment plant with unfavorable mgp and regrowth characteristics the following objectives are addressed establishing the performance of uf in improving biological stability of bacf filtrate in terms of reduction in slowly biodegradable high mw oc easily assimilable low mw oc microbial growth potential biomass and particles comparing the uf permeate quality with reference values provided by literature for full scale surface water treatment plants with disinfectant free distribution which feature low levels of mgp and little regrowth in their distribution network determining the impact of uf pore size on uf permeate quality investigating the impact of operational aspects of uf filtration flux fouling long term effects on uf permeate quality for this purpose ultrafiltration membranes of various pore sizes 0 12 μm 150 kda and 10 kda were field tested at pilot scale feed to the uf was the bacf filtrate of a full scale conventional surface water treatment plant characterized by high levels of mgp high mw oc and regrowth the extensive monitoring program covered a two year period and deployed a broad suit of analytical methods 2 methods and materials 2 1 research outline test configuration and comparison with reference cases the study presented here features the operation sampling and monitoring of a uf pilot installation positioned as posttreatment to the bacf step of a full scale conventional surface water treatment plant of the evides water company in the south western netherlands the overall setup of the full scale plant and the uf pilot installation is shown graphically in fig 1 raw river water was taken in and subsequently stored in open reservoirs here seasonal algal blooms caused fluctuating biopolymer contents next the stored water was conveyed to the treatment plant after transport chlorination 0 5 mg l cl2 treatment encompassed consecutively microstraining 35 μm coagulation 6 mg l fe and in winter 1 mg l coagulant aid clariflocculation rapid dual media filtration uv disinfection bacf 20 minutes contact time and final low dose 0 08 mg l clo2 filtrate post disinfection aeration and ph correction the plants produced water exhibited elevated levels of high mw oc mgp and regrowth in the distribution network as elaborated by hijnen et al 2018 denoted as plant 1 in that paper the feed to the uf pilot installation was abstracted from the combined filtrate of nine full scale bacf filters uf feed bacf filtrate and uf permeates were sampled in tandem and compared for the relevant parameters to assess the efficacy of uf the experiments lasted for a two year period to cover seasonal variations in bacf filtrate quality and uf membrane fouling and operation the obtained uf permeate quality was compared with other cases of surface water treatment with disinfectant free distribution reported in literature the most important reference here involved a treated water characterized by simultaneous low levels of regrowth phmoc and mgp as described by hijnen et al 2018 as plant 2 this water s properties were assumed as the target to be attained by the uf permeates this quality is presented in table 1 and is henceforth denoted here as the reference quality 2 2 uf field piloting experimental setup sampling and monitoring of operational aspects the uf pilot setup comprised three parallel uf membrane modules to investigate the effect of uf membrane pore size the modules were provided by pentair with pore sizes defined as 90 retention of 10 kda hfs type 150 kda ufc type and 0 12 μm mf02 type respectively this selection was commercially available and covered the pore size range where retention of high mw oc was expected to happen in varying degrees the modules featured comparable membrane polymer chemistry 10 kda modified pes pes 150 kda and 0 12 μm pes pvp configuration hollow fiber inside out dead end filtration and dimensions 6 2 m2 4 diameter all modules were operated automatically and simultaneously with identical flux backwash and chemically enhanced backwash in the first year of operation year 1 running from april to the following march filtration and sampling were conducted at 80 l m2 h flux in the year 1 december and march sample rounds additional samples were collected at a momentarily increased after hydraulic backwash flux of 120 l m2 h in year 2 filtration and sampling were only at 120 l m2 h filtration cycle time was 40 80 min backwash at 160 240 l m2 h for 60 40 s with 10 kda uf permeate and chemically enhanced backwash was at ph 11 and 200 ppm cl2 followed by ph 2 for 30 min soaking time every 17 50 h based on seasonally varying membrane fouling these settings were maintained constant for several weeks months the adopted operational regime resembled common practice for full scale treated water ultrafiltration in posttreatment position bacf filtrate uf feed and permeates were always sampled at the same time all samples were collected approximately 24 36 h after the preceding chemically enhanced backwash in the middle of the actual filtration cycle after ample sample tap stainless steel flushing samples for aoc mgp and biomass analyses were processed within 4 24 h after collection and storage at 4 c in the interim using aoc free materials greenberg et al 1992 hammes and egli 2005 the obtained reductions of high mw oc aoc and mgp were evaluated on the impact of uf operational aspects filtration flux membrane fouling transmembrane pressure and the feed concentration of high mw oc membrane fouling resistance r f was monitored by correcting the absolute transmembrane pressure δp for the applied flux j temperature dependent water viscosity η t and virgin membrane resistance r m 0 by r f δp j η t r m 0 in addition accumulation and release of biomass on the membranes permeate side during filtration at system restart after idle periods and after chemically enhanced backwash was assessed by dedicated timed sampling on atp and cell counts 2 3 high mw oc and biomass analytical methods high mw oc was determined both as the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography oc detection lc ocd huber et al 2011 and as particulate and high mw oc phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 in short the latter encompassed concentration of 100 l water to 0 5 1 l using cross flow ultrafiltration hemoflow membrane hf80s fresenius medical care 30 kda cut off subsequently the water sample s phmoc content was calculated from the total organic carbon toc of the water sample and its 30 kda concentrate determined by shimadzu toc v by tocconcentrate tocwater sample concentration factor thus phmoc encompasses all colloidal and particulate biopolymeric and biomass matter atp adenosine tri phosphate was obtained spectrophotometrically as total atp by the luciferine luciferase reaction van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 intact and total cell counts were enumerated by flow cytometry according to the protocol and equipment bd accuri c6 described by prest et al 2013 2 4 assimilable organic carbon aoc and microbial growth potential mgp analytical methods aoc was investigated by two separate pure strain bio assays as follows presence of easily assimilable low mw oc was assessed by the aoc p17 nox method van der kooij et al 1982 high mw slowly biodegradable oc was determined as aoc a3 sack et al 2010 2011 in short both methods encompassed duplicate sample collection and processing 600 ml in 1 l glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks pasteurization inoculation with pure cultures p17 and nox strains and strain a3 respectively addition of 0 3 mg l po4 p and 0 8 mg l no3 n to avoid growth limitation incubation at 15 c and eventual conversion of the attained maximum colony counts by calibration curves into equivalent μg c l of acetate and a mix of polysaccharides and proteins respectively mgp was evaluated separately by the biomass production potential bpp and the bacterial growth potential bgp methods both deploying the ambient indigenous microbial consortium the bpp assay was executed according to the protocol provided by van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 in short this involved the monitoring of atp concentrations of directly incubated samples at 25 c in duplicate 600 ml erlenmeyers flasks after addition of po4 p and no3 n the bpp was subsequently expressed as bpc14 i e the cumulative atp content during the 14 day incubation period in ng atp d l and represented the initial plus produced microbial biomass from the assimilable high mw and low mw oc all uf permeates were inoculated with 1 ml bacf filtrate to re introduce the original microbial consortium in a few specific cases addition of phosphate p was omitted to study the occurrence of phosphate growth limitation the bgp was conducted according to the protocol described by prest et al 2016 and sousi et al 2018 this involved sample collection in 250 ml schott duran bottles pouring of 20 ml in triplicate vials 40 ml supelco followed by direct i e no pasteurization incubation at 30 c for 21 days the bgp was defined here as the maximum intact cell count by flow cytometry see section 2 3 encountered during incubation and hence represented the maximum amount of cellular biomass sustainable by the given water all uf permeates were inoculated with 0 5 ml bacf filtrate to re introduce the original microbial consortium 2 5 particulate and inorganic analytical methods presence of particulates was assessed by particle counting 1 0 μm pamas waterviewer in addition cartridge filters 20 μm cut off meltblown polyproyene 255 mm 60 mm diameter holland filter were placed in the 150 kda permeate and a bacf filtrate side stream the cartridges were visually inspected on external surface discoloration every 4 weeks after passage of 450 m3 water inorganic characterizations encompassed iron icp ms and ortho phosphate spectrophotometrically unicam uv530 thermo spectronic 2 6 verification of uf piloting reliability the experimental results were considered to be vulnerable to membrane breach contamination and system artifacts therefore the reliability of the uf pilot installation was thoroughly verified throughout the experimental period as described in detail in the supplementary information section s1 in short membrane integrity was ascertained by means of air pressure hold tests and monitoring of permeate particle and cell counts absence of contamination was verified by immediate analysis of residuals of chemically enhanced backwash agents absence of other artifacts was evaluated by monitoring aoc p17 nox as well as by comparing mgp levels of uf feed uf permeates and uf backwash water akin to a mass balance approach all results confirmed the integrity of the uf system and absence of contamination or other artifacts 2 7 statistical data handling all statistical analyses were performed by spreadsheet ms excel 2013 the uf permeates were statistically evaluated on mutual similarity for each water quality parameter as follows firstly each data set was assessed on normality by shapiro wilk p 0 05 subsequently permeates were mutually compared for each quality parameter by the students t test 2 sided for normal distributed data and by kruskal wallis 2 degrees of freedom otherwise furthermore correlations between quality parameters and operational parameters section 2 2 were evaluated by least square regression analysis with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacf filtrate uf feed properties the water quality data of bacf filtrate and uf permeates encountered during the experimental period are presented in table 1 and fig 2 a f total doc of the bacf filtrate amounted to 2 0 mg l table 1 this comprised mainly humics building blocks and low mw compounds whereas biopolymers amounted to only 5 supplementary information table s1 biopolymer and phmoc concentrations ranged between 70 μg l and 170 μg l fig 2a and b aoc a3 ranged from 5 to 15 μg c l fig 2c aoc p17 nox fig 2d fluctuated between 7 and 12 μg l which was close to the 10 μg l level considered in literature as the recommended upper boundary for low mw aoc to limit regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij 1992 the bpc14 fig 2e varied between 100 and 225 ng d l the underlying bpp incubation curves typically showed an immediate rapid decline in atp followed by a continuous rise which persisted after the first week of incubation without exhibiting a clearly distinct atp peak in that first week before eventual stabilization at maximum values of 17 5 ng l supplementary information figure s1 this observed pattern indicated a relatively high proportion of slowly biodegradable compounds in the total assimilable oc matrix van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 maximum bgp cell counts amounted to 300 600 103 ml fig 2f and maxima were always reached after the first week of incubation supplementary information figure s2 bacf filtrate biomass concentrations as atp and cell counts ranged between 5 and 25 ng l and 200 800 103 ml respectively ortho phosphate levels were always close to or below the detection limit of 1 0 μg l p however phosphate limitation usually occurs at lower levels miettinen et al 1997 bpc14 values of bpp assays where the p addition had deliberately been omitted were slightly lower 11 8 n 7 than those of the regular assay i e including p addition between may and october and identical outside this period fig 2e hence phosphate limitation was considered to be absent or marginal importantly levels of high mw oc aoc and mgp encountered in the bacf filtrate clearly exceeded those of the low regrowth reference water quality as shown in table 1 furthermore the bacf filtrate high mw oc aoc and mgp levels were in the same range and temporal pattern as reported by hijnen et al 2018 and van der kooij et al 2015 for bacf filtrates of plants treating eutrophic surface water and exhibiting regrowth in their distribution networks 3 2 uf performance biopolymer and phmoc uf reduced biopolymer and phmoc by 30 for 0 12 μm 60 for 150 kda and 70 for 10 kda fig 2a and b table 1 and fig 3 moreover biopolymer and phmoc concentrations in the 10 kda and 150 kda permeate though not the 0 12 μm permeate were below those of the low regrowth reference water section 2 1 as shown in table 1 biopolymer and phmoc contents were statistically different for the three permeates supplementary information tables s2 and s3 and hence their retention depended on membrane pore size other oc fractions i e humics building blocks and low mw compounds fully passed the uf membranes independent of their pore size supplementary information table s1 these observed retentions were in line with the range provided in literature wray and andrews 2014 siembida lösch et al 2015 villacorte et al 2009 tabatabai 2014 retention of biopolymer and phmoc tended to decline slightly at low biopolymer pmhoc concentrations in the bacf filtrate 70 μg l e g july of year 1 and year 2 in fig 2a and b a finding also reported by siembida lösch et al 2015 it is hypothesized that the retained biopolymers act as dynamically formed additional filtration layer van den brink 2014 hence low feed biopolymer content and short chemically enhanced backwash intervals may result in lower rejections theoretically the complete absence of biopolymers might be expected in the 10 kda permeate because biopolymers are quantified in the lc ocd analysis as the fraction 20 kda huber et al 2011 whereas the integrity of the used membranes was already verified section 2 6 nevertheless the 10 kda permeate consistently contained low quantities of both phmoc and biopolymers one or more of the following hypotheses may explain this observation the flexibility of biopolymers which enables passage through pores smaller than their nominal dimensions passow 2000 a small percentage of the membrane pores possibly being larger than 20 kda at the membranes nominal 90 cut off tabatabai 2014 the presence of some permeate side regrowth see section 3 4 and or differences in the applied methods used to determine uf membrane pore sizes and biopolymer fractions 3 3 uf performance aoc and mgp as shown in fig 2c e and f and table 1 all three uf permeates were always substantially lower in aoc a3 bpc14 and bgp than the bacf filtrate achieved reductions amounted to 90 for aoc a3 70 for bpc14 and 50 for bgp fig 3 in contrast to the other parameters aoc p17 nox was not reduced by any of the tested membranes the complete passage of aoc p17 nox indicated that the involved substances were too low in mw to be rejected by uf hem and efraimsen 2001 zhou et al 2009 remarkably at any given point in time all three permeates featured similar levels of bpc14 bgp aoc a3 and aoc p17 nox respectively statistical evaluation supplementary information tables s2 and s3 confirmed that all permeates were indistinguishable in terms of these parameters hence the three permeates consistently resembled each other and thus all three uf membranes achieved similar reductions in each parameter except for biopolymers en phmoc importantly the uf permeates aoc and mgp levels were well below or equal to those of the low regrowth reference water section 2 1 as shown in table 1 permeate bpc14 was also close to the 40 ng d l level reported for surface water which was intensively treated by soil infiltration and slow sand filtration and exhibited no excessive regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij et al 2017 permeate bgp 240 60 103 ml was below that of treated lake water after slow sand filtration 250 500 103 ml hammes et al 2010 and only twice as high as spring water evian 80 220 103 ml prest et al 2016 sousi et al 2018 these results indicate that ultrafiltration as posttreatment for bacf is capable of significantly improving the water quality with respect to mgp 3 4 uf performance biomass and particulates uf permeate particle and cell counts were low in all samples yielding 95 99 removal respectively table 1 and fig 3 this further illustrated the integrity of the uf system in addition to other measures described in section 2 6 the observed reduction of cellular biomass was in the range reported by wang et al 2007 but was less than the complete removal reported by chan at al 2019 and what was theoretically expected based on the difference in size between cells μm order vis à vis pores nm order therefore plausibly a minor degree of permeate side microbial regrowth could have occurred to which the permeates residual aoc p17 nox and low but measurable residual mgp levels lend further support nevertheless permeate biomass levels remained well below those of the low regrowth reference water table 1 the cartridge filter in the 150 kda permeate discharge remained totally free of any visible discoloration even after prolonged exposure in contrast the cartridge filter in the bacf filtrate side stream clearly exhibited rapid grey blackish discoloration the observations on particle counts cell counts and cartridge filter appearances indicated the capacity of uf to retain particulate matter present in bacf filtrate hence uf posttreatment will minimize their load to the distribution network and thus contribute to reduce associated consumer complaints network flushing incidence and any regrowth conditions ensuing from interaction between sediment and organic matter as inferred from vreeburg et al 2008 groundwater uf posttreatment reduced sediments and associated oc van lieverloo et al 2012 invertebrate abundance correlates with sediment and organic matter and liu et al 2014 biomass is a major component of loose deposits a concomitant reduction in particulate iron by uf is probable but could not be determined here as the iron concentrations were below the detection limit 10 μg l of the applied analytical method determination with a more sensitive method detection limit 1 μg l is warranted since iron accumulation in the distribution network may stimulate regrowth by e g sediment formation and preferential adsorption of oc on iron sutherland 2001 camper 2004 parikh and chorover 2006 3 5 correlations between high mw oc aoc and mgp parameters concentrations and trends of the lc ocd biopolymer fraction and phmoc coincided well for bacf and uf permeates and the paired data were linearly correlated r2 0 91 as shown by fig 4 this correlation suggests that both analytical methods covered similar high mw oc compounds in the water samples tested here bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated for bacf filtrate p 0 01 r2 0 76 fig 5 whereas no correlation was observable for the uf permeates because their low bpc14 and aoc a3 levels approached the lower bounds of the methods sensitivity in contrast aoc p17 nox of bacf filtrate or uf permeates did not correlate with any other parameter both observations were qualitatively in line with findings by hijnen et al 2018 for various bacf filtrates and supported the relevance of slowly biodegradable high mw oc for mgp in the bacf filtrate tested here the importance of high mw oc as contributor to mgp is also in agreement with other recent studies on surface water van der kooij et al 2015 2017 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 2018 the clear difference between bacf filtrate and uf permeates in terms of high mw oc bpc14 bgp and aoc a3 as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 is illustrated by supplementary information figures s3a c regression analysis of the full data set comprising bacf filtrate and uf permeates confirmed the presence of a positive correlation between high mw oc and the other parameters p 0 004 for only the bacf filtrate data subset such correlations did not emerge p 0 34 however hijnen et al 2018 found a good correlation between phmoc and bpc14 for a large data set encompassing raw surface waters pre treated waters and bacf filtrates ranging up to 1000 μg l phmoc this apparent discrepancy is possibly explained by the comparatively low concentrations of high mw oc and bpc14 as applicable for the bacf filtrate used here as uf feed in combination with seasonal variations in the ambient microbial consortium and or biodegradability and chemistry of the high mw oc fraction such seasonal variations are plausible seen the changing temperatures and the biological origin of the high mw oc hijnen et al 2018 applicable for surface water treatment this variability may affect the resultant mgp see section 2 4 and thus potentially impair the emergence of a clear correlation between high mw oc and mgp in bacf filtrate hence the occurrence of seasonal variability of the microbial consortium and the high mw oc chemistry and biodegradability in bacf filtrate warrants further study 3 6 impact of uf pore size on mgp reduction as elaborated in section 3 3 the high reduction in aoc a3 bpc14 and bgp was similar for all uf pore sizes hence it is inferred that mgp of the tested bacf filtrate was predominantly associated with matter of relatively large size i e retainable by a 0 12 μm pore size membrane rather than the overall bulk of the high mw oc candidate constituents in the 0 12 μm size fraction encompass bacterial cells protozoa invertebrates biopolymers and undefined larger bio organic particles e g sloughed off biofilm in colloidal aggregated or associated state a further distinction between their respective contribution to and importance for overall mgp cannot yet be made with the available data and was not the subject of the present study it is thus of future interest to determine the respective reductions in mgp biomass and high mw oc accomplished by further separation of the 0 12 μm fraction by e g filtration with pores 0 12 μm centrifugation etc as well as chemical characterization of the obtained subfractions this will also provide a first indication of the potential of alternative posttreatment processes with pore sizes 0 12 μm e g microfiltration rapid sand filtration to reduce mgp furthermore the aoc and mgp methods level of detection in the low concentrations range of high mw oc applicable for the uf permeates is to be evaluated to assess the observed similarity in the permeates quality in more detail the high mgp reduction established by uf and other observations elaborated in sections 3 1 and 3 5 indicated that the overall mgp of the bacf filtrate tested here was dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds rather than the easily assimilable low mw oc fraction this highlights the importance of the total oc matrix of the specific water envisaged for uf posttreatment uf is likely less effective in reducing mgp for waters rich in low mw oc and deficient in high mw oc as the former compounds are not retained this is amongst methodological differences a possible explanation for the low to moderate improvement in biological stability observed by liu et al 2013 for uf posttreatment in groundwater where low phmoc levels prevail 20 μg l hijnen et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2017 as shown in this work the deployed in vitro biostability methods enabled useful comparison of the results obtained for uf posttreatment with other reference cases this approach is to be regarded as the first step in assessing the eventual potential of uf to reduce regrowth in the distribution network however the in vitro methods cannot provide the sole and ultimate prediction of the occurrence of regrowth in the distribution network as the microbial ecology of the distribution network is complex and still largely unknown and is influenced by numerous long and short term biotic and abiotic variables such as sediments biofilm invertebrates residence time flow patterns etc liu et al 2014 therefore the eventual impact of uf posttreatment on regrowth should be confirmed further by trials in true distribution network conditions 3 7 uf performance operational aspects the uf system operated continuously during the experimental period retentions remained unchanged 10 differential for all parameters when measured at both 80 and 120 l m2 h fluxes the average reduction in aoc and mgp was also similar for the periods of continuous filtration at respectively 80 l m2 h and 120 l m2 h table 2 presents the range of encountered transmembrane pressures δp and fouling layer resistance r f reductions of high mw oc aoc and mgp were independent of membrane resistance and pressure differential as well as influent concentration as typically illustrated for bpc14 in supplementary information figure s4 permeate cell counts and atp levels remained low after backwash or at restart of the uf system after prolonged idle periods only chemically enhanced backwash caused a short term lasting up to 4 h and limited 3 ng l increase in atp which could be attributed to release of free atp however the impact on mgp was considered to be negligible since the involved p and c quantities were small compared to the p and aoc concentrations of the matrix nescerecka et al 2016 hence operational settings were found not to compromise uf performance in mgp reduction in the tested range 4 conclusions ultrafiltration uf by membranes of 10 kda 150 kda and 0 12 μm pore size as a posttreatment step after conventional surface water treatment coagulation clariflocculation uv disinfection biologically activated carbon filtration reduced high mw molecular weight organic carbon and microbial growth potential mgp of the produced potable water tested as follows retention of biopolymers lc ocd and phmoc particulate and high mw organic carbon depended on the pore size of the membrane and was 30 0 12 μm 60 150 kda and 70 10 kda respectively biomass and particulates were retained almost completely 95 by all uf membranes microbial growth potential was reduced by 50 as bacterial growth potential bgp and by 70 as biomass production potential bpc14 respectively by all uf membranes slowly biodegradable organic carbon aoc a3 was reduced by 90 whereas easily assimilable carbon aoc p17 nox was not reduced and remained at moderate to low levels the reductions in microbial growth potential and aoc a3 were similar for all three uf membranes i e irrespective of membrane pore size this suggests that the organic matter fraction mainly responsible for mgp can be retained by 0 12 μm membrane filtration the achieved low levels of high mw organic carbon aoc a3 and microbial growth potential measured as bpc14 in the uf permeates were close to or below their respective levels in a reference water known to exhibit little regrowth in its distribution network the overall results showed the importance of the high mw organic carbon fraction for mgp in the water type tested here filtration flux membrane fouling and uf system down time did not adversely affect the achieved reductions hence the results demonstrate that ultrafiltration posttreatment in conventional surface water treatment plants is a potentially promising approach to enhance the biological stability of drinking water future study is to provide further elucidation on the characteristics of high mw oc and mgp in terms of distribution over sizes 0 12 μm biodegradability chemical composition and the methods level of detection

18559,controlling membrane fouling is challenging and information regarding the causes of fouling is critical for this while liquid phase fluorescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix lpf eem has previously been applied to identify the characteristics of membrane foulants we applied eem measurements to solid samples to identify foulants accumulated on the membrane this solid phase fluorescence eem spf eem enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids lpf eems and spf eems were used on natural organic matter nom isolated from secondary treated wastewater which revealed differences in peak positions and in spectral shapes spf eems and lpf eems of hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions showed that peaks of hpo fraction disappeared while those of tpi and hpi fractions shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification then the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using spf eem during filtration three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression indicating that in situ monitoring of foulants was successful comparison of the eem peaks between foulants and isolated nom fractions shows the presence of both liquid phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from hpi and tpi fractions changes in peak intensity confirmed that the former proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling while the latter gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling we demonstrated the functionality of the spf eem as an in situ fouling monitoring tool graphical abstract image 1 keywords aggregation induced emission fouling sensor gelation monitoring irreversible fouling secondary treated wastewater 1 introduction low pressure membranes i e microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes allow the operator to precisely separate solids from liquids and therefore are now installed in drinking water purification plants all over the world huang et al 2009 one of the most critical problems facing membrane filtration is membrane fouling wherein membrane pores are obstructed with particulate and dissolved contaminants significantly reducing water permeability fouling is classified as reversible or irreversible kimura et al 2004 the former is easily remedied by physical cleaning such as backwashing or air scrubbing while the latter is only resolved by chemical cleaning yamamura et al 2007a because the chemical cleaning process creates additional problems such as shortening the membrane lifetime and disposal of the used chemical solutions irreversible fouling requires greater attention an essential way of controlling irreversible fouling is investigating the major constituents causing the process and then taking measures to prevent accumulation of the foulants through pre treatment enhanced physical cleaning or membrane surface modification akhondi et al 2017 guo et al 2012 however because foulants change with season water sources locations and period of operation universal guidelines for controlling irreversible fouling have not been established consequently a long term pilot scale membrane experiment running for over a year is often required to optimize the pre treatment condition or physical cleaning intensity by professional operators this negates one of the principle advantages of the membrane process full automation the automation system consists of a sensor eyes a processor brain and an actuator hands information monitored by the sensor is transmitted to the processor which decides on the action of the actuator an effective automated system requires accurate information from the sensor but in the case of the membrane filtration processes the operation relies solely on indirect parameters such as transmembrane pressure tmp gao et al 2011 seidel and elimelech 2002 to establish a fully automated membrane filtration the quality and quantity of irreversible foulants should be continuously monitored in situ using a nondestructive analytical tool recently optical or non optical analysis methods have been developed which enable in situ foulant observation chen et al 2004 li et al 2017 fortunato et al 2017 succeeded in indirect visualization of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface using optical coherence tomography however the method does not appear to have been used for in situ and on line identification of membrane foulants for irreversible fouling occurred in hollow fiber membrane because of limitation of both resolution and sample shape however non optical methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy jing et al 2016 and ultrasonic reflectometry mairal et al 2000 have been investigated ultrasonic reflectometry analysis of membrane fouling has been demonstrated in desalination plants and shown to detect the accumulation of membrane foulants with high accuracy mairal et al 1999 there are many other reports of non optical methods successfully used to visualize membrane fouling at the site sim et al 2018 however these in situ observation techniques focus on the accumulation of cake or the biofilm layer on the membrane surface i e reversible fouling linares et al 2016 xu et al 2015 currently the resolution and detection sensitivity of these techniques are insufficient for observing foulants responsible for irreversible fouling as these are smaller than the membrane pore size most of the existing in situ observation methods focus on the amount of membrane foulant but a high sensitivity technique for identifying the membrane foulants is currently lacking three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy analysis has been widely used to analyze foulant characteristics because it enables establishing the presence of tiny amounts of fluorescent natural organic matter nom without any special pre treatment henderson et al 2009 in the case of foulant examinations eem analysis is usually carried out on liquid samples in cuvettes liquid phase fluorescence spectroscopy hereafter lpf eem but our research group succeeded in capturing the fluorescence emitted from the membrane surface using solid phase fluorescence spectroscopy hereafter spf eem by irradiating the sample with excitation light at 45 the use of 45 declined plate could avoid the direct reflection of fluorescence irradiation as a result membrane foulants can be analyzed directly without elution by chemicals furthermore we confirmed that a sample in a liquid separated from the apparatus can be directly analyzed by connecting the optical fiber to a fluorescence spectrophotometer these techniques allow the direct observation of nom accumulated on the membrane surface during membrane filtration spf eem studies have reported that the excitation emission property differs significantly between the solid phase and liquid phase due to differences in molecular motion mei et al 2014 spf eem has been used to analyze ingredients of pharmaceuticals and painting pigments becker et al 2003 and recently was applied to characterize waste organic matter albrecht et al 2015 muller et al 2011 however few studies have attempted to use spf eem to characterize aquatic nom such as membrane foulants during membrane filtration a further complication of applying spf eem to investigate membrane fouling is the necessity for prior identification of the spf eem characteristics of nom present in natural water therefore in this study we aimed to investigate whether in situ observation of membrane fouling using spf eem is feasible first nom present in natural water were collected and fractionated into hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions then the peak positions of spf eems and lpf eems were recorded for each fraction and were compared with previous researches characterizing hpo tpi and hpi fractions using lpf eem after that the membrane filtration experiment was conducted while the membrane surface was observed in situ using an optical fiber probe connected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer the fluorescence properties of directly observed membrane foulants were compared with the characteristics of the nom fractions based on the progression of eems observed in situ membrane foulants causing irreversible fouling were examined we also discussed the applicability of spf eem as a membrane fouling sensor 2 materials and methods 2 1 water used for membrane filtration and fractionation all water samples used for membrane filtration and fractionation consisted of secondary treated wastewater effluent collected at the hanno wastewater treatment plant saitama japan after collecting 800 l of water sample the particulate matter was immediately removed through a combination of continuous centrifugation 12 000 rpm and using a 0 45 μm cartridge filter for fractionation samples the particle free water sample was concentrated 40 times using a 2 5 in 63 5 mm spiral wound reverse osmosis ro membrane dow flimtec sw30 2540 dow chemical usa under a constant pressure of 1 0 mpa and a constant pump motor frequency of 35 hz then electrodialysis selemiom agc engineering japan was applied to reduce inorganic ions to the level of 115 ms m as a result of the concentration and deionization processes the recovery of organic matter calculated using equation 1 was 88 which is comparable to previous research yamamura et al 2014 1 n o m r e c o v e r y d o c v o l u m e c o n c e n t r a t e d s a m p l e d o c v o l u m e p r e t r e a t e d s a m p l e f i l t e r e d b y 0 45 μ m f i l t e r after an adjustment of the dissolved organic carbon doc level to 16 mg c l the deionized sample was fractionated into hpo tpi and hpi fractions by sequentially flowing the sample through amberlite dax 8 and amberlite xad 4 resins details about the fractionation process are provided in aiken et al and yamamura et al aiken et al 1992 yamamura et al 2014 fractionation of the nom in the raw water resulted in hpo tpi and hpi fractions of 52 20 and 28 respectively the fractionated samples were further divided into two equal parts one was diluted to 5 0 mg c l and used for lpf eem analysis and the other was further lyophilized fdu 2100 tokyo rikakikai japan and used for spf eem analysis the characteristics of diluted nom fractions are shown in table 1 in table 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva is an index of the degree of unsaturated nom levels of suva in fractions were in the order of hpo tpi hpi the dax 8 resins used for recovering the hpo fraction have high affinity with organic compounds containing benzene rings such as aromatic carboxylic acid and phenol while the xad 4 resins used for recovering the tpi fraction have high affinity with the fatty acids therefore the unsaturated bonds derived from benzene rings are considered to contribute to the high suva of the hpo fraction while the lower suva of the tpi fraction is a result of the lower ratio of cc bond in the fatty acids furthermore c n ratios index of protein percentage in organic compounds were in the order of the hpi tpi hpo fraction 2 2 lpf eem and spf eem analyses all eem spectra were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi japan which enables extremely high speed scanning with a low signal noise s n ratio in a pre investigation using a sulfide quinine sample 12 000 nm min was identified as the practical limit for the 5 nm step scanning from 220 to 550 nm excitation one measurement took 3 9 min to remove second order rayleigh scattering a filter with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm was attached to the emission light pass lpf eem was measured with a 1 cm quartz cuvette photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 400 v and 10 nm respectively an eem spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from each eem spectrum to remove the raman scattering effect spf eem of powdered samples was measured with a solid state sample holder fig s1 one hundred fifty mg of powdered sample was introduced into a sample chamber fitted with a round quarts window diameter 1 cm and a steel screw cap was placed on the chamber the sample chamber was then placed into the holder where emission and excitation light angle was strictly controlled to prevent the scattering effect photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 400 v and 5 nm respectively 2 3 bench scale membrane filtration experiments a membrane module was handmade in our laboratory using five fibers surface area 18 6 cm2 made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf asahi kasei chemicals japan with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm the fibers were lined up in a row without a gap between the adjacent fibers fig s2 shows the membrane filtration apparatus connected with the in situ spf eem measurement raw water was introduced to the membrane filtration tank continuously when the filtration started and the filtration was operated by suction at a constant flux of 1 0 m3 m2 day 41 6 lmh hydraulic backwashing was periodically conducted at a fixed flux of 1 5 m3 m2 day 62 5 lmh for 2 min per 30 min of filtration the filtration was continued for 26 cycles which lasted for approximately 14 h and changes in tmp were recorded using a data logger in situ eems were carried out using the same equipment for both spf eems and lpf eems but the sample chamber was replaced with optical fiber modules provided by the manufacturer briefly emission and excitation light were directed to the outside of the sample chamber by two lines of optical fibers and were assembled in a probe with a diameter of 6 mm the total length of the fiber was 2 m and the top of the probe was protected by quartz glass to prevent pollution of the fiber the probe was inserted into a hole in the silicon cap attached to the filtration tank and installed 2 mm away from the membrane surface during the filtration experiments the membrane module was fixed at the top and bottom to prevent changes in the fiber membrane distance during each filtration cycle an in situ eem was conducted three times at 0 min 13 min and 26 min photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 700 v and 5 nm respectively in summary the parameters used for in situ spf eem are summarized in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of lpf eems and spf eems lpf eem and spf eem determined for nom in raw water are shown in fig 1 lpf eem had two significant peaks at emission excitation of 417 330 fig 1 a point a and 425 240 fig 1 a point b these peaks are quite common in the spectra identified for natural water samples and indicate the presence of humic substances chen et al 2003 yang et al 2015 in addition to the humic signals two shoulders were seen with shorter emissions around 330 nm fig 1 a points c and d the shoulder with higher excitation excited at 275 nm is an indicator of proteinaceous compounds while the other with lower excitation excited at 230 nm is attributed to tryptophan like compounds compared to the lpf eem the spf eem pattern differed in the position of the peaks and spectral shape interestingly the most prominent peak at 425 240 in the lpf eem was almost non existent in the spf eem but new signals spreading over a longer excitation and emission region were present however a weak proteinaceous signal was seen at 348 280 nm fig 1 b point g similar to that seen in the lpf eem these peaks suggest that the signals of humic substances tend to either move to a longer excitation and emission position or quench the fluorescence signal with a phase change from liquid to solid according to mei et al 2014 aggregation or crystallization may cause changes in peak position in eem measurement furthermore muller et al 2011 identified an impact of color transformation on the spectral patterns the reasons for the differences in spectral pattern between lpf eem and spf eem will be further discussed in the following section it should however be noted that the database of combinations of peak positions and nom characteristics which has been assembled over a long time by a number of researchers such as openfluor murphy et al 2014 is no longer suitable for spf eems in other words we have to re examine the peak positions of solid nom samples if the nom characteristics were identified by spf eems the spf eem spectral patterns of isolated nom i e hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions were thus further examined to clarify the relationship between peak location and nom character fig 2 the fundamental trends of lpf eems determined for hpo tpi and hpi fractions were similar to trends shown in many previous studies yamamura et al 2014 briefly significant signals of humic substances were seen in all the fractions but peak locations differed slightly between fractions the hpo fraction had two peaks one at a higher excitation range of 426 335 nm fig 2 a point l1 and the other at a lower excitation range of 461 240 nm fig 2 a point l2 the tpi fraction had two significant peaks one at a higher excitation range of 405 330 nm fig 2 b point l5 and another at a lower excitation range of 403 225 nm fig 2 b point l6 the hpi fraction had two peaks one at a higher excitation range of 393 320 nm fig 2 c point l9 and the other at a lower excitation range of 422 225 nm fig 2 c point l10 these slight differences in peak positions of humic substances may represent the diverse chemical structures of humics in wastewater effluents in addition to the humic signals protein signals near 330 270 nm were observed for all the lpf eem spectra generally peaks of proteinaceous substances are prominent in the hpi organic fraction chen et al 2003 but in the present study the signal was more significant in the hpo fraction than in hpi or tpi this may be due to substances rich in carbohydrates in the hpi and tpi fraction since it is difficult to detect hydrophilic polysaccharides with a fluorescence spectrometer andrade eiroa et al 2013 we suspect that the hpi or tpi signals were too weak to register the spectral pattern of the spf eems was completely different from that of the lpf eems fig 2 here the hpo fraction fig 2 d had no signals at all despite there being many signals in the lpf eems muller et al 2011 reported a decrease in fluorescence intensity when samples solidify and found a clear negative relationship between blackness and peak intensity the blacker the sample the lower the fluorescence intensity the quenching of fluorescence intensity is partially explained by the inner filter effect as similarly observed in dark liquid samples the dark colored samples have highly light absorptive chromophores we suspect that the dark brown color of the hpo powder eliminated the fluorescence alternatively aggregation of humic substances during the lyophilization process may induce an aggregation caused quenching acq effect in the spf eem measurement acq is thought to occur because of the π π stacking interaction during aggregation between the molecules which have a planar polycyclic aromatic structure mei et al 2014 hpo organic matter is known to be rich in π π bonds from benzene rings and therefore quenching of fluorescence signals is likely in a spf eem measurement further discussion of mechanisms of spf eem signal quenching in the hpo fraction is beyond the scope of this paper but we hope to conduct research on the topic in the future spf eem measured for the hpi and tpi fractions showed similar peak positions to the spf eem spectra established for the unfractionated sample this indicates that trends present in the hpi and tpi fractions but not the hpo fraction appear in the spf eem of unfractionated samples significant peaks observed at 405 330 nm fig 2 b point l5 in the lpf eem of the tpi fraction and at 393 320 nm fig 2 c point l9 in the lpf eem of the hpi fraction shifted slightly to a longer excitation and emission position when the phase changed from liquid to solid further the weak shoulder designating the presence of protein observed at 330 270 nm fig 2 c point l11 in the lpf eem disappeared in the spf eem the changes in peak position between lpf eem and spf eem are mainly explained by an aggregation induced emission aie effect although as discussed previously the acq effect might be induced by unsaturated cc bonds in the hpi and tpi fractions it only eliminates the signals of humic region and thus cannot be the primary reason for the peak shift however aie effect may explain these changes since it occurs when inner h bonding e g c h π c h o and c h n interactions occur during solidification and when the rotations of the molecules are restricted mei et al 2014 restricting molecular rotation blocks the radiationless processes and thereby enhances emission efficiency if chemicals enabling hydrogen bonding with water molecules are present in the sample it is possible for the aie effect to occur when the sample dries out completely due to the formation of inner h bonding interactions while significant peak shifts in the solidification process were demonstrated for the bovine serum albumin bsa details of the aie active chemicals contributing to aie remain uncertain despite the fact that many chemicals are known to have aie characteristics mei et al 2014 although we here demonstrated for the first time that aie active nom exist in the tpi fraction at 471 385 nm fig 2 e point s1 and in the hpi fraction at 417 345 nm fig 2 f point s2 we remained unable to extract information regarding the aie active chemicals in the hpi and tpi fractions further studies incorporating advanced chemical structure analysis such as nuclear magnetic resonance or mass spectrometry will be required to identify the chemicals contributing to the aie effect of these fractions 3 2 in situ observation of eems during membrane filtration in this section we discuss the application of spf eem measurements to continuous monitoring of organic matter accumulated on membrane surfaces the difference in changes in tmp shows that pure water permeability changed as fouling developed fig 3 in our study periodical backwashing was performed every 30 min during filtration implementing this physical cleaning regime reduced reversible fouling as indicated by decreases in tmp the concomitant increase in resistance cannot be completely undone thus resistance increased gradually fouling which cannot be addressed by physical cleaning is the start of irreversible fouling illustrated by the dashed line in fig 3 the progression of irreversible fouling mainly occurred just after filtration started and saturation seemed to occur after 8 h in contrast reversible fouling increased until the end of operation this trends is fairly common and has been observed in a number of pilot scale studies akhondi et al 2017 it is hypothesized that the initial rapid increase in tmp is explained by pore constriction due to organic adsorption or pore blockage with colloidal particles yamamura et al 2007a yuan et al 2002 fouling mechanisms change from pore constriction and pore blockage to cake layer accumulation as shown by a transition from rapid increase to saturation in tmp changes in fouling mechanisms in our study appear to have occurred via these processes however the determination of the timing of fouling mechanism changes and identification of components causing each fouling is not possible from trends in tmp changes therefore we also obtained information regarding changes in the spf eem on the surface of the membrane fiber thereby enabling us to identify changes occurring on the membrane itself a baseline spf eem initially measured on an unused membrane was subtracted from all monitored spectra used in fig 4 the spf eem was continuously monitored on the surface of the membrane fibers and revealed three significant fouling peaks fig 4 a this indicates that we successfully monitored in situ and continuously some of the organic matter accumulated on the membrane surface without interrupting the operation when comparing the spf eems and lpf eems of fractionated solid samples peak 1 at 330 285 nm fig 4 a appears close to peak c in the lpf eems fig 1 a on the other hand peaks 2 at 410 370 nm and 3 at 430 370 nm fig 4 a look similar to the single peaks peaks s2 and s1 fig 2 e and f observed in the spf eem of the hpi and tpi fractions these results indicate the presence of proteinaceous substances or hydrophilic and transphilic organic matter accumulated on the surface of the membrane additionally the coexistence of peak 1 and peaks 2 and 3 implies that both solid and liquid phases existed in the accumulated fouling layer gelation induces rapid fouling during microfiltration chan and chen 2004 zhao et al 2014 thus spf eem was also determined for gels of the hpi fraction which revealed a peak in a similar position to that found in the spf eems of the hpi gel samples see fig s3 therefore peaks 2 and 3 can be considered a sign of gel layer formation on the membrane surface this is the first study to directly observe gelation on the membrane surface changes in the intensity of three peaks are shown in fig 4 b c and d although intensity of all peaks increased similarly to irreversible fouling trends it is of interest that the value of peak 1 decreased slightly after backwashing this indicates that a portion of the accumulated proteinaceous components was detached through physical cleaning while proteinaceous substances may be categorized as both reversible and irreversible foulants studies have reported that it is protein like substances that are responsible for irreversible fouling chan and chen 2004 yamamura et al 2007a 2007b however the continuous increase with filtration time in intensities of peaks 2 and 3 indicates that the gels accumulated on the membrane surface contributed to the initiation of irreversible fouling and once formed could no longer be mitigated these observations suggest that the mitigation of gel formation on the surface of the membrane is an efficient means of controlling irreversible fouling it should be noted that it is possible that cake layers interrupt excitation scans and fluorescence emissions if a sufficient amount of cake is deposited on the membrane in our study signals were recognized probably due to the detachment of the cake layer during backwashing and the transmittance capacity of irradiated and fluorescence lights since blackness of the sample surface contributes to the reduction of fluorescence signals it may be deduced that accumulation of humic substances greatly reduces the peak fluorescence intensity moreover a significant amount of deposited cake may disrupt monitoring of the irreversible fouling layer details regarding the influence of composition and thickness of cake layers on irreversible fouling monitoring should be further investigated investigation into the use of spf eem for controlling irreversible fouling may be valuable however two practical applications of spf eem have been identified firstly using it to assist with estimating the optimal concentration of detergents for eliminating peaks 2 and 3 another potential use is determining the point in time at which a chemical washing should be applied based on certain levels of signals developing such fouling control methods would contribute to a more efficient and reliable use of membranes 4 conclusions spf eem enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids we applied it in situ by using an optical fiber on the surface of the hollow fiber membranes operating the filtration first lpf eems and spf eems were used on nom isolated from secondary treated wastewater revealing distinctive differences in their peak positions and spectral shapes spf eem and lpf eem measurements of fractionated hpo tpi and hpi samples showed that peaks of hpo fraction disappeared while those of tpi and hpi fraction shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification then the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using spf eem during filtration three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression indicating that in situ monitoring of foulants was successful comparison of eem peaks between foulants and isolated nom fractions indicated that the peaks show the presence of both liquid phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from hpi and tpi fractions changes in peak intensity confirmed that the proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling while the gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling which once formed cannot be mitigated by physical cleaning we demonstrated the functionality of the spf eem as an in situ fouling monitoring tool and anticipate further research on its application in controlling

fluorescence eem spf eem enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids lpf eems and spf eems were used on natural organic matter nom isolated from secondary treated wastewater which revealed differences in peak positions and in spectral shapes spf eems and lpf eems of hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions showed that peaks of hpo fraction disappeared while those of tpi and hpi fractions shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification then the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using spf eem during filtration three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression indicating that in situ monitoring of foulants was successful comparison of the eem peaks between foulants and isolated nom fractions shows the presence of both liquid phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from hpi and tpi fractions changes in peak intensity confirmed that the former proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling while the latter gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling we demonstrated the functionality of the spf eem as an in situ fouling monitoring tool graphical abstract image 1 keywords aggregation induced emission fouling sensor gelation monitoring irreversible fouling secondary treated wastewater 1 introduction low pressure membranes i e microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes allow the operator to precisely separate solids from liquids and therefore are now installed in drinking water purification plants all over the world huang et al 2009 one of the most critical problems facing membrane filtration is membrane fouling wherein membrane pores are obstructed with particulate and dissolved contaminants significantly reducing water permeability fouling is classified as reversible or irreversible kimura et al 2004 the former is easily remedied by physical cleaning such as backwashing or air scrubbing while the latter is only resolved by chemical cleaning yamamura et al 2007a because the chemical cleaning process creates additional problems such as shortening the membrane lifetime and disposal of the used chemical solutions irreversible fouling requires greater attention an essential way of controlling irreversible fouling is investigating the major constituents causing the process and then taking measures to prevent accumulation of the foulants through pre treatment enhanced physical cleaning or membrane surface modification akhondi et al 2017 guo et al 2012 however because foulants change with season water sources locations and period of operation universal guidelines for controlling irreversible fouling have not been established consequently a long term pilot scale membrane experiment running for over a year is often required to optimize the pre treatment condition or physical cleaning intensity by professional operators this negates one of the principle advantages of the membrane process full automation the automation system consists of a sensor eyes a processor brain and an actuator hands information monitored by the sensor is transmitted to the processor which decides on the action of the actuator an effective automated system requires accurate information from the sensor but in the case of the membrane filtration processes the operation relies solely on indirect parameters such as transmembrane pressure tmp gao et al 2011 seidel and elimelech 2002 to establish a fully automated membrane filtration the quality and quantity of irreversible foulants should be continuously monitored in situ using a nondestructive analytical tool recently optical or non optical analysis methods have been developed which enable in situ foulant observation chen et al 2004 li et al 2017 fortunato et al 2017 succeeded in indirect visualization of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface using optical coherence tomography however the method does not appear to have been used for in situ and on line identification of membrane foulants for irreversible fouling occurred in hollow fiber membrane because of limitation of both resolution and sample shape however non optical methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy jing et al 2016 and ultrasonic reflectometry mairal et al 2000 have been investigated ultrasonic reflectometry analysis of membrane fouling has been demonstrated in desalination plants and shown to detect the accumulation of membrane foulants with high accuracy mairal et al 1999 there are many other reports of non optical methods successfully used to visualize membrane fouling at the site sim et al 2018 however these in situ observation techniques focus on the accumulation of cake or the biofilm layer on the membrane surface i e reversible fouling linares et al 2016 xu et al 2015 currently the resolution and detection sensitivity of these techniques are insufficient for observing foulants responsible for irreversible fouling as these are smaller than the membrane pore size most of the existing in situ observation methods focus on the amount of membrane foulant but a high sensitivity technique for identifying the membrane foulants is currently lacking three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy analysis has been widely used to analyze foulant characteristics because it enables establishing the presence of tiny amounts of fluorescent natural organic matter nom without any special pre treatment henderson et al 2009 in the case of foulant examinations eem analysis is usually carried out on liquid samples in cuvettes liquid phase fluorescence spectroscopy hereafter lpf eem but our research group succeeded in capturing the fluorescence emitted from the membrane surface using solid phase fluorescence spectroscopy hereafter spf eem by irradiating the sample with excitation light at 45 the use of 45 declined plate could avoid the direct reflection of fluorescence irradiation as a result membrane foulants can be analyzed directly without elution by chemicals furthermore we confirmed that a sample in a liquid separated from the apparatus can be directly analyzed by connecting the optical fiber to a fluorescence spectrophotometer these techniques allow the direct observation of nom accumulated on the membrane surface during membrane filtration spf eem studies have reported that the excitation emission property differs significantly between the solid phase and liquid phase due to differences in molecular motion mei et al 2014 spf eem has been used to analyze ingredients of pharmaceuticals and painting pigments becker et al 2003 and recently was applied to characterize waste organic matter albrecht et al 2015 muller et al 2011 however few studies have attempted to use spf eem to characterize aquatic nom such as membrane foulants during membrane filtration a further complication of applying spf eem to investigate membrane fouling is the necessity for prior identification of the spf eem characteristics of nom present in natural water therefore in this study we aimed to investigate whether in situ observation of membrane fouling using spf eem is feasible first nom present in natural water were collected and fractionated into hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions then the peak positions of spf eems and lpf eems were recorded for each fraction and were compared with previous researches characterizing hpo tpi and hpi fractions using lpf eem after that the membrane filtration experiment was conducted while the membrane surface was observed in situ using an optical fiber probe connected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer the fluorescence properties of directly observed membrane foulants were compared with the characteristics of the nom fractions based on the progression of eems observed in situ membrane foulants causing irreversible fouling were examined we also discussed the applicability of spf eem as a membrane fouling sensor 2 materials and methods 2 1 water used for membrane filtration and fractionation all water samples used for membrane filtration and fractionation consisted of secondary treated wastewater effluent collected at the hanno wastewater treatment plant saitama japan after collecting 800 l of water sample the particulate matter was immediately removed through a combination of continuous centrifugation 12 000 rpm and using a 0 45 μm cartridge filter for fractionation samples the particle free water sample was concentrated 40 times using a 2 5 in 63 5 mm spiral wound reverse osmosis ro membrane dow flimtec sw30 2540 dow chemical usa under a constant pressure of 1 0 mpa and a constant pump motor frequency of 35 hz then electrodialysis selemiom agc engineering japan was applied to reduce inorganic ions to the level of 115 ms m as a result of the concentration and deionization processes the recovery of organic matter calculated using equation 1 was 88 which is comparable to previous research yamamura et al 2014 1 n o m r e c o v e r y d o c v o l u m e c o n c e n t r a t e d s a m p l e d o c v o l u m e p r e t r e a t e d s a m p l e f i l t e r e d b y 0 45 μ m f i l t e r after an adjustment of the dissolved organic carbon doc level to 16 mg c l the deionized sample was fractionated into hpo tpi and hpi fractions by sequentially flowing the sample through amberlite dax 8 and amberlite xad 4 resins details about the fractionation process are provided in aiken et al and yamamura et al aiken et al 1992 yamamura et al 2014 fractionation of the nom in the raw water resulted in hpo tpi and hpi fractions of 52 20 and 28 respectively the fractionated samples were further divided into two equal parts one was diluted to 5 0 mg c l and used for lpf eem analysis and the other was further lyophilized fdu 2100 tokyo rikakikai japan and used for spf eem analysis the characteristics of diluted nom fractions are shown in table 1 in table 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva is an index of the degree of unsaturated nom levels of suva in fractions were in the order of hpo tpi hpi the dax 8 resins used for recovering the hpo fraction have high affinity with organic compounds containing benzene rings such as aromatic carboxylic acid and phenol while the xad 4 resins used for recovering the tpi fraction have high affinity with the fatty acids therefore the unsaturated bonds derived from benzene rings are considered to contribute to the high suva of the hpo fraction while the lower suva of the tpi fraction is a result of the lower ratio of cc bond in the fatty acids furthermore c n ratios index of protein percentage in organic compounds were in the order of the hpi tpi hpo fraction 2 2 lpf eem and spf eem analyses all eem spectra were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi japan which enables extremely high speed scanning with a low signal noise s n ratio in a pre investigation using a sulfide quinine sample 12 000 nm min was identified as the practical limit for the 5 nm step scanning from 220 to 550 nm excitation one measurement took 3 9 min to remove second order rayleigh scattering a filter with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm was attached to the emission light pass lpf eem was measured with a 1 cm quartz cuvette photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 400 v and 10 nm respectively an eem spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from each eem spectrum to remove the raman scattering effect spf eem of powdered samples was measured with a solid state sample holder fig s1 one hundred fifty mg of powdered sample was introduced into a sample chamber fitted with a round quarts window diameter 1 cm and a steel screw cap was placed on the chamber the sample chamber was then placed into the holder where emission and excitation light angle was strictly controlled to prevent the scattering effect photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 400 v and 5 nm respectively 2 3 bench scale membrane filtration experiments a membrane module was handmade in our laboratory using five fibers surface area 18 6 cm2 made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf asahi kasei chemicals japan with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm the fibers were lined up in a row without a gap between the adjacent fibers fig s2 shows the membrane filtration apparatus connected with the in situ spf eem measurement raw water was introduced to the membrane filtration tank continuously when the filtration started and the filtration was operated by suction at a constant flux of 1 0 m3 m2 day 41 6 lmh hydraulic backwashing was periodically conducted at a fixed flux of 1 5 m3 m2 day 62 5 lmh for 2 min per 30 min of filtration the filtration was continued for 26 cycles which lasted for approximately 14 h and changes in tmp were recorded using a data logger in situ eems were carried out using the same equipment for both spf eems and lpf eems but the sample chamber was replaced with optical fiber modules provided by the manufacturer briefly emission and excitation light were directed to the outside of the sample chamber by two lines of optical fibers and were assembled in a probe with a diameter of 6 mm the total length of the fiber was 2 m and the top of the probe was protected by quartz glass to prevent pollution of the fiber the probe was inserted into a hole in the silicon cap attached to the filtration tank and installed 2 mm away from the membrane surface during the filtration experiments the membrane module was fixed at the top and bottom to prevent changes in the fiber membrane distance during each filtration cycle an in situ eem was conducted three times at 0 min 13 min and 26 min photomultiplier detector voltage and slit width were fixed at 700 v and 5 nm respectively in summary the parameters used for in situ spf eem are summarized in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of lpf eems and spf eems lpf eem and spf eem determined for nom in raw water are shown in fig 1 lpf eem had two significant peaks at emission excitation of 417 330 fig 1 a point a and 425 240 fig 1 a point b these peaks are quite common in the spectra identified for natural water samples and indicate the presence of humic substances chen et al 2003 yang et al 2015 in addition to the humic signals two shoulders were seen with shorter emissions around 330 nm fig 1 a points c and d the shoulder with higher excitation excited at 275 nm is an indicator of proteinaceous compounds while the other with lower excitation excited at 230 nm is attributed to tryptophan like compounds compared to the lpf eem the spf eem pattern differed in the position of the peaks and spectral shape interestingly the most prominent peak at 425 240 in the lpf eem was almost non existent in the spf eem but new signals spreading over a longer excitation and emission region were present however a weak proteinaceous signal was seen at 348 280 nm fig 1 b point g similar to that seen in the lpf eem these peaks suggest that the signals of humic substances tend to either move to a longer excitation and emission position or quench the fluorescence signal with a phase change from liquid to solid according to mei et al 2014 aggregation or crystallization may cause changes in peak position in eem measurement furthermore muller et al 2011 identified an impact of color transformation on the spectral patterns the reasons for the differences in spectral pattern between lpf eem and spf eem will be further discussed in the following section it should however be noted that the database of combinations of peak positions and nom characteristics which has been assembled over a long time by a number of researchers such as openfluor murphy et al 2014 is no longer suitable for spf eems in other words we have to re examine the peak positions of solid nom samples if the nom characteristics were identified by spf eems the spf eem spectral patterns of isolated nom i e hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions were thus further examined to clarify the relationship between peak location and nom character fig 2 the fundamental trends of lpf eems determined for hpo tpi and hpi fractions were similar to trends shown in many previous studies yamamura et al 2014 briefly significant signals of humic substances were seen in all the fractions but peak locations differed slightly between fractions the hpo fraction had two peaks one at a higher excitation range of 426 335 nm fig 2 a point l1 and the other at a lower excitation range of 461 240 nm fig 2 a point l2 the tpi fraction had two significant peaks one at a higher excitation range of 405 330 nm fig 2 b point l5 and another at a lower excitation range of 403 225 nm fig 2 b point l6 the hpi fraction had two peaks one at a higher excitation range of 393 320 nm fig 2 c point l9 and the other at a lower excitation range of 422 225 nm fig 2 c point l10 these slight differences in peak positions of humic substances may represent the diverse chemical structures of humics in wastewater effluents in addition to the humic signals protein signals near 330 270 nm were observed for all the lpf eem spectra generally peaks of proteinaceous substances are prominent in the hpi organic fraction chen et al 2003 but in the present study the signal was more significant in the hpo fraction than in hpi or tpi this may be due to substances rich in carbohydrates in the hpi and tpi fraction since it is difficult to detect hydrophilic polysaccharides with a fluorescence spectrometer andrade eiroa et al 2013 we suspect that the hpi or tpi signals were too weak to register the spectral pattern of the spf eems was completely different from that of the lpf eems fig 2 here the hpo fraction fig 2 d had no signals at all despite there being many signals in the lpf eems muller et al 2011 reported a decrease in fluorescence intensity when samples solidify and found a clear negative relationship between blackness and peak intensity the blacker the sample the lower the fluorescence intensity the quenching of fluorescence intensity is partially explained by the inner filter effect as similarly observed in dark liquid samples the dark colored samples have highly light absorptive chromophores we suspect that the dark brown color of the hpo powder eliminated the fluorescence alternatively aggregation of humic substances during the lyophilization process may induce an aggregation caused quenching acq effect in the spf eem measurement acq is thought to occur because of the π π stacking interaction during aggregation between the molecules which have a planar polycyclic aromatic structure mei et al 2014 hpo organic matter is known to be rich in π π bonds from benzene rings and therefore quenching of fluorescence signals is likely in a spf eem measurement further discussion of mechanisms of spf eem signal quenching in the hpo fraction is beyond the scope of this paper but we hope to conduct research on the topic in the future spf eem measured for the hpi and tpi fractions showed similar peak positions to the spf eem spectra established for the unfractionated sample this indicates that trends present in the hpi and tpi fractions but not the hpo fraction appear in the spf eem of unfractionated samples significant peaks observed at 405 330 nm fig 2 b point l5 in the lpf eem of the tpi fraction and at 393 320 nm fig 2 c point l9 in the lpf eem of the hpi fraction shifted slightly to a longer excitation and emission position when the phase changed from liquid to solid further the weak shoulder designating the presence of protein observed at 330 270 nm fig 2 c point l11 in the lpf eem disappeared in the spf eem the changes in peak position between lpf eem and spf eem are mainly explained by an aggregation induced emission aie effect although as discussed previously the acq effect might be induced by unsaturated cc bonds in the hpi and tpi fractions it only eliminates the signals of humic region and thus cannot be the primary reason for the peak shift however aie effect may explain these changes since it occurs when inner h bonding e g c h π c h o and c h n interactions occur during solidification and when the rotations of the molecules are restricted mei et al 2014 restricting molecular rotation blocks the radiationless processes and thereby enhances emission efficiency if chemicals enabling hydrogen bonding with water molecules are present in the sample it is possible for the aie effect to occur when the sample dries out completely due to the formation of inner h bonding interactions while significant peak shifts in the solidification process were demonstrated for the bovine serum albumin bsa details of the aie active chemicals contributing to aie remain uncertain despite the fact that many chemicals are known to have aie characteristics mei et al 2014 although we here demonstrated for the first time that aie active nom exist in the tpi fraction at 471 385 nm fig 2 e point s1 and in the hpi fraction at 417 345 nm fig 2 f point s2 we remained unable to extract information regarding the aie active chemicals in the hpi and tpi fractions further studies incorporating advanced chemical structure analysis such as nuclear magnetic resonance or mass spectrometry will be required to identify the chemicals contributing to the aie effect of these fractions 3 2 in situ observation of eems during membrane filtration in this section we discuss the application of spf eem measurements to continuous monitoring of organic matter accumulated on membrane surfaces the difference in changes in tmp shows that pure water permeability changed as fouling developed fig 3 in our study periodical backwashing was performed every 30 min during filtration implementing this physical cleaning regime reduced reversible fouling as indicated by decreases in tmp the concomitant increase in resistance cannot be completely undone thus resistance increased gradually fouling which cannot be addressed by physical cleaning is the start of irreversible fouling illustrated by the dashed line in fig 3 the progression of irreversible fouling mainly occurred just after filtration started and saturation seemed to occur after 8 h in contrast reversible fouling increased until the end of operation this trends is fairly common and has been observed in a number of pilot scale studies akhondi et al 2017 it is hypothesized that the initial rapid increase in tmp is explained by pore constriction due to organic adsorption or pore blockage with colloidal particles yamamura et al 2007a yuan et al 2002 fouling mechanisms change from pore constriction and pore blockage to cake layer accumulation as shown by a transition from rapid increase to saturation in tmp changes in fouling mechanisms in our study appear to have occurred via these processes however the determination of the timing of fouling mechanism changes and identification of components causing each fouling is not possible from trends in tmp changes therefore we also obtained information regarding changes in the spf eem on the surface of the membrane fiber thereby enabling us to identify changes occurring on the membrane itself a baseline spf eem initially measured on an unused membrane was subtracted from all monitored spectra used in fig 4 the spf eem was continuously monitored on the surface of the membrane fibers and revealed three significant fouling peaks fig 4 a this indicates that we successfully monitored in situ and continuously some of the organic matter accumulated on the membrane surface without interrupting the operation when comparing the spf eems and lpf eems of fractionated solid samples peak 1 at 330 285 nm fig 4 a appears close to peak c in the lpf eems fig 1 a on the other hand peaks 2 at 410 370 nm and 3 at 430 370 nm fig 4 a look similar to the single peaks peaks s2 and s1 fig 2 e and f observed in the spf eem of the hpi and tpi fractions these results indicate the presence of proteinaceous substances or hydrophilic and transphilic organic matter accumulated on the surface of the membrane additionally the coexistence of peak 1 and peaks 2 and 3 implies that both solid and liquid phases existed in the accumulated fouling layer gelation induces rapid fouling during microfiltration chan and chen 2004 zhao et al 2014 thus spf eem was also determined for gels of the hpi fraction which revealed a peak in a similar position to that found in the spf eems of the hpi gel samples see fig s3 therefore peaks 2 and 3 can be considered a sign of gel layer formation on the membrane surface this is the first study to directly observe gelation on the membrane surface changes in the intensity of three peaks are shown in fig 4 b c and d although intensity of all peaks increased similarly to irreversible fouling trends it is of interest that the value of peak 1 decreased slightly after backwashing this indicates that a portion of the accumulated proteinaceous components was detached through physical cleaning while proteinaceous substances may be categorized as both reversible and irreversible foulants studies have reported that it is protein like substances that are responsible for irreversible fouling chan and chen 2004 yamamura et al 2007a 2007b however the continuous increase with filtration time in intensities of peaks 2 and 3 indicates that the gels accumulated on the membrane surface contributed to the initiation of irreversible fouling and once formed could no longer be mitigated these observations suggest that the mitigation of gel formation on the surface of the membrane is an efficient means of controlling irreversible fouling it should be noted that it is possible that cake layers interrupt excitation scans and fluorescence emissions if a sufficient amount of cake is deposited on the membrane in our study signals were recognized probably due to the detachment of the cake layer during backwashing and the transmittance capacity of irradiated and fluorescence lights since blackness of the sample surface contributes to the reduction of fluorescence signals it may be deduced that accumulation of humic substances greatly reduces the peak fluorescence intensity moreover a significant amount of deposited cake may disrupt monitoring of the irreversible fouling layer details regarding the influence of composition and thickness of cake layers on irreversible fouling monitoring should be further investigated investigation into the use of spf eem for controlling irreversible fouling may be valuable however two practical applications of spf eem have been identified firstly using it to assist with estimating the optimal concentration of detergents for eliminating peaks 2 and 3 another potential use is determining the point in time at which a chemical washing should be applied based on certain levels of signals developing such fouling control methods would contribute to a more efficient and reliable use of membranes 4 conclusions spf eem enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids we applied it in situ by using an optical fiber on the surface of the hollow fiber membranes operating the filtration first lpf eems and spf eems were used on nom isolated from secondary treated wastewater revealing distinctive differences in their peak positions and spectral shapes spf eem and lpf eem measurements of fractionated hpo tpi and hpi samples showed that peaks of hpo fraction disappeared while those of tpi and hpi fraction shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification then the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using spf eem during filtration three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression indicating that in situ monitoring of foulants was successful comparison of eem peaks between foulants and isolated nom fractions indicated that the peaks show the presence of both liquid phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from hpi and tpi fractions changes in peak intensity confirmed that the proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling while the gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling which once formed cannot be mitigated by physical cleaning we demonstrated the functionality of the spf eem as an in situ fouling monitoring tool and anticipate further research on its application in controlling
