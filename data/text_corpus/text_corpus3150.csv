15750,pyrite autotrophic denitrification pad is considered a promising method for nitrate removal from wastewater and groundwater however the results of pad studies have been contradictory for two decades and the mechanism is unclear here we investigated mineral properties of two kinds of natural pyrite yp and tp their pad performances and microbial community shift in their column reactors in parallel both pyrite are highly pure crystalline pyrite but their other mineral properties are quite different both batch and column experiments found that pad of yp occurred but that of tp did not thus the contradictory results of pad were presented for the first time at the same study the dominant bacteria in yp and tp columns finally were thiobacillus 24 55 8 67 and flavobacterium 21 11 10 59 respectively though their initial microbial communities cultured were similar reduced sulfur species and oxide impurities on the surface of pyrite and small do in water did not change autotrophic denitrification characteristic of the pyrite itself this research indicates that mineral property of pyrite caused the contradictory result of pad among pyrite properties the main crystal plane exposed and chemical state of surficial sulfur and iron were considered the decisive parameters for pad the study provides guidelines for selection of pyrite minerals for pad applications graphical

introduction denitrification mainly heterotrophic and autotropic denitrification is the dominant method for the nitrogen removal from water altabet et al 1995 heterotrophic denitrification is the conventional and most commonly adopted process gómez et al 2000 but it is dependent on easily biodegradable organic matter under the background of pursuing low carbon technologies autotrophic denitrification which is independent of organic matter has become increasingly important in nitrogen pollution control in water pyrite fes2 iron disulfide is the most abundant metal sulfide mineral on the earth s crust rickard and luther 2007 pyrite autotrophic denitrification pad refers to autotrophic denitrifiers using pyrite as an electron donor to reduce nitrate to n2 the pad reaction can be expressed as follows jorgensen et al 2009 1 3 n o 3 f e s 2 2 h 2 o 3 2 n 2 2 s o 4 2 f e o h 3 h eq 1 is thermodynamically feasible jorgensen et al 2009 but studies on pad under defined laboratory conditions arrived at contradictory conclusions bosch and meckenstock 2012b pad has been observed by many field studies and is considered a pathway of nitrate removal from groundwater zhang et al 2009 pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrento et al 2011 many laboratory studies confirmed the pad torrento et al al 2010 found that pure thiobacillus denitrificans dsmz 12 475 used natural pyrite crystal particles 25 100 μm to reduce nitrate in anaerobic batch and flow through experiments torrento et al 2010 nanosized natural pyrite crystals 375 1317 nm were oxidized and nitrate was reduced by pure thiobacillus denitrificans dsmz 739 in batch experiments bosch et al 2012a autotrophic denitrifiers enriched from anaerobic sludge used natural pyrite crystals 0 15 0 25 mm to reduce nitrate in anaerobic batch experiments pu et al 2014 in an anaerobic reactor with crushed pyrite 45 200 μm saturated aquifer sediment and kno3 solution most of the observed nitrate reduction can be ascribed to the pad jorgensen et al 2009 pad was also found in biofilter kong et al 2016 xu et al 2019 constructed wetlands ge et al 2019 and permeable reactive barrier chen et al 2020 for nitrate removal from wastewater however a number of other studies found that pad does not exist schippers and jorgensen 2002 reported that pad did not occur through slurry experiments with pyrite and marine sediment haaijer et al 2007 indicated that crystalline pyrite did not function as an electron donor in the reactor system with soil and crystalline pyrite yan et al 2019 found that pad was not possible with pure natural crystalline pyrite and thiobacillus denitrificans dsm 12 475 by batch experiments to date the reasons of the contradictory conclusions of pad are unclear some researchers thought the inconsistent the experimental and analytical protocols maybe made the contradictory conclusions of pad yan et al 2021 however all studies on pad are carried out under the normal conditions of pad and the differences under normal pad conditions are not enough to draw contradictory conclusions about pad so the reason should be found in pyrite itself those studies supporting the nonexistence of pad thought that the high crystallinity of pyrite was the reason however in all the studies supporting the existence of pad those pyrites used were also highly crystalline so crystallinity could not be the reason of the contradictory conclusions of pad except for the crystallinity few other pyrite properties were paid attention to in existing pad studies actually pyrite properties have a great influence on its chemical activity rickard and luther 2007 however all previous studies on pad concluding existence or nonexistence of pad were only based on one kind of natural pyrite and mineral properties of these pyrites were not studied in detail in order to investigate effects of pyrite properties on pad and make the reasons of the contradictory conclusions of pad clear pad with different mineral properties is conducted side by side in this study we studied 1 mineral properties of the two kinds of pyrite 2 the pad performances of them and 3 the microbial communities in the pad columns of them through the comparison of mineral properties pad performance and microbial community this study would shed light on the contradictory results of the pad and their mechanism and provide direction for application of natural pyrite to nitrate removal from wastewater and groundwater 2 methods and materials 2 1 pyrite many pyrites were acquired from different regions in china and their pad were tried at last two kinds of natural pyrite one from yunfu pyrite mine yp guandong province and the other from tongling pyrite mine tp anhui province china were found the most typical so yp and tp were studied in detail pyrite was broken in a jaw crusher and sieved into particles of 0 25 0 83 and 1 7 4 mm for batch and column experiments respectively pyrite particles for batch experiments were added to a 10 v v hcl solution for 2 h to remove oxide on the surface of pyrite and then washed with deionized water repeatedly until the ph of the water was 7 0 1 the clean pyrite particles were dried in a vacuum drying oven at room temperature for 24 h the dried pyrite was stored in airtight bags which were flushed with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of anaerobic tank in a local wastewater treatment plant a2 o with the culturing medium made from distilled water and contained 5 0 g l 1 na2s2o3 5h2o 2 0 g l 1 kh2po4 2 0 g l 1 kno3 1 0 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nh4cl 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o and 0 01 g l 1 feso4 7h2o adopted from baalsrud 1954 the detailed enrichment process was described in a previous study li et al 2016 enriched autotrophic denitrifiers were used as the inoculum in the batch and column experiment 2 3 batch experiment in the batch experiment for the pad pyrite 10 g inoculum 3 5 ml and synthetic wastewater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes sarstedt ltd germany the synthetic wastewater used in this study was composed of 0 20 g l

loss from the inoculum the polypropylene centrifuge tubes filled with the synthetic wastewater inoculum and pyrite were flushed with n2 for 120 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for mixing in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 28 c all batch experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data and standard deviation are presented 2 4 column experiment two glass column reactors fig s1 with 10 cm internal diameter and 50 cm height were established as anaerobic upflow fixed bed biofilters one was filled with yp limestone and the other was filled with tp limestone weight ratio of pyrite and limestone 3 1 labeled ypc and tpc the limestone contains 55 39 cao 0 48 mgo 0 08 sio2 and 0 01 fe2o3 the particle size of limestone was the same as that of pyrite both had a packed height of 48 cm with porosities of 50 and 47 for ypc and tpc respectively five sampling outlets o 1 o 5 located on the column at heights of 8 16 24 32 and 40 cm from the bottom of the column were used for media sampling the effluent outlet o 6 was located at a height of 50 cm from the bottom of the column during biofilm culture the two columns were fed with a solution generated from the culturing medium 95 and the inoculum solution 5 the solution 15 l was flushed with n2 for 15 min and then pumped into o 1 and flowed out from o 6 at a flow rate of 15 ml min continuously the solution was circulated in the biofilters for 2 days and then replaced with fresh solution the duration of biofilm enrichment lasted for 7 cycles 14 days after biofilm culturing was finished the biofilters were continuously fed synthetic wastewater which was prepared with distilled water kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl the hrt hydraulic retention time was kept at 24 h the whole operation time lasted 46 days at room temperature 20 25 c 2 5 sampling and analysis after water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 detection limits 0 08 0 03 and 0 09 mg l respectively in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography ics 1000 and nh4 and po4 3 p detection limits 0 01 and 0 025 mg l respectively were determined according to standard methods with mepprc 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany yp and tp were analyzed with x ray fluorescence arl 9800 arl switzerland and x ray diffraction xrd x tra arl switzerland before reaction following the manufacturer s instructions yp and tp samples were treated following torrentó et al 2012 and gold coated emitech k550 for scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55 carl zeiss ag germany pristine yp and tp embedded in resin sanded and polished and then sectioned into 10 40 nm thick sections with a

community analysis substrate samples for microbial community analysis were fixed with 100 ethanol immediately at a ratio of 1 1 v v and stored at 20 c before dna extraction total genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification a nanodrop 2000 uvevis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps were described in a previous study li et al 2020 statistical analyses using spss 22 were provided and differences in parameters were confirmed by one way analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 indicated statistically significant difference 3 results 3 1 characterization of pyrite properties yp particles had no major shape but tp particles were predominantly cubic fig s2 xrf table s1 shows 46 5 fe 51 4 s and 1 1 si in yp 44 2 fe 51 9 s and 2 1 si in tp and each of other impurities such as mg al ca k etc below 0 5 xrd spectra fig 1 a clearly indicate that both yp and tp were single pyrite phases with the same xrd peaks and there were no other detectable peaks of impurities therefore yp and tp were highly pure crystalline pyrite with the same crystal structure in view of xrd however in view of sem figs 1b and c yp and tp were quite different yp fig 1b was made of small monomer particles 10 20 μm but tp fig 1c was a whole particle with tiny particles attached on the surface figs 2 a and b are bright field images of yp and tp respectively where areas for hrtem and saed are shown the hrtem images of yp fig 2c and tp fig 2d show irregular lattice fringes and regular lattice fringes of the 100 plane with a spacing of 0 541 nm respectively all saed patterns of yp fig 2e and figs s3a c and d show multiple diffraction rings except for the area of s2 fig s3b but those of tp show ordered diffraction spots fig 2f and fig s4 both hrtem images and saed patterns indicate that yp and tp were polycrystal and monocrystal respectively a b bright field images of yp and tp respectively h1 and h2 are areas for hrtem and s1 s5 are areas for saed c d hrtem images at areas h1 of yp and h2 of tp respectively e f saed patterns at areas s4 of yp and s5 of tp respectively xps spectra fig 3 and table s2 show that fe ii and fe iii species were 96 7 and 3 3 for pristine yp and 90 2 and 9 8 for pristine tp respectively and the s2 s2 2 and sn 2 species were 5 8 93 8 and 0 4 for yp and 4 3 95 7 and 0 for pt respectively except for the normal fe ii and s2 2 species of pyrite there were more fe iii and fewer s2 species on the surface of tp than on the surface of yp 3 2 batch experiments of pyrite autotrophic denitrification batch experiments of yp and tp autotrophic denitrification ypad and tpad respectively were conducted side by side no no3 removal in the controls indicated no abiotic denitrification by yp and tp and no electron donor in the inoculum thus all no3 n removed in the batch experiments should be attributed to pad within 23 days fig 4 a no3 n decreased to zero in the ypad batch experiment ypb and no no3 n removal was observed in the tpad batch experiment tpb thus the contradictory results of pad found in different studies previously were shown in this study accordingly so4 2 increased to an equilibrium concentration in the ypb but in the tpb so4 2 increased to approximately 150 mg l which was much smaller than that in the ypb fig 4b the so4 2 in the tpb should be mainly attributed to residual oxides on the surface of tp because the residual oxides were difficult to be completely removed like in the study of pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2019 in fact in the first two days of ypb so4 2 quickly increased to 326 17 mg l fig 4b which obviously did not mainly result from pad but from residual oxides on the surface of yp in the ypb the molar ratio of no3 n removed and so4 2 produced between day 2 and day 8 is 1 37 which is only slightly lower than that of the stoichiometric value of eq 1 1 5 because a small amount of so4 2 still released from the surficial residual oxides into water po4 3 p rapidly reduced to zero in 2 days in the tpb but in the ypb it quickly decreased to 2 mg l in 2 days and further slowly to zero in the following days fig 4c though phosphorus sources were used in the growth of microorganisms consumption of phosphorus for the growth of microorganisms was very small so there were mainly two actions adsorption and precipitation zhang et al 2019 elsetinow et al 2001 for po4 3 removal in pad experiments usually adsorption of po4 3 finished in 2 days but during that period the growth of microorganisms was in a sluggish stage iron ions produced by pad were small thus po4 3 precipitated by iron ions was very small therefore the rapid po4 3 decreasing in the first 2 days shown in fig 4c was mainly attributed to po4 3 adsorption on pyrite that po4 3 adsorption capacity of tp was bigger than that of yp could be related to higher fe iii species on the tp after 2 days po4 3 removal in ypad batch experiments was mainly related to production of iron ions slow ypad limited production of iron ions and thus made po4 3 removal slow ph in the ypb was lower than that in the tpb fig 4d because of h production during pad reaction 3 3 column experiments of pyrite autotrophic denitrification to further evaluate ypad and tpad continuous flow column experiments were conducted in parallel with the same inoculum and culture medium as those of the batch experiments biofilms were cultured in ypc and tpc firstly many bacteria were attached on the yp figs s5a b c and tp figs s5d e f at the end of biofilm culturing after biofilm culturing was finished the two columns were fed with synthetic wastewater continuously for 46 days to investigate their pad performance according to the no3 n variation figs 5 a and b and removal rate table s3 the whole 46 day operation of the column experiments could be divided into 2 phases phase i day 0 25 and phase ii day 25 46 the ypc fig 5a removed no3 n to zero and approximately 2 mg l during phases i and ii respectively however during phase i effluent no3 n in the tpc gradually increased to the influent concentration and during phase ii no no3 n removal was observed fig 5b during phase i the occurrence and nonoccurrence of no2 in the effluent of tpc and ypc respectively indicated the difference in tpad and ypad too the results of ypc and tpc during phase ii further showed that ypad occurred but tpad did not like the results of ypb and tpb when sulfur autotrophic biofilms were cultured with culture medium some residual reduced sulfur rrs usually remained in the biofilm li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 cardoso et al 2006 similarly during biofilm culturing some rrs would remain in the ypc and tpc therefore phase i could be considered the transitional period between biofilm culturing and phase ii which could be considered the period of normal operation of the pad thus during phase i rrs and pyrite were used as electron donors together for nitrate removal in the two columns by the end of phase i the rrs was depleted and pyrite became the only electron donor for nitrate removal during phase ii ypc fig 5a removed no3 n to zero during phase i with rrs and yp together as the electron donor and approximately 2 mg l during phase ii with only yp as the electron donor however for tpc because tp could not be used as an electron donor for denitrification during phase i effluent no3 n gradually increased to the influent concentration as the rrs gradually ran out and during phase ii because of no electron donor any more no no3 n was removed the effluent no3 n of the tpc was even slightly bigger than the influent concentration fig 5b and table s3 which could be ascribed to nitrification which was supported by nh4 n removal fig s6d at the beginning of phase i so4 2 remained in the biofilm released into water which made the effluent so4 2 much higher than the influent so4 2 of the two columns figs 5c and d which also happened to the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 with the so4 2 remaining in the biofilm released completely the so4 2 concentration in the effluent of the two columns basically depended on the pad thus the so4 2 difference between the effluent and influent of the ypc remained stable fig 5c because no3 n was stably removed during phase ii the average molar ratio of no3 n removed and so4 2 produced during phase ii is 1 09 below that of the stoichiometric value of eq 1 indicating aerobic pyrite oxidation in the ypc because anaerobic conditions were not strictly maintained however the so4 2 difference between the effluent and influent of the tpc was very small during most of phase i and the whole phase ii fig 5d since tpad did not occur specifically an average of 17 mg l so4 2 produced during phase ii indicated slight aerobic pyrite oxidation in the tpc like in the ypc there were a few dissolved oxygen do in the influent ypc and tpc but still ypad occurred and tpad did not so small do in the water did not change characteristic of one kind of pyrite for autotrophic denitrification 3 4 microbial community differences in the ypc and tpc the inoculum was enriched from anaerobic sludge with na2s2o3 as the electron donor in the inoculum sulfurimonas and thiobacillus the most common sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers were dominant with abundances of 97 22 and 0 81 fig 6 a respectively zhang et al 2019 the inoculum was used for biofilm culturing in the column experiments after biofilm culturing finished the abundances of sulfurimonas were 78 00 79 01 81 80 and 79 32 70 58 73 75 at the o 1 3 and 5 of the ypc and tpc respectively accordingly the abundances of thiobacillus were 13 86 12 60 and 9 32 and 3 99 1 73 and 1 44 respectively fig 6a this result indicated that the sulfur autotrophic denitrification biofilm in both ypc and tpc was cultured successfully overall the abundances of sulfurimonas in the ypc and tpc were very close p 0 05 but those of thiobacillus were quite different p 0 05 thiobacillus has a stronger ability to catalyze anaerobic nitrate dependent oxidation of fe ii and oxidize mineral electron donors than sulfurimona beller et al 2006 therefore it can be deduced that in ypc and tpc the close abundance of sulfurimonas resulted from the same culture media with na2s2o3 as the electron donor and the large difference in the abundances of thiobacillus should be attributed to the large difference between ypad and tpad because of the much higher abundance of thiobacillus in the ypc and tpc than in the inoculum it was inferred that both yp and tp participated in autotrophic denitrification during biofilm culturing with na2s2o3 as an electron donor though tpad did not occur in the tpb and tpc experiments this was supported by etching pits on both yp and tp but they were much larger and deeper on the yp surface than on the tp surface fig s7 at the end of biofilm culture at the end of column operation the dominant bacteria in the ypc were still sulfurimonas and thiobacillus but in the tpc they became flavobacterium and sulfurimonas fig 5b specifically at o 1 3 and 5 of the ypc and tpc the abundances of thiobacillus were 21 69 34 29 17 67 and 7 27 9 43 and 5 88 respectively at the same outlets of the ypc and tpc those of sulfurimonas were 10 69 22 77 56 02 and 8 07 20 10 and 21 25 respectively flavobacterium is involved in aerobic heterotrophic nitrification pishgar et al 2019 jo et al 2016 whose abundances at o 1 3 and 5 of the tpc were 33 33 15 38 and 14 63 but at the same outlets of the ypc they were only 3 09 1 02 and 0 004 respectively therefore the most dominant microbial process was pad in the ypc and nitrification in the tpc which was supported by figs 5a and e and figs s5c and d in the tpc sulfurimonas and thiobacillus were still significant which should result from their high abundance during biofilm culturing actually they did not play the role of autotrophic denitrification during phase ii this was supported by the higher nh4 n removal fig s5b and higher effluent no3 n than influent no3 n fig 5b in the tpc thermomonas weisener et al 2017 for conversions of n2o to n2 and rhizobium herridge et al 2008 for conversions of n2 to nh4 have abundances of 13 04 and 17 91 at outlet 1 of the ypc much higher than those of 2 11 and 3 15 at outlet 1 of the tpc respectively this also supported that ypad occurred but tpad did not 4 discussion batch and column experiments of this study provides strong evidence that ypad occurred and tpad did not which was supported by the shift of the microbial communities in the ypc and tpc it is observed for the first time that the contradictory pad results occurred for two natural pyrites with different properties in the same study inconsistent experimental and analytical protocols may cause the contradictory results of pad yan et al 2021 however all experiments of ypad and tpad were conducted side by side therefore the contradictory results of the ypad and tpad could only be attributed to the different properties of yp and tp previous conclusion of existence or non existence of pad were only one sided because those conclusions were based on one kind of pyrite natural pyrite may contain impurities such as sulfur and pyrrhotite which have higher activity for sulfur autotropic denitrification thus nitrate removal based on autotrophic denitrification of those impurities may be misinterpreted as the action of pad yan et al 2019 however in the xrd spectra of both yp and tp no peaks of those impurities indicate that the contents of those impurities are very small therefore in this study the effects of impurities in pyrite on nitrate removal were negligible surficial impurities such as oxides produced during pyrite sample preparation reduced sulfur formed during bacteria culture and do in influent caused by not strictly anaerobic conditions may interfere interpretation of pad results yan et al 2021 in this study batch and column experiments indirectly indicated that there were surficial oxides rrs on surface of pyrite and small do in influent not strictly anaerobic condition but they did not change autotrophic denitrification characteristic of the pyrite itself at last this is beneficial for pad to be used in nitrate removal from water practically because it is difficult to remove all oxides and rrs on surface of pyrite and keep strict anaerobic condition in engineering application in natural pyrite crystals the atomic ratio of s fe is usually not equal to 2 namely sulfur or iron vacancies often exist in pyrite sulfur vacancies form sulfur monomer species and provide active sites for the oxidation of pyrite andersson et al 2004 and iron vacancy sites are more electron acceptor like defect sites krishnamoorthy et al 2013 the atomic ratios of s fe were 1 93 and 2 05 tables s1 in yp and tp respectively this indicates that low concentrations of sulfur vacancies exist in the yp and iron vacancies in the tp therefore yp with sulfur vacancies seems to be more beneficial for pad than tp with iron vacancies however the atomic ratio of s fe of pyrite is 1 94 in yan s study yan et al 2019 which did not find the occurrence of pad and bosch 2012b found that pad occurred for pyrite with an atomic ratio of s fe of 2 02 therefore the effects of the atomic ratio of s fe on pad are unclear crystallinity such as the structural differences between framboidal and highly ordered pyrite crystals bosch et al 2012a was considered a decisive parameter for the pad those studies supporting the nonexistence of the pad concluded that crystalline pyrite could not drive the pad but many studies found that crystalline pyrite could in this study both yp and tp are highly pure crystalline pyrite with nearly the same xrd spectra the framboidal pyrite consists of spherical or subspherical clusters of submicron to micron sized pyrite crystals itabashi et al 2019 according to fig 1b yp obviously does not have the typical framboidal features therefore the occurrence of ypad did not support that crystallinity is the decisive parameter for pad particle size was considered another decisive parameter for the pad bosch et al 2012 bosch et al 2012a found that pyrite nanoparticles were oxidized and that large crystals of the same pyrite did not however using pyrite with visible nanoparticles on its surface as the electron donor yan et al 2019 still did not exhibit pad the yp is made of 10 20 μm monomer particles fig 1b but those monomer particles tightly bond together therefore the practical particle size of yp should be close to its apparent particle size the average yp oxidation rate in the ypb apparent particle size 250 830 μm was approximately 3 6 μm h 1 no3 which was between the 10 1 and 2 0 μm h 1 no3 obtained by bosch et al 2012a and torrento et al 2010 with pyrite particle sizes of 0 75 2 63 and 25 100 μm respectively therefore the particle size could affect the rate of the pad as shown by tong et al 2018 but it could not be the decisive parameter for the pad yp is polycrystal and made of 10 20 μm monomer particles thus yp would mainly fracture along the interface of monomer particles when broken as shown in fig 1b fig 2e shows that the dominant crystal planes exposed would be 110 and 111 for the yp tp is monocrystal and it would mainly fracture along the crystal planes with low surface energy when broken the dominant crystal planes exposed would be 100 for the tp those were supported by yp particles without a major shape and tp particles with a main cubic shape fig s2 previous studies indicated that the order of surface energy of pyrite crystal planes is 100 110 111 kitchaev and ceder 2016 and that of the overall reaction rate for both abiotic and biological aerobic oxidation was 100 110 111 ndlovua et al 2005 feng et al 2019 crystal plane 111 shows 10 100 times faster oxidation than 100 in chemical reactions zhu et al 2018 the effects of pyrite crystal planes on pad have never been studied before but it is rational to deduce that the order of reaction rate of pyrite crystal planes for pad is 100 110 111 therefore the reaction rate of ypad was much faster than that of tpad according to xps spectra of pristine yp and tp surficial sulfur and iron elements of yp had lower oxidation state than those of tp this means that yp is easier to be oxidized than tp xps spectra of reacted yp and tp fig s8 and table s4 show that species of fe ii and fe iii are 0 and 100 for reacted yp and 31 09 and 68 91 for reacted tp respectively species of s2 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 are 47 37 9 83 and 42 80 for the reacted yp respectively and s2 2 s2o3 2 and sn 2 are 98 77 0 87 and 3 07 for the reacted tp respectively relative to pristine yp fe ii and s2 disappeared and s2 2 significantly decreased and fe iii s2o3 2 and so4 2 increased greatly on the surface of reacted yp indicating oxidations of both elements s and fe happened on the surface of yp however relative to pristine tp s2 disappeared small amounts of new species sn 2 and s2o3 2 occurred but s2 2 increased fe ii significantly decreased and fe iii increased on the reacted tp indicating that species s2 and fe ii were oxidized but s2 2 was not on the surface of tp the species of s2o3 2 on the reacted yp was over 10 times more than that on the reacted tp and no species of so4 2 was observed on the reacted tp therefore the reactivity of pad could depend on whether the surface s2 2 of pyrite can be microbially oxidized by no3 which is in agreement with the fact that pad appears to be induced via s oxidation but not via fe oxidation yan et al 2019 previous study thought that there are two enzymatic pathways sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and sulfur oxidation sox for sulfide oxidation under nitrate reducing conditions poser et al 2014 and in the sqr pathway a series of intermediates form such as s0 and s2o3 2 but in the sox pathway no intermediates are generated during oxidation to sulfate t denitrificans predominantly uses the sqr pathway for oxidizing sulfide to sulfate under denitrifying conditions beller et al 2006 much more abundance of thiobacillus in the ypc than in the tpc and much more s2o3 2 species on the reacted yp than on the reacted tp in this study also indirectly supported that yp could drive autotrophic denitrification but tp can t 5 conclusions two kinds of natural pyrite yp and tp were studied for the pad in parallel both yp and tp are highly pure crystalline pyrite but yp is polycrystal pyrite with sulfur vacancy smaller monomer particle size mainly crystal plane 110 and 111 exposed and lower oxidation state of sulfur and iron elements and tp is monocrystal pyrite with iron vacancy bigger monomer particle size mainly crystal plane 100 exposed and higher oxidation state of sulfur and iron elements the batch and column experiments found that ypad occurred but tpad did not accordingly microbial communities were dominated by thiobacillus 24 55 8 67 and flavobacterium 21 11 10 59 in yp and tp column reactors respectively among these mineral properties mainly crystal plane exposed and chemical state of surficial sulfur and iron were decisive for pad reduced sulfur species and oxides impurities on the surface of pyrite and small do in water did not change autotrophic denitrification characteristic of the pyrite itself pad can have good performance of simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal from water which is significant for eutrophication control and groundwater pollution control however the contradictory results of pad is a big problem for application of pyrite to water pollution control pyrite properties had huge effects on the pad and caused contradictory pad results in order to clarify the mechanism of pad and the contradictory results of the pad deeply the future study should pay more attentions to the effects of pyrite properties especially the pyrite

15750,pyrite autotrophic denitrification pad is considered a promising method for nitrate removal from wastewater and groundwater however the results of pad studies have been contradictory for two decades and the mechanism is unclear here we investigated mineral properties of two kinds of natural pyrite yp and tp their pad performances and microbial community shift in their column reactors in parallel both pyrite are highly pure crystalline pyrite but their other mineral properties are quite different both batch and column experiments found that pad of yp occurred but that of tp did not thus the contradictory results of pad were presented for the first time at the same study the dominant bacteria in yp and tp columns finally were thiobacillus 24 55 8 67 and flavobacterium 21 11 10 59 respectively though their initial microbial communities cultured were similar reduced sulfur species and oxide impurities on the surface of pyrite and small do in water did not change autotrophic denitrification characteristic of the pyrite itself this research indicates that mineral property of pyrite caused the contradictory result of pad among pyrite properties the main crystal plane exposed and chemical state of surficial sulfur and iron were considered the decisive parameters for pad the study provides guidelines for selection of pyrite minerals for pad applications graphical

introduction denitrification mainly heterotrophic and autotropic denitrification is the dominant method for the nitrogen removal from water altabet et al 1995 heterotrophic denitrification is the conventional and most commonly adopted process gómez et al 2000 but it is dependent on easily biodegradable organic matter under the background of pursuing low carbon technologies autotrophic denitrification which is independent of organic matter has become increasingly important in nitrogen pollution control in water pyrite fes2 iron disulfide is the most abundant metal sulfide mineral on the earth s crust rickard and luther 2007 pyrite autotrophic denitrification pad refers to autotrophic denitrifiers using pyrite as an electron donor to reduce nitrate to n2 the pad reaction can be expressed as follows jorgensen et al 2009 1 3 n o 3 f e s 2 2 h 2 o 3 2 n 2 2 s o 4 2 f e o h 3 h eq 1 is thermodynamically feasible jorgensen et al 2009 but studies on pad under defined laboratory conditions arrived at contradictory conclusions bosch and meckenstock 2012b pad has been observed by many field studies and is considered a pathway of nitrate removal from groundwater zhang et al 2009 pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrento et al 2011 many laboratory studies confirmed the pad torrento et al al 2010 found that pure thiobacillus denitrificans dsmz 12 475 used natural pyrite crystal particles 25 100 μm to reduce nitrate in anaerobic batch and flow through experiments torrento et al 2010 nanosized natural pyrite crystals 375 1317 nm were oxidized and nitrate was reduced by pure thiobacillus denitrificans dsmz 739 in batch experiments bosch et al 2012a autotrophic denitrifiers enriched from anaerobic sludge used natural pyrite crystals 0 15 0 25 mm to reduce nitrate in anaerobic batch experiments pu et al 2014 in an anaerobic reactor with crushed pyrite 45 200 μm saturated aquifer sediment and kno3 solution most of the observed nitrate reduction can be ascribed to the pad jorgensen et al 2009 pad was also found in biofilter kong et al 2016 xu et al 2019 constructed wetlands ge et al 2019 and permeable reactive barrier chen et al 2020 for nitrate removal from wastewater however a number of other studies found that pad does not exist schippers and jorgensen 2002 reported that pad did not occur through slurry experiments with pyrite and marine sediment haaijer et al 2007 indicated that crystalline pyrite did not function as an electron donor in the reactor system with soil and crystalline pyrite yan et al 2019 found that pad was not possible with pure natural crystalline pyrite and thiobacillus denitrificans dsm 12 475 by batch experiments to date the reasons of the contradictory conclusions of pad are unclear some researchers thought the inconsistent the experimental and analytical protocols maybe made the contradictory conclusions of pad yan et al 2021 however all studies on pad are carried out under the normal conditions of pad and the differences under normal pad conditions are not enough to draw contradictory conclusions about pad so the reason should be found in pyrite itself those studies supporting the nonexistence of pad thought that the high crystallinity of pyrite was the reason however in all the studies supporting the existence of pad those pyrites used were also highly crystalline so crystallinity could not be the reason of the contradictory conclusions of pad except for the crystallinity few other pyrite properties were paid attention to in existing pad studies actually pyrite properties have a great influence on its chemical activity rickard and luther 2007 however all previous studies on pad concluding existence or nonexistence of pad were only based on one kind of natural pyrite and mineral properties of these pyrites were not studied in detail in order to investigate effects of pyrite properties on pad and make the reasons of the contradictory conclusions of pad clear pad with different mineral properties is conducted side by side in this study we studied 1 mineral properties of the two kinds of pyrite 2 the pad performances of them and 3 the microbial communities in the pad columns of them through the comparison of mineral properties pad performance and microbial community this study would shed light on the contradictory results of the pad and their mechanism and provide direction for application of natural pyrite to nitrate removal from wastewater and groundwater 2 methods and materials 2 1 pyrite many pyrites were acquired from different regions in china and their pad were tried at last two kinds of natural pyrite one from yunfu pyrite mine yp guandong province and the other from tongling pyrite mine tp anhui province china were found the most typical so yp and tp were studied in detail pyrite was broken in a jaw crusher and sieved into particles of 0 25 0 83 and 1 7 4 mm for batch and column experiments respectively pyrite particles for batch experiments were added to a 10 v v hcl solution for 2 h to remove oxide on the surface of pyrite and then washed with deionized water repeatedly until the ph of the water was 7 0 1 the clean pyrite particles were dried in a vacuum drying oven at room temperature for 24 h the dried pyrite was stored in airtight bags which were flushed with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of anaerobic tank in a local wastewater treatment plant a2 o with the culturing medium made from distilled water and contained

described in a previous study li et al 2016 enriched autotrophic denitrifiers were used as the inoculum in the batch and column experiment 2 3 batch experiment in the batch experiment for the pad pyrite 10 g inoculum 3 5 ml and synthetic wastewater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes sarstedt ltd germany the synthetic wastewater used in this study was composed of 0 20 g l

loss from the inoculum the polypropylene centrifuge tubes filled with the synthetic wastewater inoculum and pyrite were flushed with n2 for 120 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for mixing in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 28 c all batch experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data and standard deviation are presented 2 4 column experiment two glass column reactors fig s1 with 10 cm internal diameter and 50 cm height were established as anaerobic upflow fixed bed biofilters one was filled with yp limestone and the other was filled with tp limestone weight ratio of pyrite and limestone 3 1 labeled ypc and tpc the limestone contains 55 39 cao 0 48 mgo 0 08 sio2 and 0 01 fe2o3 the particle size of limestone was the same as that of pyrite both had a packed height of 48 cm with porosities of 50 and 47 for ypc and tpc respectively five sampling outlets o 1 o 5 located on the column at heights of 8 16 24 32 and 40 cm from the bottom of the column were used for media sampling the effluent outlet o 6 was located at a height of 50 cm from the bottom of the column during biofilm culture the two columns were fed with a solution generated from the culturing medium 95 and the inoculum solution 5 the solution 15 l was flushed with n2 for 15 min and then pumped into o 1 and flowed out from o 6 at a flow rate of 15 ml min continuously the solution was circulated in the biofilters for 2 days and then replaced with fresh solution the duration of biofilm enrichment lasted for 7 cycles 14 days after biofilm culturing was finished the biofilters were continuously fed synthetic wastewater which was prepared with distilled water kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl the hrt hydraulic retention time was kept at 24 h the whole operation time lasted 46 days at room temperature 20 25 c 2 5 sampling and analysis after water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 detection limits 0 08 0 03 and 0 09 mg l respectively in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography ics 1000 and nh4 and po4 3 p detection limits 0 01 and 0 025 mg l respectively were determined according to standard methods with mepprc 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany yp and tp were analyzed with x ray fluorescence arl 9800 arl switzerland and x ray diffraction xrd x tra arl switzerland before reaction following the manufacturer s instructions yp and tp samples were treated following torrentó et al 2012 and gold coated emitech k550 for scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55 carl zeiss ag germany pristine yp and tp embedded in resin sanded and polished and then sectioned into 10 40 nm thick sections with a

spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps were described in a previous study li et al 2020 statistical analyses using spss 22 were provided and differences in parameters were confirmed by one way analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 indicated statistically significant difference 3 results 3 1 characterization of pyrite properties yp particles had no major shape but tp particles were predominantly cubic fig s2 xrf table s1 shows 46 5 fe 51 4 s and 1 1 si in yp 44 2 fe 51 9 s and 2 1 si in tp and each of other impurities such as mg al ca k etc below 0 5 xrd spectra fig 1 a clearly indicate that both yp and tp were single pyrite phases with the same xrd peaks and there were no other detectable peaks of impurities therefore yp and tp were highly pure crystalline pyrite with the same crystal structure in view of xrd however in view of sem figs 1b and c yp and tp were quite different yp fig 1b was made of small monomer particles 10 20 μm but tp fig 1c was a whole particle with tiny particles attached on the surface figs 2 a and b are bright field images of yp and tp respectively where areas for hrtem and saed are shown the hrtem images of yp fig 2c and tp fig 2d show irregular lattice fringes and regular lattice fringes of the 100 plane with a spacing of 0 541 nm respectively all saed patterns of yp fig 2e and figs s3a c and d show multiple diffraction rings except for the area of s2 fig s3b but those of tp show ordered diffraction spots fig 2f and fig s4 both hrtem images and saed patterns indicate that yp and tp were polycrystal and monocrystal respectively a b bright field images of yp and tp respectively h1 and h2 are areas for hrtem and s1 s5 are areas for saed c d hrtem images at areas h1 of yp and h2 of tp respectively e f saed patterns at areas s4 of yp and s5 of tp respectively xps spectra fig 3 and table s2 show that fe ii and fe iii species were 96 7 and 3 3 for pristine yp and 90 2 and 9 8 for pristine tp respectively and the s2 s2 2 and sn 2 species were 5 8 93 8 and 0 4 for yp and 4 3 95 7 and 0 for pt respectively except for the normal fe ii and s2 2 species of pyrite there were more fe iii and fewer s2 species on the surface of tp than on the surface of yp 3 2 batch experiments of pyrite autotrophic denitrification batch experiments of yp and tp autotrophic denitrification ypad and tpad respectively were conducted side by side no no3 removal in the controls indicated no abiotic denitrification by yp and tp and no electron donor in the inoculum thus all no3 n removed in the batch experiments should be attributed to pad within 23 days fig 4 a no3 n decreased to zero in the ypad batch experiment ypb and no no3 n removal was observed in the tpad batch experiment tpb thus the contradictory results of pad found in different studies previously were shown in this study accordingly so4 2 increased to an equilibrium concentration in the ypb but in the tpb so4 2 increased to approximately 150 mg l which was much smaller than that in the ypb fig 4b the so4 2 in the tpb should be mainly attributed to residual oxides on the surface of tp because the residual oxides were difficult to be completely removed like in the study of pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2019 in fact in the first two days of ypb so4 2 quickly increased to 326 17 mg l fig 4b which obviously did not mainly result from pad but from residual oxides on the surface of yp in the ypb the molar ratio of no3 n removed and so4 2 produced between day 2 and day 8 is 1 37 which is only slightly lower than that of the stoichiometric value of eq 1 1 5 because a small amount of so4 2 still released from the surficial residual oxides into water po4 3 p rapidly reduced to zero in 2 days in the tpb but in the ypb it quickly decreased to 2 mg l in 2 days and further slowly to zero in the following days fig 4c though phosphorus sources were used in the growth of microorganisms consumption of phosphorus for the growth of microorganisms was very small so there were mainly two actions adsorption and precipitation zhang et al 2019 elsetinow et al 2001 for po4 3 removal in pad experiments usually adsorption of po4 3 finished in 2 days but during that period the growth of microorganisms was in a sluggish stage iron ions produced by pad were small thus po4 3 precipitated by iron ions was very small therefore the rapid po4 3 decreasing in the first 2 days shown in fig 4c was mainly attributed to po4 3 adsorption on pyrite that po4 3 adsorption capacity of tp was bigger than that of yp could be related to higher fe iii species on the tp after 2 days po4 3 removal in ypad batch experiments was mainly related to production of iron ions slow ypad limited production of iron ions and thus made po4 3 removal slow ph in the ypb was lower than that in the tpb fig 4d because of h production during pad reaction 3 3 column experiments of pyrite autotrophic denitrification to further evaluate ypad and tpad continuous flow column experiments were conducted in parallel with the same inoculum and culture medium as those of the batch experiments biofilms were cultured in ypc and tpc firstly many bacteria were attached on the yp figs s5a b c and tp figs s5d e f at the end of biofilm culturing after biofilm culturing was finished the two columns were fed with synthetic wastewater continuously for 46 days to investigate their pad performance according to the no3 n variation figs 5 a and b and removal rate table s3 the whole 46 day operation of the column experiments could be divided into 2 phases phase i day 0 25 and phase ii day 25 46 the ypc fig 5a removed no3 n to zero and approximately 2 mg l during phases i and ii respectively however during phase i effluent no3 n in the tpc gradually increased to the influent concentration and during phase ii no no3 n removal was observed fig 5b during phase i the occurrence and nonoccurrence of no2 in the effluent of tpc and ypc respectively indicated the difference in tpad and ypad too the results of ypc and tpc during phase ii further showed that ypad occurred but tpad did not like the results of ypb and tpb when sulfur autotrophic biofilms were cultured with culture medium some residual reduced sulfur rrs usually remained in the biofilm li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 cardoso et al 2006 similarly during biofilm culturing some rrs would remain in the ypc and tpc therefore phase i could be considered the transitional period between biofilm culturing and phase ii which could be considered the period of normal operation of the pad thus during phase i rrs and pyrite were used as electron donors together for nitrate removal in the two columns by the end of phase i the rrs was depleted and pyrite became the only electron donor for nitrate removal during phase ii ypc fig 5a removed no3 n to zero during phase i with rrs and yp together as the electron donor and approximately 2 mg l during phase ii with only yp as the electron donor however for tpc because tp could not be used as an electron donor for denitrification during phase i effluent no3 n gradually increased to the influent concentration as the rrs gradually ran out and during phase ii because of no electron donor any more no no3 n was removed the effluent no3 n of the tpc was even slightly bigger than the influent concentration fig 5b and table s3 which could be ascribed to nitrification which was supported by nh4 n removal fig s6d at the beginning of phase i so4 2 remained in the biofilm released into water which made the effluent so4 2 much higher than the influent so4 2 of the two columns figs 5c and d which also happened to the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 with the so4 2 remaining in the biofilm released completely the so4 2 concentration in the effluent of the two columns basically depended on the pad thus the so4 2 difference between the effluent and influent of the ypc remained stable fig 5c because no3 n was stably removed during phase ii the average molar ratio of no3 n removed and so4 2 produced during phase ii is 1 09 below that of the stoichiometric value of eq 1 indicating aerobic pyrite oxidation in the ypc because anaerobic conditions were not strictly maintained however the so4 2 difference between the effluent and influent of the tpc was very small during most of phase i and the whole phase ii fig 5d since tpad did not occur specifically an average of 17 mg l so4 2 produced during phase ii indicated slight aerobic pyrite oxidation in the tpc like in the ypc there were a few dissolved oxygen do in the influent ypc and tpc but still ypad occurred and tpad did not so small do in the water did not change characteristic of one kind of pyrite for autotrophic denitrification 3 4 microbial community differences in the ypc and tpc the inoculum was enriched from anaerobic sludge with na2s2o3 as the electron donor in the inoculum sulfurimonas and thiobacillus the most common sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers were dominant with abundances of 97 22 and 0 81 fig 6 a respectively zhang et al 2019 the inoculum was used for biofilm culturing in the column experiments after biofilm culturing finished the abundances of sulfurimonas were 78 00 79 01 81 80 and 79 32 70 58 73 75 at the o 1 3 and 5 of the ypc and tpc respectively accordingly the abundances of thiobacillus were 13 86 12 60 and 9 32 and 3 99 1 73 and 1 44 respectively fig 6a this result indicated that the sulfur autotrophic denitrification biofilm in both ypc and tpc was cultured successfully overall the abundances of sulfurimonas in the ypc and tpc were very close p 0 05 but those of thiobacillus were quite different p 0 05 thiobacillus has a stronger ability to catalyze anaerobic nitrate dependent oxidation of fe ii and oxidize mineral electron donors than sulfurimona beller et al 2006 therefore it can be deduced that in ypc and tpc the close abundance of sulfurimonas resulted from the same culture media with na2s2o3 as the electron donor and the large difference in the abundances of thiobacillus should be attributed to the large difference between ypad and tpad because of the much higher abundance of thiobacillus in the ypc and tpc than in the inoculum it was inferred that both yp and tp participated in autotrophic denitrification during biofilm culturing with na2s2o3 as an electron donor though tpad did not occur in the tpb and tpc experiments this was supported by etching pits on both yp and tp but they were much larger and deeper on the yp surface than on the tp surface fig s7 at the end of biofilm culture at the end of column operation the dominant bacteria in the ypc were still sulfurimonas and thiobacillus but in the tpc they became flavobacterium and sulfurimonas fig 5b specifically at o 1 3 and 5 of the ypc and tpc the abundances of thiobacillus were 21 69 34 29 17 67 and 7 27 9 43 and 5 88 respectively at the same outlets of the ypc and tpc those of sulfurimonas were 10 69 22 77 56 02 and 8 07 20 10 and 21 25 respectively flavobacterium is involved in aerobic heterotrophic nitrification pishgar et al 2019 jo et al 2016 whose abundances at o 1 3 and 5 of the tpc were 33 33 15 38 and 14 63 but at the same outlets of the ypc they were only 3 09 1 02 and 0 004 respectively therefore the most dominant microbial process was pad in the ypc and nitrification in the tpc which was supported by figs 5a and e and figs s5c and d in the tpc sulfurimonas and thiobacillus were still significant which should result from their high abundance during biofilm culturing actually they did not play the role of autotrophic denitrification during phase ii this was supported by the higher nh4 n removal fig s5b and higher effluent no3 n than influent no3 n fig 5b in the tpc thermomonas weisener et al 2017 for conversions of n2o to n2 and rhizobium herridge et al 2008 for conversions of n2 to nh4 have abundances of 13 04 and 17 91 at outlet 1 of the ypc much higher than those of 2 11 and 3 15 at outlet 1 of the tpc respectively this also supported that ypad occurred but tpad did not 4 discussion batch and column experiments of this study provides strong evidence that ypad occurred and tpad did not which was supported by the shift of the microbial communities in the ypc and tpc it is observed for the first time that the contradictory pad results occurred for two natural pyrites with different properties in the same study inconsistent experimental and analytical protocols may cause the contradictory results of pad yan et al 2021 however all experiments of ypad and tpad were conducted side by side therefore the contradictory results of the ypad and tpad could only be attributed to the different properties of yp and tp previous conclusion of existence or non existence of pad were only one sided because those conclusions were based on one kind of pyrite natural pyrite may contain impurities such as sulfur and pyrrhotite which have higher activity for sulfur autotropic denitrification thus nitrate removal based on autotrophic denitrification of those impurities may be misinterpreted as the action of pad yan et al 2019 however in the xrd spectra of both yp and tp no peaks of those impurities indicate that the contents of those impurities are very small therefore in this study the effects of impurities in pyrite on nitrate removal were negligible surficial impurities such as oxides produced during pyrite sample preparation reduced sulfur formed during bacteria culture and do in influent caused by not strictly anaerobic conditions may interfere interpretation of pad results yan et al 2021 in this study batch and column experiments indirectly indicated that there were surficial oxides rrs on surface of pyrite and small do in influent not strictly anaerobic condition but they did not change autotrophic denitrification characteristic of the pyrite itself at last this is beneficial for pad to be used in nitrate removal from water practically because it is difficult to remove all oxides and rrs on surface of pyrite and keep strict anaerobic condition in engineering application in natural pyrite crystals the atomic ratio of s fe is usually not equal to 2 namely sulfur or iron vacancies often exist in pyrite sulfur vacancies form sulfur monomer species and provide active sites for the oxidation of pyrite andersson et al 2004 and iron vacancy sites are more electron acceptor like defect sites krishnamoorthy et al 2013 the atomic ratios of s fe were 1 93 and 2 05 tables s1 in yp and tp respectively this indicates that low concentrations of sulfur vacancies exist in the yp and iron vacancies in the tp therefore yp with sulfur vacancies seems to be more beneficial for pad than tp with iron vacancies however the atomic ratio of s fe of pyrite is 1 94 in yan s study yan et al 2019 which did not find the occurrence of pad and bosch 2012b found that pad occurred for pyrite with an atomic ratio of s fe of 2 02 therefore the effects of the atomic ratio of s fe on pad are unclear crystallinity such as the structural differences between framboidal and highly ordered pyrite crystals bosch et al 2012a was considered a decisive parameter for the pad those studies supporting the nonexistence of the pad concluded that crystalline pyrite could not drive the pad but many studies found that crystalline pyrite could in this study both yp and tp are highly pure crystalline pyrite with nearly the same xrd spectra the framboidal pyrite consists of spherical or subspherical clusters of submicron to micron sized pyrite crystals itabashi et al 2019 according to fig 1b yp obviously does not have the typical framboidal features therefore the occurrence of ypad did not support that crystallinity is the decisive parameter for pad particle size was considered another decisive parameter for the pad bosch et al 2012 bosch et al 2012a found that pyrite nanoparticles were oxidized and that large crystals of the same pyrite did not however using pyrite with visible nanoparticles on its surface as the electron donor yan et al 2019 still did not exhibit pad the yp is made of 10 20 μm monomer particles fig 1b but those monomer particles tightly bond together therefore the practical particle size of yp should be close to its apparent particle size the average yp oxidation rate in the ypb apparent particle size 250 830 μm was approximately 3 6 μm h 1 no3 which was between the 10 1 and 2 0 μm h 1 no3 obtained by bosch et al 2012a and torrento et al 2010 with pyrite particle sizes of 0 75 2 63 and 25 100 μm respectively therefore the particle size could affect the rate of the pad as shown by tong et al 2018 but it could not be the decisive parameter for the pad yp is polycrystal and made of 10 20 μm monomer particles thus yp would mainly fracture along the interface of monomer particles when broken as shown in fig 1b fig 2e shows that the dominant crystal planes exposed would be 110 and 111 for the yp tp is monocrystal and it would mainly fracture along the crystal planes with low surface energy when broken the dominant crystal planes exposed would be 100 for the tp those were supported by yp particles without a major shape and tp particles with a main cubic shape fig s2 previous studies indicated that the order of surface energy of pyrite crystal planes is 100 110 111 kitchaev and ceder 2016 and that of the overall reaction rate for both abiotic and biological aerobic oxidation was 100 110 111 ndlovua et al 2005 feng et al 2019 crystal plane 111 shows 10 100 times faster oxidation than 100 in chemical reactions zhu et al 2018 the effects of pyrite crystal planes on pad have never been studied before but it is rational to deduce that the order of reaction rate of pyrite crystal planes for pad is 100 110 111 therefore the reaction rate of ypad was much faster than that of tpad according to xps spectra of pristine yp and tp surficial sulfur and iron elements of yp had lower oxidation state than those of tp this means that yp is easier to be oxidized than tp xps spectra of reacted yp and tp fig s8 and table s4 show that species of fe ii and fe iii are 0 and 100 for reacted yp and 31 09 and 68 91 for reacted tp respectively species of s2 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 are 47 37 9 83 and 42 80 for the reacted yp respectively and s2 2 s2o3 2 and sn 2 are 98 77 0 87 and 3 07 for the reacted tp respectively relative to pristine yp fe ii and s2 disappeared and s2 2 significantly decreased and fe iii s2o3 2 and so4 2 increased greatly on the surface of reacted yp indicating oxidations of both elements s and fe happened on the surface of yp however relative to pristine tp s2 disappeared small amounts of new species sn 2 and s2o3 2 occurred but s2 2 increased fe ii significantly decreased and fe iii increased on the reacted tp indicating that species s2 and fe ii were oxidized but s2 2 was not on the surface of tp the species of s2o3 2 on the reacted yp was over 10 times more than that on the reacted tp and no species of so4 2 was observed on the reacted tp therefore the reactivity of pad could depend on whether the surface s2 2 of pyrite can be microbially oxidized by no3 which is in agreement with the fact that pad appears to be induced via s oxidation but not via fe oxidation yan et al 2019 previous study thought that there are two enzymatic pathways sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and sulfur oxidation sox for sulfide oxidation under nitrate reducing conditions poser et al 2014 and in the sqr pathway a series of intermediates form such as s0 and s2o3 2 but in the sox pathway no intermediates are generated during oxidation to sulfate t denitrificans predominantly uses the sqr pathway for oxidizing sulfide to sulfate under denitrifying conditions beller et al 2006 much more abundance of thiobacillus in the ypc than in the tpc and much more s2o3 2 species on the reacted yp than on the reacted tp in this study also indirectly supported that yp could drive autotrophic denitrification but tp can t 5 conclusions two kinds of natural pyrite yp and tp were studied for the pad in parallel both yp and tp are highly pure crystalline pyrite but yp is polycrystal pyrite with sulfur vacancy smaller monomer particle size mainly crystal plane 110 and 111 exposed and lower oxidation state of sulfur and iron elements and tp is monocrystal pyrite with iron vacancy bigger

microbial communities were dominated by thiobacillus 24 55 8 67 and flavobacterium 21 11 10 59 in yp and tp column reactors respectively among these mineral properties mainly crystal plane exposed and

15751,green walls can provide an aesthetic approach to treat domestic greywater in urban landscapes however the widespread adoption of green walls for greywater treatment depends on its performance to remove the emerging contaminants from greywater such as xenobiotic organic compounds xocs in this study the performance of five lightweight green wall media types zeolite perlite date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir was evaluated for the removal of six xocs representing a range of hydrophilic to hydrophobic organic micropollutants in domestic greywater acetaminophen diethyltoluamide bisphenol a oxybenzone triclosan nonylphenol the adsorption affinity of targeted xocs on different green wall media types the role of contact time on xocs removal and the impact of background pollutants in greywater matrix on the adsorption of xocs were analysed results indicate that removal of xocs was higher using carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite moreover the adsorption of xocs increased with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity all xocs showed highest removal using coco coir with fast adsorption kinetics achieving 90 of the removal in 30 min the only exception was acetaminophen that showed best removal using zeolite but exhibited slow adsorption kinetics with 90 of the removal attained in 24 h the initial adsorption kinetics 30 min of xocs in greywater were adversely affected by the presence of background pollutants indicating the need of higher residence time of greywater in green wall system for better removal of xocs based on the findings of this batch study it is recommended to design a green wall system with more than 30 min of greywater residence time using a mixture of coco coir and zeolite for effective removal of xocs from domestic greywater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords living wall nature based solution graywater natural media micropollutants 1 introduction the scarcity of water is a global apprehension as two third population of the world is projected to suffer from clean water unavailability by 2025 eliasson 2015 the sustainable management and reuse of existing water resources such as greywater can be one of the potential solutions to overcome the existing and approaching water crises greywater represents up to 75 of household wastewater that is free from toilet waste ghaitidak and yadav 2013 it may account for daily volume of up to 120 litters per person in developed countries morel and diener 2006 therefore the appropriate treatment of such large volume of greywater can provide a reliable source of water greywater is produced consistently for non potable usage with an additional advantage of easing the strain on existing sewage system by reducing the wastewater volume greywater requires prior treatment if the reuse is planned as it is a source of many contaminants such as pathogens nutrients heavy metals but also xenobiotic organic compounds xocs noman et al 2019 xocs are complex aromatic compounds that are found in greywater due to extensive use of household chemicals such as cleaning agents dyes detergents and personal care products the study conducted by eriksson et al 2002 stated the possibility of over 900 xocs originated from commonly used household chemicals their concentration in domestic greywater is highly variable i e ranged between pg l to mg l depending upon the geographical location and lifestyles of occupants with mean concentrations of surfactants and personal care products preservatives uv filters flavors and fragrances are found to be higher 1 20 µg l than pharmaceuticals and antibiotics 0 01 0 4 µg l glover et al 2021 the toxicological risk assessment conducted by glover et al 2021 classified 98 xocs in domestic greywater as high risk for aquatic environment many of these xocs are associated with an increase in antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic efficacy of antibiotic drugs alderton et al 2021 thus also affecting human health moreover many xocs in greywater possess endocrine disrupting properties e g bisphenol a triclosan nonylphenol and their chronic exposure may lead to serious human health issues olaniyan et al 2016 werkneh et al 2022 this represents significant risk in new urban farming movements that aim to reuse domestic greywater rich with nutrients for at source crop production meharg 2016 therefore high risk xocs should be removed from greywater prior to reuse to reduce the associated ecological and health risks the suitable method for greywater treatment is determined by its reuse guidelines scale of system and associated cost unfortunately the regulatory standards for greywater reuse e g land scape irrigation toilet flushing food production etc do not have prescribed guidelines about most xocs but include parameters like suspended solids nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod pathogens and e coli de gisi et al 2016 a review of greywater treatment technologies in urban residential buildings suggested membrane bioreactor as suitable method to attain satisfactory removal of organics surfactants and microbial contaminants without involving post treatment steps de gisi et al 2016 however high operational and maintenance cost majorly associated with membrane fouling is impeding the widespread adoption of membrane bioreactors for domestic greywater treatment ho et al 2015 greywater treatment using aerobic sequencing batch reactor followed by adsorption on activated carbon showed excellent removal of targeted xocs i e uv filters preservatives fragrances and personal care products leal et al 2011 2010 however the high cost of activated carbon shukla et al 2020 difficulty of its regeneration and environmental concerns of its disposal omorogie et al 2016 are making its use less favourable compared to more sustainable options the use of nature based processes and systems such as constructed wetlands biofilters and green walls can provide more cost effective and environmentally friendly solution for greywater treatment boano et al 2019 amongst these technologies green walls are regarded as highly suitable for densely populated areas due to their vertical arrangement and direct attachment to walls requiring low area footprint addo bankas et al 2021 their on site usage for greywater treatment might not only help in fulfilling their substantial water demands i e 0 5 20 l m2 day depi 2014 prodanovic et al 2019b but might also offset cost of green wall system by providing reliable source of water for non potable applications e g land scape irrigation toilet flushing food production etc despite being an attractive option for urban landscapes there are limited studies on green walls for greywater treatment and none of them explored the potential for the removal of xocs therefore findings from studies that focused on xocs removal in other types of nature based systems have been reviewed to form hypothesis on their behaviour in green walls several constructed wetland studies found that media plays a major role in facilitating the removal process of xocs dordio and carvalho 2013 therefore media should be carefully selected based on targeted xocs properties e g hydrophobicity molecular structure charge physiochemical interactions and operational conditions e g retention time concentration ph dordio and carvalho 2013 garcía et al 2020 however commonly used media types in biofilters and constructed wetlands sand gravel course rock are not suitable for green walls due to their higher weight because of their vertical arrangement and direct attachment to buildings green walls require lightweight media to avoid higher load on support structure several lightweight media types such as perlite coco coir date seeds and coffee grinds have been tested for the removal of tss nutrients cod and e coli from greywater bakheet et al 2020 pradhan et al 2020 2019 prodanovic et al 2020 2019b 2019a 2018 2017 however their potential to remove xocs is not yet explored despite greywater being a known source of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic xocs noman et al 2019 pradhan et al 2019 tested coco coir in vegetated column for greywater treatment and reported higher removal of hydrophobic pollutants as compared to hydrophilic pollutants however the findings were generic no information about xocs was provided and interpreted based on the removal of total organics mg l that does not truly represent the removal of concerned xocs ng l µg l in greywater biochar amendment in substrates of biofilters and constructed wetlands revealed promising prospects for the removal of hazardous xocs from stormwater wastewater lu and chen 2018 tang et al 2016 however sustainability concerns related to biochar production higher cost of its regeneration and lack of understanding about its long term stability deng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 present significant drawbacks for its practical use in commercial green wall systems the suitability of different hydroponic media types i e mineral wool pumice wood fibre and coconut fibre for constructed wetlands was tested in lab scale batch study for the removal of pharmaceuticals sithamparanathan et al 2021 findings demonstrated higher removal performance of organic media types i e wood fibre and coconut fibre regardless of pollutant hydrophobicity this contrasts with the findings of other adsorption studies related to xocs removal in constructed wetlands that showed higher sorption affinity of media for hydrophobic pollutants dordio and carvalho 2013 this implies the need to analyse the adsorption affinity of different light weight media types for the removal of hydrophilic to hydrophobic xocs in greywater the selection of suitable light weight media for green walls is highly dependant on the adsorption kinetics of xocs as green walls are designed for short retention of greywater greywater is generated continuously media types that offer fast adsorption kinetics of xocs would be preferable moreover the adsorption kinetics of xocs using different media types may be influenced by the presence of background pollutants organics inorganics nutrients suspended solids etc that are different for each type of water matrix the background pollutants can hinder the adsorption of xocs by competing for the adsorption sites and blocking the pore entrance of the media bonvin et al 2016 li et al 2003 although background organic matter in wastewater effluent adversely affected the adsorption capacity and kinetics of micropollutants on activated carbon hu et al 2016 zietzschmann et al 2014 no study explored the impact of background pollutants in greywater on the removal of xocs using lightweight green wall media it can be concluded that to date there has been no research on how sustainable lightweight media used in green walls and other similar technologies can adsorb xocs from greywater this study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the performance of a range of lightweight green wall media for the removal of selected xocs hydrophilic to hydrophobic found in greywater specific objectives of this study are to i quantify the xocs adsorption potential of lightweight green wall media ii investigate the adsorption kinetics of hydrophilic to hydrophobic xocs and iii understand the impact of background greywater pollutants on the removal of xocs to our knowledge this is the first study that makes practical recommendations for green wall media selection for effective removal of xocs which we believe could lead to wider use of this attractive technology for water treatment in our cities 2 materials and methods 2 1 media selection and characterization in this study five lightweight green wall media types were tested including two natural minerals zeolite and perlite and three carbonaceous waste materials date seeds spent coffee grinds and coco coir the selection of media was based on their suitability for green walls in terms of being light weight 1 g cm3 low cost and healthy growth substrate for plants natural zeolite clinoptilolite was selected based on its high surface area 100 m2 g with regular porous structure that may offer favourable surface morphology for xocs adsorption wang et al 2020 perlite and coco coir are commonly used plant growth substrates and were selected based on their proven suitability in green wall system for removing greywater nutrients cod and e coli prodanovic et al 2020 2019a 2019b 2018 date seeds and spent coffee grinds were selected as potential waste materials to replace perlite and coco coir in green wall system for greywater treatment pradhan et al 2020 2019 all media types were washed with di water and oven dried at 105 ºc for two days to obtain the dry mass of media pradhan et al 2019 the flow dynamics and pollutant removal in green walls are majorly linked with physical characteristics of media e g particle size surface area surface morphology in this study both smaller and larger particle size media were tested the coarser media types zeolite perlite and date seeds were sieved to get larger particle size 2 36 mm 4 75 mm and finer media types coco coir and coffee grinds were sieved to get smaller particle size 0 075 mm 0 6 mm table 1 the selected media types have low bulk density value 0 09 0 76 g cm3 which is desirable to reduce the weight of green wall system the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of dried media gently packed into the known volume container the surface area was analysed with brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area analyser novatouch nt 4lx quantachrome instruments using nitrogen gas the samples were degassed at 105 ºc for 16 h before analysis to understand the surface morphology high resolution images of all media types were taken using hitachi tm4000plus benchtop scanning electron microscope sem fig 1 before performing the sem air dried samples of media were attached to carbon tape and ultra thin layer of gold 10 nm was applied using sputter coating to increase the sample conductivity 2 2 batch experiment design batch experiments were performed to compare the performance of selected lightweight green wall media types for the removal of six xocs that are associated with commonly used household products covering the range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic pollutants these xocs included acetaminophen act analgesic as a hydrophilic pollutant diethyltoluamide deet insect repellent and bisphenol a bpa plasticizer as low solubility pollutant while oxybenzone oxy uv filter triclosan tcs antimicrobial agent and nonylphenol np non ionic surfactant were representative of hydrophobic pollutants the physio chemical properties of selected xocs household usage and concentration range in greywater are summarized in table 2 five different concentrations 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l of xocs were used in this study the concentrations between 1 and 50 µg l were chosen to cover both average and maximum detected concentrations of selected xocs in greywater table 2 while 250 µg l was selected to represent rare events of very high concentration of some xocs detected in greywater eriksson et al 2003 zraunig et al 2019 a stock solution of xocs 1 g l in methanol was prepared using analytical grade chemicals purity 97 and stored at 20 c in amber vials to avoid photodegradation the desired concentration of xocs was then achieved by diluting the stock solution in water matrix two types of water matrix were tested in this study i mixture of xocs spiked in deionized water dixoc and ii mixture of xocs spiked in synthetic greywater sgwxoc the sgwxoc was prepared by following the protocol stated by diaper et al 2008 that is used in several studied related to greywater treatment bakheet et al 2020 fowdar et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2018 the composition of sgwxoc table s1 and its quality parameters table s2 are provided in supplementary information the batch experiments were conducted using amber vials 40 ml to avoid photodegradation mathon et al 2019 for each vial 0 5 g of media dry mass was added into 25 ml water matrix the vials were rotated at 30 rpm using rotary wheel this rotational speed was selected to keep media suspended in water matrix with minimum impact of media collisions with vial surfaces to analyse the residual concentration of xocs in water matrix at different time intervals 0 45 ml of sample volume from each vial was transferred to low protein binding micro centrifuge tubes and spiked with 0 05 ml of isotope labelled internal standard solution the known concentrations of targeted xocs in spiked internal standard solution help to correct any variability in xocs concentration that may occur between sample collection and analysis dolan 2012 to separate any solid particles from water matrix the micro centrifuge tubes were rotated at 4000 rpm for 10 min after centrifuge the liquid samples 0 4 ml were extracted using syringe needle and filtered by polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane syringe filter with pore size of 0 22 µm the filtered samples were transferred to amber autosampler vials and stored at 4 c until their xocs concentration was analysed the experiments were performed in two phases in the first phase five different initial concentrations of xocs 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l were spiked in di water dixoc and their residual concentrations were analysed at 3 min 8 min 15 min 30 min 90 min and 1440 min by using all media types additional samples at 480 min 2880 min and 4320 min were taken for act as its residual concentration from dixoc kept on decreasing till 1440 min the difference between initial and residual concentration is used to calculate the amount of xocs adsorb by media during different time intervals to keep total extracted volume for sampling less than 10 for all experiments two identical sets of vials were used i e i the first set to extract samples at 3 min 8 min 15 min and 30 min and ii the second set to extract samples at 90 min 480 min 1440 min 2880 min and 4320 min the residual concentration of all xocs in dixoc reached near equilibrium condition 5 change in concentration after 1440 min therefore time duration of 1440 min was considered to quantify xocs adsorption potential of different media types in second phase the effect of water matrix on the adsorption performance of different media types was analysed by comparing the removal of xocs from dixoc and sgwxoc the initial concentration of xocs in dixoc and sgwxoc was set at 5 µg l representative value of average concentration of selected xocs in domestic greywater table 2 and removal of xocs was analysed at 8 min 30 min and 1440 min these time intervals for sampling were considered based on adsorption kinetics study from first phase all experiments were run in triplicate and two types of controls i e i dixoc and sgwxoc without media to test the decline in xocs concentration with time and ii media in di water without xocs to test the leaching of pollutants by different media types 2 3 water quality analysis the concentration of xocs in each sample was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms the xocs were chromatographically separated by using 1200 series agilent hplc that is fitted with 5 μm particle size reverse phase c18 column the hplc was coupled with sciex api 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that used electrospray ionization technique to identify and quantify the xocs the mobile phase was the binary gradient of 5 mm ammonium acetate in water and pure methanol with a flow rate of 800 µl min the hplc instrument extracted 10 µl from each sample vial for analysis the calibration curve was created using at least five relative response ratios of analyte internal standard between concentration range of 1 500 µg l the calibration curve for all the analysed xocs corresponds to a linearity coefficient greater than 0 99 that represents the consistency and accuracy of analysis over the wider range of analyte concentration for quality assurance in terms of no carryover between samples each batch of samples was run with di water blank samples results indicated 10 carryover for tcs and np at initial concentration higher than 10 µg l therefore two di blanks were run between each sample analysis while analysing higher concentrations of tcs and np the concentration of tcs and np was below the detection limit 10 ng l in the second blank sample confirming no carryover to the next analysed sample 2 4 data fitting and statistical analysis the percentage removal of xocs was calculated as 1 percentage removal q o q t q o x 100 where qo is the initial concentration µg l and qt is the residual concentration µg l of xocs at any time interval in water matrix the experimental data collected at 1440 min equilibrium residual concentrations of xocs in dixoc for five different concentrations of xocs 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l was fitted to freundlich isotherm eq 2 that is well suited to describe the heterogeneity of adsorbent surface at environmental relevant concentrations ng l to µg l of micropollutants 2 q e k f c e 1 n where qe represents the amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent at equilibrium µg g and ce represents the concentration of pollutant in solution at equilibrium µg l kf is fredluich constant and its higher value represents better adsorption affinity 1 n is reaction intensity index and its value between 0 and 1 represents favourable adsorption with values close to 1 describe heterogeneity of the adsorbate sites foo and hameed 2010 moreover 1 n value help to understand fredluich isotherm curves with lower values are indicative of l shaped curve representing saturation of media at higher equilibrium concentration of pollutant and higher values are indicative of c shaped curve representing linear increase in adsorption capacity with increase in equilibrium concentration limousin et al 2007 the representative shapes of different isotherm curves figure s1 are provided in supplementary information to analyse adsorption performance over time and understand rate limiting steps during adsorption process the removal of xocs at different time intervals was analysed using pseudo first order pfo rate equation eq 3 pseudo second order pso rate equation eq 4 and intraparticle diffusion idp equation eq 5 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 t q e k 2 t 1 5 q t k 3 t 0 5 where qe and qt represent the amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 1 min k2 g µg min and k3 µg g min0 5 are the adsorption kinetic constant for pfo pso and ipd equations respectively moussout et al 2018 wu et al 2009 in idp equation eq 5 a plot of qt versus t0 5 should pass through origin to indicate intraparticle diffusion as the only rate limiting step in the adsorption process however if intraparticle diffusion model fits data linearly in multiple zones the adsorption process is controlled by more than one rate limiting steps wu et al 2009 the experimental data of xocs removal rate with initial concentration of 50 µg l was used in pfo pso and idp equations this initial concentration was selected to represent maximum detected concentration of targeted xocs in domestic greywater table 2 moreover this initial concentration resulted in reasonable data points 5 for curve fitting before residual concentration of xocs decrease below the detection limit the goodness of fit for experimental data was accessed using r2 values that were calculated as 6 r 2 q c a l q e x p 2 q cal q e x p 2 q c a l q e x p 2 where q c a l is the model predicted amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g q e x p is the experimental amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g and q e is the average of q e x p the r2 values closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the experimental data to the considered equation a simple t test was used to statistically compare the pollutant removal performance of two media while the pollutant removal by media involving two independent variables i e time and concentration was statistically analysed with 2 way anova all data was analysed at significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 xocs removal by different media types all xocs in dixoc without media control showed small difference in concentration 6 during 24 hour time interval figure s2 supplementary information indicating minimal photodegradation or attachment of pollutants with vial surface moreover xocs were not detected in di water containing media only control confirming no leaching of pollutants by different media types the maximum removal of xocs achieved at equilibrium 24 hours time interval was significantly higher using carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite p 0 05 and showed increasing removal trend with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity fig 2 the only exception was the high removal 80 of polar hydrophilic act using zeolite possibly due to high surface area of zeolite 125 m2 g table 1 with large number of well structured micropores fig 1 a and its high affinity for adsorbing polar molecules snelgrove 2017 another possible reason could be the lowest value of minimum projection radius 3 49 aº of act amongst the studied xocs table 2 that can enter the clinoptilolite framework of zeolite used in this study ambrozova et al 2017 margeta et al 2013 the removal of deet remained low 40 by using all media types which can be attributed to its lower adsorption affinity for media and previous findings that biodegradation might be a dominant mechanism of its removal greenstein et al 2018 sui et al 2010 yang et al 2011 bpa was moderately removed 40 80 while hydrophobic pollutants oxy tcs and np showed good removal 80 using carbonaceous waste materials with coffee grinds and coco coir were the best performing media types both showing statistically similar removal performance p 0 05 this was expected as both coffee grinds and coco coir have large number of favourable adsorptions sites due to their highly porous surface with rough interstices fig 1 d and e the removal of hydrophobic xocs oxy tcs and np using natural minerals zeolite and perlite remained low 25 except for np which showed moderate removal 40 using zeolite this might be associated with np s dissociation constant pk a 10 3 that is much higher than the ph of zeolite ph 7 8 resulting in neutral charge on np in contrast oxy pk a 7 07 and tcs pk a 7 68 may deprotonate to form anionic species resulting in electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged zeolite surface kodešová et al 2015 most xocs showed similar removal performance under varying initial concentrations i e 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l p 0 05 fig 3 indicating large number of available adsorption sites for pollutant attachment few exceptions include significantly lower removal of act bpa and np using zeolite at higher initial concentrations 50 µg l and 250 µg l as compared to lower initial concentration 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l p 0 05 suggesting saturation of favourable adsorption sites on zeolite surface the removal of xocs showed good fit to freundlich isotherm model r2 0 93 table s3 supplementary information all xocs showed favourable absorption on heterogeneous surface of media 1 n 1 table s4 supplementary information with higher adsorption affinity for carbonaceous waste materials i e date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir higher kf values as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite table s4 supplementary information moreover the freundlich isotherm followed c shaped curves fig 4 b f representing typical case of linear increase in adsorption capacity with the increase in equilibrium concentration of pollutants the only exception was act that showed higher adsorption affinity for zeolite higher kf value table s4 supplementary information but experienced l shaped curve fig 4 a indicating saturation of media at higher equilibrium concentration of pollutant limousin et al 2007 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of act fig 5 a showed inconsistent results with poor removal 20 using most media types the exception was zeolite which showed significant decrease in residual concentration with time p 0 05 reaching minimum concentration at 1440 min ct c0 0 17 the adsorption rate was slow with more than 90 min required to reach moderate removal 40 followed by much slower adsorption rate with more than 1440 min required to achieve over 80 removal the data showed goodness of fit r2 0 99 for both pfo and pso rate equations table s5 supplementary information indicating that simultaneous contribution of multiple interactions physical or chemical could be involved in the adsorption process coimbra 2018 lima et al 2019 villaescusa et al 2011 moreover the multilinear data fitting by the intraparticle diffusion model fig 6 suggesting more than one rate limiting step involved in the adsorption process wu et al 2009 the steeper line zone i represents the film diffusion of act from bulk solution to the zeolite surface followed by less steep line zone ii that refers to intraparticle diffusion of act into the internal pores of zeolite several studies have stated similar observations of having multilinear data fit of act on different absorbents lladó et al 2015 quesada et al 2019 wong et al 2017 the adsorption kinetics of deet mostly remained inconsistent with overall low removal 40 using all media types fig 5 b the possible reason could be unfavourable structural properties of deet with lower count of hydrogen bond doner acceptor table s6 supplementary information limiting its ability to form h bonding with functional groups i e cooh oh involved in surface chemistry of different media mitra et al 2021 tong et al 2019 bpa showed steep decline in residual concentration 60 removal during initial 15 min of contact with coffee grinds and coco coir fig 5 c possibly due to large number of readily available adsorption sites wirasnita and hadibarata 2014 these adsorption sites were reduced with time resulting in much slower adsorption kinetics between 15 min to 90 min 20 removal with no significant difference in concentration afterwards p 0 05 the adsorption kinetics data showed better fit r2 0 96 to pso rate equations suggesting surface reaction controlled adsorption with π π interactions due to the availability of two benzine rings with an oh group in bpa structure might be the major facilitator in the adsorption process mitra et al 2021 hydrophobic xocs oxy trc and np experienced rapid decline in residual concentration 90 removal during initial 15 min of contact with coffee grinds and coco coir with no significant difference in concentration afterwards p 0 05 fig 5 d f the possible reason of steep decline could be lower resistance experienced by hydrophobic xocs while transporting from bulk aqueous solution to media surface tong et al 2019 the decline in residual concentration ct c0 was less steep using date seeds with major part of removal 60 was achieved in 15 min additional 20 between 15 min to 90 min after which no significant change was experienced p 0 05 the slower adsorption kinetics using date seeds is possibly due to smother surface morphology with larger pores fig 1 c as compared to coffee grinds fig 1 d and coco coir fig 1 e resulting in lower surface area table 1 and less adsorption sites for pollutant attachment the adsorption kinetics data showed goodness of fit r2 0 98 for both pfo and pso rate equations table s5 supplementary information suggesting several kinds of surface interactions i e π π interaction h bonding and hydrophobic interactions could be involved in the adsorption process sophia a and lima 2018 the pfo and pso rate constants table s5 supplementary information for the adsorption of all xocs on carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir corelate well with hydrophobicity of xocs with significantly higher values were experienced for the adsorption of hydrophobic xocs oxy tcs and np p 0 05 indicating hydrophobic interactions may be the dominant mechanism in the adsorption of xocs on carbonaceous media tong et al 2019 most xocs experienced no significant change in concentration using natural minerals zeolite and perlite during different time intervals p 0 05 fig 5 b f the only exception was np that showed slow but continuous removal with time to reach around 20 and 40 removal at 1440 min using perlite and zeolite respectively fig 5 f the comparatively better adsorption kinetics of np using zeolite might be attributed to its higher adsorption affinity logkow and dissociation constant pk a table 1 covered in the earlier discussion section 3 1 3 3 impact of background greywater pollutants on the removal of xocs all xocs in sgwxoc without media control experienced small decline in concentration 20 figure s3 supplementary information possibly due to retention of xocs by background pollutants i e organics inorganics nutrients suspended solids schäfer et al 2006 the removal of act using zeolite was significantly lower in sgwxoc as compared to dixoc p 0 05 fig 7 a this suggests that the presence of background pollutants in sgwxoc adversely affected the adsorption of act on zeolite since the removal mechanism is both through film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the background pollutants could have either competed with act for the intraparticle diffusion diffusion within the pores or covered the zeolite surface to reduce the active sites for the act adsorption quesada et al 2019 however small pore openings on zeolite surface may not allow major fraction of background pollutants to enter and compete for the intraparticle diffusion hung and lin 2006 therefore reduction in active adsorption sites on the zeolite surface due to coverage by background pollutants may be the major contributing factor in lower adsorption of act from sgwxoc the removal of deet from sgwxoc was lower as compared to dixoc but not significantly different p 0 05 fig 7 b the insignificant impact on the removal of deet can be attributed to its existence as a week base pk a 0 93 ph 7 3 along with its conjugate cations that may interact with negatively charged organic matter present in sgwxoc offsetting the hinderance that background pollutants may offer in the adsorption of deet on media surface li et al 2021 bpa oxy tcs and np showed significantly lower removal from sgwxoc in comparison to dixoc during short contact time 8 min with all carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir p 0 05 fig 7 c f however no significant difference in removal was observed at 30 min and 1440 min p 0 05 the only exception was significant lower removal of tcs and np from sgwxoc using date seeds at 30 min this indicates that the presence of background pollutants in sgwxoc adversely affected the immediate adsorption kinetics 30 min by either competing for the adsorption site or blocking the pores on the surface of carbonaceous waste materials humbert et al 2008 however total adsorption capacity of carbonaceous waste materials was not affected as large number of adsorption sites were available for the removal of xocs in contrast the removal of np using zeolite was significantly lower in sgwxoc as compared to dixoc during all time intervals p 0 05 fig 7 f indicating that both adsorption capacity and kinetics were adversely affected by the presence of background pollutants that may cover the zeolite surface resulting in lower adsorption sites for np attachment 3 4 practical implications for green wall design date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir were identified as promising green wall media types to remove most of the targeted xocs from greywater however these media types are associated with some practical disadvantages that needs to be consider before their selection for green wall system date seeds are the heaviest amongst all tested media types table 1 and its use as a green wall media will increase the overall weight of green wall system moreover the availability of date seeds as a waste material is limited to specific regions i e egypt iran saudi arabia that may hinder its widespread adoption as green wall media coffee grinds and coco coir are very fine media types that are prone to clogging in green wall system resulting in lower volume of treated greywater prodanovic et al 2017 however mixing the coarser media type i e zeolite or perlite with finer media types i e coco coir or coffee grinds in volumetric proportion of 1 2 may improve the hydraulic performance along with better aeration in green wall system prodanovic et al 2018 amongst course media types zeolite is expected to perform much better due to its higher xocs adsorption and excellent removal for polar hydrophilic pollutant act that was not removed by any other media type for finer media types coco coir is the best option due to its excellent removal performance of most xocs and proven long term suitability in green wall system bakheet et al 2020 prodanovic et al 2020 2019a 2018 2017 therefore it is recommended to use mixture of zeolite with coco coir in 1 2 to remove both hydrophilic and hydrophobic xocs without compromising the hydraulic performance of green wall system however long term performance of this media mix for the removal of xocs needs to be explored in real green wall system while using media mix in green wall system the retention time of greywater should be selected to match the adsorption kinetics of targeted xocs based on the findings of this study designing green wall system with 30 min of retention time using recommended media mix mixture of zeolite with coffee grinds or coco coir can achieve more than 90 removal of hydrophobic xocs although this retention time may not be enough to achieve good adsorption 50 of hydrophilic xocs i e act it is expected that other removal pathways like biodegradation and phytoremediation in green wall system may help to improve the overall removal of such xocs from domestic greywater 4 conclusions this was the first study to investigate the performance of different light weight green wall media for the removal of xocs from domestic greywater two natural minerals zeolite and perlite and three carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir were tested for the removal of six carefully selected xocs that cover hydrophilic to hydrophobic range of pollutants in greywater results indicate that overall removal of xocs increased with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity and was better using carbonaceous waste materials as compared to natural minerals low solubility and hydrophobic xocs were best removed using coco coir while polar hydrophilic xoc showed excellent removed using zeolite therefore mixing zeolite with coco coir in green walls system can help to remove wider range of xocs from domestic greywater this study also explored the adsorption kinetics of xocs using different media types to provide practical implications for green wall design results showed that the adsorption kinetics of hydrophilic xoc using zeolite was much slower i e 90 removal after 24 h than the adsorption kinetics of hydrophobic xocs on coco coir i e 90 removal after 30 min moreover the presence of background pollutants in greywater adversely affected the initial adsorption kinetics 30 min of xocs by competing for the adsorption sites or blocking the pores on media surface therefore retention time of greywater in green wall system should be carefully selected to match the adsorption kinetics of targeted xocs the findings of this study will serve as a valuable

15751,green walls can provide an aesthetic approach to treat domestic greywater in urban landscapes however the widespread adoption of green walls for greywater treatment depends on its performance to remove the emerging contaminants from greywater such as xenobiotic organic compounds xocs in this study the performance of five lightweight green wall media types zeolite perlite date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir was evaluated for the removal of six xocs representing a range of hydrophilic to hydrophobic organic micropollutants in domestic greywater acetaminophen diethyltoluamide bisphenol a oxybenzone triclosan nonylphenol the adsorption affinity of targeted xocs on different green wall media types the role of contact time on xocs removal and the impact of background pollutants in greywater matrix on the adsorption of xocs were analysed results indicate that removal of xocs was higher using carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite moreover the adsorption of xocs increased with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity all xocs showed highest removal using coco coir with fast adsorption kinetics achieving 90 of the removal in 30 min the only exception was acetaminophen that showed best removal using zeolite but exhibited slow adsorption kinetics with 90 of the removal attained in 24 h the initial adsorption kinetics 30 min of xocs in greywater were adversely affected by the presence of background pollutants indicating the need of higher residence time of greywater in green wall system for better removal of xocs based on the findings of this batch study it is recommended to design a green wall system with more than 30 min of greywater residence time using a mixture of coco coir and zeolite for effective removal of xocs from domestic greywater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords living wall nature based solution graywater natural media micropollutants 1 introduction the scarcity of water is a global apprehension as two third population of the world is projected to suffer from clean water unavailability by 2025 eliasson 2015 the sustainable management and reuse of existing water resources such as greywater can be one of the potential solutions to overcome the existing and approaching water crises greywater represents up to 75 of household wastewater that is free from toilet waste ghaitidak and yadav 2013 it may account for daily volume of up to 120 litters per person in developed countries morel and diener 2006 therefore the appropriate treatment of such large volume of greywater can provide a reliable source of water greywater is produced consistently for non potable usage with an additional advantage of easing the strain on existing sewage system by reducing the wastewater volume greywater requires prior treatment if the reuse is planned as it is a source of many contaminants such as pathogens nutrients heavy metals but also xenobiotic organic compounds xocs noman et al 2019 xocs are complex aromatic compounds that are found in greywater due to extensive use of household chemicals such as cleaning agents dyes detergents and personal care products the study conducted by eriksson et al 2002 stated the possibility of over 900 xocs originated from commonly used household chemicals their concentration in domestic greywater is highly variable i e ranged between pg l to mg l depending upon the geographical location and lifestyles of occupants with mean concentrations of surfactants and personal care products preservatives uv filters flavors and fragrances are found to be higher 1 20 µg l than pharmaceuticals and antibiotics 0 01 0 4 µg l glover et al 2021 the toxicological risk assessment conducted by glover et al 2021 classified 98 xocs in domestic greywater as high risk for aquatic environment many of these xocs are associated with an increase in antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic efficacy of antibiotic drugs alderton et al 2021 thus also affecting human health moreover many xocs in greywater possess endocrine disrupting properties e g bisphenol a triclosan nonylphenol and their chronic exposure may lead to serious human health issues olaniyan et al 2016 werkneh et al 2022 this represents significant risk in new urban farming movements that aim to reuse domestic greywater rich with nutrients for at source crop production meharg 2016 therefore high risk xocs should be removed from greywater prior to reuse to reduce the associated ecological and health risks the suitable method for greywater treatment is determined by its reuse guidelines scale of system and associated cost unfortunately the regulatory standards for greywater reuse e g land scape irrigation toilet flushing food production etc do not have prescribed guidelines about most xocs but include parameters like suspended solids nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod pathogens and e coli de gisi et al 2016 a review of greywater treatment technologies in urban residential buildings suggested membrane bioreactor as suitable method to attain satisfactory removal of organics surfactants and microbial contaminants without involving post treatment steps de gisi et al 2016 however high operational and maintenance cost majorly associated with membrane fouling is impeding the widespread adoption of membrane bioreactors for domestic greywater treatment ho et al 2015 greywater treatment using aerobic sequencing batch reactor followed by adsorption on activated carbon showed excellent removal of targeted xocs i e uv filters preservatives fragrances and personal care products leal et al 2011 2010 however the high cost of activated carbon shukla et al 2020 difficulty of its regeneration and environmental concerns of its disposal omorogie et al 2016 are making its use less favourable compared to more sustainable options the use of nature based processes and systems such as constructed wetlands biofilters and green walls can provide more cost effective and environmentally friendly solution for greywater treatment boano et al 2019 amongst these technologies green walls are regarded as highly suitable for densely populated areas due to their vertical arrangement and direct attachment to walls requiring low area footprint addo bankas et al 2021 their on site usage for greywater treatment might not only help in fulfilling their substantial water demands i e 0 5 20 l m2 day depi 2014 prodanovic et al 2019b but might also offset cost of green wall system by providing reliable source of water for non potable applications e g land scape irrigation toilet flushing food production etc despite being an attractive option for urban landscapes there are limited studies on green walls for greywater treatment and none of them explored the potential for the removal of xocs therefore findings from studies that focused on xocs removal in other types of nature based systems have been reviewed to form hypothesis on their behaviour in green walls several constructed wetland studies found that media plays a major role in facilitating the removal process of xocs dordio and carvalho 2013 therefore media should be carefully selected based on targeted xocs properties e g hydrophobicity molecular structure charge physiochemical interactions and operational conditions e g retention time concentration ph dordio and carvalho 2013 garcía et al 2020 however commonly used media types in biofilters and constructed wetlands sand gravel course rock are not suitable for green walls due to their higher weight because of their vertical arrangement and direct attachment to buildings green walls require lightweight media to avoid higher load on support structure several lightweight media types such as perlite coco coir date seeds and coffee grinds have been tested for the removal of tss nutrients cod and e coli from greywater bakheet et al 2020 pradhan et al 2020 2019 prodanovic et al 2020 2019b 2019a 2018 2017 however their potential to remove xocs is not yet explored despite greywater being a known source of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic xocs noman et al 2019 pradhan et al 2019 tested coco coir in vegetated column for greywater treatment and reported higher removal of hydrophobic pollutants as compared to hydrophilic pollutants however the findings were generic no information about xocs was provided and interpreted based on the removal of total organics mg l that does not truly represent the removal of concerned xocs ng l µg l in greywater biochar amendment in substrates of biofilters and constructed wetlands revealed promising prospects for the removal of hazardous xocs from stormwater wastewater lu and chen 2018 tang et al 2016 however sustainability concerns related to biochar production higher cost of its regeneration and lack of understanding about its long term stability deng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 present significant drawbacks for its practical use in commercial green wall systems the suitability of different hydroponic media types i e mineral wool pumice wood fibre and coconut fibre for constructed wetlands was tested in lab scale batch study for the removal of pharmaceuticals sithamparanathan et al 2021 findings demonstrated higher removal performance of organic media types i e wood fibre and coconut fibre regardless of pollutant hydrophobicity this contrasts with the findings of other adsorption studies related to xocs removal in constructed wetlands that showed higher sorption affinity of media for hydrophobic pollutants dordio and carvalho 2013 this implies the need to analyse the adsorption affinity of different light weight media types for the removal of hydrophilic to hydrophobic xocs in greywater the selection of suitable light weight media for green walls is highly dependant on the adsorption kinetics of xocs as green walls are designed for short retention of greywater greywater is generated continuously media types that offer fast adsorption kinetics of xocs would be preferable moreover the adsorption kinetics of xocs using different media types may be influenced by the presence of background pollutants organics inorganics nutrients suspended solids etc that are different for each type of water matrix the background pollutants can hinder the adsorption of xocs by competing for the adsorption sites and blocking the pore entrance of the media bonvin et al 2016 li et al 2003 although background organic matter in wastewater effluent adversely affected the adsorption capacity and kinetics of micropollutants on activated carbon hu et al 2016 zietzschmann et al 2014 no study explored the impact of background pollutants in greywater on the removal of xocs using lightweight green wall media it can be concluded that to date there has been no research on how sustainable lightweight media used in green walls and other similar technologies can adsorb xocs from greywater this study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the performance of a range of lightweight green wall media for the removal of selected xocs hydrophilic to hydrophobic found in greywater specific objectives of this study are to i quantify the xocs adsorption potential of lightweight green wall media ii investigate the adsorption kinetics of hydrophilic to hydrophobic xocs and iii understand the impact of background greywater pollutants on the removal of xocs to our knowledge this is the first study that makes practical recommendations for green wall media selection for effective removal of xocs which we believe could lead to wider use of this attractive technology for water treatment in our cities 2 materials and methods 2 1 media selection and characterization in this study five lightweight green wall media types were tested including two natural minerals zeolite and perlite and three carbonaceous waste materials date seeds spent coffee grinds and coco coir the selection of media was based on their suitability for green walls in terms of being light weight 1 g cm3 low cost and healthy growth substrate for plants natural zeolite clinoptilolite was selected based on its high surface area 100 m2 g with regular porous structure that may offer favourable surface morphology for xocs adsorption wang et al 2020 perlite and coco coir are commonly used plant growth substrates and were selected based on their proven suitability in green wall system for removing greywater nutrients cod and e coli prodanovic et al 2020 2019a 2019b 2018 date seeds and spent coffee grinds were selected as potential waste materials to replace perlite and coco coir in green wall system for greywater treatment pradhan et al 2020 2019 all media types were washed with di water and oven dried at 105 ºc for two days to obtain the dry mass of media pradhan et al 2019 the flow dynamics and pollutant removal in green walls are majorly linked with physical characteristics of media e g particle size surface area surface morphology in this study both smaller and larger particle size media were tested the coarser media types zeolite perlite and date seeds were sieved to get larger particle size 2 36 mm 4 75 mm and finer media types coco coir and coffee grinds were sieved to get smaller particle size 0 075 mm 0 6 mm table 1 the selected media types have low bulk density value 0 09 0 76 g cm3 which is desirable to reduce the weight of green wall system the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of dried media gently packed into the known volume container the surface area was analysed with brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area analyser novatouch nt 4lx quantachrome instruments using nitrogen gas the samples were degassed at 105 ºc for 16 h before analysis to understand the surface morphology high resolution images of all media types were taken using hitachi tm4000plus benchtop scanning electron microscope sem fig 1 before performing the sem air dried samples of media were attached to carbon tape and ultra thin layer of gold 10 nm was applied using sputter coating to increase the sample conductivity 2 2 batch experiment design batch experiments were performed to compare the performance of selected lightweight green wall media types for the removal of six xocs that are associated with commonly used household products covering the range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic pollutants these xocs included acetaminophen act analgesic as a hydrophilic pollutant diethyltoluamide deet insect repellent and bisphenol a bpa plasticizer as low solubility pollutant while oxybenzone oxy uv filter triclosan tcs antimicrobial agent and nonylphenol np non ionic surfactant were representative of hydrophobic pollutants the physio chemical properties of selected xocs household usage and concentration range in greywater are summarized in table 2 five different concentrations 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l of xocs were used in this study the concentrations between 1 and 50 µg l were chosen to cover both average and maximum detected concentrations of selected xocs in greywater table 2 while 250 µg l was selected to represent rare events of very high concentration of some xocs detected in greywater eriksson et al 2003 zraunig et al 2019 a stock solution of xocs 1 g l in methanol was prepared using analytical grade chemicals purity 97 and stored at 20 c in amber vials to avoid photodegradation the desired concentration of xocs was then achieved by diluting the stock solution in water matrix two types of water matrix were tested in this study i mixture of xocs spiked in deionized water dixoc and ii mixture of xocs spiked in synthetic greywater sgwxoc the sgwxoc was prepared by following the protocol stated by diaper et al 2008 that is used in several studied related to greywater treatment bakheet et al 2020 fowdar et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2018 the composition of sgwxoc table s1 and its quality parameters table s2 are provided in supplementary information the batch experiments were conducted using amber vials 40 ml to avoid photodegradation mathon et al 2019 for each vial 0 5 g of media dry mass was added into 25 ml water matrix the vials were rotated at 30 rpm using rotary wheel this rotational speed was selected to keep media suspended in water matrix with minimum impact of media collisions with vial surfaces to analyse the residual concentration of xocs in water matrix at different time intervals 0 45 ml of sample volume from each vial was transferred to low protein binding micro centrifuge tubes and spiked with 0 05 ml of isotope labelled internal standard solution the known concentrations of targeted xocs in spiked internal standard solution help to correct any variability in xocs concentration that may occur between sample collection and analysis dolan 2012 to separate any solid particles from water matrix the micro centrifuge tubes were rotated at 4000 rpm for 10 min after centrifuge the liquid samples 0 4 ml were extracted using syringe needle and filtered by polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane syringe filter with pore size of 0 22 µm the filtered samples were transferred to amber autosampler vials and stored at 4 c until their xocs concentration was analysed the experiments were performed in two phases in the first phase five different initial concentrations of xocs 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l were spiked in di water dixoc and their residual concentrations were analysed at 3 min 8 min 15 min 30 min 90 min and 1440 min by using all media types additional samples at 480 min 2880 min and 4320 min were taken for act as its residual concentration from dixoc kept on decreasing till 1440 min the difference between initial and residual concentration is used to calculate the amount of xocs adsorb by media during different time intervals to keep total extracted volume for sampling less than 10 for all experiments two identical sets of vials were used i e i the first set to extract samples at 3 min 8 min 15 min and 30 min and ii the second set to extract samples at 90 min 480 min 1440 min 2880 min and 4320 min the residual concentration of all xocs in dixoc reached near equilibrium condition 5 change in concentration after 1440 min therefore time duration of 1440 min was considered to quantify xocs adsorption potential of different media types in second phase the effect of water matrix on the adsorption performance of different media types was analysed by comparing the removal of xocs from dixoc and sgwxoc the initial concentration of xocs in dixoc and sgwxoc was set at 5 µg l representative value of average concentration of selected xocs in domestic greywater table 2 and removal of xocs was analysed at 8 min 30 min and 1440 min these time intervals for sampling were considered based on adsorption kinetics study from first phase all experiments were run in triplicate and two types of controls i e i dixoc and sgwxoc without media to test the decline in xocs concentration with time and ii media in di water without xocs to test the leaching of pollutants by different media types 2 3 water quality analysis the concentration of xocs in each sample was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms the xocs were chromatographically separated by using 1200 series agilent hplc that is fitted with 5 μm particle size reverse phase c18 column the hplc was coupled with sciex api 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that used electrospray ionization technique to identify and quantify the xocs the mobile phase was the binary gradient of 5 mm ammonium acetate in water and pure methanol with a flow rate of 800 µl min the hplc instrument extracted 10 µl from each sample vial for analysis the calibration curve was created using at least five relative response ratios of analyte internal standard between concentration range of 1 500 µg l the calibration curve for all the analysed xocs corresponds to a linearity coefficient greater than 0 99 that represents the consistency and accuracy of analysis over the wider range of analyte concentration for quality assurance in terms of no carryover between samples each batch of samples was run with di water blank samples results indicated 10 carryover for tcs and np at initial concentration higher than 10 µg l therefore two di blanks were run between each sample analysis while analysing higher concentrations of tcs and np the concentration of tcs and np was below the detection limit 10 ng l in the second blank sample confirming no carryover to the next analysed sample 2 4 data fitting and statistical analysis the percentage removal of xocs was calculated as 1 percentage removal q o q t q o x 100 where qo is the initial concentration µg l and qt is the residual concentration µg l of xocs at any time interval in water matrix the experimental data collected at 1440 min equilibrium residual concentrations of xocs in dixoc for five different concentrations of xocs 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l was fitted to freundlich isotherm eq 2 that is well suited to describe the heterogeneity of adsorbent surface at environmental relevant concentrations ng l to µg l of micropollutants 2 q e k f c e 1 n where qe represents the amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent at equilibrium µg g and ce represents the concentration of pollutant in solution at equilibrium µg l kf is fredluich constant and its higher value represents better adsorption affinity 1 n is reaction intensity index and its value between 0 and 1 represents favourable adsorption with values close to 1 describe heterogeneity of the adsorbate sites foo and hameed 2010 moreover 1 n value help to understand fredluich isotherm curves with lower values are indicative of l shaped curve representing saturation of media at higher equilibrium concentration of pollutant and higher values are indicative of c shaped curve representing linear increase in adsorption capacity with increase in equilibrium concentration limousin et al 2007 the representative shapes of different isotherm curves figure s1 are provided in supplementary information to analyse adsorption performance over time and understand rate limiting steps during adsorption process the removal of xocs at different time intervals was analysed using pseudo first order pfo rate equation eq 3 pseudo second order pso rate equation eq 4 and intraparticle diffusion idp equation eq 5 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 t q e k 2 t 1 5 q t k 3 t 0 5 where qe and qt represent the amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 1 min k2 g µg min and k3 µg g min0 5 are the adsorption kinetic constant for pfo pso and ipd equations respectively moussout et al 2018 wu et al 2009 in idp equation eq 5 a plot of qt versus t0 5 should pass through origin to indicate intraparticle diffusion as the only rate limiting step in the adsorption process however if intraparticle diffusion model fits data linearly in multiple zones the adsorption process is controlled by more than one rate limiting steps wu et al 2009 the experimental data of xocs removal rate with initial concentration of 50 µg l was used in pfo pso and idp equations this initial concentration was selected to represent maximum detected concentration of targeted xocs in domestic greywater table 2 moreover this initial concentration resulted in reasonable data points 5 for curve fitting before residual concentration of xocs decrease below the detection limit the goodness of fit for experimental data was accessed using r2 values that were calculated as 6 r 2 q c a l q e x p 2 q cal q e x p 2 q c a l q e x p 2 where q c a l is the model predicted amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g q e x p is the experimental amount of pollutant adsorbed per mass of adsorbent µg g and q e is the average of q e x p the r2 values closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the experimental data to the considered equation a simple t test was used to statistically compare the pollutant removal performance of two media while the pollutant removal by media involving two independent variables i e time and concentration was statistically analysed with 2 way anova all data was analysed at significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 xocs removal by different media types all xocs in dixoc without media control showed small difference in concentration 6 during 24 hour time interval figure s2 supplementary information indicating minimal photodegradation or attachment of pollutants with vial surface moreover xocs were not detected in di water containing media only control confirming no leaching of pollutants by different media types the maximum removal of xocs achieved at equilibrium 24 hours time interval was significantly higher using carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite p 0 05 and showed increasing removal trend with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity fig 2 the only exception was the high removal 80 of polar hydrophilic act using zeolite possibly due to high surface area of zeolite 125 m2 g table 1 with large number of well structured micropores fig 1 a and its high affinity for adsorbing polar molecules snelgrove 2017 another possible reason could be the lowest value of minimum projection radius 3 49 aº of act amongst the studied xocs table 2 that can enter the clinoptilolite framework of zeolite used in this study ambrozova et al 2017 margeta et al 2013 the removal of deet remained low 40 by using all media types which can be attributed to its lower adsorption affinity for media and previous findings that biodegradation might be a dominant mechanism of its removal greenstein et al 2018 sui et al 2010 yang et al 2011 bpa was moderately removed 40 80 while hydrophobic pollutants oxy tcs and np showed good removal 80 using carbonaceous waste materials with coffee grinds and coco coir were the best performing media types both showing statistically similar removal performance p 0 05 this was expected as both coffee grinds and coco coir have large number of favourable adsorptions sites due to their highly porous surface with rough interstices fig 1 d and e the removal of hydrophobic xocs oxy tcs and np using natural minerals zeolite and perlite remained low 25 except for np which showed moderate removal 40 using zeolite this might be associated with np s dissociation constant pk a 10 3 that is much higher than the ph of zeolite ph 7 8 resulting in neutral charge on np in contrast oxy pk a 7 07 and tcs pk a 7 68 may deprotonate to form anionic species resulting in electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged zeolite surface kodešová et al 2015 most xocs showed similar removal performance under varying initial concentrations i e 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l 50 µg l and 250 µg l p 0 05 fig 3 indicating large number of available adsorption sites for pollutant attachment few exceptions include significantly lower removal of act bpa and np using zeolite at higher initial concentrations 50 µg l and 250 µg l as compared to lower initial concentration 1 µg l 5 µg l 10 µg l p 0 05 suggesting saturation of favourable adsorption sites on zeolite surface the removal of xocs showed good fit to freundlich isotherm model r2 0 93 table s3 supplementary information all xocs showed favourable absorption on heterogeneous surface of media 1 n 1 table s4 supplementary information with higher adsorption affinity for carbonaceous waste materials i e date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir higher kf values as compared to natural minerals zeolite and perlite table s4 supplementary information moreover the freundlich isotherm followed c shaped curves fig 4 b f representing typical case of linear increase in adsorption capacity with the increase in equilibrium concentration of pollutants the only exception was act that showed higher adsorption affinity for zeolite higher kf value table s4 supplementary information but experienced l shaped curve fig 4 a indicating saturation of media at higher equilibrium concentration of pollutant limousin et al 2007 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of act fig 5 a showed inconsistent results with poor removal 20 using most media types the exception was zeolite which showed significant decrease in residual concentration with time p 0 05 reaching minimum concentration at 1440 min ct c0 0 17 the adsorption rate was slow with more than 90 min required to reach moderate removal 40 followed by much slower adsorption rate with more than 1440 min required to achieve over 80 removal the data showed goodness of fit r2 0 99 for both pfo and pso rate equations table s5 supplementary information indicating that simultaneous contribution of multiple interactions physical or chemical could be involved in the adsorption process coimbra 2018 lima et al 2019 villaescusa et al 2011 moreover the multilinear data fitting by the intraparticle diffusion model fig 6 suggesting more than one rate limiting step involved in the adsorption process wu et al 2009 the steeper line zone i represents the film diffusion of act from bulk solution to the zeolite surface followed by less steep line zone ii that refers to intraparticle diffusion of act into the internal pores of zeolite several studies have stated similar observations of having multilinear data fit of act on different absorbents lladó et al 2015 quesada et al 2019 wong et al 2017 the adsorption kinetics of deet mostly remained inconsistent with overall low removal 40 using all media types fig 5 b the possible reason could be unfavourable structural properties of deet with lower count of hydrogen bond doner acceptor table s6 supplementary information limiting its ability to form h bonding with functional groups i e cooh oh involved in surface chemistry of different media mitra et al 2021 tong et al 2019 bpa showed steep decline in residual concentration 60 removal during initial 15 min of contact with coffee grinds and coco coir fig 5 c possibly due to large number of readily available adsorption sites wirasnita and hadibarata 2014 these adsorption sites were reduced with time resulting in much slower adsorption kinetics between 15 min to 90 min 20 removal with no significant difference in concentration afterwards p 0 05 the adsorption kinetics data showed better fit r2 0 96 to pso rate equations suggesting surface reaction controlled adsorption with π π interactions due to the availability of two benzine rings with an oh group in bpa structure might be the major facilitator in the adsorption process mitra et al 2021 hydrophobic xocs oxy trc and np experienced rapid decline in residual concentration 90 removal during initial 15 min of contact with coffee grinds and coco coir with no significant difference in concentration afterwards p 0 05 fig 5 d f the possible reason of steep decline could be lower resistance experienced by hydrophobic xocs while transporting from bulk aqueous solution to media surface tong et al 2019 the decline in residual concentration ct c0 was less steep using date seeds with major part of removal 60 was achieved in 15 min additional 20 between 15 min to 90 min after which no significant change was experienced p 0 05 the slower adsorption kinetics using date seeds is possibly due to smother surface morphology with larger pores fig 1 c as compared to coffee grinds fig 1 d and coco coir fig 1 e resulting in lower surface area table 1 and less adsorption sites for pollutant attachment the adsorption kinetics data showed goodness of fit r2 0 98 for both pfo and pso rate equations table s5 supplementary information suggesting several kinds of surface interactions i e π π interaction h bonding and hydrophobic interactions could be involved in the adsorption process sophia a and lima 2018 the pfo and pso rate constants table s5 supplementary information for the adsorption of all xocs on carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir corelate well with hydrophobicity of xocs with significantly higher values were experienced for the adsorption of hydrophobic xocs oxy tcs and np p 0 05 indicating hydrophobic interactions may be the dominant mechanism in the adsorption of xocs on carbonaceous media tong et al 2019 most xocs experienced no significant change in concentration using natural minerals zeolite and perlite during different time intervals p 0 05 fig 5 b f the only exception was np that showed slow but continuous removal with time to reach around 20 and 40 removal at 1440 min using perlite and zeolite respectively fig 5 f the comparatively better adsorption kinetics of np using zeolite might be attributed to its higher adsorption affinity logkow and dissociation constant pk a table 1 covered in the earlier discussion section 3 1 3 3 impact of background greywater pollutants on the removal of xocs all xocs in sgwxoc without media control experienced small decline in concentration 20 figure s3 supplementary information possibly due to retention of xocs by background pollutants i e organics inorganics nutrients suspended solids schäfer et al 2006 the removal of act using zeolite was significantly lower in sgwxoc as compared to dixoc p 0 05 fig 7 a this suggests that the presence of background pollutants in sgwxoc adversely affected the adsorption of act on zeolite since the removal mechanism is both through film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the background pollutants could have either competed with act for the intraparticle diffusion diffusion within the pores or covered the zeolite surface to reduce the active sites for the act adsorption quesada et al 2019 however small pore openings on zeolite surface may not allow major fraction of background pollutants to enter and compete for the intraparticle diffusion hung and lin 2006 therefore reduction in active adsorption sites on the zeolite surface due to coverage by background pollutants may be the major contributing factor in lower adsorption of act from sgwxoc the removal of deet from sgwxoc was lower as compared to dixoc but not significantly different p 0 05 fig 7 b the insignificant impact on the removal of deet can be attributed to its existence as a week base pk a 0 93 ph 7 3 along with its conjugate cations that may interact with negatively charged organic matter present in sgwxoc offsetting the hinderance that background pollutants may offer in the adsorption of deet on media surface li et al 2021 bpa oxy tcs and np showed significantly lower removal from sgwxoc in comparison to dixoc during short contact time 8 min with all carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir p 0 05 fig 7 c f however no significant difference in removal was observed at 30 min and 1440 min p 0 05 the only exception was significant lower removal of tcs and np from sgwxoc using date seeds at 30 min this indicates that the presence of background pollutants in sgwxoc adversely affected the immediate adsorption kinetics 30 min by either competing for the adsorption site or blocking the pores on the surface of carbonaceous waste materials humbert et al 2008 however total adsorption capacity of carbonaceous waste materials was not affected as large number of adsorption sites were available for the removal of xocs in contrast the removal of np using zeolite was significantly lower in sgwxoc as compared to dixoc during all time intervals p 0 05 fig 7 f indicating that both adsorption capacity and kinetics were adversely affected by the presence of background pollutants that may cover the zeolite surface resulting in lower adsorption sites for np attachment 3 4 practical implications for green wall design date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir were identified as promising green wall media types to remove most of the targeted xocs from greywater however these media types are associated with some practical disadvantages that needs to be consider before their selection for green wall system date seeds are the heaviest amongst all tested media types table 1 and its use as a green wall media will increase the overall weight of green wall system moreover the availability of date seeds as a waste material is limited to specific regions i e egypt iran saudi arabia that may hinder its widespread adoption as green wall media coffee grinds and coco coir are very fine media types that are prone to clogging in green wall system resulting in lower volume of treated greywater prodanovic et al 2017 however mixing the coarser media type i e zeolite or perlite with finer media types i e coco coir or coffee grinds in volumetric proportion of 1 2 may improve the hydraulic performance along with better aeration in green wall system prodanovic et al 2018 amongst course media types zeolite is expected to perform much better due to its higher xocs adsorption and excellent removal for polar hydrophilic pollutant act that was not removed by any other media type for finer media types coco coir is the best option due to its excellent removal performance of most xocs and proven long term suitability in green wall system bakheet et al 2020 prodanovic et al 2020 2019a 2018 2017 therefore it is recommended to use mixture of zeolite with coco coir in 1 2 to remove both hydrophilic and hydrophobic xocs without compromising the hydraulic performance of green wall system however long term performance of this media mix for the removal of xocs needs to be explored in real green wall system while using media mix in green wall system the retention time of greywater should be selected to match the adsorption kinetics of targeted xocs based on the findings of this study designing green wall system with 30 min of retention time using recommended media mix mixture of zeolite with coffee grinds or coco coir can achieve more than 90 removal of hydrophobic xocs although this retention time may not be enough to achieve good adsorption 50 of hydrophilic xocs i e act it is expected that other removal pathways like biodegradation and phytoremediation in green wall system may help to improve the overall removal of such xocs from domestic greywater 4 conclusions this was the first study to investigate the performance of different light weight green wall media for the removal of xocs from domestic greywater two natural minerals zeolite and perlite and three carbonaceous waste materials date seeds coffee grinds and coco coir were tested for the removal of six carefully selected xocs that cover hydrophilic to hydrophobic range of pollutants in greywater results indicate that overall removal of xocs increased with the increase in pollutant hydrophobicity and was better using carbonaceous waste materials as compared to natural minerals low solubility and hydrophobic xocs were best removed using coco coir while polar hydrophilic xoc showed excellent removed using zeolite therefore mixing zeolite with coco coir in green walls system can help to remove wider range of xocs from domestic greywater this study also explored the adsorption kinetics of xocs using different media types to provide practical implications for green wall design results showed that the adsorption kinetics of hydrophilic xoc using zeolite was much slower i e 90 removal after 24 h than the adsorption kinetics of hydrophobic xocs on coco coir i e 90 removal after 30 min moreover the presence of background pollutants in greywater adversely affected the initial adsorption kinetics 30 min of xocs by competing for the adsorption sites or blocking the pores on media surface therefore retention time of greywater in green wall system should be carefully selected to match the adsorption kinetics of targeted xocs the findings of this study will serve as a valuable

corresponding author artificial infiltration is an established managed aquifer recharge method that is commonly incorporated into drinking water processes however groundwater sourced from this type of purification method is prone to contamination with chemical hazards such an instance was previously shown at a swedish dwtp where the river water was contaminated by hazardous chemicals during artificial infiltration further there remains a paucity of research studying the quality of drinking water following this type of treatment from an effect based bioanalytical perspective in the current study an effect based assessment for chemical hazards was conducted for a swedish drinking water system comprised of two dwtps fed artificially infiltrated river water in this system artificial infiltration of the river water takes approximately six to eight months a sampling event was conducted in the autumn season and the samples were enriched by solid phase extraction a panel of cell based reporter gene assays representing several toxicity pathways was selected oxidative stress response nrf2 activity aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and hormone receptor mediated effects estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar ahr and er bioactivities were detected in samples collected from the river intake and in the open air infiltration basins prior to artificial infiltration however the ahr activity decreased and er activity was effectively removed following artificial infiltration in the nrf2 and ar assays no bioactivities above cut off levels were detected in any samples collected along the entire treatment process of the drinking water production from source to tap using a suite of bioassays the current study highlighted the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in reducing bioactive compounds in this raw river water although artificial infiltration is a common purification method in drinking water production the limited number of effect based studies evaluating the effectiveness of this method emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the risks and benefits of this water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords artificial infiltration drinking water chemical hazards effect based methods in vitro bioassay data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally groundwater is commonly used as a freshwater supply for drinking purposes to sustainably manage this resource groundwater can be replenished through a process of managed aquifer recharge mar balke and zhu 2008 wherein the aquifer is artificially recharged with surface water us national research council 1994 this can be done by various methods such as via infiltration basins irrigation pits redirection of the surface water across land surfaces or via injection wells into the subsurface in europe alone more than 200 different mar schemes specifically riverbank filtration are used in the production of drinking water sprenger et al 2017 in sweden for instance approximately 25 of the public drinking water is sourced from surface waters via artificial infiltration a method of mar svenskt vatten 2021 however artificially recharged groundwater can become contaminated by many of the same pollutants that enter surface waters including toxic metals pesticides industrial chemicals microorganisms natural toxins and a variety of micropollutants mps via diffuse non point sources albergamo et al 2019 böhlke 2002 díaz cruz and barceló 2008 maeng et al 2011 sasakova et al 2018 in a previous study using in vitro bioassays we detected a contamination scenario in the artificially infiltrated source water of a swedish drinking water treatment plant dwtp oskarsson et al 2021 in that study high oxidative stress activity and anti androgenic effects were detected in the outlet of the dwtp but not in the raw river water samples collected further a chemical analysis of the samples revealed that the detected organic mps did not contribute to the observed effects the results of that study highlighted that further effect based research into the artificial infiltration process and the associated risks due to chemical contamination is clearly needed effect based methods using in vitro bioassays provide useful information on the total effect and moreover the toxic potential of a sample for a specific toxicity pathway integrating both known and unknown chemicals as well as mixture effects brack et al 2019 escher et al 2020 the application of such methods in the assessment of drinking water production is not new and has been used in hazard identification as well as in assessing the efficacies of drinking water treatment technologies however very few studies have investigated the artificial infiltration process in drinking water production using such a bioanalytical approach the current study thus aimed to perform an effect based assessment of chemical hazards of another swedish drinking water system comprised of two dwtps fed artificially infiltrated groundwater a panel of in vitro reporter gene assays was used representing several common toxicity pathways relevant to human health such as oxidative stress nrf2 activation aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and hormone mediated effects the selection of bioassays followed what is generally recommended to be comprehensive of effects commonly detected in water samples escher et al 2021 this study also monitored the bioactivities across all subsequent treatment steps in two conventional dwtps fed the infiltrated groundwater as well as in their respective distribution networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water production in uppsala sweden in uppsala the drinking water supply is sourced primarily from groundwater extracted from the uppsala esker to compensate for water abstraction a managed aquifer recharge system has been utilized since 1966 to infiltrate surface water from the fyris river and additionally from lake tämnaren during the summer months at the source water intake the raw river first undergoes rapid sand filtration and then is pumped uphill to multiple infiltration basins situated north of the greater uppsala area in a nature area referred to as tunåsen the water from the basins percolates into the subsurface and mixes with the naturally formed groundwater as it flows through the aquifer it takes approximately six to eight months for the infiltrated water to travel to four wellfields that supply two dwtps gränby and bäcklösa the groundwater abstracted at the respective four wellfields vary in the proportion of infiltrated water from 15 20 40 45 45 50 to 80 90 at both dwtps the incoming infiltrated water undergoes similar treatments including aeration hardness removal pellet reactors sand filtration and then disinfection via chlorination with sodium hypochlorite however ten granular activated carbon gac filters are also installed at the bäcklösa dwtp between the sand filtration and chlorination treatment steps the finished drinking water is stored in underground reservoirs at the dwtps before entering the distribution network which consists of two municipal water towers and 440 km of pipelines that serve residential commercial and industrial water users an average of 48 300 m3 of finished drinking water per day was distributed from these two dwtps in 2021 to serve approximately 190 000 consumers in the city of uppsala a more detailed explanation of the drinking water production process is provided in the supplementary information s1 2 2 sample collection and preparation water samples were collected in late september and early october 2020 grab samples 2 l were collected from 22 sampling sites representing the full treatment cycle of the drinking water production process from source to tap table 1 fig 1 the water samples were collected in two 1 l sterile pet bottles vwr collection and transported immediately to the laboratory where they were stored at 20 c until sample preparation within 45 days this specific type of bottle has previously been demonstrated not to contaminate water samples with any activity in the assays assessed in this study lundqvist et al 2021 procedural controls of ultrapure water milli q sourced from the laboratory were also included the samples collected from the three basins sampled at tunåsen were first filtered using 0 45 µm pes filters under vacuum due to their turbid nature and the presence of visible debris e g dead vegetation all water samples 2 l were extracted via solid phase extraction spe using a spe 03 8 channel automated spe system promochrom technologies and 6 ml hlb cartridges 6cc oasis prime hlb cartridge sorbent weight 200 mg waters corporation the sample extraction process consisted of preconditioning with ethanol loading of water volume extraction with ethanol followed by rinsing and evaporation all samples were re suspended with ethanol to obtain a final extract volume of 0 4 ml each water sample was thus enriched by a factor of 5000 additional information regarding the sample preparations is provided in the supplementary information s2 1 2 3 bioassays the concentrated water samples along with procedural milli q controls vehicle negative 1 ethanol controls positive controls and reference compounds were tested in luciferase reporter gene assays the assays were selected based on their relevance to effects commonly detected in drinking water extracts and representation of different cellular toxicity pathways relevant to human health the following endpoints were thus assessed oxidative stress response nrf2 activation aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation estrogen receptor er activation androgen receptor ar activation and inhibition cytotoxicity was initially assessed in all cell lines with cell viability assays mts for all assays except er activity where the atp assay was used the main purpose of the cell viability testing was to ensure that the bioanalytical assessment of specific parameters was performed under non cytotoxic conditions cell viability of 0 80 of the vehicle control was defined as cytotoxic the concentrations of the tested samples were expressed in units of relative enrichment factor ref when incubated with the cells the 5000 fold enriched samples and controls were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to attain a final well concentration of 1 ethanol and a ref of 50 as well as 200 for some samples in all bioassays the enrichment and dilution of the samples together constitute the ref escher et al 2014 a ref of 1 is interpreted as the unconcentrated native sample while a ref of 50 for instance indicates that the sample was enriched 50 times in the bioassay detailed descriptions of the bioanalytical methods are provided in the supplementary information sections s2 2 to 2 5 for all bioassays the concentrated water samples and controls were analyzed in quadruplicate all bioassays were repeated at least once to prove biological reproducibility in brief all activity experiments were conducted in white walled 384 well cell culture plates with transparent bottoms corning incorporated cells were seeded in the plates and incubated for 24 h the cells were then exposed to the concentrated water samples for another 24 h on the third day bioactivity i e luminescence was measured on a tecan spark multimode microplate reader using the luciferase reporter assay system promega according to the manufacturer s instructions vehicle controls and a dilution series of reference compounds were included on every experimental plate for each assay for the er assay a weak positive control p p methoxychlor was also included a summary of the bioassays and concentration ranges of the reference compounds are provided in table 2 2 4 data evaluation all concentrated water samples were initially analyzed for bioactivity at a concentration of relative enrichment factor ref 50 in all bioassays bioactivities in each sample were expressed as the mean fold change normalized to the mean fold change in the vehicle controls set to 1 for nrf2 activity where no maximum effect can be reached the standard curve for the reference compound was based on a linear regression of activities normalized to the mean activity of the vehicle control for ahr ar and er the standard curves for the reference compounds were obtained by fitting data x axes were log transformed to a four parameter sigmoidal curve cut off levels for a positive response in bioactivity were determined as follows for nrf2 a fold ratio of 1 5 compared to the normalized vehicle control was used as the cut off level for bioactivity as recommended by escher et al 2012 for ahr ar and er cut off levels for bioactivity were based on the limit of detection lod for that assay which was defined as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation sd of the normalized vehicle control a cut off level for a positive response was then set for each assay as a value exceeding the lod value in instances when the lod was below 1 5 the cut off level was set to 1 5 and if the lod was between 1 5 and 2 the cut off level was set at 2 for ar antagonist activity the lod was calculated as 1 min 3 times the sd of the normalized vehicle control and a cut off level of 0 7 was set for some samples differences in bioactivities at ref50 were statistically evaluated using a one way anova followed by a šidák s multiple comparisons test performed in graphpad prism v 9 3 1 statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 samples collected from the inlets outlets and distribution networks of gränby and bäcklösa were tested further in dilutions series up to ref 200 to calculate bioanalytical equivalent beq concentrations in one of the dilution series a mann whitney test was performed to circumvent a lack of sample volume further details of this instance are provided in section 3 2 2 mean activities were normalized first to the vehicle control then to the assay maximum defined as the highest concentration of the reference compound of the respective assay the normalized data were then fit to four parameter sigmoidal curves to generate concentration effect curves cecs and analyzed via non linear regression the concentrations causing a 10 effect ec10 expressed as ref were then interpolated from the curves the ec values were further translated into beq concentrations in units of ng l or μg l using the ec10 values of the sample ec10 sample and the reference compounds ec10 ref

samples were initially tested for cytotoxicity at ref 50 in all assays thereafter samples that were to be assessed further in dilutions series were tested for cytotoxicity up to ref 200 in all assays none of the water samples exerted cytotoxicity supplementary information fig s1 which demonstrated that the bioassays were conducted under conditions where the cell viability was not compromised 3 2 initial screening of bioactivities initially all samples were analyzed at ref 50 in bioassays for oxidative stress nrf2 activity ahr and er agonistic activities as well as ar agonistic and antagonistic activities fig 2 in general the majority of the samples were inactive for most of the studied endpoints at ref 50 none of the samples exerted oxidative stress fig 2a or ar agonist fig 2d or antagonistic activity fig 2e above cut off levels and only one sample showed estrogenicity at ref 50 fig 2c for ahr however several raw water samples taken in the basins prior to infiltration exerted relatively high activities at ref 50 fig 2b ahr activity was lower in the post infiltration wellfield sample and significantly different than the activities detected in the basin samples p 0 0001 šídák s multiple comparisons test α 0 05 the ahr activity remained at or just above the detection limit in most post infiltration samples collected downstream in the dwtps and distribution networks 3 2 1 treatment effects of artificial infiltration in the soil subsurface chemical contaminants can undergo biodegradation and attenuation over time via various biotic and abiotic processes during migration they may also be removed from the aqueous environment by adherence to soils many studies have reported on the fate and degradation of various chemical contaminants in wastewater effluents treated by natural attenuation in the soil subsurface cordy et al 2004 drewes et al 2003 hoon et al 2007 further to this artificial recharge through infiltration basins has been reported to improve recharged water quality by eliminating various pesticides pharmaceuticals and pathogens dragon et al 2018 maeng et al 2011 nagy kovács et al 2018 tröger et al 2020 valhondo et al 2020 verstraeten et al 2003 moreover biological toxicity assays have been used to evaluate the safety of reclaimed wastewater and recycled water quality leusch and snyder 2015 xu et al 2020 however there appears to be a paucity of bioanalytical studies investigating the effectiveness of artificial infiltration processes in drinking water production nevertheless the results of the current study are discussed below in the context of a limited number of studies relevant to the treatment efficiency of artificial infiltration processes in water purification in the nrf2 and ar assays no bioactivities above cut off levels or below in the case of ar antagonist activity were detected at ref 50 at any of the sampling points between the river source the galgbacken wellfield and the infiltrated water intakes at the two dwtps this is in contrast to the findings of oskarsson et al 2021 s study wherein high nrf2 and anti androgenic activities were detected in samples collected from abstraction wells and the outlet of the dwtp over different seasons oskarsson et al 2021 that particular dwtp draws artificially infiltrated water from a large river source which receives treated wastewater storm water discharges and effluents from industries the artificial infiltration in that study had been in place since the 1950s the nrf2 and anti androgenic activities in the raw water source to be infiltrated did not show any detectable nrf2 or anti androgenic activities so contamination of the water occurred during the infiltration process targeted chemical analysis of the infiltrated water samples detected 17 of 163 analysed mps tröger et al 2020 a mixture of all the analysed mps each at a concentration of 1 µg l which was far higher than the concentrations of the 17 detected chemicals did not induce nrf2 or anti ar activities thus it was concluded that the detected mps were not responsible for the bioactivities observed in the infiltrated water samples possible explanations of the observed effects included the release of contaminants into the infiltrated water retained in the infiltration soil in the past and or the release of natural bioactive compounds toxins formed by microorganisms present in the infiltration environment still the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in reducing reactive oxygen species ros and anti androgenic activity has been demonstrated elsewhere in another bioanalytical study that assessed infiltrated wastewater effluent jia et al 2015 the authors reported that infiltration attenuated mutagenic and oxidative stress effects with beq reductions up to 97 and 93 respectively on another note the presence of plants as a filtering layer in natural water purification systems has been demonstrated to biodegrade some pollutants in such an example wherein a drinking water source was purified through a large scale constructed wetland decreases in ros levels as well as in cytotoxicity and anti androgen activity following purification was reported xu et al 2019 other studies using bioassays also reported a lack of ar activation or inhibition in finished drinking water samples jones et al 2020 leusch et al 2018 neale et al 2020 valcárcel et al 2018 in contrast to ar activity nrf2 activity is often detected in river waters in other parts of the world neale et al 2017 wang et al 2013 further the oxidative stress response is quite commonly detected in a variety of water types and therefore a highly relevant parameter in water quality assessments escher et al 2014 overall the lack of ar and nrf2 activities detected in any of the samples in the current study particularly in the source river water suggests the low presence of bioactive compounds during this sampling event for these two endpoints in contrast to the non detectable bioactivities in the other bioassays tested water samples collected before the artificial infiltration were above the cut off level for ahr activity in particular bioactivities were higher in the samples collected from the three open air infiltration basins compared to the source river water even though there is no treatment in between these sampling points this may be attributed to the fact that the water in the open air infiltration basins may undergo physical chemical or biochemical changes while exposed to sunlight temperature fluctuations and other ambient conditions which may affect water quality before entering the groundwater natural sunlight irradiation for instance plays an important role in transforming mps and dissolved organic matter in other water environments such as open storage of reclaimed water and in natural surface waters due to natural processes e g photolysis bahnmüller et al 2014 tixier et al 2002 wang et al 2021 at the same time phototoxic products may also be formed during the photolysis of organic contaminants such as dioxin like bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles mumbo et al 2017 and pharmaceutical mixtures wang and lin 2014 in short while identification of the compounds inducing the ahr activity was not in the scope of the current study the higher ahr bioactivities detected in the basin samples compared to the preceding sampling points provide interesting insight into the presence of ahr inducing chemical hazards in the basins in contrast to the elevated ahr bioactivities detected in the infiltration basin samples the bioactivity in the sample collected from the subsequent galgbacken wellfield gwf was much lower with a 2 5 fold decrease compared to the highest bioactivities measured in the basin samples albeit still above the cut off level the lower bioactivities measured in the wellfield sample following infiltration may be due to several explanations first the infiltration basins contain approximately one meter of sand directly in contact with the underlying natural esker formation water from the basins undergoes infiltration at a rate of approximately 3 5 4 5 m3 m2 per day a biological growth or schmutzdecke typically occurs on the sand surface and is a key factor in the treatment process physical chemical or biochemical changes in the water matrix can occur within the schmultzdecke and the unsaturated and saturated natural esker material underlying the infiltration basins the schmultzdecke functions as a biologically active filter and may account for the ahr activity due to the adsorption of contaminants during this process next natural attenuation due to dilution and mixing with the natural groundwater as well as adsorption occurs within the esker material during the transit time from infiltration to extraction which is approximately 6 8 months oskarsson et al 2021 also reported removal of ahr activity detected in raw river water following the artificial infiltration treatment oskarsson et al 2021 still in another study of a dwtp fed riverbank filtrate ahr mediated effects at an ec10 value of approximately ref 8 albergamo et al 2020 were detected in the filtrate the raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate in that study had an average infiltration time of 30 years taking into account the results from these other studies of the infiltration process the transit or residence time of the infiltrated water seems to be a notable factor on the whole compared to the positive ahr responses in the less treated basin samples the clear lower response following artificial infiltration is a compelling observation of the current study in the er assay bioactivity above the cut off level was detected in only one sample basin 3 albeit marginally furthermore no estrogenic activity above the cutoff level was detected in the sample collected from the wellfield following infiltration nor in the two dwtp s inlet samples riverbank filtration piloted for water supply systems has been demonstrated to remove thyroid disrupting chemicals as well in the recombinant thyroid hormone receptor tr gene yeast assay valcárcel et al 2018 while there appears to be a lack of toxicological effect based studies investigating the degradation of estrogenic compounds in artificially infiltrated drinking water sources other studies using chemical analyses have investigated the occurrence and elimination of endocrine disrupting compounds in groundwater recharge systems in germany for instance a study that investigated the removal of steroids during two different groundwater recharge systems riverbank infiltration and artificial groundwater replenishment observed significant decreases in the selected estrogenic compounds following these two processes zuehlke et al 2004 similarly a study that monitored the concentrations of 10 natural and synthetic estrogens and progestogens in water samples collected from two artificial recharge plants located in sweden and denmark detected only one compound estrone 3 sulfate following the recharge processes kuster et al 2010 as such while no to low estrogenic effects were detected in the current study the presence of hormones in mar systems has been observed in other non bioanalytical studies in brief the lower ahr bioactivities and lack of er bioactivities in the wellfield and dwtp intake samples compared to the preceding raw water samples river and basins where activities were detected above the respective cut off levels would suggest that artificial infiltration is an effective natural purification method in this study this is in contrast to the findings of our previous study at another swedish dwtp utilizing artificial infiltration wherein the artificial infiltration process appeared to be a source of contamination oskarsson et al 2021 as mentioned previously the contrasting findings may be attributed to several factors regarding the removal efficiency of the artificial infiltration process one explanation may be due to differences in the residence or travel time of the raw water in the subsurface the infiltrated water in the current study takes approximately six to eight months to reach the wellfields supplying the two dwtps the infiltrated water in the previous study takes seven to thirty days to percolate through the subsurface from the infiltration basins a longer travel time could therefore result in greater removal or dilution of bioactivity compounds to undetectable concentrations an alternative explanation could be due to the accumulation of contaminants in the subsurface in the case of the dwtp in our previous study oskarsson et al 2021 as revealed by oskarsson et al 2021 and elsewhere the artificial infiltration of aquifers may lead to the eventual mobilization of toxic naturally occurring contaminants into the water thereby compromising the water quality fakhreddine et al 2021 oskarsson et al 2021 further certain classes of hydrophilic organics that enter riverbank filtration systems can persist and migrate over prolonger time scales e g decades albergamo et al 2019 the fact that bioactivities above cut off levels following artificial infiltration were detected in the ahr assay but not in any of the other bioassays in this study may suggest that certain compounds present in infiltrated water cannot be as effectively removed during subsurface attenuation as others due to their resistance to biodegradation and the hydrophilic nature of the compounds even at low concentrations in the groundwater this has for instance been demonstrated for certain pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine and primidone personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds benotti et al 2012 debroux et al 2012 heberer et al 2004 hrkal et al 2018 compound specific characteristics such as hydrophilicity and recalcitrance may limit the amount of compound that will adsorb to soils or that can be biodegraded by the soil microbial community maeng et al 2011 also mobility during subsurface flow riverbank filtration depends on the polarity of the mps mishra et al 2021 next the fate of organic compounds and degree of attenuation during artificial recharge is influenced by multiple factors such as the retardation factor the distance and time spent in travel depth to water table sediment porosity and permeability groundwater flow and the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer mishra et al 2021 petrovic et al 2009 such characteristics of the aquifer include its lithology hydraulic and textural properties of the soil temperature and the microbial environment among these factors redox conditions of the aquifer play a significant role in that certain pollutants are preferably removed under some particular redox conditions barbieri et al 2011 valhondo et al 2015 finally there is the temporal aspect of the sampling strategy in the current study given that all samples were collected on the same day in this study it is likely that the composition of the water samples collected along each step of the total treatment process from the river water source would differ from each other further to this only one sampling event was conducted for this study seasonal differences in the quality and chemical profile of the raw water were therefore not assessed as described by jokela et al 2017 fluctuations in commonly monitored water quality parameters alone related to the organic matter content of river waters are typical jokela et al 2017 overall artificial filtration as a natural water purification method has been shown to have its benefits as well as limitations mainly in that it does not result in the complete removal of all bioactive mps and that it may be a cause of contamination of drinking water this treatment method therefore can serve as an effective pre treatment of raw water but should include some water quality monitoring with additional purification required thereafter in drinking water production 3 2 2 water purification at gränby and bäcklösa dwtps following artificial infiltration the surface water will have mixed with the groundwater refer to section 2 1 and then fed into the gränby and bäcklösa dwtps for further purification a secondary objective of the current study was to monitor the bioactivities across all treatment steps in the two dwtps fed the infiltrated groundwater in general consistent with the lack of nrf2 ar and er bioactivities detected in almost all samples collected between the river and wellfield locations samples from both dwtps were below cut off levels at ref 50 in all assays tested except in the ahr assay low ahr bioactivities either at or slightly above the cut off level were detected at ref 50 in several samples collected from both dwtps it is important to mention that these ahr activities were either lower or similar to what was observed in the raw water in the basins prior to artificial infiltration however that ahr activities above cut off were detected in some samples collected at the dwtps suggests the limited removal effect of ahr inducing compounds during the treatment processes utilized at the dwtps as mentioned in section 2 4 samples collected from the inlets outlets and distribution networks of both dwtps were further analyzed in dilution series to obtain cecs ec values and beqs were then determined to compare to other effect based studies on dwtps this was done for the ahr and er bioassays only based on the initial screening results as these two assays showed more frequent bioactivities above cut off levels at ref 50 compared to the nrf2 and ar bioassays however given the low levels of bioactivities detected in some of the samples at ref 50 it was necessary to increase the sensitivity in the assays by increasing the highest tested concentration to ref 200 the cecs and calculated results are presented in fig 3 and table 3 respectively for the gränby dwtp dilution series were possible to study for the inlet sample but not for the outlet sample due to a lack of sample volume however a mann whitney test of the ref 50 results for the outlet sample and the subsequent tap water sample yielded no significant differences in the ahr assay p 0 686 or the er assay p 0 343 consequently dilution series of the tap water sample were completed instead at the bäcklösa dwtp it should be pointed out that this plant receives water from two wellfields as mentioned previously low ahr was detected overall in all samples collected from both dwtps in the current study other effect based studies on river water sourced dwtps utilizing similar conventional treatment methods have reported higher activities escher et al 2014 for instance reported an ec10 value of ref 8 6 in the 24 h ahr caflux assay in finished drinking water samples collected from a river water sourced dwtp that utilized coagulation and filtration followed by chlorination and finishing with chloramination escher et al 2014 a previous study at that same australian dwtp reported ahr activity at 0 17 ng tcdd l in the finished drinking water macova et al 2011 in the er bioassay low estrogenic activities were detected in the current study in the finished drinking water samples collected from gränby and bäcklösa another effect based study investigating river water sourced dwtps reported reduced estrogenic activity to below the limit of detection eeqbio 3 00 10 2 ng e2 l in finished water samples following conventional treatments neale et al 2020 similarly ten dwtps sourced from surface stream water alluvial groundwater and deeper groundwater in an area of high agricultural use in the usa reported a low prevalence in the detection of er activity in the finished drinking water jones et al 2020 still much higher activities have been reported at other dwtps elsewhere such as 0 035 1 51 ng eeq l in the e screen assay in tap water samples collected from ten dwtps located throughout taiwan gou et al 2016 and an ec10 value greater than ref 30 in the e screen assay in finished drinking water samples collected from a river water sourced dwtp in australia escher et al 2014 furthermore the observed estrogenicity in the finished drinking water samples collected from both dwtps in the current study were at concentrations far below the suggested threshold of concern of 1 ng estradiol l recommended by the world health organization world health organisation europe 2017 and included in the 2022 watch list council of the european union 2020 in the eu drinking water directive drinking water parameter cooperation project support to the revision of annex i council directive 98 83 ec on the quality of water intended for human consumption drinking water directive 2017 4 conclusions mar techniques such as artificial infiltration are commonly utilized around the world to improve water quality and increase groundwater storage stefan and ansems 2018 however groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination by many of the same mps found in surface waters such an instance was previously shown at a swedish dwtp where the river water source was contaminated by hazardous chemicals during artificial infiltration oskarsson et al 2021 the current study involved an effect based evaluation of another swedish dwtp that utilizes artificial infiltration in its drinking water production in this case the artificial infiltration process seemed effective in reducing ahr and er bioactivities what is important to highlight is that there are still a very limited number of relevant effect based studies evaluating the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in removing chemical hazards given that artificial infiltration is commonly utilized around the world in drinking water production further research particularly using effect based methods is urgently needed to gain further understanding of the risks and benefits of this water treatment process future work with the current study could include additional sampling to observe any temporal differences along the artificial infiltration process it would also be worthwhile to investigate operational factors related to the infiltration process such as loading rates basin material and pre treatment which may optimize the reduction of bioactivities declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

corresponding author artificial infiltration is an established managed aquifer recharge method that is commonly incorporated into drinking water processes however groundwater sourced from this type of purification method is prone to contamination with chemical hazards such an instance was previously shown at a swedish dwtp where the river water was contaminated by hazardous chemicals during artificial infiltration further there remains a paucity of research studying the quality of drinking water following this type of treatment from an effect based bioanalytical perspective in the current study an effect based assessment for chemical hazards was conducted for a swedish drinking water system comprised of two dwtps fed artificially infiltrated river water in this system artificial infiltration of the river water takes approximately six to eight months a sampling event was conducted in the autumn season and the samples were enriched by solid phase extraction a panel of cell based reporter gene assays representing several toxicity pathways was selected oxidative stress response nrf2 activity aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and hormone receptor mediated effects estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar ahr and er bioactivities were detected in samples collected from the river intake and in the open air infiltration basins prior to artificial infiltration however the ahr activity decreased and er activity was effectively removed following artificial infiltration in the nrf2 and ar assays no bioactivities above cut off levels were detected in any samples collected along the entire treatment process of the drinking water production from source to tap using a suite of bioassays the current study highlighted the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in reducing bioactive compounds in this raw river water although artificial infiltration is a common purification method in drinking water production the limited number of effect based studies evaluating the effectiveness of this method emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the risks and benefits of this water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords artificial infiltration drinking water chemical hazards effect based methods in vitro bioassay data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally groundwater is commonly used as a freshwater supply for drinking purposes to sustainably manage this resource groundwater can be replenished through a process of managed aquifer recharge mar balke and zhu 2008 wherein the aquifer is artificially recharged with surface water us national research council 1994 this can be done by various methods such as via infiltration basins irrigation pits redirection of the surface water across land surfaces or via injection wells into the subsurface in europe alone more than 200 different mar schemes specifically riverbank filtration are used in the production of drinking water sprenger et al 2017 in sweden for instance approximately 25 of the public drinking water is sourced from surface waters via artificial infiltration a method of mar svenskt vatten 2021 however artificially recharged groundwater can become contaminated by many of the same pollutants that enter surface waters including toxic metals pesticides industrial chemicals microorganisms natural toxins and a variety of micropollutants mps via diffuse non point sources albergamo et al 2019 böhlke 2002 díaz cruz and barceló 2008 maeng et al 2011 sasakova et al 2018 in a previous study using in vitro bioassays we detected a contamination scenario in the artificially infiltrated source water of a swedish drinking water treatment plant dwtp oskarsson et al 2021 in that study high oxidative stress activity and anti androgenic effects were detected in the outlet of the dwtp but not in the raw river water samples collected further a chemical analysis of the samples revealed that the detected organic mps did not contribute to the observed effects the results of that study highlighted that further effect based research into the artificial infiltration process and the associated risks due to chemical contamination is clearly needed effect based methods using in vitro bioassays provide useful information on the total effect and moreover the toxic potential of a sample for a specific toxicity pathway integrating both known and unknown chemicals as well as mixture effects brack et al 2019 escher et al 2020 the application of such methods in the assessment of drinking water production is not new and has been used in hazard identification as well as in assessing the efficacies of drinking water treatment technologies however very few studies have investigated the artificial infiltration process in drinking water production using such a bioanalytical approach the current study thus aimed to perform an effect based assessment of chemical hazards of another swedish drinking water system comprised of two dwtps fed artificially infiltrated groundwater a panel of in vitro reporter gene assays was used representing several common toxicity pathways relevant to human health such as oxidative stress nrf2 activation aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and hormone mediated effects the selection of bioassays followed what is generally recommended to be comprehensive of effects commonly detected in water samples escher et al 2021 this study also monitored the bioactivities across all subsequent treatment steps in two conventional dwtps fed the infiltrated groundwater as well as in their respective distribution networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water production in uppsala sweden in uppsala the drinking water supply is sourced primarily from groundwater extracted from the uppsala esker to compensate for water abstraction a managed aquifer recharge system has been utilized since 1966 to infiltrate surface water from the fyris river and additionally from lake tämnaren during the summer months at the source water intake the raw river first undergoes rapid sand filtration and then is pumped uphill to multiple infiltration basins situated north of the greater uppsala area in a nature area referred to as tunåsen the water from the basins percolates into the subsurface and mixes with the naturally formed groundwater as it flows through the aquifer it takes approximately six to eight months for the infiltrated water to travel to four wellfields that supply two dwtps gränby and bäcklösa the groundwater abstracted at the respective four wellfields vary in the proportion of infiltrated water from 15 20 40 45 45 50 to 80 90 at both dwtps the incoming infiltrated water undergoes similar treatments including aeration hardness removal pellet reactors sand filtration and then disinfection via chlorination with sodium hypochlorite however ten granular activated carbon gac filters are also installed at the bäcklösa dwtp between the sand filtration and chlorination treatment steps the finished drinking water is stored in underground reservoirs at the dwtps before entering the distribution network which consists of two municipal water towers and 440 km of pipelines that serve residential commercial and industrial water users an average of 48 300 m3 of finished drinking water per day was distributed from these two dwtps in 2021 to serve approximately 190 000 consumers in the city of uppsala a more detailed explanation of the drinking water production process is provided in the supplementary information s1 2 2 sample collection and preparation water samples were collected in late september and early october 2020 grab samples 2 l were collected from 22 sampling sites representing the full treatment cycle of the drinking water production process from source to tap table 1 fig 1 the water samples were collected in two 1 l sterile pet bottles vwr collection and transported immediately to the laboratory where they were stored at 20 c until sample preparation within 45 days this specific type of bottle has previously been demonstrated not to contaminate water samples with any activity in the assays assessed in this study lundqvist et al 2021 procedural controls of ultrapure water milli q sourced from the laboratory were also included the samples collected from the three basins sampled at tunåsen were first filtered using 0 45 µm pes filters under vacuum due to their turbid nature and the presence of visible debris e g dead vegetation all water samples 2 l were extracted via solid phase extraction spe using a spe 03 8 channel automated spe system promochrom technologies and 6 ml hlb cartridges 6cc oasis prime hlb cartridge sorbent weight 200 mg waters corporation the sample extraction process consisted of preconditioning with ethanol loading of water volume extraction with ethanol followed by rinsing and evaporation all samples were re suspended with ethanol to obtain a final extract volume of 0 4 ml each water sample was thus enriched by a factor of 5000 additional information regarding the sample preparations is provided in the supplementary information s2 1 2 3 bioassays the concentrated water samples along with procedural milli q controls vehicle negative 1 ethanol controls positive controls and reference compounds were tested in luciferase reporter gene assays the assays were selected based on their relevance to effects commonly detected in drinking water extracts and representation of different cellular toxicity pathways relevant to human health the following endpoints were thus assessed oxidative stress response nrf2 activation aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation estrogen receptor er activation androgen receptor ar activation and inhibition cytotoxicity was initially assessed in all cell lines with cell viability assays mts for all assays except er activity where the atp assay was used the main purpose of the cell viability testing was to ensure that the bioanalytical assessment of specific parameters was performed under non cytotoxic conditions cell viability of 0 80 of the vehicle control was defined as cytotoxic the concentrations of the tested samples were expressed in units of relative enrichment factor ref when incubated with the cells the 5000 fold enriched samples and controls were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to attain a final well concentration of 1 ethanol and a ref of 50 as well as 200 for some samples in all bioassays the enrichment and dilution of the samples together constitute the ref escher et al 2014 a ref of 1 is interpreted as the unconcentrated native sample while a ref of 50 for instance indicates that the sample was enriched 50 times in the bioassay detailed descriptions of the bioanalytical methods are provided in the supplementary information sections s2 2 to 2 5 for all bioassays the concentrated water samples and controls were analyzed in quadruplicate all bioassays were repeated at least once to prove biological reproducibility in brief all activity experiments were conducted in white walled 384 well cell culture plates with transparent bottoms corning incorporated cells were seeded in the plates and incubated for 24 h the cells were then exposed to the concentrated water samples for another 24 h on the third day bioactivity i e luminescence was measured on a tecan spark multimode microplate reader using the luciferase reporter assay system promega according to the manufacturer s instructions vehicle controls and a dilution series of reference compounds were included on every experimental plate for each assay for the er assay a weak positive control p p methoxychlor was also included a summary of the bioassays and concentration ranges of the reference compounds are provided in table 2 2 4 data evaluation all concentrated water samples were initially analyzed for bioactivity at a concentration of relative enrichment factor ref 50 in all bioassays bioactivities in each sample were expressed as the mean fold change normalized to the mean fold change in the vehicle controls set to 1 for nrf2 activity where no maximum effect can be reached the standard curve for the reference compound was based on a linear regression of activities normalized to the mean activity of the vehicle control for ahr ar and er the standard curves for the reference compounds were obtained by fitting data x axes were log transformed to a four parameter sigmoidal curve cut off levels for a positive response in bioactivity were determined as follows for nrf2 a fold ratio of 1 5 compared to the normalized vehicle control was used as the cut off level for bioactivity as recommended by escher et al 2012 for ahr ar and er cut off levels for bioactivity were based on the limit of detection lod for that assay which was defined as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation sd of the normalized vehicle control a cut off level for a positive response was then set for each assay as a value exceeding the lod value in instances when the lod was below 1 5 the cut off level was set to 1 5 and if the lod was between 1 5 and 2 the cut off level was set at 2 for ar antagonist activity the lod was calculated as 1 min 3 times the sd of the normalized vehicle control and a cut off level of 0 7 was set for some samples differences in bioactivities at ref50 were statistically evaluated using a one way anova followed by a šidák s multiple comparisons test performed in graphpad prism v 9 3 1 statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 samples collected from the inlets outlets and distribution networks of gränby and bäcklösa were tested further in dilutions series up to ref 200 to calculate bioanalytical equivalent beq concentrations in one of the dilution series a mann whitney test was performed to circumvent a lack of sample volume further details of this instance are provided in section 3 2 2 mean activities were normalized first to the vehicle control then to the assay maximum defined as the highest concentration of the reference compound of the respective assay the normalized data were then fit to four parameter sigmoidal curves to generate concentration effect curves cecs and analyzed via non linear regression the concentrations causing a 10 effect ec10 expressed as ref were then interpolated from the curves the ec values were further translated into beq concentrations in units of ng l or μg l using the ec10 values of the sample ec10 sample and the reference compounds ec10 ref

samples were initially tested for cytotoxicity at ref 50 in all assays thereafter samples that were to be assessed further in dilutions series were tested for cytotoxicity up to ref 200 in all assays none of the water samples exerted cytotoxicity supplementary information fig s1 which demonstrated that the bioassays were conducted under conditions where the cell viability was not compromised 3 2 initial screening of bioactivities initially all samples were analyzed at ref 50 in bioassays for oxidative stress nrf2 activity ahr and er agonistic activities as well as ar agonistic and antagonistic activities fig 2 in general the majority of the samples were inactive for most of the studied endpoints at ref 50 none of the samples exerted oxidative stress fig 2a or ar agonist fig 2d or antagonistic activity fig 2e above cut off levels and only one sample showed estrogenicity at ref 50 fig 2c for ahr however several raw water samples taken in the basins prior to infiltration exerted relatively high activities at ref 50 fig 2b ahr activity was lower in the post infiltration wellfield sample and significantly different than the activities detected in the basin samples p 0 0001 šídák s multiple comparisons test α 0 05 the ahr activity remained at or just above the detection limit in most post infiltration samples collected downstream in the dwtps and distribution networks 3 2 1 treatment effects of artificial infiltration in the soil subsurface chemical contaminants can undergo biodegradation and attenuation over time via various biotic and abiotic processes during migration they may also be removed from the aqueous environment by adherence to soils many studies have reported on the fate and degradation of various chemical contaminants in wastewater effluents treated by natural attenuation in the soil subsurface cordy et al 2004 drewes et al 2003 hoon et al 2007 further to this artificial recharge through infiltration basins has been reported to improve recharged water quality by eliminating various pesticides pharmaceuticals and pathogens dragon et al 2018 maeng et al 2011 nagy kovács et al 2018 tröger et al 2020 valhondo et al 2020 verstraeten et al 2003 moreover biological toxicity assays have been used to evaluate the safety of reclaimed wastewater and recycled water quality leusch and snyder 2015 xu et al 2020 however there appears to be a paucity of bioanalytical studies investigating the effectiveness of artificial infiltration processes in drinking water production nevertheless the results of the current study are discussed below in the context of a limited number of studies relevant to the treatment efficiency of artificial infiltration processes in water purification in the nrf2 and ar assays no bioactivities above cut off levels or below in the case of ar antagonist activity were detected at ref 50 at any of the sampling points between the river source the galgbacken wellfield and the infiltrated water intakes at the two dwtps this is in contrast to the findings of oskarsson et al 2021 s study wherein high nrf2 and anti androgenic activities were detected in samples collected from abstraction wells and the outlet of the dwtp over different seasons oskarsson et al 2021 that particular dwtp draws artificially infiltrated water from a large river source which receives treated wastewater storm water discharges and effluents from industries the artificial infiltration in that study had been in place since the 1950s the nrf2 and anti androgenic activities in the raw water source to be infiltrated did not show any detectable nrf2 or anti androgenic activities so contamination of the water occurred during the infiltration process targeted chemical analysis of the infiltrated water samples detected 17 of 163 analysed mps tröger et al 2020 a mixture of all the analysed mps each at a concentration of 1 µg l which was far higher than the concentrations of the 17 detected chemicals did not induce nrf2 or anti ar activities thus it was concluded that the detected mps were not responsible for the bioactivities observed in the infiltrated water samples possible explanations of the observed effects included the release of contaminants into the infiltrated water retained in the infiltration soil in the past and or the release of natural bioactive compounds toxins formed by microorganisms present in the infiltration environment still the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in reducing reactive oxygen species ros and anti androgenic activity has been demonstrated elsewhere in another bioanalytical study that assessed infiltrated wastewater effluent jia et al 2015 the authors reported that infiltration attenuated mutagenic and oxidative stress effects with beq reductions up to 97 and 93 respectively on another note the presence of plants as a filtering layer in natural water purification systems has been demonstrated to biodegrade some pollutants in such an example wherein a drinking water source was purified through a large scale constructed wetland decreases in ros levels as well as in cytotoxicity and anti androgen activity following purification was reported xu et al 2019 other studies using bioassays also reported a lack of ar activation or inhibition in finished drinking water samples jones et al 2020 leusch et al 2018 neale et al 2020 valcárcel et al 2018 in contrast to ar activity nrf2 activity is often detected in river waters in other parts of the world neale et al 2017 wang et al 2013 further the oxidative stress response is quite commonly detected in a variety of water types and therefore a highly relevant parameter in water quality assessments escher et al 2014 overall the lack of ar and nrf2 activities detected in any of the samples in the current study particularly in the source river water suggests the low presence of bioactive compounds during this sampling event for these two endpoints in contrast to the non detectable bioactivities in the other bioassays tested water samples collected before the artificial infiltration were above the cut off level for ahr activity in particular bioactivities were higher in the samples collected from the three open air infiltration basins compared to the source river water even though there is no treatment in between these sampling points this may be attributed to the fact that the water in the open air infiltration basins may undergo physical chemical or biochemical changes while exposed to sunlight temperature fluctuations and other ambient conditions which may affect water quality before entering the groundwater natural sunlight irradiation for instance plays an important role in transforming mps and dissolved organic matter in other water environments such as open storage of reclaimed water and in natural surface waters due to natural processes e g photolysis bahnmüller et al 2014 tixier et al 2002 wang et al 2021 at the same time phototoxic products may also be formed during the photolysis of organic contaminants such as dioxin like bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles mumbo et al 2017 and pharmaceutical mixtures wang and lin 2014 in short while identification of the compounds inducing the ahr activity was not in the scope of the current study the higher ahr bioactivities detected in the basin samples compared to the preceding sampling points provide interesting insight into the presence of ahr inducing chemical hazards in the basins in contrast to the elevated ahr bioactivities detected in the infiltration basin samples the bioactivity in the sample collected from the subsequent galgbacken wellfield gwf was much lower with a 2 5 fold decrease compared to the highest bioactivities measured in the basin samples albeit still above the cut off level the lower bioactivities measured in the wellfield sample following infiltration may be due to several explanations first the infiltration basins contain approximately one meter of sand directly in contact with the underlying natural esker formation water from the basins undergoes infiltration at a rate of approximately 3 5 4 5 m3 m2 per day a biological growth or schmutzdecke typically occurs on the sand surface and is a key factor in the treatment process physical chemical or biochemical changes in the water matrix can occur within the schmultzdecke and the unsaturated and saturated natural esker material underlying the infiltration basins the schmultzdecke functions as a biologically active filter and may account for the ahr activity due to the adsorption of contaminants during this process next natural attenuation due to dilution and mixing with the natural groundwater as well as adsorption occurs within the esker material during the transit time from infiltration to extraction which is approximately 6 8 months oskarsson et al 2021 also reported removal of ahr activity detected in raw river water following the artificial infiltration treatment oskarsson et al 2021 still in another study of a dwtp fed riverbank filtrate ahr mediated effects at an ec10 value of approximately ref 8 albergamo et al 2020 were detected in the filtrate the raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate in that study had an average infiltration time of 30 years taking into account the results from these other studies of the infiltration process the transit or residence time of the infiltrated water seems to be a notable factor on the whole compared to the positive ahr responses in the less treated basin samples the clear lower response following artificial infiltration is a compelling observation of the current study in the er assay bioactivity above the cut off level was detected in only one sample basin 3 albeit marginally furthermore no estrogenic activity above the cutoff level was detected in the sample collected from the wellfield following infiltration nor in the two dwtp s inlet samples riverbank filtration piloted for water supply systems has been demonstrated to remove thyroid disrupting chemicals as well in the recombinant thyroid hormone receptor tr gene yeast assay valcárcel et al 2018 while there appears to be a lack of toxicological effect based studies investigating the degradation of estrogenic compounds in artificially infiltrated drinking water sources other studies using chemical analyses have investigated the occurrence and elimination of endocrine disrupting compounds in groundwater recharge systems in germany for instance a study that investigated the removal of steroids during two different groundwater recharge systems riverbank infiltration and artificial groundwater replenishment observed significant decreases in the selected estrogenic compounds following these two processes zuehlke et al 2004 similarly a study that monitored the concentrations of 10 natural and synthetic estrogens and progestogens in water samples collected from two artificial recharge plants located in sweden and denmark detected only one compound estrone 3 sulfate following the recharge processes kuster et al 2010 as such while no to low estrogenic effects were detected in the current study the presence of hormones in mar systems has been observed in other non bioanalytical studies in brief the lower ahr bioactivities and lack of er bioactivities in the wellfield and dwtp intake samples compared to the preceding raw water samples river and basins where activities were detected above the respective cut off levels would suggest that artificial infiltration is an effective natural purification method in this study this is in contrast to the findings of our previous study at another swedish dwtp utilizing artificial infiltration wherein the artificial infiltration process appeared to be a source of contamination oskarsson et al 2021 as mentioned previously the contrasting findings may be attributed to several factors regarding the removal efficiency of the artificial infiltration process one explanation may be due to differences in the residence or travel time of the raw water in the subsurface the infiltrated water in the current study takes approximately six to eight months to reach the wellfields supplying the two dwtps the infiltrated water in the previous study takes seven to thirty days to percolate through the subsurface from the infiltration basins a longer travel time could therefore result in greater removal or dilution of bioactivity compounds to undetectable concentrations an alternative explanation could be due to the accumulation of contaminants in the subsurface in the case of the dwtp in our previous study oskarsson et al 2021 as revealed by oskarsson et al 2021 and elsewhere the artificial infiltration of aquifers may lead to the eventual mobilization of toxic naturally occurring contaminants into the water thereby compromising the water quality fakhreddine et al 2021 oskarsson et al 2021 further certain classes of hydrophilic organics that enter riverbank filtration systems can persist and migrate over prolonger time scales e g decades albergamo et al 2019 the fact that bioactivities above cut off levels following artificial infiltration were detected in the ahr assay but not in any of the other bioassays in this study may suggest that certain compounds present in infiltrated water cannot be as effectively removed during subsurface attenuation as others due to their resistance to biodegradation and the hydrophilic nature of the compounds even at low concentrations in the groundwater this has for instance been demonstrated for certain pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine and primidone personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds benotti et al 2012 debroux et al 2012 heberer et al 2004 hrkal et al 2018 compound specific characteristics such as hydrophilicity and recalcitrance may limit the amount of compound that will adsorb to soils or that can be biodegraded by the soil microbial community maeng et al 2011 also mobility during subsurface flow riverbank filtration depends on the polarity of the mps mishra et al 2021 next the fate of organic compounds and degree of attenuation during artificial recharge is influenced by multiple factors such as the retardation factor the distance and time spent in travel depth to water table sediment porosity and permeability groundwater flow and the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer mishra et al 2021 petrovic et al 2009 such characteristics of the aquifer include its lithology hydraulic and textural properties of the soil temperature and the microbial environment among these factors redox conditions of the aquifer play a significant role in that certain pollutants are preferably removed under some particular redox conditions barbieri et al 2011 valhondo et al 2015 finally there is the temporal aspect of the sampling strategy in the current study given that all samples were collected on the same day in this study it is likely that the composition of the water samples collected along each step of the total treatment process from the river water source would differ from each other further to this only one sampling event was conducted for this study seasonal differences in the quality and chemical profile of the raw water were therefore not assessed as described by jokela et al 2017 fluctuations in commonly monitored water quality parameters alone related to the organic matter content of river waters are typical jokela et al 2017 overall artificial filtration as a natural water purification method has been shown to have its benefits as well as limitations mainly in that it does not result in the complete removal of all bioactive mps and that it may be a cause of contamination of drinking water this treatment method therefore can serve as an effective pre treatment of raw water but should include some water quality monitoring with additional purification required thereafter in drinking water production 3 2 2 water purification at gränby and bäcklösa dwtps following artificial infiltration the surface water will have mixed with the groundwater refer to section 2 1 and then fed into the gränby and bäcklösa dwtps for further purification a secondary objective of the current study was to monitor the bioactivities across all treatment steps in the two dwtps fed the infiltrated groundwater in general consistent with the lack of nrf2 ar and er bioactivities detected in almost all samples collected between the river and wellfield locations samples from both dwtps were below cut off levels at ref 50 in all assays tested except in the ahr assay low ahr bioactivities either at or slightly above the cut off level were detected at ref 50 in several samples collected from both dwtps it is important to mention that these ahr activities were either lower or similar to what was observed in the raw water in the basins prior to artificial infiltration however that ahr activities above cut off were detected in some samples collected at the dwtps suggests the limited removal effect of ahr inducing compounds during the treatment processes utilized at the dwtps as mentioned in section 2 4 samples collected from the inlets outlets and distribution networks of both dwtps were further analyzed in dilution series to obtain cecs ec values and beqs were then determined to compare to other effect based studies on dwtps this was done for the ahr and er bioassays only based on the initial screening results as these two assays showed more frequent bioactivities above cut off levels at ref 50 compared to the nrf2 and ar bioassays however given the low levels of bioactivities detected in some of the samples at ref 50 it was necessary to increase the sensitivity in the assays by increasing the highest tested concentration to ref 200 the cecs and calculated results are presented in fig 3 and table 3 respectively for the gränby dwtp dilution series were possible to study for the inlet sample but not for the outlet sample due to a lack of sample volume however a mann whitney test of the ref 50 results for the outlet sample and the subsequent tap water sample yielded no significant differences in the ahr assay p 0 686 or the er assay p 0 343 consequently dilution series of the tap water sample were completed instead at the bäcklösa dwtp it should be pointed out that this plant receives water from two wellfields as mentioned previously low ahr was detected overall in all samples collected from both dwtps in the current study other effect based studies on river water sourced dwtps utilizing similar conventional treatment methods have reported higher activities escher et al 2014 for instance reported an ec10 value of ref 8 6 in the 24 h ahr caflux assay in finished drinking water samples collected from a river water sourced dwtp that utilized coagulation and filtration followed by chlorination and finishing with chloramination escher et al 2014 a previous study at that same australian dwtp reported ahr activity at 0 17 ng tcdd l in the finished drinking water macova et al 2011 in the er bioassay low estrogenic activities were detected in the current study in the finished drinking water samples collected from gränby and bäcklösa another effect based study investigating river water sourced dwtps reported reduced estrogenic activity to below the limit of detection eeqbio 3 00 10 2 ng e2 l in finished water samples following conventional treatments neale et al 2020 similarly ten dwtps sourced from surface stream water alluvial groundwater and deeper groundwater in an area of high agricultural use in the usa reported a low prevalence in the detection of er activity in the finished drinking water jones et al 2020 still much higher activities have been reported at other dwtps elsewhere such as 0 035 1 51 ng eeq l in the e screen assay in tap water samples collected from ten dwtps located throughout taiwan gou et al 2016 and an ec10 value greater than ref 30 in the e screen assay in finished drinking water samples collected from a river water sourced dwtp in australia escher et al 2014 furthermore the observed estrogenicity in the finished drinking water samples collected from both dwtps in the current study were at concentrations far below the suggested threshold of concern of 1 ng estradiol l recommended by the world health organization world health organisation europe 2017 and included in the 2022 watch list council of the european union 2020 in the eu drinking water directive drinking water parameter cooperation project support to the revision of annex i council directive 98 83 ec on the quality of water intended for human consumption drinking water directive 2017 4 conclusions mar techniques such as artificial infiltration are commonly utilized around the world to improve water quality and increase groundwater storage stefan and ansems 2018 however groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination by many of the same mps found in surface waters such an instance was previously shown at a swedish dwtp where the river water source was contaminated by hazardous chemicals during artificial infiltration oskarsson et al 2021 the current study involved an effect based evaluation of another swedish dwtp that utilizes artificial infiltration in its drinking water production in this case the artificial infiltration process seemed effective in reducing ahr and er bioactivities what is important to highlight is that there are still a very limited number of relevant effect based studies evaluating the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in removing chemical hazards given that artificial infiltration is commonly utilized around the world in drinking water production further research particularly using effect based methods is urgently needed to gain further understanding of the risks and benefits of this water treatment process future work with the current study could include additional sampling to observe any temporal differences along the artificial infiltration process it would also be worthwhile to investigate operational factors related to the infiltration process such as loading rates basin material and pre treatment which may optimize the reduction of bioactivities declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

15753,fecal sources to recreational surf zone waters should be identified to protect public health while watershed origins of human and other fecal sources are often discoverable by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of fecal markers using spatially stratified samples similarly assessing wastewater treatment plant wwtp outfall and other offshore contributions to surf zones is challenged by individual marker fate and transport here bacterial communities were assessed for relatedness between all hypothesized fecal sources and surf zone waters for two urban california recreational beaches by sequencing genes encoding 16s rrna and analyzing data using sourcetracker and feast ambient marine bacterial communities dominated the surf zone while fecal human dog or gull or wastewater sewage or treated wwtp effluent bacterial communities were present at low proportions and those from recycled water were absent based on the relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with human feces the abundances of hf183 in bacterial community sequences and feast and sourcetracker results when benchmarked to hf183 the major sources of hf183 to surf zone waters were human feces and treated wwtp effluent while surf zone sequence proportions from human sources feces sewage and treated wwtp effluent appeared uncorrelated to previously obtained qpcr hf183 results the proportions of human fecal and potential human pathogen sequences in surf zone waters were elevated when there were more swimmers i e during weekday afternoons holidays and busy weekends and race events thus confirming previously published qpcr based conclusions that bather shedding contributed low levels of human fecal contamination here bacterial community sequencing also showed evidence that treated wwtp effluent from an offshore outfall was entering the surf zone thereby resolving a prior uncertainty thus bacterial community sequencing not only confirms qpcr hf183 based human marker detections but further allows for confirming fecal sources for which individual marker quantification results can be equivocal graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking fecal contamination bacterial community beach water quality human fecal marker data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fecal contamination of coastal waters is an ongoing public health problem with large numbers of gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses occurring annually from pathogen exposure during recreation in contaminated coastal waters shuval 2003 fecal indicator bacteria fib including total coliforms fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococci are routinely monitored as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational surf zone waters in many regions including california harwood et al 2014 however fib can originate from animal feces that may pose less serious risks to public health than human feces due to host specificity of pathogens sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010 fib can also survive and propagate in beach sand wrack and aquatic vegetation harwood et al 2014 these phenomena underpin the disassociation of fib from human illness in numerous epidemiological studies arnold et al 2013 to discern human fecal contamination from other sources and to evaluate associated health risks in surf zone waters more accurately boehm et al 2015 microbial source tracking mst is necessary various mst approaches including comparisons to large libraries of molecularly typed fecal bacterial strains harwood et al 2014 have been employed to identify sources of fecal pollution current mst methods mainly enumerate molecular markers that target genes encoding 16s rrna of host coevolved or associated bacteria using quantitative pcr qpcr or droplet digital pcr ddpcr the application of host associated markers in previous investigations has suggested that seabirds and canines can be major proximate sources of fecal bacteria to recreational beach waters li et al 2021 and management practices such as using falconry or dogs to control gulls can dramatically reduce the levels of fib in surf zone waters converse et al 2012 goodwin et al 2016 however low but chronic human fecal marker hf183 has historically been documented along the california coastline during the summer dry season when swimmers are prevalent cao et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 riedel et al 2015 russell et al 2013 even after management practices have been implemented to address diverse potential sources los angeles regional water quality control board 2018 goodwin et al 2016 san diego regional water quality control board 2017 sikich et al 2018 determining origins of human fecal markers to recreational beaches is particularly important in mst but the complexities of urban environments often challenge locating human fecal sources to surf zone waters origins may be proximate such as nearshore sewer pipeline leakage or sewage overflows sikich et al 2018 or even bather shedding elmir et al 2007 and 2009 li et al 2021 origins may also be distal such as leaking sewers into upstream storm drains sercu et al 2009 and 2011 with the possibility that ensuing creek contamination could migrate through coastal lagoons or other transitional waters riedel et al 2015 into surf zones however much less has been investigated about potential distal offshore sources such as treated wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent discharged from ocean outfalls with ongoing migration towards surf zones li et al 2021 zimmer faust et al 2021 with over 40 wwtp outfalls discharging treated effluent off the coast of california heal the ocean 2010 understanding how to discern outfalls as potential sources of surf zone hf183 remains regionally important recently zimmer faust et al 2021 revealed the impact and reach of a treated wastewater discharge along a california coast but the outfall was located at the surf zone and not offshore in our recent study li et al 2021 although the predicted plume from the larger of the two wwtp ocean outfalls was deep and far offshore the treated effluent still contained quantifiable human marker hf183 and hf183 was occasionally observed in nearshore and offshore marine waters suggesting possible plume resurfacing and off to onshore transport however the levels of hf183 fecal markers in surf zone waters were low and the concentrations of indicators and hf183 markers along transects from offshore to nearshore while suggestive of a gradient that could imply treated wwtp effluent entering surf zone waters were low and inconsistent across sampling dates individual fecal marker attenuation for example owing to salinity light intensity dilution and food webs carneiro et al 2018 over long and uncertain transport pathways between ocean outfall diffusers and the surf zone could undermine their reliability for linking wwtp treated effluent as a continuous source of hf183 markers to the surf zone thus although outfalls discharging treated wwtp effluent might act as sources of low but chronic human fecal marker hf183 to the surf zone reliance on hf183 quantification alone is inadequate to trace effluent plumes here we hypothesized that whole bacterial community sequencing of genes encoding 16s rrna for dna archived during a large coastal mst study could enable more definitive discerning of the imprint on surf zone waters of treated wwtp effluent discharging from an offshore ocean outfall with advances in high throughput sequencing and based on bacterial species or operational taxonomic units otus shared between potential sources and contaminated samples whole bacterial community characterization has provided a more comprehensive platform for discriminating bacterial sources including fecal materials unno et al 2018 source specific microbial genera or species can be identified with multivariate statistics such as linear discriminant analysis of effect sizes lefse segata et al 2011 further sourcetracker knights et al 2011 a bayesian algorithm has successfully quantified source contributions to ecological patches with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity henry et al 2016 staley et al 2018 recently fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast became available to estimate the proportions of source contributions with a much higher computational efficiency by using a modified algorithm shenhav et al 2019 the utilization of multiple microbial taxa as source specific markers afforded by whole bacterial community sequencing can overcome uncertainty from individual marker attenuation as such community sequencing based mst can simultaneously reveal multiple contamination sources particularly those originating from afar duvert et al 2019 or post treatment liu et al 2018 relative to contaminated sites whole bacterial community analysis also has the potential to resolve physical inputs of human waste markers such as hf183 in the prior study upon which this research builds all hypothesized fecal sources were rigorously tested for two popular urban recreational beaches leadbetter beach and east beach at sycamore creek in santa barbara ca with bather shedding clearly identified as a source of hf183 fecal markers in surf zones yet while not ruling out treated wwtp effluent as another source li et al 2021 additionally the possible contamination of recycled water which is used for irrigation of plants including those proximate to the beaches was unresolved in surf zone waters li et al 2021 to understand the possible contributions of treated wwtp effluent and recycled water to chronically low hf183 impacted surf zones and to further confirm the impacts of bather shedding bacterial community analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing was utilized in this study to our best knowledge this is the first time that the contributions of human feces and sewage treated wwtp effluent and recycled water as well as non fecal sources including nearshore anchorage and offshore waters have been simultaneously examined for their influences on surf zone bacterial communities and hf183 content specifically potential human pathogens were further revealed by bacterial community sequencing thereby adding information to safeguard public health over and beyond qpcr of the hf183 human marker hf183 content was estimated here by sequencing and those results were compared to the previously published qpcr hf183 results the results of this study support the complementarity of bacterial community sequencing for coastal marine mst and further suggest its unique value to discerning effects to surf zones of distal ocean outfall discharges and possible pathogen content owing to the information richness inherent to bacterial community sequencing results 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations and hypothesized sources leadbetter beach lb and east beach eb at sycamore creek in santa barbara ca are popular for surfing and swimming but have historically had elevated fib in their surf zone waters to determine fib contamination sources comprehensive mst was previously performed during the dry season from 2015 to 2017 li et al 2021 while mst revealed that surf zone fib were mainly from seabirds and dogs there were also chronic low levels of hf183 potential regional background concentrations of hf183 were ruled out by sampling a remote reference site arroyo hondo while swimmers associated with human recreational activities were identified as sources of surf zone hf183 li et al 2021 however synchronous sampling of surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore marine waters fig s1 showed that hf183 was occasionally detected in nearshore and offshore waters thus leaving open the possibility that treated wwtp effluent discharging from either or both of two nearby ocean outfalls was contributing surf zone hf183 further the surf zone hf183 concentrations albeit chronic were low and thus there was uncertainty given likely attenuation of hf183 through circuitous off to onshore transport pathways and decay the details of sampling physicochemical analyses and fib measurements were described previously li et al 2021 here recognizing the greater density of data gathered with bacterial community sequencing it was hypothesized that 16s rrna sequences encoded in the archived dna extracted from surf zone n 259 including weekdays holiday and busy weekends and swimming race events nearshore n 56 anchorage n 20 and offshore n 15 water samples could be compared to sequences from potential fecal sources table s1 including raw sewage n 7 human n 9 dog n 11 and gull n 6 feces and treated wwtp effluent at one of the wwtps n 11 and from the ocean outfall diffusers of both wwtps n 6 to further examine the role of bather shedding in chronic surf zone hf183 and to further evaluate offshore hf183 sources such as treated wwtp effluent recycled water n 6 from the el estero wwtp which is the larger proximate and likely based on prior study influential source of treated effluent was included in this study as a possible source because recycled water contained detectable levels of hf183 and was used to irrigate public spaces but was not addressed comprehensively in the original mst study li et al 2021 2 2 dna extraction qpcr and sequencing the details of water filtration dna extraction and host fecal marker quantification were described in li et al 2021 briefly dna extraction of all water samples was performed using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen carol stream il following the manufacturer s protocol the presence of human dog and gull fecal materials was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr with hf183 as the human associated fecal marker dogbact as the dog marker and gull2taqman as the gull marker li et al 2021 the detailed procedures of dna amplification purification and normalization for 16s rrna sequencing was the same as before li et al 2020 the 27f forward primer 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and the 534r reverse primer 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 which target the v1 v3 region of genes encoding 16s rrna oh et al 2014 were used for pcr amplification filter blanks extraction blanks and no template controls were used as negative controls during pcr amplification amplification products were purified attached with dual indices and adapters normalized and pooled before paired end sequencing on the illumina miseq platform with a miseq v3 600 cycle kit 2 by 300 bp in the california nanosystems institute cnsi university of california santa barbara the sequencing data were deposited in ncbi with accession numbers from samn28816115 to samn28816526 and the bioproject id number as prjna844403 2

paired end reads were assembled with a minimum 80 base pair bp overlap the minimum sequence length was set to 460 bp after quality filtering valid sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity table s2 in total 21 796 410 sequences were obtained in this study and less than 100 sequences were obtained for two negative controls included in the sequencing representative sequences for each otu were picked and taxonomic data were assigned using the greengenes 13 8 aligned reference database possible chimeric sequences were checked with the chimeraslayer wrapper in qiime the human fecal marker hf183 is located in the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene sequence to quantify the hf183 marker copy number in sequencing data of each sample the human fecal marker hf183 specific sequence 5 atcatgagttcacatgtccg 3 was searched against the sequencing data of each sample using blastn script with 100 match and 100 coverage as described elsewhere li et al 2022 the fraction of hf183 sequence copy number versus the total number of sequences in each sequencing dataset was obtained to represent the proportion of hf183 sequence in bacterial community sequences of each sample raw sequences of each sample were also processed and aligned through the 16spip pipeline against a human pathogen 16s rrna sequence database consisting of 29 258 sequences representing 346 bacterial species miao et al 2017 the bwa mem algorithm was utilized for alignment and the sequences with similarity higher than 99 to reference sequences were identified as taxa of potential human health concern the percentage abundances of potential human pathogens in bacterial communities were obtained by calculating the ratios of the numbers of sequences of potential human pathogens versus the total number of sequences in the samples then multiplying the ratios by one hundred the weighted unifrac distance matrix generated in qiime was used for non metric multidimensional scaling

and human feces specific genera τ 0 24 p 0 0002 indicating that besides human feces treated wwtp effluent and sewage could have also contributed to human fecal contamination in surf zone waters

p 0 0001 and p 0 0009 respectively but were weak between the sewage proportions and the hf183 sequence ratios τ 0 13 and 0 16 p 0 04 and 0 01 respectively additionally the total relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with human feces and treated wwtp effluent also exhibited significant correlations with the ratios of human fecal marker hf183 in bacterial community sequences τ 0 40 and 0 21 p 0 0001 and p 0 0008 respectively these correlations revealed that both human feces and treated wwtp effluent were the major contributors of human fecal marker hf183 sequence in surf

all surf zone water samples τ 0 27 and 0 17 p 0 0001 and p 0 01 respectively n 238 the proportions of treated effluent in the 4 ocean outfall discharge samples from el estero wwtp were estimated to be

results were in accordance with the predictions of sourcetracker 27 7 62 8 60 5 and 62 1 and feast 28 5 59 9 61 6 and 57 4 4 discussion previous research has indicated that owing to many environmental factors marine bacterial communities are dynamic but also resilient over daily weekly monthly and seasonal timescales fuhrman et al 2015 similarly herein bacterial communities in the surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore varied with individual sampling dates regardless the bacterial community compositions in marine water samples of this study revealed by the dominant phyla and genera figs 1 and s2 were similar to those reported previously fuhrman et al 2015 needham and fuhrman 2016 wang et al 2021 additionally the marine bacterial community signature was dominant within surf zone samples with the proportions of marine bacteria as 81 0 and 80 1 on average estimated by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 in contrast contributions of diverse fecal sources consistently comprised a very small percentage 0 2 and 0 4 on average in all surf zone samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 and thus did not significantly shift the overall surf zone bacterial community previously we reported that the human fecal marker hf183 was detected in 37 0 of eb and lb surf zone water samples by using qpcr table s1 li et al 2021 however this percentage was only 9 2 by searching for the hf183 sequence in the bacterial community sequencing results and human feces contamination was only identified in 6 7 and 5 0 of surf zone water samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively we had hypothesized that sewage owing to its similarity to human feces and treated wwtp effluent were contributing hf183 markers to surf zone waters but the total percentage of surf zone water samples that was predicted to contain human feces sewage or treated wwtp effluent was 12 2 and 14 7 by sourcetracker and feast respectively which was still lower than that of hf183 qpcr detection results although there were significant correlations between three bacterial community sequencing based assessments of human fecal contamination sourcetracker and feast analyses relative abundances of specific bacterial genera associated with each human fecal source and the ratio of human fecal marker hf183 in bacterial community sequences remarkable discrepancy was still observed between community sequencing based methods and human fecal marker qpcr results such inconsistency was also observed for gull fecal contamination and between feast predictions and dog qpcr results gull fecal marker was detected by qpcr in all the samples and dog fecal marker was present in 60 6 of samples table s1 yet gull and dog fecal contamination were only predicted in 21 2 and 6 1 as well as 6 1 and 18 2 of these samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 until now few studies have compared bacterial community sequencing based methods with detection of fecal markers by qpcr for field samples in the study of bauza et al 2019 the human fecal marker hf183 was detected by qpcr in all soil samples but results from sequencing based methods including sourcetracker and specific bacterial genera revealed by lefse were discordant for most of the samples similar phenomena were also observed in the study of zimmer faust et al 2021 in which contamination levels using the sequencing based sourcetracker method were clearly much lower than those using fecal marker hf183 by ddpcr in contrast in the study by phelan et al 2019 sequencing based sourcetracker and lefse methods both provided more positive predictions of hf183 than qpcr for river water samples however the concentrations of hf183 by qpcr in the samples were much higher 1e 06 1e 07 copies 100 ml than the hf183 concentration observed in surf zone waters of this study overall discrepancies between qpcr and general bacterial community sequencing based sourcetracker and lefse methods were observed in previous studies as they were here to understand the inconsistency of community sequencing and qpcr results of host associated fecal markers the results of human fecal marker hf183 for treated wwtp effluent samples by sequencing and qpcr in this study were compared due to the positive detection results of hf183 in all 11 treated wwtp effluent samples by qpcr as well as community sequencing table s1 the hf183 content in sequences was nearly significantly correlated with qpcr hf183 results kendall correlation test τ 0 55 p 0 06 considering that 1 the average qpcr hf183 concentration in treated wwtp effluent was 2 37e 06 copies 100 ml 2 the average filtered volume of treated wwtp effluent was 144 ml 3 100 µl dna solution was obtained for each treated wwtp effluent sample during dna extraction with the average dna concentration of 56 5 ng µl and assuming 4 that the average bacterial genome weight is 2 5 fg button and robertson 2001 then 1 51 copies of hf183 per 103 bacterial genomes were detected in treated wwtp effluent by qpcr measurements this value is comparable with the average ratio of hf183 in treated wwtp effluent bacterial community dna obtained by sequencing table s1 0 90 copies per 103 bacterial 16s rrna sequences if further considering multiple copies of the 16s rrna gene carried by each bacterial genome such consistency between qpcr and sequencing methods indicates that there is no significant difference across these methods accuracies when hf183 concentrations are sufficiently high however for a low range of quantification the lower limit of quantification of hf183 was approximately 100 copies 100 ml level of hf183 qpcr detection in surf zone waters assuming the hf183 concentration is 200 copies 100 ml the filtered volume of surf zone water is 1500 ml and the average dna concentration is 30 ng µl only 0 25 copies of hf183 per 105 bacterial genomes can be quantified by qpcr roq level which is much lower than the detection limit of sequencing considering that the number of sequences obtained for each surf zone sample in this study was generally less than 1e 05 table s2 these results might explain the inconsistency and reduced sensitivity of overall bacterial community sequencing compared to qpcr quantification in this study however sequencing based methods can still reveal possible fecal sources not revealed by qpcr detection in this study 72 7 of surf zone water samples that were positive with hf183 by bacterial community sequencing were not positive for hf183 by qpcr table s1 additionally sequencing based mst methods can simultaneously determine the contamination of multiple fecal sources particularly fecal sources without any single robust fecal dna marker for qpcr detection such as treated wwtp effluent and recycled water further the sensitivity of detection based on sequencing can be improved by increasing the depth of sequencing for each sample table s2 the results of this study confirmed the presence of treated wwtp effluent in surf zone waters which possibly originated from the discharge of the el estero wwtp ocean outfall the more physically proximate of two outfalls in the region to the eb and lb surf zones the contribution from treated wwtp effluent was also observed in a few nearshore anchorage and offshore water samples as suggested by sourcetracker feast and bacterial genera specifically associated with treated wwtp effluent data not shown particularly in the surf zone water samples collected on 10 5 2017 when there were higher qpcr hf183 concentrations at two of the lb nearshore locations and one eb nearshore location than in the surf zone locations table s1 compared to individual fecal markers which likely decay during long distance transport carneiro et al 2018 the results of this study demonstrated the capability of sequencing based mst methods which inherently recruit multiple taxa as simultaneous source markers to identify the impacts of potential distal sources such as treated wwtp effluent meanwhile no contribution of recycled water which was widely used for irrigation of plants including those close to the beaches was observed for any surf zone water although contamination from raw sewage in surf zone waters was also suggested by both sourcetracker and feast there were no leaking sewers or other sewage specific fecal sources at the beaches in this study li et al 2021 the actual source was more likely human feces since sewage specific bacterial genera identified in this study were also human intestinal microorganisms yet further discerning the putative contributions of human feces versus sewage would require sequencing many more human fecal samples regardless just as was previously concluded in the qpcr based mst study li et al 2021 compared to samples collected in the morning during the studies of weekdays holiday and busy weekends and swimming race events the proportions of human feces predicted by sourcetracker and feast as well as potential human pathogens were higher in surf zone water collected in the afternoon particularly during swimming race events further confirming that bather shedding contributes to the human fecal contamination in these surf zone waters thus bacterial community sequencing here allowed for three critical advances upon the prior publication li et al 2021 definitively determining that treated wwtp effluent was a source of hf183 to the surf zones a question that was not previously answerable by qpcr hf183 alone confirming that bather shedding was contributing hf183 to the surf zones showing that while revealing putative bacterial pathogens and allowing for multiple source resolution bacterial community sequencing alone particularly for surf zones with low qpcr hf183 concentrations was not as sensitive as qpcr for host marker detection although the v1 v3 region of 16s rrna gene over 500 bp sequenced in this study can provide species level resolution as reported previously meisel et al 2016 oh et al 2014 and many of the potential human pathogens identified in this study were present in sewage ahrenfeldt et al 2020 the percentages of these potential human pathogens were generally extremely low or non detected in surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore water samples of this study table s3 suggesting that the overall health risk was very low 5 conclusions in this study bacterial community 16s rrna sequencing based mst was utilized to simultaneously quantify contributions from several possible fecal contamination sources to surf zone waters at two popular california urban recreational beaches both beaches had been subjected to prior comprehensive mst li et al 2021 but the influence of treated effluent from a nearby wwtp outfall and recycled water had remained uncertain as sources of hf183 markers to the surf zone here both sourcetracker and feast estimations suggested that nearshore anchorage and offshore waters were the dominant sources of bacterial communities in surf zone waters human feces and offshore treated wwtp effluent were found to be the major contributors of human fecal marker hf183 to surf zone waters thereby confirming prior qpcr hf183 results as to the role of bather shedding li et al 2021 but newly answering the question of whether treated wwtp effluent affected surf zone hf183 treated wwtp effluent migrating from an outfall discharging offshore into surf zones was identified based on multiple lines of evidence including sourcetracker and feast source estimations bacterial genera specifically associated with the treated wwtp effluent and the hf183 sequences in bacterial communities no measurable contribution of recycled water was observed in any surf zone water although it was widely used for irrigation including for areas proximate to the beaches the discrepancies observed between sequencing based results versus qpcr likely owe to the low levels of human fecal contamination thus allowing an examination of the lower threshold for bacterial community sequencing in mst overall this study demonstrated the ability of bacterial community sequencing as an

15753,fecal sources to recreational surf zone waters should be identified to protect public health while watershed origins of human and other fecal sources are often discoverable by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of fecal markers using spatially stratified samples similarly assessing wastewater treatment plant wwtp outfall and other offshore contributions to surf zones is challenged by individual marker fate and transport here bacterial communities were assessed for relatedness between all hypothesized fecal sources and surf zone waters for two urban california recreational beaches by sequencing genes encoding 16s rrna and analyzing data using sourcetracker and feast ambient marine bacterial communities dominated the surf zone while fecal human dog or gull or wastewater sewage or treated wwtp effluent bacterial communities were present at low proportions and those from recycled water were absent based on the relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with human feces the abundances of hf183 in bacterial community sequences and feast and sourcetracker results when benchmarked to hf183 the major sources of hf183 to surf zone waters were human feces and treated wwtp effluent while surf zone sequence proportions from human sources feces sewage and treated wwtp effluent appeared uncorrelated to previously obtained qpcr hf183 results the proportions of human fecal and potential human pathogen sequences in surf zone waters were elevated when there were more swimmers i e during weekday afternoons holidays and busy weekends and race events thus confirming previously published qpcr based conclusions that bather shedding contributed low levels of human fecal contamination here bacterial community sequencing also showed evidence that treated wwtp effluent from an offshore outfall was entering the surf zone thereby resolving a prior uncertainty thus bacterial community sequencing not only confirms qpcr hf183 based human marker detections but further allows for confirming fecal sources for which individual marker quantification results can be equivocal graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking fecal contamination bacterial community beach water quality human fecal marker data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fecal contamination of coastal waters is an ongoing public health problem with large numbers of gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses occurring annually from pathogen exposure during recreation in contaminated coastal waters shuval 2003 fecal indicator bacteria fib including total coliforms fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococci are routinely monitored as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational surf zone waters in many regions including california harwood et al 2014 however fib can originate from animal feces that may pose less serious risks to public health than human feces due to host specificity of pathogens sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010 fib can also survive and propagate in beach sand wrack and aquatic vegetation harwood et al 2014 these phenomena underpin the disassociation of fib from human illness in numerous epidemiological studies arnold et al 2013 to discern human fecal contamination from other sources and to evaluate associated health risks in surf zone waters more accurately boehm et al 2015 microbial source tracking mst is necessary various mst approaches including comparisons to large libraries of molecularly typed fecal bacterial strains harwood et al 2014 have been employed to identify sources of fecal pollution current mst methods mainly enumerate molecular markers that target genes encoding 16s rrna of host coevolved or associated bacteria using quantitative pcr qpcr or droplet digital pcr ddpcr the application of host associated markers in previous investigations has suggested that seabirds and canines can be major proximate sources of fecal bacteria to recreational beach waters li et al 2021 and management practices such as using falconry or dogs to control gulls can dramatically reduce the levels of fib in surf zone waters converse et al 2012 goodwin et al 2016 however low but chronic human fecal marker hf183 has historically been documented along the california coastline during the summer dry season when swimmers are prevalent cao et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 riedel et al 2015 russell et al 2013 even after management practices have been implemented to address diverse potential sources los angeles regional water quality control board 2018 goodwin et al 2016 san diego regional water quality control board 2017 sikich et al 2018 determining origins of human fecal markers to recreational beaches is particularly important in mst but the complexities of urban environments often challenge locating human fecal sources to surf zone waters origins may be proximate such as nearshore sewer pipeline leakage or sewage overflows sikich et al 2018 or even bather shedding elmir et al 2007 and 2009 li et al 2021 origins may also be distal such as leaking sewers into upstream storm drains sercu et al 2009 and 2011 with the possibility that ensuing creek contamination could migrate through coastal lagoons or other transitional waters riedel et al 2015 into surf zones however much less has been investigated about potential distal offshore sources such as treated wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent discharged from ocean outfalls with ongoing migration towards surf zones li et al 2021 zimmer faust et al 2021 with over 40 wwtp outfalls discharging treated effluent off the coast of california heal the ocean 2010 understanding how to discern outfalls as potential sources of surf zone hf183 remains regionally important recently zimmer faust et al 2021 revealed the impact and reach of a treated wastewater discharge along a california coast but the outfall was located at the surf zone and not offshore in our recent study li et al 2021 although the predicted plume from the larger of the two wwtp ocean outfalls was deep and far offshore the treated effluent still contained quantifiable human marker hf183 and hf183 was occasionally observed in nearshore and offshore marine waters suggesting possible plume resurfacing and off to onshore transport however the levels of hf183 fecal markers in surf zone waters were low and the concentrations of indicators and hf183 markers along transects from offshore to nearshore while suggestive of a gradient that could imply treated wwtp effluent entering surf zone waters were low and inconsistent across sampling dates individual fecal marker attenuation for example owing to salinity light intensity dilution and food webs carneiro et al 2018 over long and uncertain transport pathways between ocean outfall diffusers and the surf zone could undermine their reliability for linking wwtp treated effluent as a continuous source of hf183 markers to the surf zone thus although outfalls discharging treated wwtp effluent might act as sources of low but chronic human fecal marker hf183 to the surf zone reliance on hf183 quantification alone is inadequate to trace effluent plumes here we hypothesized that whole bacterial community sequencing of genes encoding 16s rrna for dna archived during a large coastal mst study could enable more definitive discerning of the imprint on surf zone waters of treated wwtp effluent discharging from an offshore ocean outfall with advances in high throughput sequencing and based on bacterial species or operational taxonomic units otus shared between potential sources and contaminated samples whole bacterial community characterization has provided a more comprehensive platform for discriminating bacterial sources including fecal materials unno et al 2018 source specific microbial genera or species can be identified with multivariate statistics such as linear discriminant analysis of effect sizes lefse segata et al 2011 further sourcetracker knights et al 2011 a bayesian algorithm has successfully quantified source contributions to ecological patches with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity henry et al 2016 staley et al 2018 recently fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast became available to estimate the proportions of source contributions with a much higher computational efficiency by using a modified algorithm shenhav et al 2019 the utilization of multiple microbial taxa as source specific markers afforded by whole bacterial community sequencing can overcome uncertainty from individual marker attenuation as such community sequencing based mst can simultaneously reveal multiple contamination sources particularly those originating from afar duvert et al 2019 or post treatment liu et al 2018 relative to contaminated sites whole bacterial community analysis also has the potential to resolve physical inputs of human waste markers such as hf183 in the prior study upon which this research builds all hypothesized fecal sources were rigorously tested for two popular urban recreational beaches leadbetter beach and east beach at sycamore creek in santa barbara ca with bather shedding clearly identified as a source of hf183 fecal markers in surf zones yet while not ruling out treated wwtp effluent as another source li et al 2021 additionally the possible contamination of recycled water which is used for irrigation of plants including those proximate to the beaches was unresolved in surf zone waters li et al 2021 to understand the possible contributions of treated wwtp effluent and recycled water to chronically low hf183 impacted surf zones and to further confirm the impacts of bather shedding bacterial community analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing was utilized in this study to our best knowledge this is the first time that the contributions of human feces and sewage treated wwtp effluent and recycled water as well as non fecal sources including nearshore anchorage and offshore waters have been simultaneously examined for their influences on surf zone bacterial communities and hf183 content specifically potential human pathogens were further revealed by bacterial community sequencing thereby adding information to safeguard public health over and beyond qpcr of the hf183 human marker hf183 content was estimated here by sequencing and those results were compared to the previously published qpcr hf183 results the results of this study support the complementarity of bacterial community sequencing for coastal marine mst and further suggest its unique value to discerning effects to surf zones of distal ocean outfall discharges and possible pathogen content owing to the information richness inherent to bacterial community sequencing results 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations and hypothesized sources leadbetter beach lb and east beach eb at sycamore creek in santa barbara ca are popular for surfing and swimming but have historically had elevated fib in their surf zone waters to determine fib contamination sources comprehensive mst was previously performed during the dry season from 2015 to 2017 li et al 2021 while mst revealed that surf zone fib were mainly from seabirds and dogs there were also chronic low levels of hf183 potential regional background concentrations of hf183 were ruled out by sampling a remote reference site arroyo hondo while swimmers associated with human recreational activities were identified as sources of surf zone hf183 li et al 2021 however synchronous sampling of surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore marine waters fig s1 showed that hf183 was occasionally detected in nearshore and offshore waters thus leaving open the possibility that treated wwtp effluent discharging from either or both of two nearby ocean outfalls was contributing surf zone hf183 further the surf zone hf183 concentrations albeit chronic were low and thus there was uncertainty given likely attenuation of hf183 through circuitous off to onshore transport pathways and decay the details of sampling physicochemical analyses and fib measurements were described previously li et al 2021 here recognizing the greater density of data gathered with bacterial community sequencing it was hypothesized that 16s rrna sequences encoded in the archived dna extracted from surf zone n 259 including weekdays holiday and busy weekends and swimming race events nearshore n 56 anchorage n 20 and offshore n 15 water samples could be compared to sequences from potential fecal sources table s1 including raw sewage n 7 human n 9 dog n 11 and gull n 6 feces and treated wwtp effluent at one of the wwtps n 11 and from the ocean outfall diffusers of both wwtps n 6 to further examine the role of bather shedding in chronic surf zone hf183 and to further evaluate offshore hf183 sources such as treated wwtp effluent recycled water n 6 from the el estero wwtp which is the larger proximate and likely based on prior study influential source of treated effluent was included in this study as a possible source because recycled water contained detectable levels of hf183 and was used to irrigate public spaces but was not addressed comprehensively in the original mst study li et al 2021 2 2 dna extraction qpcr and sequencing the details of water filtration dna extraction and host fecal marker quantification were described in li et al 2021 briefly dna extraction of all water samples was performed using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen carol stream il following the manufacturer s protocol the presence of human dog and gull fecal materials was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr with hf183 as the human associated fecal marker dogbact as the dog marker and gull2taqman as the gull marker li et al 2021 the detailed procedures of dna amplification purification and normalization for 16s rrna sequencing was the same as before li et al 2020 the 27f forward primer 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and the 534r reverse primer 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 which target the v1 v3 region of genes encoding 16s rrna oh et al 2014 were used for pcr amplification filter blanks extraction blanks and no template controls were used as negative controls during pcr amplification amplification products were purified attached with dual indices and adapters normalized and pooled before paired end sequencing on the illumina miseq platform with a miseq v3 600 cycle kit 2 by 300 bp in the california nanosystems institute cnsi university of california santa barbara the sequencing data were deposited in ncbi with accession numbers from samn28816115 to samn28816526 and the bioproject id number as prjna844403 2

paired end reads were assembled with a minimum 80 base pair bp overlap the minimum sequence length was set to 460 bp after quality filtering valid sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity table s2 in total 21 796 410 sequences were obtained in this study and less than 100 sequences were obtained for two negative controls included in the sequencing representative sequences for each otu were picked and taxonomic data were assigned using the greengenes 13 8 aligned reference database possible chimeric sequences were checked with the chimeraslayer wrapper in qiime the human fecal marker hf183 is located in the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene sequence to quantify the hf183 marker copy number in sequencing data of each sample the human fecal marker hf183 specific sequence 5 atcatgagttcacatgtccg 3 was searched against the sequencing data of each sample using blastn script with 100 match and 100 coverage as described elsewhere li et al 2022 the fraction of hf183 sequence copy number versus the total number of sequences in each sequencing dataset was obtained to represent the proportion of hf183 sequence in bacterial community sequences of each sample raw sequences of each sample were also processed and aligned through the 16spip pipeline against a human pathogen 16s rrna sequence database consisting of 29 258 sequences representing 346 bacterial species miao et al 2017 the bwa mem algorithm was utilized for alignment and the sequences with similarity higher than 99 to reference sequences were identified as taxa of potential human health concern the percentage abundances of potential human pathogens in bacterial communities were obtained by calculating the ratios of the numbers of sequences of potential human pathogens versus the total number of sequences in the samples then multiplying the ratios by one hundred the weighted unifrac distance matrix generated in qiime was used for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds with primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 bacterial genera significantly associated with potential fecal sources were determined with the lefse algorithm segata et al 2011 as well as the deseq2 method

potential human pathogen sequences in all samples potential human pathogen sequences were identified in 100 81 8 and 88 9 of gull dog and human fecal samples table s3 the average percentage abundance

surf zone waters with the average proportions up to 52 9 and 50 4 respectively followed by anchorage 21 8 and 18 5 respectively and offshore waters 6 4 and 11 5 respectively the predicted proportions of nearshore anchorage and offshore aquatic bacterial communities in all surf zone water samples by sourcetracker significantly correlated with those by feast table s5 kendall correlation test all τ 0 48 all p 0 0001 n 238 in contrast fecal sources including human dog and gull feces sewage treated wwtp effluent and recycled water contributed much less to the bacterial communities of surf zone waters sewage contamination was identified in 4 6 and 5 9 of surf zone samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively with the average proportions individually as 0 001 and 0 03 treated wwtp effluent was present in 3 4 and 7 1 of surf zone water samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively and the average proportions were both 0 2 recycled water was not identified in any surf zone water sample

anchorage and offshore waters in the vicinity of eb and lb were similar to bacterial communities in surf zone waters of the reference beach arroyo hondo data not shown indicating shared marine taxa across the region however no contamination by human or dog feces sewage treated wwtp effluent or recycled water was evidenced in any surf zone water sample of arroyo hondo with the exception of gull feces table s4 for the four el estero wwtp ocean outfall discharge samples the proportions of treated wwtp effluent were individually 27 7 62 8 60 5 and 62 1 predicted by sourcetracker and 28 5 59 9 61 6 and 57 4 by feast the proportions of marine water including nearshore anchorage and offshore were individually 58 5 22 6 12 6 and 27 0 by sourcetracker and 52 5 16 3 6 8 and 12 0 by feast confirming that the ocean outfall discharge samples were mixtures of treated wwtp effluent and marine water li et al 2021 3 4 human fecal marker hf183 identified in bacterial community sequences the representation of human fecal marker hf183 in bacterial community sequences was studied for all samples table s1 the hf183 sequence was identified in 77 8 of human feces 7 of 9 human fecal samples bacterial communities with the proportion ranging from 0 to 1 8 and the average proportion of 0 4 the hf183 sequence was not detected in any gull feces while present in 1 of 11 dog feces with the proportion of 0 01 in contrast it was present in all sewage 7 of 7 treated wwtp effluent 11 of 11 and almost all 5 of 6 recycled water bacterial communities the average proportion of hf183 sequence was individually 0 3 0 09 and 0 06 in sewage treated wwtp effluent and recycled water samples respectively and was 0 08 in the four el estero wwtp ocean outfall discharge samples the hf183 sequence was not detected in any arroyo hondo surf zone bacterial community but was present in 9 2 of eb and lb surf zone water samples this percentage decreased to 5 4 in nearshore waters and to 5 0 in anchorage waters and further to 0 in offshore waters correspondingly the average proportion of the hf183 sequence in the bacterial community was individually 0 0004 0 00008 0 00006 and 0 in eb and lb surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore water samples respectively 3 5 correlations among sourcetracker and feast predictions specific bacterial genera host fecal markers and potential human pathogens the predicted percentage of human feces by sourcetracker showed a significant correlation with the total relative abundance of bacterial genera specifically associated with human feces fig 3 in all eb and lb surf zone waters table s5 kendall correlation test τ 0 28 p 0 0001 n 238 such correlations were further observed between the predicted proportions of treated wwtp effluent by both sourcetracker and feast and the total relative abundance of human feces specific genera τ 0 28 and 0 17 p 0 0001 and p 0 008 respectively as well as between the proportions of sewage by sourcetracker and human feces specific genera τ 0 24 p 0 0002 indicating that besides human feces treated wwtp effluent and sewage could have also contributed to human fecal contamination in surf zone waters furthermore the predicted percentages of human feces by both sourcetracker and feast showed significant correlations with the ratios of the hf183 sequence in bacterial community sequences kendall correlation test τ 0 37 and 0 21 p 0 0001 and p 0 0009 respectively such correlations were significant between the proportions of treated wwtp effluent and the ratios of hf183 sequence τ 0 36 and 0 21 p 0 0001 and p 0 0009 respectively but were weak between the sewage proportions and the hf183 sequence ratios τ 0 13 and 0 16 p 0 04 and 0 01 respectively additionally the total relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with human feces and treated wwtp effluent also exhibited significant correlations with the ratios of human fecal marker hf183 in bacterial community sequences τ 0 40 and 0 21 p 0 0001 and p 0 0008 respectively these correlations revealed that both human feces and treated wwtp effluent were the major contributors of human fecal marker hf183 sequence in surf zone waters however correlations were not observed between proportions of any fecal sources including human feces sewage and treated wwtp effluent predicted by sourcetracker or feast and human marker hf183 qpcr results in surf zone waters table s1 kendall correlation test all p 0 10 or between the ratios of human marker hf183 sequence in bacterial community sequences and hf183 qpcr results τ 0 08 p 0 15 indicating the inconsistency of 16s rrna sequencing and qpcr in the detection of human marker hf183 the predicted proportions of dog feces by both sourcetracker and feast showed significant correlations with the total relative abundances of dog feces specific bacterial genera fig 3 in all surf zone water samples table s5 kendall correlation test τ 0 39 and 0 16 p 0 0001 and p 0 01 respectively n 238 similarly the predicted proportions of gull feces by sourcetracker significantly correlated with the total relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with gull feces in all surf zone waters τ 0 30 p 0 0001 n 238 the sourcetracker predicted proportions of dog feces and the qpcr results of dog fecal marker were correlated kendall correlation test τ 0 40 p 0 02 n 33 however neither the feast predicted proportions and dog marker nor the predicted proportions of gull feces by either algorithm with gull fecal marker qpcr results were correlated table s1 finally the predicted proportions of treated wwtp effluent by both sourcetracker and feast correlated significantly with the total relative abundances of bacterial genera specifically associated with treated wwtp effluent τ 0 31 and 0 21 p 0 0001 and p 0 001 respectively n 238 these correlations between the proportions of fecal sources and the total relative abundance of their specific bacterial genera confirmed the predictions of sourcetracker and feast the proportions of treated wwtp effluent by both algorithms further significantly correlated with the percentages of potential human pathogens in all surf zone water samples τ 0 27 and 0 17 p 0 0001 and p 0 01 respectively n 238 the proportions of treated effluent in the 4 ocean outfall discharge samples from el estero wwtp were estimated to be individually 21 7 61 1 67 3 and 65 6 based on the total relative abundance of treated wwtp effluent specific bacterial genera in ocean outfall discharge samples and in treated wwtp effluent these results were in accordance with the predictions of sourcetracker 27 7 62 8 60 5 and 62 1 and feast 28 5 59 9 61 6 and 57 4 4 discussion previous research has indicated that owing to many environmental factors marine bacterial communities are dynamic but also resilient over daily weekly monthly and seasonal timescales fuhrman et al 2015 similarly herein bacterial communities in the surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore varied with individual sampling dates regardless the bacterial community compositions in marine water samples of this study revealed by the dominant phyla and genera figs 1 and s2 were similar to those reported previously fuhrman et al 2015 needham and fuhrman 2016 wang et al 2021 additionally the marine bacterial community signature was dominant within surf zone samples with the proportions of marine bacteria as 81 0 and 80 1 on average estimated by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 in contrast contributions of diverse fecal sources consistently comprised a very small percentage 0 2 and 0 4 on average in all surf zone samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 and thus did not significantly shift the overall surf zone bacterial community previously we reported that the human fecal marker hf183 was detected in 37 0 of eb and lb surf zone water samples by using qpcr table s1 li et al 2021 however this percentage was only 9 2 by searching for the hf183 sequence in the bacterial community sequencing results and human feces contamination was only identified in 6 7 and 5 0 of surf zone water samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively we had hypothesized that sewage owing to its similarity to human feces and treated wwtp effluent were contributing hf183 markers to surf zone waters but the total percentage of surf zone water samples that was predicted to contain human feces sewage or treated wwtp effluent was 12 2 and 14 7 by sourcetracker and feast respectively which was still lower than that of hf183 qpcr detection results although there were significant correlations between three bacterial community sequencing based assessments of human fecal contamination sourcetracker and feast analyses relative abundances of specific bacterial genera associated with each human fecal source and the ratio of human fecal marker hf183 in bacterial community sequences remarkable discrepancy was still observed between community sequencing based methods and human fecal marker qpcr results such inconsistency was also observed for gull fecal contamination and between feast predictions and dog qpcr results gull fecal marker was detected by qpcr in all the samples and dog fecal marker was present in 60 6 of samples table s1 yet gull and dog fecal contamination were only predicted in 21 2 and 6 1 as well as 6 1 and 18 2 of these samples by sourcetracker and feast respectively table s4 until now few studies have compared bacterial community sequencing based methods with detection of fecal markers by qpcr for field samples in the study of bauza et al 2019 the human fecal marker hf183 was detected by qpcr in all soil samples but results from sequencing based methods including sourcetracker and specific bacterial genera revealed by lefse were discordant for most of the samples similar phenomena were also observed in the study of zimmer faust et al 2021 in which contamination levels using the sequencing based sourcetracker method were clearly much lower than those using fecal marker hf183 by ddpcr in contrast in the study by phelan et al 2019 sequencing based sourcetracker and lefse methods both provided more positive predictions of hf183 than qpcr for river water samples however the concentrations of hf183 by qpcr in the samples were much higher 1e 06 1e 07 copies 100 ml than the hf183 concentration observed in surf zone waters of this study overall discrepancies between qpcr and general bacterial community sequencing based sourcetracker and lefse methods were observed in previous studies as they were here to understand the inconsistency of community sequencing and qpcr results of host associated fecal markers the results of human fecal marker hf183 for treated wwtp effluent samples by sequencing and qpcr in this study were compared due to the positive detection results of hf183 in all 11 treated wwtp effluent samples by qpcr as well as community sequencing table s1 the hf183 content in sequences was nearly significantly correlated with qpcr hf183 results kendall correlation test τ 0 55 p 0 06 considering that 1 the average qpcr hf183 concentration in treated wwtp effluent was 2 37e 06 copies 100 ml 2 the average filtered volume of treated wwtp effluent was 144 ml 3 100 µl dna solution was obtained for each treated wwtp effluent sample during dna extraction with the average dna concentration of 56 5 ng µl and assuming 4 that the average bacterial genome weight is 2 5 fg button and robertson 2001 then 1 51 copies of hf183 per 103 bacterial genomes were detected in treated wwtp effluent by qpcr measurements this value is comparable with the average ratio of hf183 in treated wwtp effluent bacterial community dna obtained by sequencing table s1 0 90 copies per 103 bacterial 16s rrna sequences if further considering multiple copies of the 16s rrna gene carried by each bacterial genome such consistency between qpcr and sequencing methods indicates that there is no significant difference across these methods accuracies when hf183 concentrations are sufficiently high however for a low range of quantification the lower limit of quantification of hf183 was approximately 100 copies 100 ml level of hf183 qpcr detection in surf zone waters assuming the hf183 concentration is 200 copies 100 ml the filtered volume of surf zone water is 1500 ml and the average dna concentration is 30 ng µl only 0 25 copies of hf183 per 105 bacterial genomes can be quantified by qpcr roq level which is much lower than the detection limit of sequencing considering that the number of sequences obtained for each surf zone sample in this study was generally less than 1e 05 table s2 these results might explain the inconsistency and reduced sensitivity of overall bacterial community sequencing compared to qpcr quantification in this study however sequencing based methods can still reveal possible fecal sources not revealed by qpcr detection in this study 72 7 of surf zone water samples that were positive with hf183 by bacterial community sequencing were not positive for hf183 by qpcr table s1 additionally sequencing based mst methods can simultaneously determine the contamination of multiple fecal sources particularly fecal sources without any single robust fecal dna marker for qpcr detection such as treated wwtp effluent and recycled water further the sensitivity of detection based on sequencing can be improved by increasing the depth of sequencing for each sample table s2 the results of this study confirmed the presence of treated wwtp effluent in surf zone waters which possibly originated from the discharge of the el estero wwtp ocean outfall the more physically proximate of two outfalls in the region to the eb and lb surf zones the contribution from treated wwtp effluent was also observed in a few nearshore anchorage and offshore water samples as suggested by sourcetracker feast and bacterial genera specifically associated with treated wwtp effluent data not shown particularly in the surf zone water samples collected on 10 5 2017 when there were higher qpcr hf183 concentrations at two of the lb nearshore locations and one eb nearshore location than in the surf zone locations table s1 compared to individual fecal markers which likely decay during long distance transport carneiro et al 2018 the results of this study demonstrated the capability of sequencing based mst methods which inherently recruit multiple taxa as simultaneous source markers to identify the impacts of potential distal sources such as treated wwtp effluent meanwhile no contribution of recycled water which was widely used for irrigation of plants including those close to the beaches was observed for any surf zone water although contamination from raw sewage in surf zone waters was also suggested by both sourcetracker and feast there were no leaking sewers or other sewage specific fecal sources at the beaches in this study li et al 2021 the actual source was more likely human feces since sewage specific bacterial genera identified in this study were also human intestinal microorganisms yet further discerning the putative contributions of human feces versus sewage would require sequencing many more human fecal samples regardless just as was previously concluded in the qpcr based mst study li et al 2021 compared to samples collected in the morning during the studies of weekdays holiday and busy weekends and swimming race events the proportions of human feces predicted by sourcetracker and feast as well as potential human pathogens were higher in surf zone water collected in the afternoon particularly during swimming race events further confirming that bather shedding contributes to the human fecal contamination in these surf zone waters thus bacterial community sequencing here allowed for three critical advances upon the prior publication li et al 2021 definitively determining that treated wwtp effluent was a source of hf183 to the surf zones a question that was not previously answerable by qpcr hf183 alone confirming that bather shedding was contributing hf183 to the surf zones showing that while revealing putative bacterial pathogens and allowing for multiple source resolution bacterial community sequencing alone particularly for surf zones with low qpcr hf183 concentrations was not as sensitive as qpcr for host marker detection although the v1 v3 region of 16s rrna gene over 500 bp sequenced in this study can provide species level resolution as reported previously meisel et al 2016 oh et al 2014 and many of the potential human pathogens identified in this study were present in sewage ahrenfeldt et al 2020 the percentages of these potential human pathogens were generally extremely low or non detected in surf zone nearshore anchorage and offshore water samples of this study table s3 suggesting that the overall health risk was very low 5 conclusions in this study bacterial community 16s rrna sequencing based mst was utilized to simultaneously quantify contributions from several possible fecal contamination sources to surf zone waters at two popular california urban recreational beaches both beaches had been subjected to prior comprehensive mst li et al 2021 but the influence of treated effluent from a nearby wwtp outfall and recycled water had remained uncertain as sources of hf183 markers to the surf zone here both sourcetracker and feast estimations suggested that nearshore anchorage and offshore waters were the dominant sources of bacterial communities in surf zone waters human feces and offshore treated wwtp effluent were found to be the major contributors of human fecal marker hf183 to surf zone waters thereby confirming prior qpcr hf183 results as to the role of bather shedding li et al 2021 but newly answering the question of whether treated wwtp effluent affected surf zone hf183 treated wwtp effluent migrating from an outfall discharging offshore into surf zones was identified based on multiple lines of evidence including sourcetracker and feast source estimations bacterial genera specifically associated with the treated wwtp effluent and the hf183 sequences in bacterial communities no measurable contribution of recycled water was observed in any surf zone water although it was widely used for irrigation including for areas proximate to the beaches the discrepancies observed between sequencing based results versus qpcr likely owe to the low levels of human fecal contamination thus allowing an examination of the lower threshold for bacterial community sequencing in mst overall this study demonstrated the ability of bacterial community sequencing as an information rich mst tool for revealing complex fecal sources from proximate and distal origins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15754,the transport of microplastics mp or nanoplastics np in porous media has been widely reported however their mutual interaction and effect on cotransport remain unclear here we investigated the colloidal interaction between np 50 nm submicroplastics sp 300 nm and mp 1000 nm in seawater and their cotransport in saturated natural sea sands in the single component suspension the recovered mass percentage meff of colloids was as follows mp 47 81 np 24 18 sp 21 66 sp and mp remained monodispersed mp had the highest mobility due to the strongest electrostatic repulsion with sand surface whereas np formed homoaggregates and was characterized by ripening phenomena in the sp mp mixture sp and mp kept independent mobility without mutual effect in the np sp mp mixture the meff of mp was reduced by 10 because unstable np induced mp to form heteroaggregates with sp which could not pass through the pores in addition np attached to the sand surface could form additional retention sites to retain mp by contrast sp showed a 13 increase in meff because mp became an indirect carrier of sp through the bridging of np overall this study demonstrates the dominant role of unstable np in the cotransport of np sp mp in the marine sedimentary environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics submicroplastics nanoplastics transport seawater data availability data

potential threats to marine ecosystems as they may be inadvertently consumed by sea creatures mitrano 2019 peng et al 2020b these small scale plastics ssp are not a single contaminant but rather a

a worrying aspect with ssp is their transport potentials in marine sediments courtene jones et al 2020 lusher et al 2015 ssp are found to be hidden in deep sediment to a depth of 60 cm xue et al 2020 which may show adverse effects on the habitat of benthos corinaldesi et al 2021 besides bioturbation the vertical mobility in the sediment of ssp which is closely related to their physical characteristics and hydrochemical properties of seawater should not be overlooked kumar et al 2021 the particle size of ssp is a critical feature affecting their transport in porous media in a single component system the relative colloid effluent concentration c c0 of plastic colloids pc usually decreases with increasing pc size bradford et al 2003 this finding indicates that large pc may easily get trapped by the collector whereas small pc can travel long distances to pass through the porous media bradford et al 2007 shaniv et al 2021 song et al 2019 yang et al 2015 these observations are usually involved in low ionic strength or salinity solutions in which the sufficiently negative zeta ζ potential of pc causes them to repel each other electrostatically and keep them dispersed in an estuarine environment the aggregation of pc is expected to occur because the salinity intrusion leads to colloidal destabilization sun et al 2021 wu et al 2019 seawater typically has a salinity of approximately 35 practical salinity units psu which is also expressed as mass salinity of around 35 g kg 1 in seawater polystyrene np particles e g 30 40 and 90 nm in size with a high surface area to volume ratio can easily form homoaggregates with a diameter larger than 1 μm due to the cation shielding effect della torre et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the aggregation of nanoparticles may dramatically reduce their transport in porous media because of the increase of collision frequency physical trapping and size exclusion babakhani 2019 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 for example the smaller sp particles 100 400 and 600 nm can aggregate individually in seawater and their mobility in porous media to be remarkably lower than that of the larger sp and mp 800 1500 and 2000 nm dong et al 2018 mp are usually well dispersed either in freshwater besseling et al 2017 or seawater dong et al 2018 due to strong electrostatic repulsions gui et al 2022 and low collision frequency sun et al 2021 between particles nevertheless their individual transport may still have mutual influence the retention of monodispersed mp in porous media is affected by attachment straining and wedging physical blockage by the grooves on the surface of porous media johnson et al 2007 2010 the trapped and or wedged mp will prevent the re entrainment of small mp near the grain to grain contacts back into the pore water ma et al 2017 large mp on the surface of porous media provide extra retention or wedging sites for small mp ma et al 2017 xu and saiers 2009 therefore large particle ssp affect the transport of small ones previous studies showed that the heteroaggregation between monodispersed mp and unstable nanoparticles can influence the individual transport of mp and nanoparticles cai et al 2019 found that the predeposited nano tio2 can provide additional deposition sites for mp thus promoting the retention of mp on the contrary nanokaolinite in solution may compete with mp kaolinite heteroaggregates for deposition sites thereby increasing the mobility of kaolinite and mp li et al 2020 peng et al 2017 demostrated that graphene oxide go can enhance the mobility of sp or mp in porous media saturated with 10 and 50 mmol l 1 nacl solution which is driven by the go facilitated transport because a gigantic go layer interacts with and carries on plastic particles another observation of the heteroaggregation and cotransport of carboxylate modified sp with c60 1 1 mass ratio found that sp strongly inhibit the aggregation of c60 in seawater c60 particles can be attached to the surface of sp to form monodispersed nanohybrids and sp serve as carriers for part of c60 to transport in porous media dong et al 2019 in analogy to these plastic nanomineral and plastic nanocarbon systems the coexistence of mp sp and np in seawater is likely to form homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates which have important influences on the mobility and fate of plastics in porous media however knowledge on the effect of ssp aggregation on their cotransport is limited this work aims to investigate the mutual effect of plastic particles of various sizes in 35 psu seawater and explore their cotransport and retention behaviors in saturated porous media polystyrene mp sp and np are chosen as plastic models because they are commonly used as personal care products and drug delivery carriers al thawadi 2020 sussarellu et al 2016 the aggregation behaviors breakthrough curves and retention profiles of mp sp and np in single binary and trinary suspensions are comprehensively studied to clarify their stability and interaction in seawater and the underlying cotransport mechanism in seawater saturated porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural

one dimensional glass column experiments length 24 8 cm inside diameter 1 6 cm were conducted to investigate the transport and retention of single and multiple component plastic particles the stainless steel screen with 50 μm aperture was installed at both ends of the column the natural sand was wetted and packed into the glass column during the process the liquid level was always slightly higher 1 cm than the sand after filling the sand with a height of 1 cm the packed column was tapped with a rubber mallet to expel any small bubble that might exist finally the average height of the sand filled in each experimental column was 23 6 0 2 cm the average dry weight of sand was about 80 86 0 12 g and the porosity was 37 6 0 4 table s1 a peristaltic pump was used to inject seawater from bottom to top to avoid unsaturated transport the rate of particle deposition in up flow direction may be greater than that in down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 before experiment 100 ml background solution 4 7 pore volume pv was pumped to rinse the packed column and reach saturation at the flow rate of 1 50 0 10 ml min 1 during transport experiments the suspension of plastic particles and background seawater solution was successively pumped into the column for 42 min 3 0 pv at the same flow rate then the effluent was collected every 160 s 4 ml to determine the concentration of plastic particles passing through the column to obtain breakthrough curves btcs the research methods of the conservative tracer potassium iodide transport experiment and the pre equilibration experiment of plastic particles are presented in the supporting information text s2 the retention profiles of particles were obtained in accordance with our previous study dong et al 2020 in brief the sand column was divided into sections with a height of about 2 cm and then transferred into 45 ml glass vials subsequently 25 ml deionized water was added into vials to shake for 60 min and wash out residual particles from sand surfaces the supernatant was taken to determine the particle concentration and the particle distribution at different depths was further obtained the retention experiment was carried out three times and reserve the results of three data average value the measurement method of particle concentration is given in section 2 3 and supplementary material the calculated mass balance results of experiments under different conditions are shown in table 1 2 3 analytical methods before colloid measurement all suspensions were sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min to break possible colloidal aggregates the dynamic hydrodynamic diameter ddls of suspension was obtained through time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements and the ζ potential of the suspension was measured using the zetasizer nano marvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the dispersion and aggregation states of np sp and mp were observed using tem jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan the aggregation and sedimentation curves of the colloid were expressed by the change in ddls and relative colloidal suspension concentration cs cs 0 over time in a single component suspension a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md was used to measure the ultraviolet absorbance values of np sp and mp in effluents at 228 nm and their concentrations were calculated by their standard curves of uv vis absorbance by diluting the single suspension into different proportions to configure a series of concentrations and measuring the corresponding uv vis absorbance the linear relationship between the concentration and uv vis absorbance of np sp and mp could be obtained fig s2a the fluorescence intensities of sp and mp in the effluent could also be measured separately by a fluorescence spectrophotometry f4000 hitachi japan the excitation and emission wavelengths of sp were 440 and 486 nm respectively and those of mp were 530 and 560 nm respectively preliminary experiments presented that the coexisting plastic had a negligible effect on the fluorescence intensity of mp or sp fig s3 therefore the fluorescence intensity of sp and mp in the multicomponent system was obtained by direct measurement then the concentrations of sp and mp were determined by their respective standard curves of fluorescence intensity fig s2b the quantitative concentration of np in binary and ternary systems was calculated by its uv vis absorbance and standard curve and its absorbance was obtained by the subtraction method as presented in the supporting information texts s3 s4 tables s3 s5 after the column experiment the sand samples at the entrance of the column were collected and the adhesion states of np sp and mp on the sand surface in the microscopic field were observed using sem nova nanosem 450 fei hillsboro or usa in addition clsm a1r nikon tokyo japan was used to observe the adhesion state of fluorescent particles sp and mp on sand surface in binary and ternary systems in a broader view the sand sample was placed in a porous counting plate with a glass bottom a 40 oil lens was used for sample observation simultaneous imaging of sp and mp with green and red fluorescence was done using dual channels 2 4 extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo calculation the xdlvo theory was used to calculate the interaction energies between nanoparticles and sand assuming the presence of ideal particle surface sphere plate geometries related formula and parameters are described in supporting information text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of single component np sp and mp suspensions in seawater aggregation and sedimentation of single component np sp and mp in 35 psu artificial seawater are shown in fig 1 a for the single suspension the cs cs 0 and ddls values of sp and mp nearly remained stable within 42 min whereas the ddls of np gradually increased with time from 119 07 35 32 nm to 409 77 115 90 nm indicating that np could easily form large sized aggregates in seawater these results were evidenced by tem observation fig 2 np were aggregated with highly overlapping constituents whereas sp and mp remained monodispersed accordingly the cs cs 0 of np dropped to 0 55 0 01 within 42 min whereas those of mp and sp were steadily held at around 0 97 fig 1b nevertheless the aggregation of np in bulk solution cannot affect the stability of np in the influent solution during the column experiment because of blending with bump fig s4 dong et al 2018 the ζ potential is a key indicator for colloidal stability generally the increased absolute value of ζ potential enhances the particle stability the measured ζ potential values of np sp and mp in 35 psu seawater were 23 62 1 76 19 32 1 85 and 28 35 1 38 mv respectively evidently mp had the highest absolute most negative ζ potential and was the most stable however sp with lower absolute value of ζ potential was more stable than np this result indicated that besides electrostatic repulsion the stability of np sp and mp was also related to other factors given the same mass concentration tiny particles have high particle concentration and present high collision frequency sun et al 2021 the particle number of sp 6 74 1011 particles per l was about three orders of magnitude less than that of np 1 46 1014 particles per l in the same mass concentration of plastics 10 mg l 1 small particles have high relative surface energy resulting in decreased stability he et al 2008 accordingly np formed aggregates more easily than sp and mp and this finding was in agreement with those of previous literatures he et al 2008 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 3 2 comparison of single and ternary component transport in seawater saturated sand the single component transport of np sp and mp in seawater saturated natural sea sand is shown in fig 3 a compared with the btc of the conservative tracer ki fig s5 all btcs of colloid had no evident tailing phenomenon indicating that the detachment of colloids could be negligible babakhani et al 2017 in vertical transport system gravity may inevitably affect the colloidal transport this study investigated the effect of gravity on the transport of mp sp and np syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 it was found that large particles mp were more impacted by gravity than the small ones sp and np and mp seemed to be more easily deposited on sand surface under the action of gravity text s6 however our results showed the opposite result that is mp exhibited the highest mobility with the recovered mass percentage of plastic particles in the effluent meff of 47 81 mp with the highest negative ζ potential 28 35 1 38 mv had the strongest electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged sand 16 06 0 64 mv the meff values of sp and np were only 21 66 and 24 18 respectively table 1 the low meff of sp was probably related to its lowest negative ζ potential 19 32 1 85 mv xdlvo calculations further showed that the total interaction energy barriers of mp sp and np with the sand surface were 143 64 29 73 and 12 35 kbt respectively fig s6 the strong energy barriers between mp and sand made it difficult for mp to be retained on the surface of sand grains sp and mp displayed symmetrical btc profiles with wide plateau and their ratio of maximum effluent concentration to c0 mec values were similar to their meff values respectively table 1 this result indicated that the mobility c c0 value of sp and mp through the column had been maintained at the maximum level with time however np exhibited a ripening phenomenon of rapid increase and then a slow decrease in c c0 value with time resulting in the mec of np 0 32 being significantly higher than meff 24 18 because the increasing particle size of np aggregates made it difficult to pass through the aperture yang et al 2013 moreover the np attached on sand surfaces could further serve as additional attachment sites for new np particles babakhani et al 2017 due to the strong aggregation tendency between np and np resulting in the formation of multilayer attachment fig 3a the multilayer attachment may further cause the effective pore size of the porous medium to shrink thereby further increasing the straining of particles in the suspension bradford et al 2007 correspondingly the retention profiles of np presented a hyperexponential shape suggesting that most of np were concentrated in the input end of column fig s7 by contrast the retention profiles of sp and mp were close to linear and the concentration decreased gently from the input end to the output end given the presence of strong mutual repulsion sp or mp particles that attach to the sand surface repel sp or mp particles in the suspension thereby creating a shadow zone along the direction of fluid flow where the attachment of the particles is inhibited ko and elimelech 2000 yang et al 2015 as a result sp or mp were sporadically distributed as monodispersed spherical particles on sand surfaces fig 4 b and c and were more likely to be retained in the porous media farther from the input end fig s7b and c in the 1 1 1 ternary component system the transport of np sp and mp showed different changes the btc fig 3 and retention profile fig s7a of np were similar to those of single component np a slight decline in the meff value of np from 24 18 to 21 69 indicated that the coexisting of sp and mp had little influence on np transport table 1 conversely the transport of sp and mp in a ternary component system changed remarkably and appeared as ripening phenomena in fig 3b the c c0 values of sp and mp decreased slowly resulting in their meff to be smaller than their respective mec in addition the retention concentrations of sp and mp at 0 2 cm from the entrance of the column increased remarkably and was much higher than that at increased distance 2 24 5 cm fig s7 these results indicated their gradual decreases in colloidal stability during cotransport processes fig 1a illustrates that the stability of ternary np sp mp colloids was worse than that of single component colloid because ddls increased from 375 60 0 14 nm to 922 8 99 56 nm within 42 min and the variation range of ternary np sp mp colloid was larger than that of single component colloid in addition the sedimentation curve of ternary colloids was lower than that of np fig 1b which indicated the stronger colloidal aggregation of np sp mp than np np induced the originally monodispersed sp and mp and formed heteroaggregates with multilayered overlapping structures in 35 psu seawater fig 2d sem images further demonstrated that sp and mp were attached to the surface of np deposits and partially covered by np fig 4d which suggested that the repulsion between np and the two other components was very weak this phenomenon caused the attachment of np to sp or mp the interaction of the three components ultimately led to changes in the mobility of sp and mp the meff value of mp decreased from 47 81 to 38 56 whereas the retained mass percentage mret increased from 50 78 to 60 40 table 1 indicating the difficult passage of large sized mp in the ternary system on the contrary the meff and mec of sp increased from 21 66 and 0 22 to 33 31 and 0 36 respectively whereas the mret of sp decreased from 77 39 to 66 15 the enhanced transport of sp might be related to the coexisting influence of np and or mp 3 3 exploration of ternary cotransport mechanism based on binary experiments a series of aggregation sedimentation transport and retention experiments of binary suspension was systematically conducted to analyze the mutual interaction among np mp np sp and sp mp and elucidate the potential influence and contribution of any plastic colloid in ternary cotransport 3 3 1 np sp mixture compared with the single component transport the np sp cotransport hardly changed the meff values of sp from 21 66 to 22 43 and np from 24 18 to 23 81 table 1 however the btc shape of sp was radically changed and closely similar to that of np in single and binary suspensions fig 5 a in the binary system np and sp had similar mec 0 34 and 0 33 respectively and meff and these values were similar to the mec and meff of np in the single suspension table 1 in addition the ζ potential of two component colloids 24 88 1 49 mv was close to that of single np colloid these resemblances indicated that the coexisting np dominated the mobility of np sp mixtures thus sp presented ripening characteristics similar to np by changing its btc shape from symmetric plateau blue solid points in fig 3a to asymmetric peak blue solid points in fig 5a the phenomenon was because the formation of np sp heteroaggregates consisted of several sp bridged by a large number of np fig s8a np sp and np sp mp heteroaggregation curves perfectly overlapped fig 1a and the ddls of the colloid of np sp was remarkably larger than the that of single np and sp colloids fig 1a suggesting that the interaction between np and sp played a leading role in binary and ternary colloidal aggregation np might induce the stable sp colloids to settle in binary mixture and showed similar sedimentation trend similar to np homoaggregates fig 1b tem and sem results further presented that np mediated sp evidently formed bulky aggregates in suspension and on sand surface respectively figs s8a and s9a on the contrary sp scarcely affected np transport and the meff mret and mec of np in single and binary suspensions remained unchanged table 1 the formation of heteroaggregates indicated the weak mutual exclusion between np and sp therefore np and sp have chances to provide attachment sites for the subsequent colloids mutually probably promoting the colloidal retention cai et al 2019 the transport of sp or np in porous media was studied by pre equilibrating np or sp on the sand surface to verify this possibility the obtained btcs in pre equilibration experiments were similar to those in single component system fig s10 this result meant that np and sp neither competed for attachment site on sandy surfaces nor created more attachment sites for each other therefore the attachment and straining of large sized co aggregates might be the main factors that led to the changes in transport of sp and np in binary mixture 3 3 2 np mp mixture the cotransport of the np mp mixture markedly differed from that of the np sp mixture the btcs of np and mp did not overlap as np and sp curves did fig 5b the meff value of mp decreased from 47 81 to 39 44 and that of np increased from 24 18 to 30 62 table 1 which indicated that mp could facilitate np transport and that np was capable of inhibiting mp transport the btc shape of mp lost its symmetrical feature and showed ripening phenomena whereas that of np showed a relatively gentle downward trend fig 5b correspondingly the retention profiles of np and mp presented the hyperexponential shape in the binary component system compared with those of the single component system the concentrations of np and mp of the binary component system at the entrance of the column 0 2 cm increased remarkably fig s11 the aggregation and sedimentation curves of the np mp mixture showed that the colloids in the binary suspension were unstable fig 1 the increase in the ddls of the np mp colloid indicated the presence of np mp heteroaggregates however the ddls of the np mp colloid was still lower than that of the single mp suspension fig 1a which was due presumably to the simultaneous formation of np mp heteroaggregates and np np homoaggregates fig s8b demonstrates that two mp spheres can be bridged by several np spheres to form mp dimers the similar observation was found in sem images fig s9b in which three mp were bridged by np to form the mp trimer and most of np were attached to the surface of each mp the increase in size of heteroaggregates made it difficult to pass through sand pores resulting in decreased transport ability of mp peng et al 2017 in addition mp could act as carriers to carry np because mp had the highest mobility thus promoting the transport of np in binary mixture fig 5b cai et al 2014 dong et al 2019 the pre equilibration experiment showed that the pre equilibrated mp had little effect on the transport of np however the pre equilibrated np remarkably reduced the mobility of mp in porous media fig s12 which suggested that the pre equilibrated np on sand surfaces could provide the additional attachment sites for mp furthermore the btc profile of mp in the pre equilibration test was different from that in the np mp binary mixture the btc of mp in the pre equilibration test increased gradually and slowly over time showing the characteristics of a blocking phenomenon babakhani et al 2017 this result indicated that the pre equilibrated np provided a limited number of attachment sites which might be gradually occupied and consumed during experiments becker et al 2015 accordingly the np in the binary system might also provide additional attachment sites for mp notably in the np mp experiment the np attached to the surface of the porous medium increased gradually with time which meant that the additional attachment sites provided by np for mp might increase gradually this finding was one of the reasons for the increased retention rate and decreased mobility of mp therefore two aspects affected the whole np mp cotransport process the formation and transport of np mp heteroaggregates promoted the transport of np and inhibited the transport of mp the retained np provided additional attachment sites and then inhibited the transport of np and mp these processes caused the simultaneous accumulation of np and mp at the input end of columns although the mret of np decreased the content of np at the input end still increased significantly 3 3 3 sp mp mixture the cotransport of sp and mp could be regarded as a simple addition of the separate transport of sp and mp because the btcs and retention profiles of sp and mp in the mixture were nearly identical to those in single suspension figs 5c and 3a the meff values of sp from 21 66 to 20 27 and mp from 47 81 to 48 09 almost remained unchanged table 1 the cs cs 0 value of sp mp binary suspension was close to 1 within 42 min fig 1a implying colloidal stability this result was similar to those of single sp and mp suspensions although fig s8c shows that mp and sp were chained together they did not form tight aggregates like those found in np sp mp suspensions fig 2d aggregation experiments demonstrated that the ddls value of colloid in the mixture was relatively stable at 351 57 16 89 nm average value within 0 42 min which was close to that of single sp 357 14 18 84 nm but remarkably less than that of single mp 1012 76 59 08 nm fig 1a this result indicated that the particles in the sp mp suspension were monodispersed sp sem images further evidenced that sp and mp were sporadically distributed on the sand surface without any mutual adhesion or aggregation fig s9c this result was similar to the distribution of single sp or mp on the surface of sand grains fig 4b and c furthermore clsm was applied to present the distribution of green sp and red mp on sand surfaces from a large microscopic perspective in the np sp mp system the distribution of sp and mp was concentrated fig 6 in the sp mp system a small number of sp and mp scattered sporadically in the visual field fig s13a most of mp existed alone and did not form heteroaggregates with sp results showed that the change in mobility of sp and mp in mp sp mp mixture could be attributed to the np mediated effect 3 4 dominant role of np in ternary cotransport systems in the absence of np sp and mp particles remained stable in the sp mp mixture without forming heteroaggregates and presented similar btcs to those in the single component system indicating that the mutual repulsion of sp and mp did not affect their respective transport once unstable np were involved the relative stability of sp and mp was destroyed and the transport of sp and mp was changed accordingly compared with those of mp in the sp mp mixture 48 09 the meff values of mp in np sp mp mixture 38 96 were reduced by about 10 this finding was accompanied by the typical ripening phenomena of mp transport and was due to the formation of bulky heteroaggregates of np sp mp figs 2d and 4d this result was similar to the transport of mp in np mp mixtures thus the transport of mp in the ternary component was inferred to be affected by np rather than sp the btcs of sp presented the ripening phenomena in np sp fig 5a and np sp mp mixtures fig 3b suggesting that np also affected the transport of sp the meff values of sp in the np sp 22 43 and sp mp 20 27 mixtures were similar to that in single sp suspension 21 66 whereas the meff value of sp in the np sp mp system increased to 33 31 this result indicated that the individual np or mp did not promote the sp transport in the column thus a special combination of np sp and mp might promote the transport of sp which only occurred when np and mp existed simultaneously in the ternary suspension the promotion of sp transport could be attributed to competition for attachment and or colloid carrying transport however the results from np sp and sp mp systems showed no competition for attachment sites between sp and np fig s10 and between sp and mp fig 5c therefore the main influencing factor of sp in the np sp mp system would be colloid carrying transport in the np sp system the heteroaggregation of np with sp caused the btc of sp similar to that of np fig 5a in the np mp system the heteroaggregation of np with mp could promote the transport of np by carrying np fig 5b three kinds of primary aggregates namely np np np sp and np mp were inferred to be formed in the ternary system subsequently the ternary heteroaggregates with np as the core were further formed therefore mp might promote sp transport through mp np sp heteroaggregates a kind of np mediated association of mp with sp meanwhile the mobility of np in the ternary systems did not change significantly although some of np could be carried by mp to transport another np could form np sp mp heterogeneous aggregates which are too large to pass through the sand pore the size of np sp mp was evidently larger than that of np sp figs 2d and s8a however the aggregate curves of np sp mp and np sp almost completely overlapped fig 1 which was indicative of their similar ddls this result was because most of np sp mp and np sp aggregates were concentrated in the range of 0 1 1 μm fig s14b although the np sp mp system contained gigantic aggregates 4 μm fig s14a their amount was not enough to cause the change in ddls because ddls represented the average particle size of all colloids in the suspension clsm was applied to further visualize the effect of np on the aggregation of sp and red mp on sand surfaces in the sp mp system sp and mp particles were dispersed separately without interaction fig s13 however np induced green sp to form gigantic three dimensional network structures dotted with red mp and further formed aggregates with diameters ranging from a few microns to tens of microns fig 6 notably a large number of yellow particles which were the same size as the red mp appeared in the field of view which might be due to the coverage of some green sp on the surface of red mp based on the additive color theory some mp particles had a greenish yellow appearance suggesting that the surface of these mp was covered with a large number of green sp these results demonstrated that np played a critical role in the aggregation of sp and mp sp cannot be directly transported by mp but could be transported by mp mediated with np therefore the mobility of sp in the ternary component system was influenced by np and mp and np played a dominant bridging role 4 conclusions the coexistence of plastic debris in all sizes in the ocean is a pervasive phenomenon which leads to the inevitable interaction between plastic particles of different sizes our study demonstrates that sp and mp in seawater remain relatively stable and that high salinity may induce np to form homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates np aggregation has no significant effect on self transport but inhibits mp transport and promotes sp mobility this finding is attributed to the bridging role of np between mp and sp forming np sp mp heteroaggregates in addition np mediation enhances the retention of plastic particles on the near surface of 0 1 cm of sea sand which means that plastic particles are likely to be re released into the seawater system under the influence of wave fluctuation or bioturbation thus increasing the risk of ssp in seawater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15754,the transport of microplastics mp or nanoplastics np in porous media has been widely reported however their mutual interaction and effect on cotransport remain unclear here we investigated the colloidal interaction between np 50 nm submicroplastics sp 300 nm and mp 1000 nm in seawater and their cotransport in saturated natural sea sands in the single component suspension the recovered mass percentage meff of colloids was as follows mp 47 81 np 24 18 sp 21 66 sp and mp remained monodispersed mp had the highest mobility due to the strongest electrostatic repulsion with sand surface whereas np formed homoaggregates and was characterized by ripening phenomena in the sp mp mixture sp and mp kept independent mobility without mutual effect in the np sp mp mixture the meff of mp was reduced by 10 because unstable np induced mp to form heteroaggregates with sp which could not pass through the pores in addition np attached to the sand surface could form additional retention sites to retain mp by contrast sp showed a 13 increase in meff because mp became an indirect carrier of sp through the bridging of np overall this study demonstrates the dominant role of unstable np in the cotransport of np sp mp in the marine sedimentary environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics submicroplastics nanoplastics transport seawater data availability data will be made available on request nanoplastics dominate the cotransport of small scale plastics in seawater saturated porous media original data figshare 1 introduction tiny pieces of plastics pose potential threats to marine ecosystems as they may be inadvertently consumed by sea creatures mitrano 2019 peng et al 2020b these small scale plastics ssp are not a single contaminant but rather a diverse contaminant suite koelmans et al 2013 rochman et al 2013 including microplastics mp 1 μm 5 mm in size submicroplastics sp 100 nm 1 μm annenkov et al 2021 gigault et al 2021 hartmann et al 2019

a worrying aspect with ssp is their transport potentials in marine sediments courtene jones et al 2020 lusher et al 2015 ssp are found to be hidden in deep sediment to a depth of 60 cm xue et al 2020 which may show adverse effects on the habitat of benthos corinaldesi et al 2021 besides bioturbation the vertical mobility in the sediment of ssp which is closely related to their physical characteristics and hydrochemical properties of seawater should not be overlooked kumar et al 2021 the particle size of ssp is a critical feature affecting their transport in porous media in a single component system the relative colloid effluent concentration c c0 of plastic colloids pc usually decreases with increasing pc size bradford et al 2003 this finding indicates that large pc may easily get trapped by the collector whereas small pc can travel long distances to pass through the porous media bradford et al 2007 shaniv et al 2021 song et al 2019 yang et al 2015 these observations are usually involved in low ionic strength or salinity solutions in which the sufficiently negative zeta ζ potential of pc causes them to repel each other electrostatically and keep them dispersed in an estuarine environment the aggregation of pc is expected to occur because the salinity intrusion leads to colloidal destabilization sun et al 2021 wu et al 2019 seawater typically has a salinity of approximately 35 practical salinity units psu which is also expressed as mass salinity of around 35 g kg 1 in seawater polystyrene np particles e g 30 40 and 90 nm in size with a high surface area to volume ratio can easily form homoaggregates with a diameter larger than 1 μm due to the cation shielding effect della torre et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the aggregation of nanoparticles may dramatically reduce their transport in porous media because of the increase of collision frequency physical trapping and size exclusion babakhani 2019 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 for example the smaller sp particles 100 400 and 600 nm can aggregate individually in seawater and their mobility in porous media to be remarkably lower than that of the larger sp and mp 800 1500 and 2000 nm dong et al 2018 mp are usually well dispersed either in freshwater besseling et al 2017 or seawater dong et al 2018 due to strong electrostatic repulsions gui et al 2022 and low collision frequency sun et al 2021 between particles nevertheless their individual transport may still have mutual influence the retention of monodispersed mp in porous media is affected by attachment straining and wedging physical blockage by the grooves on the surface of porous media johnson et al 2007 2010 the trapped and or wedged mp will prevent the re entrainment of small mp near the grain to grain contacts back into the pore water ma et al 2017 large mp on the surface of porous media provide extra retention or wedging sites for small mp ma et al 2017 xu and saiers 2009 therefore large particle ssp affect the transport of small ones previous studies showed that the heteroaggregation between monodispersed mp and unstable nanoparticles can influence the individual transport of mp and nanoparticles cai et al 2019 found that the predeposited nano tio2 can provide additional deposition sites for mp thus promoting the retention of mp on the contrary nanokaolinite in solution may compete with mp kaolinite heteroaggregates for deposition sites thereby increasing the mobility of kaolinite and mp li et al 2020 peng et al 2017 demostrated that graphene oxide go can enhance the mobility of sp or mp in porous media saturated with 10 and 50 mmol l 1 nacl solution which is driven by the go facilitated transport because a gigantic go layer interacts with and carries on plastic particles another observation of the heteroaggregation and cotransport of carboxylate modified sp with c60 1 1 mass ratio found that sp strongly inhibit the aggregation of c60 in seawater c60 particles can be attached to the surface of sp to form monodispersed nanohybrids and sp serve as carriers for part of c60 to transport in porous media dong et al 2019 in analogy to these plastic nanomineral and plastic nanocarbon systems the coexistence of mp sp and np in seawater is likely to form homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates which have important influences on the mobility and fate of plastics in porous media however knowledge on the effect of ssp aggregation on their cotransport is limited this work aims to investigate the mutual effect of plastic particles of various sizes in 35 psu seawater and explore their cotransport and retention behaviors in saturated porous media polystyrene mp sp and np are chosen as plastic models because they are commonly used as personal care products and drug delivery carriers al thawadi 2020 sussarellu et al 2016 the aggregation behaviors breakthrough curves and retention profiles of mp sp and np in single binary and trinary suspensions are comprehensively studied to clarify their stability and interaction in seawater and the underlying cotransport mechanism in seawater saturated porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural sea sand was obtained from the seafloor near the coast of qinhuangdao in the bohai sea hebei province china the air dried sand was passed through a 20 30 mesh sieve and washed with deionized water to remove impurities then the sand was dried in an oven at 105 c for more than 12 h before storage and use the median size d50 of the sand was 0 91 0 08 mm fig s1 and table s1 which was obtained by laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk artificial seawater was prepared in accordance with the method of kester et al 1967 and used as background solution in this experiment table s2 three kinds of polystyrene spheres i e mp sp and np were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china mp 1000 nm and sp 300 nm had red and green fluorescence respectively np 50 nm had no fluorescence the initial concentration of three particle suspensions was 10 w v all stock suspensions were stored in the dark at 4 c before use stock suspensions were diluted to 10 mg l 1 with background solution artificial seawater and sonicated for 10 min sk3200hp kudos shanghai china to obtain the working suspension the mixed suspension was composed of different particles with equal mass concentration for example the ternary component suspension was composed of mp sp and np with 1 1 1 mass ratio and the mass concentration of each particle was 10 mg l 1 the detailed methods of solution preparation and standard curve establishment are provided in the supplementary materials text s1 2 2 column transport and retention experiments one dimensional glass column experiments length 24 8 cm inside diameter 1 6 cm were conducted to investigate the transport and retention of single and multiple component plastic particles the stainless steel screen with 50 μm aperture was installed at both ends of the column the natural sand was wetted and packed into the glass column during the process the liquid level was always slightly higher 1 cm than the sand after filling the sand with a height of 1 cm the packed column was tapped with a rubber mallet to expel any small bubble that might exist finally the average height of the sand filled in each experimental column was 23 6 0 2 cm the average dry weight of sand was about 80 86 0 12 g and the porosity was 37 6 0 4 table s1 a peristaltic pump was used to inject seawater from bottom to top to avoid unsaturated transport the rate of particle deposition in up flow direction may be greater than that in down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 before experiment 100 ml background solution 4 7 pore volume pv was pumped to rinse the packed column and reach saturation at the flow rate of 1 50 0 10 ml min 1 during transport experiments the suspension of plastic particles and background seawater solution was successively pumped into the column for 42 min 3 0 pv at the same flow rate then the effluent was collected every 160 s 4 ml to determine the concentration of plastic particles passing through the column to obtain breakthrough curves btcs the research methods of the conservative tracer potassium iodide transport experiment and the pre equilibration experiment of plastic particles are presented in the supporting information text s2 the retention profiles of particles were obtained in accordance with our previous study dong et al 2020 in brief the sand column was divided into sections with a height of about 2 cm and then transferred into 45 ml glass vials subsequently 25 ml deionized water was added into vials to shake for 60 min and wash out residual particles from sand surfaces the supernatant was taken to determine the particle concentration and the particle distribution at different depths was further obtained the retention experiment was carried out three times and reserve the results of three data average value the measurement method of particle concentration is given in section 2 3 and supplementary material the calculated mass balance results of experiments under different conditions are shown in table 1 2 3 analytical methods before colloid measurement all suspensions were sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min to break possible colloidal aggregates the dynamic hydrodynamic diameter ddls of suspension was obtained through time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements and the ζ potential of the suspension was measured using the zetasizer nano marvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the dispersion and aggregation states of np sp and mp were observed using tem jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan the aggregation and sedimentation curves of the colloid were expressed by the change in ddls and relative colloidal suspension concentration cs cs 0 over time in a single component suspension a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md was used to measure the ultraviolet absorbance values of np sp and mp in effluents at 228 nm and their concentrations were calculated by their standard curves of uv vis absorbance by diluting the single suspension into different proportions to configure a series of concentrations and measuring the corresponding uv vis absorbance the linear relationship between the concentration and uv vis absorbance of np sp and mp could be obtained fig s2a the fluorescence intensities of sp and mp in the effluent could also be measured separately by a fluorescence spectrophotometry f4000 hitachi japan the excitation and emission wavelengths of sp were 440 and 486 nm respectively and those of mp were 530 and 560 nm respectively preliminary experiments presented that the coexisting plastic had a negligible effect on the fluorescence intensity of mp or sp fig s3 therefore the fluorescence intensity of sp and mp in the multicomponent system was obtained by direct measurement then the concentrations of sp and mp were determined by their respective standard curves of fluorescence intensity fig s2b the quantitative concentration of np in binary and ternary systems was calculated by its uv vis absorbance and standard curve and its absorbance was obtained by the subtraction method as presented in the supporting information texts s3 s4 tables s3 s5 after the column experiment the sand samples at the entrance of the column were collected and the adhesion states of np sp and mp on the sand surface in the microscopic field were observed using sem nova nanosem 450 fei hillsboro or usa in addition clsm a1r nikon tokyo japan was used to observe the adhesion state of fluorescent particles sp and mp on sand surface in binary and ternary systems in a broader view the sand sample was placed in a porous counting plate with a glass bottom a 40 oil lens was used for sample observation simultaneous imaging of sp and mp with green and red fluorescence was done using dual channels 2 4 extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo calculation the xdlvo theory was used to calculate the interaction energies between nanoparticles and sand assuming the presence of ideal particle surface sphere plate geometries related formula and parameters are described in supporting information text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of single component np sp and mp suspensions in seawater aggregation and sedimentation of single component np sp and mp in 35 psu artificial seawater are shown in fig 1 a for the single suspension the cs cs 0 and ddls values of sp and mp nearly remained stable within 42 min whereas the ddls of np gradually increased with time from 119 07 35 32 nm to 409 77 115 90 nm indicating that np could easily form large sized aggregates in seawater these results were evidenced by tem observation fig 2 np were aggregated with highly overlapping constituents whereas sp and mp remained monodispersed accordingly the cs cs 0 of np dropped to 0 55 0 01 within 42 min whereas those of mp and sp were steadily held at around 0 97 fig 1b nevertheless the aggregation of np in bulk solution cannot affect the stability of np in the influent solution during the column experiment because of blending with bump fig s4 dong et al 2018 the ζ potential is a key indicator for colloidal stability generally the increased absolute value of ζ potential enhances the particle stability the measured ζ potential values of np sp and mp in 35 psu seawater were 23 62 1 76 19 32 1 85 and 28 35 1 38 mv respectively evidently mp had the highest absolute most negative ζ potential and was the most stable however sp with lower absolute value of ζ potential was more stable than np this result indicated that besides electrostatic repulsion the stability of np sp and mp was also related to other factors given the same mass concentration tiny particles have high particle concentration and present high collision frequency sun et al 2021 the particle number of sp 6 74 1011 particles per l was about three orders of magnitude less than that of np 1 46 1014 particles per l in the same mass concentration of plastics 10 mg l 1 small particles have high relative surface energy resulting in decreased stability he et al 2008 accordingly np formed aggregates more easily than sp and mp and this finding was in agreement with those of previous literatures he et al 2008 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 3 2 comparison of single and ternary component transport in seawater saturated sand the single component transport of np sp and mp in seawater saturated natural sea sand is shown in fig 3 a compared with the btc of the conservative tracer ki fig s5 all btcs of colloid had no evident tailing phenomenon indicating that the detachment of colloids could be negligible babakhani et al 2017 in vertical transport system gravity may inevitably affect the colloidal transport this study investigated the effect of gravity on the transport of mp sp and np syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 it was found that large particles mp were more impacted by gravity than the small ones sp and np and mp seemed to be more easily deposited on sand surface under the action of gravity text s6 however our results showed the opposite result that is mp exhibited the highest mobility with the recovered mass percentage of plastic particles in the effluent meff of 47 81 mp with the highest negative ζ potential 28 35 1 38 mv had the strongest electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged sand 16 06 0 64 mv the meff values of sp and np were only 21 66 and 24 18 respectively table 1 the low meff of sp was probably related to its lowest negative ζ potential 19 32 1 85 mv xdlvo calculations further showed that the total interaction energy barriers of mp sp and np with the sand surface were 143 64 29 73 and 12 35 kbt respectively fig s6 the strong energy barriers between mp and sand made it difficult for mp to be retained on the surface of sand grains sp and mp displayed symmetrical btc profiles with wide plateau and their ratio of maximum effluent concentration to c0 mec values were similar to their meff values respectively table 1 this result indicated that the mobility c c0 value of sp and mp through the column had been maintained at the maximum level with time however np exhibited a ripening phenomenon of rapid increase and then a slow decrease in c c0 value with time resulting in the mec of np 0 32 being significantly higher than meff 24 18 because the increasing particle size of np aggregates made it difficult to pass through the aperture yang et al 2013 moreover the np attached on sand surfaces could further serve as additional attachment sites for new np particles babakhani et al 2017 due to the strong aggregation tendency between np and np resulting in the formation of multilayer attachment fig 3a the multilayer attachment may further cause the effective pore size of the porous medium to shrink thereby further increasing the straining of particles in the suspension bradford et al 2007 correspondingly the retention profiles of np presented a hyperexponential shape suggesting that most of np were concentrated in the input end of column fig s7 by contrast the retention profiles of sp and mp were close to linear and the concentration decreased gently from the input end to the output end given the presence of strong mutual repulsion sp or mp particles that attach to the sand surface repel sp or mp particles in the suspension thereby creating a shadow zone along the direction of fluid flow where the attachment of the particles is inhibited ko and elimelech 2000 yang et al 2015 as a result sp or mp were sporadically distributed as monodispersed spherical particles on sand surfaces fig 4 b and c and were more likely to be retained in the porous media farther from the input end fig s7b and c in the 1 1 1 ternary component system the transport of np sp and mp showed different changes the btc fig 3 and retention profile fig s7a of np were similar to those of single component np a slight decline in the meff value of np from 24 18 to 21 69 indicated that the coexisting of sp and mp had little influence on np transport table 1 conversely the transport of sp and mp in a ternary component system changed remarkably and appeared as ripening phenomena in fig 3b the c c0 values of sp and mp decreased slowly resulting in their meff to be smaller than their respective mec in addition the retention concentrations of sp and mp at 0 2 cm from the entrance of the column increased remarkably and was much higher than that at increased distance 2 24 5 cm fig s7 these results indicated their gradual decreases in colloidal stability during cotransport processes fig 1a illustrates that the stability of ternary np sp mp colloids was worse than that of single component colloid because ddls increased from 375 60 0 14 nm to 922 8 99 56 nm within 42 min and the variation range of ternary np sp mp colloid was larger than that of single component colloid in addition the sedimentation curve of ternary colloids was lower than that of np fig 1b which indicated the stronger colloidal aggregation of np sp mp than np np induced the originally monodispersed sp and mp and formed heteroaggregates with multilayered overlapping structures in 35 psu seawater fig 2d sem images further demonstrated that sp and mp were attached to the surface of np deposits and partially covered by np fig 4d which suggested that the repulsion between np and the two other components was very weak this phenomenon caused the attachment of np to sp or mp the interaction of the three components ultimately led to changes in the mobility of sp and mp the meff value of mp decreased from 47 81 to 38 56 whereas the retained mass percentage mret increased from 50 78 to 60 40 table 1 indicating the difficult passage of large sized mp in the ternary system on the contrary the meff and mec of sp increased from 21 66 and 0 22 to 33 31 and 0 36 respectively whereas the mret of sp decreased from 77 39 to 66 15 the enhanced transport of sp might be related to the coexisting influence of np and or mp 3 3 exploration of ternary cotransport mechanism based on binary experiments a series of aggregation sedimentation transport and retention experiments of binary suspension was systematically conducted to analyze the mutual interaction among np mp np sp and sp mp and elucidate the potential influence and contribution of any plastic colloid in ternary cotransport 3 3 1 np sp mixture compared with the single component transport the np sp cotransport hardly changed the meff values of sp from 21 66 to 22 43 and np from 24 18 to 23 81 table 1 however the btc shape of sp was radically changed and closely similar to that of np in single and binary suspensions fig 5 a in the binary system np and sp had similar mec 0 34 and 0 33 respectively and meff and these values were similar to the mec and meff of np in the single suspension table 1 in addition the ζ potential of two component colloids 24 88 1 49 mv was close to that of single np colloid these resemblances indicated that the coexisting np dominated the mobility of np sp mixtures thus sp presented ripening characteristics similar to np by changing its btc shape from symmetric plateau blue solid points in fig 3a to asymmetric peak blue solid points in fig 5a the phenomenon was because the formation of np sp heteroaggregates consisted of several sp bridged by a large number of np fig s8a np sp and np sp mp heteroaggregation curves perfectly overlapped fig 1a and the ddls of the colloid of np sp was remarkably larger than the that of single np and sp colloids fig 1a suggesting that the interaction between np and sp played a leading role in binary and ternary colloidal aggregation np might induce the stable sp colloids to settle in binary mixture and showed similar sedimentation trend similar to np homoaggregates fig 1b tem and sem results further presented that np mediated sp evidently formed bulky aggregates in suspension and on sand surface respectively figs s8a and s9a on the contrary sp scarcely affected np transport and the meff mret and mec of np in single and binary suspensions remained unchanged table 1 the formation of heteroaggregates indicated the weak mutual exclusion between np and sp therefore np and sp have chances to provide attachment sites for the subsequent colloids mutually probably promoting the colloidal retention cai et al 2019 the transport of sp or np in porous media was studied by pre equilibrating np or sp on the sand surface to verify this possibility the obtained btcs in pre equilibration experiments were similar to those in single component system fig s10 this result meant that np and sp neither competed for attachment site on sandy surfaces nor created more attachment sites for each other therefore the attachment and straining of large sized co aggregates might be the main factors that led to the changes in transport of sp and np in binary mixture 3 3 2 np mp mixture the cotransport of the np mp mixture markedly differed from that of the np sp mixture the btcs of np and mp did not overlap as np and sp curves did fig 5b the meff value of mp decreased from 47 81 to 39 44 and that of np increased from 24 18 to 30 62 table 1 which indicated that mp could facilitate np transport and that np was capable of inhibiting mp transport the btc shape of mp lost its symmetrical feature and showed ripening phenomena whereas that of np showed a relatively gentle downward trend fig 5b correspondingly the retention profiles of np and mp presented the hyperexponential shape in the binary component system compared with those of the single component system the concentrations of np and mp of the binary component system at the entrance of the column 0 2 cm increased remarkably fig s11 the aggregation and sedimentation curves of the np mp mixture showed that the colloids in the binary suspension were unstable fig 1 the increase in the ddls of the np mp colloid indicated the presence of np mp heteroaggregates however the ddls of the np mp colloid was still lower than that of the single mp suspension fig 1a which was due presumably to the simultaneous formation of np mp heteroaggregates and np np homoaggregates fig s8b demonstrates that two mp spheres can be bridged by several np spheres to form mp dimers the similar observation was found in sem images fig s9b in which three mp were bridged by np to form the mp trimer and most of np were attached to the surface of each mp the increase in size of heteroaggregates made it difficult to pass through sand pores resulting in decreased transport ability of mp peng et al 2017 in addition mp could act as carriers to carry np because mp had the highest mobility thus promoting the transport of np in binary mixture fig 5b cai et al 2014 dong et al 2019 the pre equilibration experiment showed that the pre equilibrated mp had little effect on the transport of np however the pre equilibrated np remarkably reduced the mobility of mp in porous media fig s12 which suggested that the pre equilibrated np on sand surfaces could provide the additional attachment sites for mp furthermore the btc profile of mp in the pre equilibration test was different from that in the np mp binary mixture the btc of mp in the pre equilibration test increased gradually and slowly over time showing the characteristics of a blocking phenomenon babakhani et al 2017 this result indicated that the pre equilibrated np provided a limited number of attachment sites which might be gradually occupied and consumed during experiments becker et al 2015 accordingly the np in the binary system might also provide additional attachment sites for mp notably in the np mp experiment the np attached to the surface of the porous medium increased gradually with time which meant that the additional attachment sites provided by np for mp might increase gradually this finding was one of the reasons for the increased retention rate and decreased mobility of mp therefore two aspects affected the whole np mp cotransport process the formation and transport of np mp heteroaggregates promoted the transport of np and inhibited the transport of mp the retained np provided additional attachment sites and then inhibited the transport of np and mp these processes caused the simultaneous accumulation of np and mp at the input end of columns although the mret of np decreased the content of np at the input end still increased significantly 3 3 3 sp mp mixture the cotransport of sp and mp could be regarded as a simple addition of the separate transport of sp and mp because the btcs and retention profiles of sp and mp in the mixture were nearly identical to those in single suspension figs 5c and 3a the meff values of sp from 21 66 to 20 27 and mp from 47 81 to 48 09 almost remained unchanged table 1 the cs cs 0 value of sp mp binary suspension was close to 1 within 42 min fig 1a implying colloidal stability this result was similar to those of single sp and mp suspensions although fig s8c shows that mp and sp were chained together they did not form tight aggregates like those found in np sp mp suspensions fig 2d aggregation experiments demonstrated that the ddls value of colloid in the mixture was relatively stable at 351 57 16 89 nm average value within 0 42 min which was close to that of single sp 357 14 18 84 nm but remarkably less than that of single mp 1012 76 59 08 nm fig 1a this result indicated that the particles in the sp mp suspension were monodispersed sp sem images further evidenced that sp and mp were sporadically distributed on the sand surface without any mutual adhesion or aggregation fig s9c this result was similar to the distribution of single sp or mp on the surface of sand grains fig 4b and c furthermore clsm was applied to present the distribution of green sp and red mp on sand surfaces from a large microscopic perspective in the np sp mp system the distribution of sp and mp was concentrated fig 6 in the sp mp system a small number of sp and mp scattered sporadically in the visual field fig s13a most of mp existed alone and did not form heteroaggregates with sp results showed that the change in mobility of sp and mp in mp sp mp mixture could be attributed to the np mediated effect 3 4 dominant role of np in ternary cotransport systems in the absence of np sp and mp particles remained stable in the sp mp mixture without forming heteroaggregates and presented similar btcs to those in the single component system indicating that the mutual repulsion of sp and mp did not affect their respective transport once unstable np were involved the relative stability of sp and mp was destroyed and the transport of sp and mp was changed accordingly compared with those of mp in the sp mp mixture 48 09 the meff values of mp in np sp mp mixture 38 96 were reduced by about 10 this finding was accompanied by the typical ripening phenomena of mp transport and was due to the formation of bulky heteroaggregates of np sp mp figs 2d and 4d this result was similar to the transport of mp in np mp mixtures thus the transport of mp in the ternary component was inferred to be affected by np rather than sp the btcs of sp presented the ripening phenomena in np sp fig 5a and np sp mp mixtures fig 3b suggesting that np also affected the transport of sp the meff values of sp in the np sp 22 43 and sp mp 20 27 mixtures were similar to that in single sp suspension 21 66 whereas the meff value of sp in the np sp mp system increased to 33 31 this result indicated that the individual np or mp did not promote the sp transport in the column thus a special combination of np sp and mp might promote the transport of sp which only occurred when np and mp existed simultaneously in the ternary suspension the promotion of sp transport could be attributed to competition for attachment and or colloid carrying transport however the results from np sp and sp mp systems showed no competition for attachment sites between sp and np fig s10 and between sp and mp fig 5c therefore the main influencing factor of sp in the np sp mp system would be colloid carrying transport in the np sp system the heteroaggregation of np with sp caused the btc of sp similar to that of np fig 5a in the np mp system the heteroaggregation of np with mp could promote the transport of np by carrying np fig 5b three kinds of primary aggregates namely np np np sp and np mp were inferred to be formed in the ternary system subsequently the ternary heteroaggregates with np as the core were further formed therefore mp might promote sp transport through mp np sp heteroaggregates a kind of np mediated association of mp with sp meanwhile the mobility of np in the ternary systems did not change significantly although some of np could be carried by mp to transport another np could form np sp mp heterogeneous aggregates which are too large to pass through the sand pore the size of np sp mp was evidently larger than that of np sp figs 2d and s8a however the aggregate curves of np sp mp and np sp almost completely overlapped fig 1 which was indicative of their similar ddls this result was because most of np sp mp and np sp aggregates were concentrated in the range of 0 1 1 μm fig s14b although the np sp mp system contained gigantic aggregates 4 μm fig s14a their amount was not enough to cause the change in ddls because ddls represented the average particle size of all colloids in the suspension clsm was applied to further visualize the effect of np on the aggregation of sp and red mp on sand surfaces in the sp mp system sp and mp particles were dispersed separately without interaction fig s13 however np induced green sp to form gigantic three dimensional network structures dotted with red mp and further formed aggregates with diameters ranging from a few microns to tens of microns fig 6 notably a large number of yellow particles which were the same size as the red mp appeared in the field of view which might be due to the coverage of some green sp on the surface of red mp based on the additive color theory some mp particles had a greenish yellow appearance suggesting that the surface of these mp was covered with a large number of green sp these results demonstrated that np played a critical role in the aggregation of sp and mp sp cannot be directly transported by mp but could be transported by mp mediated with np therefore the mobility of sp in the ternary component system was influenced by np and mp and np played a dominant bridging role 4 conclusions the coexistence of plastic debris in all sizes in the ocean is a pervasive phenomenon which leads to the inevitable interaction between plastic particles of different sizes our study demonstrates that sp and mp in seawater remain relatively stable and that high salinity may induce np to form homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates np aggregation has no significant effect on self transport but inhibits mp transport and promotes sp mobility this finding is attributed to the bridging role of np between mp and sp forming np sp mp heteroaggregates in addition np mediation enhances the retention of plastic particles on the near surface of 0 1 cm of sea sand which means that plastic particles are likely to be re released into the seawater system under the influence of wave fluctuation or bioturbation thus increasing the risk of ssp in seawater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
