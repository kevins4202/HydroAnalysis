21760,this paper investigates the effect of obliquity on impulse imparted to the hydraulic structures by an underwater shock wave in this regard the oblique shock reflection phenomenon due to a planar shock wave impingement on an inclined rigid surface is numerically modeled results from simulations are presented in this manuscript for different shock strengths and angles of structure obliquity the study reveals that impulse transmitted to the structure due to oblique shock reflection is lower than that of normal incidence in specific regimes of structure obliquity to incident shock direction the formation of mach stem is observed i e triple point configuration at a certain distance from the structure inside these regimes the stem height decreases with the increase in structure obliquity and vice versa locus of the triple point has a direct implication on the magnitude of transmitted impulse which reduces with the increase in stem height i e more the locus of the triple point is away from the structure less is the transmitted impulse results presented in this manuscript may help in understanding the physics of shock reflections from submerged hydraulic structures and subsequently framing mitigation strategies keywords shock wave compressible flow blast load oblique reflection offshore structures 1 introduction hydraulic structures such as gravity dams or gravity platforms foundation of offshore structures wind turbines and bridge piers are susceptible to underwater shock loads either from various natural e g hydraulic jump and or man made e g underwater explosion situations all these phenomena involve high speed liquid impact involving water which in turn leads to the formation of normal and oblique shocks therefore fluid structure interaction during underwater shock impingement and reflection is a subject of considerable interest and concern for many years cole 1948 swisdak 1978 an extensive body of literature exists on this topic primarily based on exploiting taylor s concept which prescribes that the impulse transmitted to the structure can be significantly reduced by using a lightweight structure taylor 1963 it persuaded researchers to investigate the effectiveness of various advanced lightweight materials and or material configurations to mitigate the effect of shock loading on submerged structures ghoshal and mitra 2014 2016 several experimental and numerical studies on scaled models and prototypes of naval structures e g ship hulls autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and submarines was conducted to study dynamic deformation and failure modes lance et al 2017 yang et al 2019 recently the effect of structural obliquity on the response of flexible plates subjected to underwater impact load was reported moradi et al 2018 however this study also focuses on underwater blast mitigation through fluid structure interaction this concept of utilizing the motion and or deformation of structure in reducing relative momentum transfer may not be applicable to hydraulic structures which are inherently heavy and stationary the consequences of a failure of these structures are significant concerning both human lives and property loss therefore in the present study an effort is made to investigate whether the existing obliquity in hydraulic structures can be efficiently designed to reduce transmitted impulse in literature there exist studies sommerfeld and müller 1988 desjouy et al 2016 where underwater blast load on different types of structures surfaces was explored extensively it is quite well known that structural obliquity may lead to oblique reflection of shock and these reflection patterns are typically classified as regular reflection and irregular reflection depending on the formation of mach stem briefly in an oblique shock wave reflection mach stem may be observed as a result of the formation of a triple point the point where the three shocks meet viz incident reflected and mach stem above the rigid surface of reflection see fig 1 however no such case is possible for a normal shock reflection from structures with a flat surface oblique shock waves result in more favorable post shock conditions and it is often preferable in aerospace applications when compared to normal shocks von neumann 1943 a great deal of research was conducted on identifying implication of shock strength and load obliquity on the transition from regular to irregular reflection henderson and lozzi 1979 hornung 1986 a detail exposition on this topic can be found in ben dor 2007 in recent work it was reported that oblique reflections could be more effective in mitigating air blast loading on structures in comparison to that of normal reflections peng et al 2011 however in most of the studies for oblique shocks reflection phenomena consider air as the medium kambouchev et al 2006 ghoshal and mitra 2015 here it should be noted that the degree of compressibility of air and water is remarkably different hence the theories of air shock loading cannot be directly applied in determining the underwater shock loading on structures moreover until recently before the work by the authors ghoshal and mitra 2018 the domain of regular and irregular reflection in water at high pressure regimes were not identified where the phase transition of water was reported to be observed prior to this ridah 1988 theoretically demonstrated the detachment criteria and sonic criteria for an oblique shock in water however this work was limited to relatively low pressure it was reported that at high pressure ranges nonlinear compressibility of water becomes predominant and can be beneficial in reducing transmitted impulse whereas for the heavy stationary structure it causes a significant enhancement in transmitted impulse jackson and jamnia 1984 ghoshal and mitra 2012 therefore a significant number of works exist in the literature which focuses on the mitigation of shock loads using a lightweight structure moreover most of these studies are based on normal shock wave reflection from the submerged rigid structure however the effect of obliquity in hydraulic structures on transmitted impulse was not studied thoroughly also the ranges of most least dangerous obliquity is yet to be determined apart from primary shock waves during an underwater explosion secondary shock waves emanating from the pulsating cavitation bubble may produce oblique shock wave upon reflection from structures the collapse of a cavitation bubble near to the structural surface can also produce oblique shock reflection the collapse of these bubbles near to structure produces liquid jets impact which makes explosion bubble structure interaction complex phenomena özarmut et al 2019 however the cavitation bubble collapse is a phenomenon that occurs at a much larger time scale as compared to that of the primary shock wave therefore the influence of the cavitation bubble collapse is not considered as this work focuses is primarily on non contact underwater explosion induced shock waves apparently most hydraulic structures are deformable and an underwater blast of high intensity may lead to local failure and or fracture in the structure williams and williamson 2011 doronin 2019 however for submerged hydraulic structures due to its inherent heavyweight the global motion of the structure will be negligible and hence it is considered as a rigid body non deformable which eventually has infinite acoustic impedance therefore in the present study the fluid structure interaction effects are not considered and the structure is considered to be stationary therefore the local cavitation effects due to fluid structure interaction never occur in this context it should also be mentioned that shock waves originating from underwater explosions are spherical in nature at a sufficient distance from the point of detonation depending on the mass explosive material and stand off distance such waves can be taken as planar uniform shocks i e constant pressure with infinite decay time which are typically considered in shock tube experiments mouritz and rajapakse 2017 however the strength of the impinging shock is considered to be high enough such that the nonlinear compressibility effect cannot be neglected the present study delves deeper into the physics of underwater oblique shock wave reflection from submerged rigid structures to explore the implications of structural obliquity on impulse transmission in this regard uniform planar shock wave reflection from submerged rigid structures is studied numerically considering various obliquity and shock strength a systematic comparative study against the normal shock reflection is performed to explore the effect of obliquity the layout of this manuscript is as follows in sec 2 the problem definition is presented along with numerical formulation which requires artificial viscous dissipation for shock capturing in a 2 d framework sec 3 contains the result from the numerical simulations along with the discussion on the implications of obliquity in transmitted impulse and subsequently on underwater blast resistance design of hydraulic structures finally in sec 4 concluding remarks are given 2 coupled problem statement planar shock wave impingement on an underwater submerged rigid structure with obliquity is numerically modeled the shock wave reflection from the inclined surface of the structure may cause an oblique reflection of shock therefore the problem is cast in a two space dimension i e mass momentum and energy conservation equations of the two dimensional form are solved shock capturing is accomplished by the von neumann richtmyer algorithm which uses an artificial dissipative mechanism in the form of artificial viscosity similar to previous publications by the authors ghoshal and mitra 2012 2014 in which a 1 d model was presented mie grüneisen eos is used in modeling of the nonlinear compressible water medium in two space dimension 2 1 governing equation conservation equations of the lagrangian form are used as governing equations for the system and they are as follows mass conservation in a two dimensional domain mass conservation can be written as 1 d ρ d t ρ v x x v y y where v x and v y are the velocity in x and y direction respectively ρ is the current density momentum conservation conservation of linear momentum in the two space dimension will have two equations and they are as follows x direction 2 ρ d v x d t σ x x x σ y x y y direction 3 ρ d v y d t σ x y x σ y y y here v x and v y are the material particle velocity in x and y direction respectively σ x x σ x y σ y x and σ y y are the components of stress tensor σ in tensor notation stress tensor σ can be written as 4 σ i j p δ i j τ i j where p is the pressure δ i j is the krönecker delta τ i j is the artificial stress tensor and can be expressed as 5 τ i j μ s ε i j where μ s is the scalar artificial viscosity coefficient and ε i j symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor ε i j is expressed as 6 ε i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i artificial dissipative terms are introduced into the governing differential equations to smear out the discontinuity shock over a certain width therefore these governing differential equations can be solved for the entire domain even in the presence of discontinuity shock a scalar artificial viscosity μ s is defined as some measure of compression or jump in a specific shock direction and is taken as dobrev et al 2012 7 μ s ρ k 1 ψ 0 ψ 1 h s c k 2 h s 2 δ s v in eq 7 k 1 and k 2 are the artificial viscosity coefficients ρ is the current density and c is the local sound speed δ s v is the directional measure of compression and can be obtained by solving the following eigenvalue problem bazilevs et al 2013 8 s v λ i e 0 where λ i and s i i 1 n s d are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric part of velocity gradient tensor i e rate of strain tensor δ s v is defined as 9 δ s v min i 1 n s d s s v s λ m i n the corresponding directional length scale becomes 10 h s 2 s m i n g s m i n 1 2 where g is the metric tensor and is given by 11 g ξ x t ξ x ξ is the parametric coordinate ψ 1 is the compression switch parameter it forces the linear term of the scalar artificial viscosity to zero when there is an expansion in the flow whereby 12 ψ 1 1 λ m i n 0 0 λ m i n 0 ψ 0 is the vorticity limiter and it also reduces the influence of linear term in vorticity dominating flows ψ 0 is expressed as 13 ψ 0 v v energy conservation in a two dimensional lagrangian formulation the energy conservation equation is expressed as 14 ρ d e d t p v x x v y y τ x x v x x τ y x v x y τ x y v y x τ y y v y y here τ x x τ x y τ y x and τ y y are the components of the artificial stress tensor p is the pressure and can be obtained from the equation of state equation of state in the present work mie grüneisen eos is used to model the nonlinear compressibility of water a complete expression for mie grüneisen eos requires two equations one for compression phase 16 p ρ 0 c 0 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ 1 s 1 μ 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e if μ 0 and another for the expansion phase 17 p ρ 0 c 0 2 μ γ 0 ρ 0 e if μ 0 where γ 0 is the grüneisen parameter at the initial state mie grüneisen eos is developed based on experimentally determined hugoniot curve which refers to the plot of shock velocity u s vs particle velocity u p in the present work the shock particle velocity relation provided by bogdanov and rybakov 27 is used this shock particle velocity u s u p relation consists of three discrete linear segments u s c 0 s u p and considers the effect of phase change of water at high pressure however for the present work only phase i is considered and hence c 0 1450 and s 2 166 are used in this manuscript it is difficult to discretize the governing equations in an irregular physical domain using the finite difference technique therefore it is necessary to map or transform the irregular physical domain x y to a computational domain ξ η the mapping is one to one which corresponds between the physical domain x y and the computational domain ξ η subsequently the components of velocity gradient tensor are required to be transformed in a general coordinate system and these transformed equations will eventually be used to derive the discrete expressions margolin and shashkov 1999 see appendix a 2 2 discretization of the governing equations the computational coordinates are known by rectangular grid relation and they must be converted back to a physical domain for use so an algebraic grid is created using the points of the computational domain ξ η given by relations 18 x ξ and 19 y h t ς 1 ς 1 ς 1 ς 1 1 η ς 1 ς 1 1 η 1 the x coordinate is unaltered as can be seen from eq 18 however the y coordinate is governed by two parameters h t and ς here h t is the total height along the y axis and ς is a clustering parameter for finer mesh near the bottom surface the plate boundary is obtained by an equation of a straight line the computational domain is discretized with m x 1 and m y 1 number of grid points in x and y direction respectively the coordinates of any point are ξ m x 1 m x 1 and η m y 1 m y 1 where m x 1 2 m x 1 and m y 1 2 m y 1 the temporal discretization t j t j 1 δ t j j 0 1 2 is done with variable time step δ t j calculated based on the cfl condition as 20 δ t j α c m a x h s m i n 1 where c m a x is the maximum sound speed and h s m i n is the minimum of the directional length scale within the domain 0 α 0 5 is a regulation parameter which depends on the shock strength and grid size an explicit newmark time integration scheme is utilized for time marching details of the discretized equations are provided in appendix b 2 3 initial and boundary condition in the present work a slip boundary condition is applied at the bottom a b as shown in fig 2 the slip boundary is mathematically represented as 21 p e v x y y 0 0 and 22 u y y 0 0 the length b c is the wall boundary implementing a wall boundary requires that the velocity normal to the wall is zero this yields the wall boundary condition for the inclined region b c to be 23 p e v n s y 0 0 and 24 v y v x tan θ w here n s is the surface normal θ w is the wedge angle for zone d e and c d an outflow boundary condition is applied an outflow boundary can be implemented as 25 p e v y v x y y l y 0 the left side of the boundary a e can be considered as a face plane of a piston on which a constant velocity in the x direction is applied to model a constant shock of intended over pressure p s so the conditions that is applied on the left boundary x 0 is v x t 0 x 0 v and v y t 0 x 0 0 here v is the piston velocity which can be obtained from the jump condition for a desired peak over pressure p s i e p t 0 x 0 p s at time t 0 for any other grid locations x 0 y the ambient states are taken as the initial condition for the system of partial differential equations so the initial conditions are v x t 0 x 0 y 0 v y t 0 x 0 y 0 p t 0 x 0 y p 0 and e t 0 x 0 y e 0 where p 0 and e 0 are the pressure and internal energy at ambient conditions 3 result and discussion uniform shocks of various intensities impinging on a plate with oblique appendages of various angles are studied in this manuscript in all calculations presented in this manuscript the initial pressure p 0 is taken as the hydrostatic pressure p h y d at a water depth of 1 5 m i e p 0 p a t m p h y d the atmospheric pressure p a t m is taken as 1 013 bar initial internal energy e 0 corresponding to the chosen ambient condition is obtained from mie grüneisen eos the initial density of water is taken as 1000 kg m 3 a linear shock particle velocity relation is used for the mie grüneisen equation of state it is well known in the literature that high intensity shock compression of water results in a phase transition to ice vii bogdanov and rybakov 1992 dolan et al 2007 neogi and mitra 2016 however in this study since the present work deals with the conventional immobile marine and or hydraulic structures low shock intensities are considered such that the phase transition of water does not occur piston velocities v of 50 100 250 and 500 m s normalized shock velocity u s c 0 1 07 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 respectively where c 0 is the speed of sound in the water medium and u s refers to shock velocity are considered for the present study here it should be noted that the piston velocity v is the same as the particle velocity u p of the incident shock i e v u p numerical simulations are carried out to study the shock wave reflection characteristics for different incident shock velocities and wedge angles in this regard a rectangular domain of size 1 m 1 m is chosen for simulation the domain is discretized utilizing a computational grid generation technique presented in appendix b a finer grid is used near the plate surface using the clustering parameter ς which is taken as 1 05 for the present study the wedge angle is varied to obtain the desired obliquity of the submerged plate depending upon the shock intensity the artificial viscosity parameters k 1 and k 2 are varied between 1 10 7 and 1 10 6 and 1 10 6 1 10 5 respectively 3 1 convergence and accuracy of the numerical method in any numerical simulations mesh size significantly influences the accuracy of the mathematical model therefore simulations are carried out at first to test the convergence and accuracy of the numerical model presented in the manuscript as many as 7 different types of the grid size m x m y are chosen in this study 21 21 51 51 101 101 201 201 301 301 401 401 and 501 501 impulse transmitted i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l to the plate is computed for a normalized shock velocity and wedge angle e g u s c 0 1 37 and θ w 30 0 in different types of grid fig 3 a shows that for grid size greater than 201 201 the slope of the curve gradually tends towards zero the numerical algorithm is tested for accuracy by computing impulse transmitted to the plate for a normalized shock velocity u s c 0 of 1 37 the analytical formulation for computing impulse transmitted to a plate due to normal reflection is provided by ghoshal and mitra 2012 percentage error i a c c i p 100 i a c c with respect to the analytical solution for detail see ghoshal and mitra 2012 in computing impulse transmission using simulation is estimated on different grid size to check for accuracy fig 3b depicts that grid size higher than 201 201 the slope of the curve tends to zero and the magnitude of error is also negligible since all calculations presented here are performed on gird size 501 501 it can be assumed that the errors are well within an acceptable limit here it should be pointed out that negative percentage error can be attributed to the damping of solutions due to the inclusion of artificial viscosity in fig 4 normalized pressure plots for incident and reflected shocks are shown for a normalized shock velocity u s c 0 of 1 37 and wedge angle θ w 90 0 the incident impulse i i 0 t i p s d t for u s c 0 1 37 is obtained from numerical simulation is obtained as 8 33 104 n s m 2 here it should be noted peak over pressure is computed just before it reaches the plate in a free field scenario transmitted impulse per unit length i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l is computed as 2 216 105 n s m 2 therefore the relative impulse transmission i p i i can be obtained as 2 66 which is near about the same as the reflection coefficient obtained for normal shock wave reflection from a fixed rigid wall these simulations are repeated for all the normalized shock velocity considered in this manuscript and for each case it complies with analytical values presented in ghoshal and mitra 2012 this validates the 2 dimensional numerical framework presented in this manuscript 3 2 analysis on shock reflection characteristics pressure contour for different wedge angles and normalized shock velocity is provided in fig 5 in fig 5a a typical von neumann reflection vnr can be observed wherein the stem becomes continuously curved and a discontinuous triple point cannot be observed this type of reflection pattern is typically observed for shock impingement on a relatively small wedge angle and was reported extensively for oblique reflection in the air medium it is worth mentioning that the water being a denser material exhibits different reflection characteristics compared to air hence the region of this type of reflection is significantly different as shown in fig 5d see the analytical solution by ghoshal and mitra 2018 a von neumann type single mach reflection smr can be observed for normalized shock velocity u s c 0 and wedge angle θ w of 1 15 and 200 respectively now as normalized shock velocities and wedge angles are increased u s c 0 1 37 and θ w 300 the reflection type gradually changes and a slight kink begins to appear see 5 b which is termed as transitional mach reflection tmr in literature for shock waves air the kink in the tmr patterns is more noticeable as the normalized shock velocity and wedge angle u s c 0 1 75 and θ w 450 are increased further hence it has similarity with double mach reflection dmr two confluence points can be seen in fig 5c with a curved front and a distinct kink in the rear a representative shock polar is shown in fig 5e for the region of shock reflection considered in this manuscript it can be seen that the incident and the reflected shock polar do not intersect therefore no triple point solution is possible as per von neumann s shock theory this is termed as von neumann paradox in literature here it should be noted that for the parameter space in terms of normalized shock velocity and wedge angle considered in this manuscript regular reflection does not occur which is in contrary to the analytical calculations based on von neumann shock theory this can be attributed to the artificial viscous dissipation added to the numerical scheme to achieve a stable solution therefore this theoretical observation warrants an experimental investigation that is kept out of the scope of the present work therefore calculations in this manuscript are restricted to the regions of irregular reflection ir obtained through analytical calculations by ghoshal and mitra 20 see fig 5d it can also be observed that with the appearance of distinct kink with increasing wedge angle and normalized shock velocity the height of the stem gradually reduces hence an investigation is performed to study the effect of structural obliquity on the stem height and it is presented in the next section 3 3 effect of stem height on structural obliquity simulations are performed considering three different wedge angles for a particular incident normalized shock velocity to understand the effect of obliquity on the height of the stem three sets of simulations are performed considering three normalized shock velocities i e 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 wedge angles are chosen to be within the domain of ir as given in fig 5d and given respectively as 22 0 22 5 0 22 5 25 0 30 0 35 0 38 0 and 40 0 42 5 0 45 0 in all calculations stem heights are measured when the incident shock front reaches a distance of 0 75 m from the inlet boundary in table 1 height of the stem h s is presented for various structural obliquity and incident normalized shock velocities it is measured as the perpendicular distance from the wedge surface to the triple point it can be observed that the stem height decreases as the wedge angles are increased for a specific value of the incident normalized shock velocity this is particularly reasonable since increasing the wedge angle see the transition criteria in ref ghoshal and mitra 2018 for a particular piston velocity to eventually move from irregular reflection ir domain with a specific stem height to regular reflection rr region with no stem height the effect of triple point formation away from the surface of the wedge on impulse transmission is studied in the following section which is relevant with respect to structural design 3 4 effect of structural obliquity on impulse transmission the design of a structure for blast mitigation requires a prior estimate regarding impulse transmitted to the structure therefore impulse transmission per unit length is computed to investigate the effect of structural obliquity on transmitted impulse impulse transmitted i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l to the structures with various obliquity is computed for different incident normalized shock velocity here p f represents the pressure pulse experienced by each node on the plate since impingement the term t i is the time elapsed since impingement of shock at the tip of the wedge and is chosen to be 0 5 m s in the present manuscript simulations are carried out for uniform shocks with various normalized shock velocities u s c 0 i e 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 wedge angles are chosen within the irregular reflection range of each particle velocity θ w 20 0 20 5 0 25 0 for u s c 0 1 15 u p 100 m s θ w 30 0 35 0 38 0 u s c 0 1 37 u p 250 m s and θ w 40 0 42 5 0 45 0 u s c 0 1 75 u p 500 m s for the current manuscript in fig 6 relative impulse transmitted ratio of the transmitted impulse i p to the incident impulse i i 0 t i p s d t per unit length of the plate with different wedge angle is plotted for various incident velocities here it should be noted that when θ w 90 the situation is comparable to that of a normal shock reflection from a fixed rigid wall in this condition the relative impulse transmitted to the plate is the same as that of the reflection coefficient c r i e i p i i c r an analytical formulation to obtain the reflection coefficient c r for a normal reflection of underwater explosion induced shock wave from a fixed rigid wall was provided by ghoshal and mitra 2012 it is found that for θ w 90 the values of transmitted impulse obtained from numerical simulations are quite close to the analytical findings for detail of the analytical formulation see ref ghoshal and mitra 2012 thereby validating the numerical method utilized in the present manuscript fig 6 shows for any specific particle velocity the impulse transmission increases with an increase in the angle of the wedge it can be concluded from fig 6 that for a specific normalized shock velocity as the angle of the wedge θ w as shown in fig 2 increases impulse transmission per unit length of the plate reduces this essentially indicates that as we move from the irregular reflection domain where the shock reflection does not happen at the surface of the wedge plate but at certain height above the plate to that of the regular reflection domain where the shock reflection takes place at the surface of the wedge plate the impulse transmitted to the structure increases the magnitudes of relative impulse transmission are presented in table 2 for various structural obliquity and incident normalized shock velocities table 2 clearly indicates that a similar trend for all the incident normalized shock velocity i e the increase in the angle of the wedge θ w as shown in fig 2 increases the ratio of transmitted to the incident impulse to the plate in other words decreasing the wedge angle θ w as shown in fig 2 might be an effective mechanism to reduce the impulse transmitted to the plate eventually the implication of this observation amounts to the development of a measure which if suitably controlled can lead to mitigation of underwater shock load on the structure here it should be noted that a high fidelity 3d simulation considering the structure to be deformable along with the experiments is necessary before it can be applied in practice however given the framework of this manuscript this is kept out of the scope of the present study 4 conclusion this manuscript demonstrates that the obliquity angle measured with respect to the incident shock direction can effectively be utilized to reduce impulse transmission to marine and hydraulic structures subjected to underwater shock loads which consequently enhances blast and impact resistance it is shown that impulse transmitted to a fixed rigid structure reduces for irregular reflection in comparison to that of normal reflection it is also observed that for the same incident shock strength with the decrease in obliquity impulse transmitted to the plate also reduces the reduction in transmitted impulse due to irregular reflection can be attributed to the locus of triple point formation i e the height of the stem the farther it is the less is the transmitted impulse a parametric study on the height of the stem for various shock strength and structural obliquity is also performed this reveals that the increase in structural obliquity reduces the stem height these observations obtained by numerical simulations may be beneficial in designing marine and hydraulic structures against underwater blast loads as well as several other natural phenomena such as hydraulic jumps however it is essential to note that in a close in underwater explosion event spherical nature of the incident shock waves will have a significant effect on oblique reflection phenomena therefore a detailed study on spherical shock wave reflection from various types of surfaces curved and or corrugated surfaces may be considered as an extension of this work to utilize the present findings as an effective strategy for mitigation credit ritwik ghoshal and nilanjan mitra both are responsible for establishing the theory within the paper the contribution from both the authors are equal declaration of competing interest

21760,this paper investigates the effect of obliquity on impulse imparted to the hydraulic structures by an underwater shock wave in this regard the oblique shock reflection phenomenon due to a planar shock wave impingement on an inclined rigid surface is numerically modeled results from simulations are presented in this manuscript for different shock strengths and angles of structure obliquity the study reveals that impulse transmitted to the structure due to oblique shock reflection is lower than that of normal incidence in specific regimes of structure obliquity to incident shock direction the formation of mach stem is observed i e triple point configuration at a certain distance from the structure inside these regimes the stem height decreases with the increase in structure obliquity and vice versa locus of the triple point has a direct implication on the magnitude of transmitted impulse which reduces with the increase in stem height i e more the locus of the triple point is away from the structure less is the transmitted impulse results presented in this manuscript may help in understanding the physics of shock reflections from submerged hydraulic structures and subsequently framing mitigation strategies keywords shock wave compressible flow blast load oblique reflection offshore structures 1 introduction hydraulic structures such as gravity dams or gravity platforms foundation of offshore structures wind turbines and bridge piers are susceptible to underwater shock loads either from various natural e g hydraulic jump and or man made e g underwater explosion situations all these phenomena involve high speed liquid impact involving water which in turn leads to the formation of normal and oblique shocks therefore fluid structure interaction during underwater shock impingement and reflection is a subject of considerable interest and concern for many years cole 1948 swisdak 1978 an extensive body of literature exists on this topic primarily based on exploiting taylor s concept which prescribes that the impulse transmitted to the structure can be significantly reduced by using a lightweight structure taylor 1963 it persuaded researchers to investigate the effectiveness of various advanced lightweight materials and or material configurations to mitigate the effect of shock loading on submerged structures ghoshal and mitra 2014 2016 several experimental and numerical studies on scaled models and prototypes of naval structures e g ship hulls autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and submarines was conducted to study dynamic deformation and failure modes lance et al 2017 yang et al 2019 recently the effect of structural obliquity on the response of flexible plates subjected to underwater impact load was reported moradi et al 2018 however this study also focuses on underwater blast mitigation through fluid structure interaction this concept of utilizing the motion and or deformation of structure in reducing relative momentum transfer may not be applicable to hydraulic structures which are inherently heavy and stationary the consequences of a failure of these structures are significant concerning both human lives and property loss therefore in the present study an effort is made to investigate whether the existing obliquity in hydraulic structures can be efficiently designed to reduce transmitted impulse in literature there exist studies sommerfeld and müller 1988 desjouy et al 2016 where underwater blast load on different types of structures surfaces was explored extensively it is quite well known that structural obliquity may lead to oblique reflection of shock and these reflection patterns are typically classified as regular reflection and irregular reflection depending on the formation of mach stem briefly in an oblique shock wave reflection mach stem may be observed as a result of the formation of a triple point the point where the three shocks meet viz incident reflected and mach stem above the rigid surface of reflection see fig 1 however no such case is possible for a normal shock reflection from structures with a flat surface oblique shock waves result in more favorable post shock conditions and it is often preferable in aerospace applications when compared to normal shocks von neumann 1943 a great deal of research was conducted on identifying implication of shock strength and load obliquity on the transition from regular to irregular reflection henderson and lozzi 1979 hornung 1986 a detail exposition on this topic can be found in ben dor 2007 in recent work it was reported that oblique reflections could be more effective in mitigating air blast loading on structures in comparison to that of normal reflections peng et al 2011 however in most of the studies for oblique shocks reflection phenomena consider air as the medium kambouchev et al 2006 ghoshal and mitra 2015 here it should be noted that the degree of compressibility of air and water is remarkably different hence the theories of air shock loading cannot be directly applied in determining the underwater shock loading on structures moreover until recently before the work by the authors ghoshal and mitra 2018 the domain of regular and irregular reflection in water at high pressure regimes were not identified where the phase transition of water was reported to be observed prior to this ridah 1988 theoretically demonstrated the detachment criteria and sonic criteria for an oblique shock in water however this work was limited to relatively low pressure it was reported that at high pressure ranges nonlinear compressibility of water becomes predominant and can be beneficial in reducing transmitted impulse whereas for the heavy stationary structure it causes a significant enhancement in transmitted impulse jackson and jamnia 1984 ghoshal and mitra 2012 therefore a significant number of works exist in the literature which focuses on the mitigation of shock loads using a lightweight structure moreover most of these studies are based on normal shock wave reflection from the submerged rigid structure however the effect of obliquity in hydraulic structures on transmitted impulse was not studied thoroughly also the ranges of most least dangerous obliquity is yet to be determined apart from primary shock waves during an underwater explosion secondary shock waves emanating from the pulsating cavitation bubble may produce oblique shock wave upon reflection from structures the collapse of a cavitation bubble near to the structural surface can also produce oblique shock reflection the collapse of these bubbles near to structure produces liquid jets impact which makes explosion bubble structure interaction complex phenomena özarmut et al 2019 however the cavitation bubble collapse is a phenomenon that occurs at a much larger time scale as compared to that of the primary shock wave therefore the influence of the cavitation bubble collapse is not considered as this work focuses is primarily on non contact underwater explosion induced shock waves apparently most hydraulic structures are deformable and an underwater blast of high intensity may lead to local failure and or fracture in the structure williams and williamson 2011 doronin 2019 however for submerged hydraulic structures due to its inherent heavyweight the global motion of the structure will be negligible and hence it is considered as a rigid body non deformable which eventually has infinite acoustic impedance therefore in the present study the fluid structure interaction effects are not considered and the structure is considered to be stationary therefore the local cavitation effects due to fluid structure interaction never occur in this context it should also be mentioned that shock waves originating from underwater explosions are spherical in nature at a sufficient distance from the point of detonation depending on the mass explosive material and stand off distance such waves can be taken as planar uniform shocks i e constant pressure with infinite decay time which are typically considered in shock tube experiments mouritz and rajapakse 2017 however the strength of the impinging shock is considered to be high enough such that the nonlinear compressibility effect cannot be neglected the present study delves deeper into the physics of underwater oblique shock wave reflection from submerged rigid structures to explore the implications of structural obliquity on impulse transmission in this regard uniform planar shock wave reflection from submerged rigid structures is studied numerically considering various obliquity and shock strength a systematic comparative study against the normal shock reflection is performed to explore the effect of obliquity the layout of this manuscript is as follows in sec 2 the problem definition is presented along with numerical formulation which requires artificial viscous dissipation for shock capturing in a 2 d framework sec 3 contains the result from the numerical simulations along with the discussion on the implications of obliquity in transmitted impulse and subsequently on underwater blast resistance design of hydraulic structures finally in sec 4 concluding remarks are given 2 coupled problem statement planar shock wave impingement on an underwater submerged rigid structure with obliquity is numerically modeled the shock wave reflection from the inclined surface of the structure may cause an oblique reflection of shock therefore the problem is cast in a two space dimension i e mass momentum and energy conservation equations of the two dimensional form are solved shock capturing is accomplished by the von neumann richtmyer algorithm which uses an artificial dissipative mechanism in the form of artificial viscosity similar to previous publications by the authors ghoshal and mitra 2012 2014 in which a 1 d model was presented mie grüneisen eos is used in modeling of the nonlinear compressible water medium in two space dimension 2 1 governing equation conservation equations of the lagrangian form are used as governing equations for the system and they are as follows mass conservation in a two dimensional domain mass conservation can be written as 1 d ρ d t ρ v x x v y y where v x and v y are the velocity in x and y direction respectively ρ is the current density momentum conservation conservation of linear momentum in the two space dimension will have two equations and they are as follows x direction 2 ρ d v x d t σ x x x σ y x y y direction 3 ρ d v y d t σ x y x σ y y y here v x and v y are the material particle velocity in x and y direction respectively σ x x σ x y σ y x and σ y y are the components of stress tensor σ in tensor notation stress tensor σ can be written as 4 σ i j p δ i j τ i j where p is the pressure δ i j is the krönecker delta τ i j is the artificial stress tensor and can be expressed as 5 τ i j μ s ε i j where μ s is the scalar artificial viscosity coefficient and ε i j symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor ε i j is expressed as 6 ε i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i artificial dissipative terms are introduced into the governing differential equations to smear out the discontinuity shock over a certain width therefore these governing differential equations can be solved for the entire domain even in the presence of discontinuity shock a scalar artificial viscosity μ s is defined as some measure of compression or jump in a specific shock direction and is taken as dobrev et al 2012 7 μ s ρ k 1 ψ 0 ψ 1 h s c k 2 h s 2 δ s v in eq 7 k 1 and k 2 are the artificial viscosity coefficients ρ is the current density and c is the local sound speed δ s v is the directional measure of compression and can be obtained by solving the following eigenvalue problem bazilevs et al 2013 8 s v λ i e 0 where λ i and s i i 1 n s d are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric part of velocity gradient tensor i e rate of strain tensor δ s v is defined as 9 δ s v min i 1 n s d s s v s λ m i n the corresponding directional length scale becomes 10 h s 2 s m i n g s m i n 1 2 where g is the metric tensor and is given by 11 g ξ x t ξ x ξ is the parametric coordinate ψ 1 is the compression switch parameter it forces the linear term of the scalar artificial viscosity to zero when there is an expansion in the flow whereby 12 ψ 1 1 λ m i n 0 0 λ m i n 0 ψ 0 is the vorticity limiter and it also reduces the influence of linear term in vorticity dominating flows ψ 0 is expressed as 13 ψ 0 v v energy conservation in a two dimensional lagrangian formulation the energy conservation equation is expressed as 14 ρ d e d t p v x x v y y τ x x v x x τ y x v x y τ x y v y x τ y y v y y here τ x x τ x y τ y x and τ y y are the components of the artificial stress tensor p is the pressure and can be obtained from the equation of state equation of state in the present work mie grüneisen eos is used to model the nonlinear compressibility of water a complete expression for mie grüneisen eos requires two equations one for compression phase 16 p ρ 0 c 0 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ 1 s 1 μ 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e if μ 0 and another for the expansion phase 17 p ρ 0 c 0 2 μ γ 0 ρ 0 e if μ 0 where γ 0 is the grüneisen parameter at the initial state mie grüneisen eos is developed based on experimentally determined hugoniot curve which refers to the plot of shock velocity u s vs particle velocity u p in the present work the shock particle velocity relation provided by bogdanov and rybakov 27 is used this shock particle velocity u s u p relation consists of three discrete linear segments u s c 0 s u p and considers the effect of phase change of water at high pressure however for the present work only phase i is considered and hence c 0 1450 and s 2 166 are used in this manuscript it is difficult to discretize the governing equations in an irregular physical domain using the finite difference technique therefore it is necessary to map or transform the irregular physical domain x y to a computational domain ξ η the mapping is one to one which corresponds between the physical domain x y and the computational domain ξ η subsequently the components of velocity gradient tensor are required to be transformed in a general coordinate system and these transformed equations will eventually be used to derive the discrete expressions margolin and shashkov 1999 see appendix a 2 2 discretization of the governing equations the computational coordinates are known by rectangular grid relation and they must be converted back to a physical domain for use so an algebraic grid is created using the points of the computational domain ξ η given by relations 18 x ξ and 19 y h t ς 1 ς 1 ς 1 ς 1 1 η ς 1 ς 1 1 η 1 the x coordinate is unaltered as can be seen from eq 18 however the y coordinate is governed by two parameters h t and ς here h t is the total height along the y axis and ς is a clustering parameter for finer mesh near the bottom surface the plate boundary is obtained by an equation of a straight line the computational domain is discretized with m x 1 and m y 1 number of grid points in x and y direction respectively the coordinates of any point are ξ m x 1 m x 1 and η m y 1 m y 1 where m x 1 2 m x 1 and m y 1 2 m y 1 the temporal discretization t j t j 1 δ t j j 0 1 2 is done with variable time step δ t j calculated based on the cfl condition as 20 δ t j α c m a x h s m i n 1 where c m a x is the maximum sound speed and h s m i n is the minimum of the directional length scale within the domain 0 α 0 5 is a regulation parameter which depends on the shock strength and grid size an explicit newmark time integration scheme is utilized for time marching details of the discretized equations are provided in appendix b 2 3 initial and boundary condition in the present work a slip boundary condition is applied at the bottom a b as shown in fig 2 the slip boundary is mathematically represented as 21 p e v x y y 0 0 and 22 u y y 0 0 the length b c is the wall boundary implementing a wall boundary requires that the velocity normal to the wall is zero this yields the wall boundary condition for the inclined region b c to be 23 p e v n s y 0 0 and 24 v y v x tan θ w here n s is the surface normal θ w is the wedge angle for zone d e and c d an outflow boundary condition is applied an outflow boundary can be implemented as 25 p e v y v x y y l y 0 the left side of the boundary a e can be considered as a face plane of a piston on which a constant velocity in the x direction is applied to model a constant shock of intended over pressure p s so the conditions that is applied on the left boundary x 0 is v x t 0 x 0 v and v y t 0 x 0 0 here v is the piston velocity which can be obtained from the jump condition for a desired peak over pressure p s i e p t 0 x 0 p s at time t 0 for any other grid locations x 0 y the ambient states are taken as the initial condition for the system of partial differential equations so the initial conditions are v x t 0 x 0 y 0 v y t 0 x 0 y 0 p t 0 x 0 y p 0 and e t 0 x 0 y e 0 where p 0 and e 0 are the pressure and internal energy at ambient conditions 3 result and discussion uniform shocks of various intensities impinging on a plate with oblique appendages of various angles are studied in this manuscript in all calculations presented in this manuscript the initial pressure p 0 is taken as the hydrostatic pressure p h y d at a water depth of 1 5 m i e p 0 p a t m p h y d the atmospheric pressure p a t m is taken as 1 013 bar initial internal energy e 0 corresponding to the chosen ambient condition is obtained from mie grüneisen eos the initial density of water is taken as 1000 kg m 3 a linear shock particle velocity relation is used for the mie grüneisen equation of state it is well known in the literature that high intensity shock compression of water results in a phase transition to ice vii bogdanov and rybakov 1992 dolan et al 2007 neogi and mitra 2016 however in this study since the present work deals with the conventional immobile marine and or hydraulic structures low shock intensities are considered such that the phase transition of water does not occur piston velocities v of 50 100 250 and 500 m s normalized shock velocity u s c 0 1 07 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 respectively where c 0 is the speed of sound in the water medium and u s refers to shock velocity are considered for the present study here it should be noted that the piston velocity v is the same as the particle velocity u p of the incident shock i e v u p numerical simulations are carried out to study the shock wave reflection characteristics for different incident shock velocities and wedge angles in this regard a rectangular domain of size 1 m 1 m is chosen for simulation the domain is discretized utilizing a computational grid generation technique presented in appendix b a finer grid is used near the plate surface using the clustering parameter ς which is taken as 1 05 for the present study the wedge angle is varied to obtain the desired obliquity of the submerged plate depending upon the shock intensity the artificial viscosity parameters k 1 and k 2 are varied between 1 10 7 and 1 10 6 and 1 10 6 1 10 5 respectively 3 1 convergence and accuracy of the numerical method in any numerical simulations mesh size significantly influences the accuracy of the mathematical model therefore simulations are carried out at first to test the convergence and accuracy of the numerical model presented in the manuscript as many as 7 different types of the grid size m x m y are chosen in this study 21 21 51 51 101 101 201 201 301 301 401 401 and 501 501 impulse transmitted i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l to the plate is computed for a normalized shock velocity and wedge angle e g u s c 0 1 37 and θ w 30 0 in different types of grid fig 3 a shows that for grid size greater than 201 201 the slope of the curve gradually tends towards zero the numerical algorithm is tested for accuracy by computing impulse transmitted to the plate for a normalized shock velocity u s c 0 of 1 37 the analytical formulation for computing impulse transmitted to a plate due to normal reflection is provided by ghoshal and mitra 2012 percentage error i a c c i p 100 i a c c with respect to the analytical solution for detail see ghoshal and mitra 2012 in computing impulse transmission using simulation is estimated on different grid size to check for accuracy fig 3b depicts that grid size higher than 201 201 the slope of the curve tends to zero and the magnitude of error is also negligible since all calculations presented here are performed on gird size 501 501 it can be assumed that the errors are well within an acceptable limit here it should be pointed out that negative percentage error can be attributed to the damping of solutions due to the inclusion of artificial viscosity in fig 4 normalized pressure plots for incident and reflected shocks are shown for a normalized shock velocity u s c 0 of 1 37 and wedge angle θ w 90 0 the incident impulse i i 0 t i p s d t for u s c 0 1 37 is obtained from numerical simulation is obtained as 8 33 104 n s m 2 here it should be noted peak over pressure is computed just before it reaches the plate in a free field scenario transmitted impulse per unit length i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l is computed as 2 216 105 n s m 2 therefore the relative impulse transmission i p i i can be obtained as 2 66 which is near about the same as the reflection coefficient obtained for normal shock wave reflection from a fixed rigid wall these simulations are repeated for all the normalized shock velocity considered in this manuscript and for each case it complies with analytical values presented in ghoshal and mitra 2012 this validates the 2 dimensional numerical framework presented in this manuscript 3 2 analysis on shock reflection characteristics pressure contour for different wedge angles and normalized shock velocity is provided in fig 5 in fig 5a a typical von neumann reflection vnr can be observed wherein the stem becomes continuously curved and a discontinuous triple point cannot be observed this type of reflection pattern is typically observed for shock impingement on a relatively small wedge angle and was reported extensively for oblique reflection in the air medium it is worth mentioning that the water being a denser material exhibits different reflection characteristics compared to air hence the region of this type of reflection is significantly different as shown in fig 5d see the analytical solution by ghoshal and mitra 2018 a von neumann type single mach reflection smr can be observed for normalized shock velocity u s c 0 and wedge angle θ w of 1 15 and 200 respectively now as normalized shock velocities and wedge angles are increased u s c 0 1 37 and θ w 300 the reflection type gradually changes and a slight kink begins to appear see 5 b which is termed as transitional mach reflection tmr in literature for shock waves air the kink in the tmr patterns is more noticeable as the normalized shock velocity and wedge angle u s c 0 1 75 and θ w 450 are increased further hence it has similarity with double mach reflection dmr two confluence points can be seen in fig 5c with a curved front and a distinct kink in the rear a representative shock polar is shown in fig 5e for the region of shock reflection considered in this manuscript it can be seen that the incident and the reflected shock polar do not intersect therefore no triple point solution is possible as per von neumann s shock theory this is termed as von neumann paradox in literature here it should be noted that for the parameter space in terms of normalized shock velocity and wedge angle considered in this manuscript regular reflection does not occur which is in contrary to the analytical calculations based on von neumann shock theory this can be attributed to the artificial viscous dissipation added to the numerical scheme to achieve a stable solution therefore this theoretical observation warrants an experimental investigation that is kept out of the scope of the present work therefore calculations in this manuscript are restricted to the regions of irregular reflection ir obtained through analytical calculations by ghoshal and mitra 20 see fig 5d it can also be observed that with the appearance of distinct kink with increasing wedge angle and normalized shock velocity the height of the stem gradually reduces hence an investigation is performed to study the effect of structural obliquity on the stem height and it is presented in the next section 3 3 effect of stem height on structural obliquity simulations are performed considering three different wedge angles for a particular incident normalized shock velocity to understand the effect of obliquity on the height of the stem three sets of simulations are performed considering three normalized shock velocities i e 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 wedge angles are chosen to be within the domain of ir as given in fig 5d and given respectively as 22 0 22 5 0 22 5 25 0 30 0 35 0 38 0 and 40 0 42 5 0 45 0 in all calculations stem heights are measured when the incident shock front reaches a distance of 0 75 m from the inlet boundary in table 1 height of the stem h s is presented for various structural obliquity and incident normalized shock velocities it is measured as the perpendicular distance from the wedge surface to the triple point it can be observed that the stem height decreases as the wedge angles are increased for a specific value of the incident normalized shock velocity this is particularly reasonable since increasing the wedge angle see the transition criteria in ref ghoshal and mitra 2018 for a particular piston velocity to eventually move from irregular reflection ir domain with a specific stem height to regular reflection rr region with no stem height the effect of triple point formation away from the surface of the wedge on impulse transmission is studied in the following section which is relevant with respect to structural design 3 4 effect of structural obliquity on impulse transmission the design of a structure for blast mitigation requires a prior estimate regarding impulse transmitted to the structure therefore impulse transmission per unit length is computed to investigate the effect of structural obliquity on transmitted impulse impulse transmitted i p 0 t i 0 l p f d l d t l to the structures with various obliquity is computed for different incident normalized shock velocity here p f represents the pressure pulse experienced by each node on the plate since impingement the term t i is the time elapsed since impingement of shock at the tip of the wedge and is chosen to be 0 5 m s in the present manuscript simulations are carried out for uniform shocks with various normalized shock velocities u s c 0 i e 1 15 1 37 and 1 75 wedge angles are chosen within the irregular reflection range of each particle velocity θ w 20 0 20 5 0 25 0 for u s c 0 1 15 u p 100 m s θ w 30 0 35 0 38 0 u s c 0 1 37 u p 250 m s and θ w 40 0 42 5 0 45 0 u s c 0 1 75 u p 500 m s for the current manuscript in fig 6 relative impulse transmitted ratio of the transmitted impulse i p to the incident impulse i i 0 t i p s d t per unit length of the plate with different wedge angle is plotted for various incident velocities here it should be noted that when θ w 90 the situation is comparable to that of a normal shock reflection from a fixed rigid wall in this condition the relative impulse transmitted to the plate is the same as that of the reflection coefficient c r i e i p i i c r an analytical formulation to obtain the reflection coefficient c r for a normal reflection of underwater explosion induced shock wave from a fixed rigid wall was provided by ghoshal and mitra 2012 it is found that for θ w 90 the values of transmitted impulse obtained from numerical simulations are quite close to the analytical findings for detail of the analytical formulation see ref ghoshal and mitra 2012 thereby validating the numerical method utilized in the present manuscript fig 6 shows for any specific particle velocity the impulse transmission increases with an increase in the angle of the wedge it can be concluded from fig 6 that for a specific normalized shock velocity as the angle of the wedge θ w as shown in fig 2 increases impulse transmission per unit length of the plate reduces this essentially indicates that as we move from the irregular reflection domain where the shock reflection does not happen at the surface of the wedge plate but at certain height above the plate to that of the regular reflection domain where the shock reflection takes place at the surface of the wedge plate the impulse transmitted to the structure increases the magnitudes of relative impulse transmission are presented in table 2 for various structural obliquity and incident normalized shock velocities table 2 clearly indicates that a similar trend for all the incident normalized shock velocity i e the increase in the angle of the wedge θ w as shown in fig 2 increases the ratio of transmitted to the incident impulse to the plate in other words decreasing the wedge angle θ w as shown in fig 2 might be an effective mechanism to reduce the impulse transmitted to the plate eventually the implication of this observation amounts to the development of a measure which if suitably controlled can lead to mitigation of underwater shock load on the structure here it should be noted that a high fidelity 3d simulation considering the structure to be deformable along with the experiments is necessary before it can be applied in practice however given the framework of this manuscript this is kept out of the scope of the present study 4 conclusion this manuscript demonstrates that the obliquity angle measured with respect to the incident shock direction can effectively be utilized to reduce impulse transmission to marine and hydraulic structures subjected to underwater shock loads which consequently enhances blast and impact resistance it is shown that impulse transmitted to a fixed rigid structure reduces for irregular reflection in comparison to that of normal reflection it is also observed that for the same incident shock strength with the decrease in obliquity impulse transmitted to the plate also reduces the reduction in transmitted impulse due to irregular reflection can be attributed to the locus of triple point formation i e the height of the stem the farther it is the less is the transmitted impulse a parametric study on the height of the stem for various shock strength and structural obliquity is also performed this reveals that the increase in structural obliquity reduces the stem height these observations obtained by numerical simulations may be beneficial in designing marine and hydraulic structures against underwater blast loads as well as several other natural phenomena such as hydraulic jumps however it is essential to note that in a close in underwater explosion event spherical nature of the incident shock waves will have a significant effect on oblique reflection phenomena therefore a detailed study on spherical shock wave reflection from various types of surfaces curved and or corrugated surfaces may be considered as an extension of this work to utilize the present findings as an effective strategy for

21761,vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder subjected to an oscillatory flow is investigated by two dimensional numerical simulations a low reynolds number of re 150 and two keulegan carpenter numbers of 5 and 10 are chosen in this study a wide range of frequency ratios which is defined as the ratio of the oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency are studied the cylinder with mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 is free to vibrate at zero damping ratio along the streamwise direction only the vibration velocity of the cylinder relative to the fluid motion referred to as relative velocity is found to vary significantly with the frequency ratio the amplitude of the relative velocity is greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity as the frequency ratio is less than a critical value which is slightly smaller than 1 the amplitude of the relative velocity significantly reduces as the frequency ratio is greater than this critical value the change of the phase difference between the cylinder motion and fluid motion is identified as the cause for the increase or decrease of the relative velocity the phase changes from 90 to 90 as the frequency ratio exceeds 1 the drag force is found to be zero at a frequency ratio of 1 keywords oscillatory flow vortex induced vibration low reynolds number 1 introduction as fluid flow comes in contact with an object it may produce flow induced vibration a topic of interest in fluid structure interaction is the study of vortex shedding and its impact on a cylinder the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in a steady flow occurs when the reynolds number re exceeds approximately 47 williamson 1996 the re is defined as re ud ν where u is the fluid velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid barkley and henderson 1996 found the wake flow becomes unstable and three dimensional as re exceeds 188 5 1 0 and becomes fully turbulent when re 300 it was demonstrated that for an elastically mounted cylinder subject to vortex shedding the amplitude of cylinder vibration is dependent on the cylinder s mass natural frequency and damping ratio raghavan 2011 the synchronization between vortex shedding and cylinder vibration frequency is found to occur within a range of reduced velocities which is also referred to as lock in regime govardhan and williamson 2000 the reduced velocity is defined as u r u f n d where u is the incoming fluid velocity and f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder modir et al 2016 and cen et al 2016 conducted experiments of vortex induced vibration viv of a flexibly mounted cylinder at different mass ratios and found the lowest mass ratio produced the largest vibration amplitude mass ratio is the ratio of the cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass in many numerical studies of viv of a circular cylinder the damping is zero in order to achieve the maximum response amplitude silva et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in offshore engineering wave induced water motion is commonly modelled by oscillatory flow the interaction between circular cylinders and oscillatory flow is relevant to engineering applications such as offshore pipelines riser pipes mooring cables etc in addition to re the effects of oscillatory flow on vortex shedding is also dependent on the keulegan carpenter k c number the kc is defined as kc u m t d where u m and t are the amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow velocity respectively the relationship between the kc number and the amplitude of the fluid motion a is kc 2πa d the stokes number β is used to describe the ratio between re and kc i e β re kc d 2 νt increasing k c may also induce the flow transition from laminar to turbulent sarpkaya 1986 the generation of vortices in oscillatory flow occurs every half period of oscillatory movement provided that k c is greater than 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 as the k c is increased β 50 800 and kc 1 2 2 4 the flow changes from unstable to displaying three dimensional disturbances honji 1981 and the gap between adjacent honji vortices that are shed has also been shown to be approximately related to k c by g d 0 2 k c 7 4 an et al 2011 tatsuno and bearman 1990 experimentally investigated the flow around an oscillating cylinder at low k c numbers and identified eight different regimes these flow regimes are described below o regime a no vortex shedding occurs o regime a vortices start forming and two vortices are shed symmetrical per half cycle o regime b vortices are formed due to instability in the boundary layer flow 3d structure o regime c large vortices of opposite sign are formed for the number of oscillation cycles o regime d asymmetrical vortices with opposite rotations are formed due to the cylinders movement and the flow is convected implicitly to one side of the axis o regime e it is similar to regime d except the flow switches to the other side of the movement at irregular intervals and the flow is convected diagonally o regime f due to the cylinder moving a large clockwise vortex is formed on the upper side and a smaller counter clockwise vortex is formed on the lower side o regime g two vortices are formed one is attached to the cylinder and the other is shed from the cylinder numerical investigation into oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at low r e and k c was conducted by dutsch et al 1998 and the simulated flow patterns concurred with experimental data of tatsuno and bearman 1990 vortex shedding in the wake of an oscillating cylinder can be categorized based on the number and pattern of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one cylinder oscillating period williamson and roshko 1988 classified the case of two single vortices being shed from the cylinder as 2s mode a pair of vortices being shed as p mode and a pair and a single vortex being shed as p s mode if a cylinder is elastically mounted in an oscillatory flow and is only allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction the cylinder s vibration amplitude in oscillatory flow is reported to increase as reduced velocity increases until it reaches a maximum amplitude then increasing the reduced velocity will lower the amplitude fu et al 2018 the vibration frequency is dependant on the amount of vortices that are shed during a flow period zhao et al 2012 the majority of current literature has focused on flow induced vibration fiv in the cross flow direction with little attention towards fiv in oscillatory flows in the in line direction the vibration of a cylinder in the inline direction makes the relative velocity between the cylinder and the flow different from the flow velocity this variation in the relative velocity either more or less than the flow velocity impacts the cylinder s response and vortex shedding pattern in this paper the effects of the kc number and frequency ratio have on the cylinder are investigated including the vibration amplitude and fluid force the frequency ratio is defined as the ratio of the oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 numerical simulations are carried out at a constant reynolds number r e 150 for two keulegan carpenter numbers k c 5 and 10 for each kc three mass ratio values m 1 2 and 3 are investigated in the frequency ratio ranging from 1 to 2 for kc 10 and from 1 to 4 for kc 5 2 numerical method a cartesian coordinate system x y is defined in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is at the cylinder centre and the x direction is aligned to the streamwise direction the cylinder is elastically mounted with a spring and a damper however the mechanical damping coefficient is set to zero in this study in order to achieve the maximum possible amplitude the oscillatory flow velocity is a sinusoidal function of time 1 u t u m sin 2 π t t where u is oscillatory velocity of the fluid t is time u m and t are the amplitude and period of the fluid velocity respectively the reynolds number of the oscillatory flow is defined as re u m d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the fluid is assumed incompressible and can be governed by the two dimensional incompressible navier stokes ns equations the velocity the time and the pressure are non dimensionalized as u v u v u t t u m d and pressure p p ρ u m 2 where u and v are the fluid velocity components in the x and y directions respectively and p is the pressure the variables with and without wave dashes stand for dimensional and non dimensional values respectively as the boundaries of the vibrating cylinder moves continuously the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme is employed to allow the motion of the cylinder to be modelled using the numerical model by zhao et al 2013 in the ale scheme the mesh moves and the convection terms of the ns equations are modified to consider the motion of the mesh the non dimensional ns equations are 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u ˆ u x v v ˆ u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u u ˆ v x v v ˆ v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 in eq 2 u ˆ and v ˆ are the velocity of the mesh nodes in the x and y directions respectively the motion of the cylinder is represented by the non dimensional motion equation 5 d 2 x d t 2 4 π ζ u r d x d t 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c f x π m where c fx is the non dimensional force in the x direction defined as c fx f x ρ d u m 2 2 f x is the fluid force in the x direction the cylinder surface is smooth and thus a no slip boundary condition is applied i e the fluid velocity on the cylinder surface is the same as the vibrating velocity of the cylinder on the left and right boundaries non dimensional sinusoidal oscillatory flow velocity is given as u t sin ω t where ω 2π kc is the non dimensional angular frequency the pressure on the left and right boundaries are p ω cos ω t x on the top and bottom boundaries symmetric boundary condition is used i e the velocity component in the y direction the vertical gradient of the velocity in the x direction and the vertical gradient of the pressure are zero the ns equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 a square non dimensional computational domain with a side length of 110 is used and the cylinder is located at the centre of the domain anagnostopoulos and minear 2004 reported that if the blockage the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the computational domain width is less than 0 2 its effect on the fluid force is negligible for kc 6 to ensure the vortices generated from the cylinder are not affected by the boundary the blockage of 0 0091 is used in this study the selected mesh size is based on the mesh dependency study for oscillatory flow past cylinders at re 150 conducted by zhao and cheng 2014 the computational domain is divided into 37040 four node quadrilateral finite elements and fig 2 shows the mesh near the cylinder the cylinder surface is divided into 160 elements and the minimum mesh size on the cylinder surface in the radial direction is 0 0008 the computational time step is δ t 0 0025 for accuracy and stability the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition must be satisfied i e the courant number defined as c u m δ t δ l must be less than 1 where δ l is the element size the courant number for numerical investigations in this paper is c 0 125 based on the incoming velocity and the element size on the cylinder surface in the tangential direction to validate the results numerical analysis was conducted using an open source spectral hp element code nektar cantwell et al 2015 which has been used by the second and fourth authors of this paper for simulating steady flow past oscillatory cylinders tang et al 2017 the set of equations 2 4 was solved through the velocity correction scheme along with a continuous galerkin projection from the unsteady incompressible ns solver a second order implicit explicit time integration scheme was chosen the code employs high order quadrilateral expansions within each element through the gauss lobatto legendre quadrature points n p the mesh and n p used in the nektar simulations are similar to that adopted in tang et al 2017 the incoming oscillatory flow velocity is the same harmonic function of time as given in equation 1 to avoid mesh deformation the cylinder oscillation is achieved through a moving frame fixed on the cylinder by introducing a forcing term in the momentum equations which is the additional acceleration as the result of the non inertial translation of the reference frame as detailed by newman and karniadakis 1997 fig 3 shows the comparison between the amplitudes of the cylinder vibration x m calculated by the present model and the ones calculated by nektar for r e 150 k c 5 and m 2 the vibration amplitude x m is defined as the maximum x within one period of vibration in the following discussion the non dimensional frequency of the oscillatory flow which is also referred to as frequency ratio is defined as f f w f n where f w is the oscillatory flow frequency and f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the relationship between the non dimensional oscillatory flow frequency and the reduced velocity is u r kc f excellent agreement between the two sets of results is observed in fig 3 the maximum difference between the two results is within 2 except at f 0 4 and 0 6 where x m changes with f rapidly to ensure the selected mesh is sufficiently dense for obtaining converged numerical results a mesh dependency study is conducted for two cases with different mesh densities as listed in table 1 here f 0 6 is the case with the highest relative velocity between the cylinder and fluid flow and f 4 is the largest frequency ratio studied in this work the number of nodes on the cylinder surface is represented by n s and the size of the first layer elements in the radial direction is represented by δr 1 mesh 1 is the mesh used for all calculations in this paper meshes 2 and 4 have double and half the mesh density along the surface of the cylinder respectively mesh 3 doubles the computational domain size the amplitude of the cylinder displacement xm and the standard deviation sd of the inline force cfx sd calculated from different meshes are compared with each other δx m and δc fx sd are the differences between the results of mesh 1 and other meshes in x m and c fx sd respectively the maximum difference 1 27 of the force occurs when f 4 and δt 0 00125 this investigation focuses on the vibration of a cylinder in the x direction only in an oscillatory flow two dimensional simulations at a low reynolds number of 150 is conducted to enable the vibration of the cylinder in a wide parametric space simulations are conducted for two k c values 5 and 10 and three m values 1 2 and 3 the reduced velocities are in the range between 1 and 20 corresponding to f ranging from 1 to 4 for kc 5 and 1 to 2 for kc 10 the flow in some cases are weakly three dimensional one three dimensional simulation with the largest relative velocity between the fluid and the cylinder was conducted the vibration displacement and the non dimensional inline force are found very close to the two dimensional numerical results the detailed comparison is shown in the appendix 3 result and discussion 3 1 the effect of the initial condition it is found that the flow develops to its equilibrium stage extremely slowly in some simulations to avoid treating not fully developed flow as the final result cases for kc 10 and m 1 are used as examples to discuss the effect of the initial condition simulations are firstly conducted for 100 oscillating periods with an initial condition where velocity and pressure are zero in the whole computational domain this initial condition is referred to as initial condition 1 ic1 fig 4 a shows an example of time histories of the lift force for all the reduced velocities for ic1 where t t t is defined as the period number the flow is initially symmetric resulting in a zero lift coefficient for all the cases the lift coefficient become nonzero after t 20 for many cases however the lift force is found still extremely small for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 at t 100 indicating that the vortex flow is still in the symmetric condition simulations for these cases were continued until t 300 the lift force become nonzero for f 0 55 but it is still very small for the rest of the cases the flow remains symmetric at t 300 for f 0 45 and 0 5 fig 5 a and b use contours of non dimensional vorticity and streaklines to present the flow patterns of the symmetric flow under ic1 streaklines are generated by releasing massless particles at 80 points that are evenly distributed on a circle with 0 02d outside the cylinder surface and 32 particles are released within one period with a time interval of t 32 at each point two vortices are shed from both the top and bottom sides of the cylinder simultaneously in each half period forming a horizontal vortex street on each side of the cylinder the lift coefficient for f 0 45 and 0 5 are not exactly zero because the flows in fig 5 a and b are not exactly symmetric although the flow is slightly asymmetric the disturbance is not sufficiently strong to make vortex shedding switch to regime f until t 300 to speed up the transition of the flow to its equilibrium state simulations for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 are repeated with a new initial condition which is the fully developed flow field at its nearest reduced velocity with the asymmetric vortex flow for example when f 0 3 is simulated the fully developed asymmetric flow field for f 0 35 is used as the initial condition this initial condition is referred to as initial condition 2 ic2 it can be seen in fig 4 b that for an asymmetric flow condition being used as the initial condition the lift force remains nonzero the vortex shedding flow for ic2 in fig 5 c and d are typical asymmetric regime f flow structure with 2 pairs of vortices being shed from the cylinder in one period the vortex flows for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 are believed to be intrinsically asymmetric because once the flow become asymmetric it never changes back to be symmetric all the simulations are checked and if the flow is found to be symmetric simulation was repeated with an asymmetric flow condition as initial condition fig 6 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude with the frequency ratio the initial results of kc 10 using ic1 is calculated using 10 periods of data from t 90 to 100 it can be seen that the not fully developed symmetric flow causes an increase in the vibration amplitude and it should not be used as the final result in all the simulations the resultant flow field are checked carefully to ensure fully developed flow is achieved it should be noted that the lift coefficient for f 0 9 is intrinsically small regardless of what initial condition is used or how long the simulation is conducted because the flow is in symmetric regime a which will be discussed in detail later on 3 2 vibration amplitude and effective kc number fig 7 a and b show the variation of the vibration amplitude with the frequency ratio for kc 5 and 10 respectively in each case x m follows the same trend i e the amplitude increases as f is increased from 0 1 until the amplitude reaches a peak and then it starts to decrease it is seen that the frequency ratio at which the maximum vibration amplitude occurs is less than 1 and the frequency ratio approaches 1 with the increase of m although the trends are very similar the smaller the m the higher the cylinders amplitude as f increases to its maximum investigated value the effect of m on the maximum vibration amplitude is similar to that of the vibration of cylinder in the transverse direction of a steady flow modir et al 2016 the results show that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder is greater than the amplitude of oscillatory water particles a d in fig 7 in a range of frequency ratios which narrows down as the mass ratio increases for m 1 x m approaches a d as f approaches infinity because a cylinder with the same density as fluid density drifts together with the flow as if the spring stiffness is zero the vibration amplitude of the cylinder for f decreases with the increase of the mass ratio the motion of the cylinder in the fluid makes the relative velocity between the cylinder and the fluid very different from the incoming fluid velocity the fluid force and the vortex flow pattern are affected significantly by the relative velocity v r between the fluid and cylinder which is calculated by v r u m sin 2 π t t d x d t and the amplitude of v r is defined as v rm the amplitude of the relative velocity v rm is found to be affected by the frequency ratio significantly as shown in fig 8 zero relative velocity which means the cylinder and flow are travelling at the same speed occurs when the mass ratio is 1 and f is infinity since the period of the oscillatory flow does not change the effective kc is defined based on the relative velocity v rm as k c eff v r m t d the reynolds number also changes and an effective reynolds number is defined as reeff v rm d ν fig 8 shows the variation of the relative velocity v rm and the effective kc eff with the frequency ratio the relative velocity is higher than 1 in a range of frequency ratios after v rm reaches its maximum value it monotonically decreases with the increase of f and approaches to zero as f is infinite and m 1 for m 2 and 3 after it peaks v rm reaches its minimum value which is nearly zero at a f greater than 1 then recovers and approaches to a non zero value as f approaches infinity it can be seen v rm reaches its minimum value at f 1 2 and 1 5 for m 3 and 2 respectively for m 1 v rm still decreases with the increase of f at the largest simulated f 4 by comparing fig 8 with fig 7 it is observed that the f where v rm reaches its minimum value coincides with f where x m a d proving that the fluid and cylinder oscillate with same velocity and amplitude the relative velocity v rm is always greater than 1 before it peaks to understand the frequency components of the vibration the vibration velocity of the cylinder is decomposed into harmonics as v x k 1 v s xk in k ω t ε k where v xk and ε k are the amplitude and phase of the k th harmonic respectively fig 9 shows the results of harmonic decomposition of the cylinder s velocity for m 1 the harmonic decomposition results for m 2 and 3 share the same characteristics as those for m 1 the 2nd and higher harmonics are insignificant compared to the 1st harmonic except for kc 10 and f 0 25 where the third and first harmonics are nearly the same to show the smaller higher order harmonics clearly diagrams with smaller scales of vertical axis are given in fig 9 in addition to the 1st harmonic it is found that the 3rd harmonic is the secondary component of the cylinder velocity the 3rd harmonic is the secondary component instead of the 2nd harmonic because the vortex shedding is in regime f with two pair of vortices being shed from the cylinder in one period correspondingly a 2p vortex shedding pattern results in a lift coefficient with a frequency three times the oscillatory flow frequency and furthermore a significant 3rd harmonics of the displacement as kc 5 the higher harmonics are consistently smaller than the 1st order while at kc 10 the third harmonic of the cylinder velocity is nearly the same as the 1st until f 0 25 beyond which the third harmonic reduces with the increase of f and almost diminish as f is about 1 since the velocity of the cylinder is nearly monochromatic with a dominant frequency the same as the oscillatory flow frequency the relative velocity of the cylinder v r is dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency this makes the vortex shedding patterns comparable with those for oscillation flow past a stationary cylinder the variation of kc eff with frequency ratio gives rise to the change in the vortex shedding pattern even for a constant reynolds number and a constant kc the kc eff for all the calculated cases are mapped on the regime map on the β kc eff plane in fig 10 the stokes numbers β d 2 νt for kc 5 and 10 are 30 and 15 respectively regardless of kc eff it can be seen that all the cases with kc 5 are distributed in regimes a a d and f on the map while those for kc 10 are distributed in regimes a a d and f in addition to all the regimes reported by tatsuno and bearman 1990 regime s marked in fig 10 is the symmetric flow regime that only occurs under ic1 and it does not transition to regime f within t 100 and t 300 for some cases regime s in the range of 13 2 k c eff 16 63 can only be seen when the configuration is ideally symmetric and there is no disturbance on the flow which may not exist in reality regime s also occurs in the case of oscillatory flow past a fixed cylinder a fixed cylinder with input parameters of k c 14 08 β 15 and r e 211 was simulated and the symmetrical pattern was present at the period number t 800 once the flow becomes asymmetric under ic2 the response amplitude and the velocity is reduced see fig 6 therefore kc eff is reduced to a value in regime f 3 3 vortex flow regimes the flow patterns around a vibrating cylinder in oscillatory flow changes with the change of kc eff figs 11 and 12 show some typical flow patterns for kc 5 and 10 respectively in each figure although the kc number is constant the flows are in different patterns depending on kc eff in fig 11 a vortices are not generated because kc eff is extremely small vortices are generated if the kc number exceed 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 the flows in figs 11 b and fig 12 a are typical regime a patterns where two vortices are generated in every half period these two vortices are not shed from the cylinder until the flow changes its direction fig 11 c is a typical regime d flow where one vortex is shed from only the bottom side of the cylinder in every half period and the two branches of vortex streets are in a v shape figs 11 d and fig 12 c are typical regime f flows where a pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder every half period forming a 2p vortex shedding pattern 3 4 correlation between force and vibration fig 13 shows the fft spectra of the vibration velocity and the inline force for some cases where the higher harmonics are significant in the small f range where f is the non dimensional frequency normalized by the frequency of the oscillatory flow the vibration velocity only has frequencies that are multiple of the frequency of the flow indicating the periodicity of the vibration from the fft spectra one can see that the dominant frequency of the vibration velocity is f 7 as f 0 1 and it reduces consecutively to f 5 3 and 1 as the frequency ratio increases to 0 15 0 3 and 0 4 respectively high vibration frequency was also reported when studying vibration of a cylinder in the crossflow direction in oscillatory flow kozakiewicz et al 1997 sumer and fredsoe 1988 the first harmonic of the vibration velocity is the same as the frequency of the oscillatory flow the dominance of 5th and 7th harmonic of the vibration velocity as the frequency ratio approaches zero is due to the modulation between different frequency components if one or multiple circulars are placed in oscillatory flow the dominant frequency of the inline force is equal to the frequency of the oscillating flow and its mean value is practically zero anagnostopoulos and dikarou 2011 the presence of the higher harmonics in the force is the result of the amplitude and frequency modulation shen et al 2017 the variation trends of x m and v rm with the frequency ratio are different from each other see figs 7 and 8 indicating that there is a phase difference between the fluid motion and the motion of the cylinder from fig 9 it can be seen that the vibration is dominated by the first harmonic except at very small frequency ratios where the vibration amplitude is very small the phase difference between the first harmonic of the cylinder s velocity and the oscillatory flow velocity is shown in fig 14 which are essentially the phase of the cylinder s velocity since the phase of the flow velocity is zero see eq 1 if two velocities v a and v b have the same frequency and defined as v a t a sin ω t ε a and v b t b sin ω t ε b respectively the amplitude of the relative velocity between them is a 2 b 2 a b cos ε a ε b 1 2 the amplitude of the relative velocity will be increased and is greater than a 2 b 2 1 2 if the phase between the two velocities is between 90 and 180 by comparing fig 14 with fig 8 it can be seen that the reason why the amplitude of the relative velocity v rm is greater than the amplitude of the fluid velocity is that the phase angle between the velocities of the fluid and the cylinder is between 90 and 180 with the increase of the frequency ratio f the phase difference ε in fig 14 becomes smaller than 90 and finally approaches zero correspondingly v rm in fig 8 reduces the phase difference ε varies weakly with f and is close to zero after f exceeds 1 the nearly in phase regime between the velocities of the cylinder and the fluid causes significant reduction in the relative velocity and effective kc number as shown in fig 8 fig 15 show the phase difference between the first harmonic of the inline force and the first harmonic of the vibration velocity since the structural damping is zero no net energy is transferred from the fluid to the cylinder and the phase between the inline force and the vibration velocity is either 90 or 90 the change of the phase from 90 to 90 occurs at f 1 fig 16 shows the variation of the standard deviation of the non dimensional inline force with the frequency ratio it is interesting to see that the force is zero when f 1 regardless of the mass ratio or the kc number because the damping ratio is zero the cylinder vibrates freely without any external force as f 1 in addition the vibration velocity and the vibration amplitude for all the mass ratios are the same as f 1 figs 7 and 8 at f 1 the vibration amplitudes for kc 5 and 10 are 1 298 and 2 364 respectively regardless of the mass ratio theoretically it is easy to understand that the force must be zero to ensure that the vibration has a finite vibration amplitude when the external force frequency and the natural frequency are the same any external force would cause infinite amplitude at synchronization without damping 4 conclusions flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow in the streamwise direction is investigated numerically two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for re 150 ζ 0 kc 5 and 10 m 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratios the main conclusions are summarized as follows it is found that the amplitude of the relative velocity of the moving cylinder to the fluid motion is greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity when the frequency ratio is smaller than some certain value the increased relative velocity results in a significant increase in the effective kc number kc eff on the other hand the kc eff reduces significantly as the frequency ratio is greater than 1 because kc eff changes with the frequency ratio for a constant kc number different flow regimes can be found the reason of the increase of kc eff is that the phase difference between the cylinder s velocity and the fluid velocity is between 90 and 180 causing the cylinder to move in the opposite direction of the flow most of the time within one period as the frequency ratio approaches infinity the phase between the cylinder motion and fluid motion becomes very small resulting in a very small relative velocity when the frequency ratio f 1 the drag force on the cylinder is zero and the cylinder vibrates freely without any external force or damping and interestingly the vibration amplitudes and the relative velocities for different mass ratios are the same the flow for some regime f cases remains symmetric until a few hundred periods of the flow provided the initial condition of the numerical simulation is that both the velocity and pressure in the whole domain are zero this symmetric flow pattern referred as regime s is unstable

validation for simulating oscillatory flow past cylinders was proved by an et al 2015 fig 17 a and b shows the comparison between the 2d and 3d results of the vibration displacement and non dimensional inline force respectively the comparison shows very good agreement on the displacement amplitude and inline force of the cylinder the iso surface of ω 1 in fig 17 c show a three dimensional flow pattern where ω represents the vorticity in the spanwise direction of the cylinder however the vortex flow pattern on the two dimensional xy plane at the centre of the cylinder is in regime f which is similar to the regime f in figs 10 and 11 the difference is that the vortices dissipate faster and some small scale vortices exist in fig 17 d fig 17 2d and 3d comparison of the

21761,vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder subjected to an oscillatory flow is investigated by two dimensional numerical simulations a low reynolds number of re 150 and two keulegan carpenter numbers of 5 and 10 are chosen in this study a wide range of frequency ratios which is defined as the ratio of the oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency are studied the cylinder with mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 is free to vibrate at zero damping ratio along the streamwise direction only the vibration velocity of the cylinder relative to the fluid motion referred to as relative velocity is found to vary significantly with the frequency ratio the amplitude of the relative velocity is greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity as the frequency ratio is less than a critical value which is slightly smaller than 1 the amplitude of the relative velocity significantly reduces as the frequency ratio is greater than this critical value the change of the phase difference between the cylinder motion and fluid motion is identified as the cause for the increase or decrease of the relative velocity the phase changes from 90 to 90 as the frequency ratio exceeds 1 the drag force is found to be zero at a frequency ratio of 1 keywords oscillatory flow vortex induced vibration low reynolds number 1 introduction as fluid flow comes in contact with an object it may produce flow induced vibration a topic of interest in fluid structure interaction is the study of vortex shedding and its impact on a cylinder the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in a steady flow occurs when the reynolds number re exceeds approximately 47 williamson 1996 the re is defined as re ud ν where u is the fluid velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid barkley and henderson 1996 found the wake flow becomes unstable and three dimensional as re exceeds 188 5 1 0 and becomes fully turbulent when re 300 it was demonstrated that for an elastically mounted cylinder subject to vortex shedding the amplitude of cylinder vibration is dependent on the cylinder s mass natural frequency and damping ratio raghavan 2011 the synchronization between vortex shedding and cylinder vibration frequency is found to occur within a range of reduced velocities which is also referred to as lock in regime govardhan and williamson 2000 the reduced velocity is defined as u r u f n d where u is the incoming fluid velocity and f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder modir et al 2016 and cen et al 2016 conducted experiments of vortex induced vibration viv of a flexibly mounted cylinder at different mass ratios and found the lowest mass ratio produced the largest vibration amplitude mass ratio is the ratio of the cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass in many numerical studies of viv of a circular cylinder the damping is zero in order to achieve the maximum response amplitude silva et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in offshore engineering wave induced water motion is commonly modelled by oscillatory flow the interaction between circular cylinders and oscillatory flow is relevant to engineering applications such as offshore pipelines riser pipes mooring cables etc in addition to re the effects of oscillatory flow on vortex shedding is also dependent on the keulegan carpenter k c number the kc is defined as kc u m t d where u m and t are the amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow velocity respectively the relationship between the kc number and the amplitude of the fluid motion a is kc 2πa d the stokes number β is used to describe the ratio between re and kc i e β re kc d 2 νt increasing k c may also induce the flow transition from laminar to turbulent sarpkaya 1986 the generation of vortices in oscillatory flow occurs every half period of oscillatory movement provided that k c is greater than 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 as the k c is increased β 50 800 and kc 1 2 2 4 the flow changes from unstable to displaying three dimensional disturbances honji 1981 and the gap between adjacent honji vortices that are shed has also been shown to be approximately related to k c by g d 0 2 k c 7 4 an et al 2011 tatsuno and bearman 1990 experimentally investigated the flow around an oscillating cylinder at low k c numbers and identified eight different regimes these flow regimes are described below o regime a no vortex shedding occurs o regime a vortices start forming and two vortices are shed symmetrical per half cycle o regime b vortices are formed due to instability in the boundary layer flow 3d structure o regime c large vortices of opposite sign are formed for the number of oscillation cycles o regime d asymmetrical vortices with opposite rotations are formed due to the cylinders movement and the flow is convected implicitly to one side of the axis o regime e it is similar to regime d except the flow switches to the other side of the movement at irregular intervals and the flow is convected diagonally o regime f due to the cylinder moving a large clockwise vortex is formed on the upper side and a smaller counter clockwise vortex is formed on the lower side o regime g two vortices are formed one is attached to the cylinder and the other is shed from the cylinder numerical investigation into oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at low r e and k c was conducted by dutsch et al 1998 and the simulated flow patterns concurred with experimental data of tatsuno and bearman 1990 vortex shedding in the wake of an oscillating cylinder can be categorized based on the number and pattern of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one cylinder oscillating period williamson and roshko 1988 classified the case of two single vortices being shed from the cylinder as 2s mode a pair of vortices being shed as p mode and a pair and a single vortex being shed as p s mode if a cylinder is elastically mounted in an oscillatory flow and is only allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction the cylinder s vibration amplitude in oscillatory flow is reported to increase as reduced velocity increases until it reaches a maximum amplitude then increasing the reduced velocity will lower the amplitude fu et al 2018 the vibration frequency is dependant on the amount of vortices that are shed during a flow period zhao et al 2012 the majority of current literature has focused on flow induced vibration fiv in the cross flow direction with little attention towards fiv in oscillatory flows in the in line direction the vibration of a cylinder in the inline direction makes the relative velocity between the cylinder and the flow different from the flow velocity this variation in the relative velocity either more or less than the flow velocity impacts the cylinder s response and vortex shedding pattern in this paper the effects of the kc number and frequency ratio have on the cylinder are investigated including the vibration amplitude and fluid force the frequency ratio is defined as the ratio of the oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 numerical simulations are carried out at a constant reynolds number r e 150 for two keulegan carpenter numbers k c 5 and 10 for each kc three mass ratio values m 1 2 and 3 are investigated in the frequency ratio ranging from 1 to 2 for kc 10 and from 1 to 4 for kc 5 2 numerical method a cartesian coordinate system x y is defined in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is at the cylinder centre and the x direction is aligned to the streamwise direction the cylinder is elastically mounted with a spring and a damper however the mechanical damping coefficient is set to zero in this study in order to achieve the maximum possible amplitude the oscillatory flow velocity is a sinusoidal function of time 1 u t u m sin 2 π t t where u is oscillatory velocity of the fluid t is time u m and t are the amplitude and period of the fluid velocity respectively the reynolds number of the oscillatory flow is defined as re u m d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the fluid is assumed incompressible and can be governed by the two dimensional incompressible navier stokes ns equations the velocity the time and the pressure are non dimensionalized as u v u v u t t u m d and pressure p p ρ u m 2 where u and v are the fluid velocity components in the x and y directions respectively and p is the pressure the variables with and without wave dashes stand for dimensional and non dimensional values respectively as the boundaries of the vibrating cylinder moves continuously the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme is employed to allow the motion of the cylinder to be modelled using the numerical model by zhao et al 2013 in the ale scheme the mesh moves and the convection terms of the ns equations are modified to consider the motion of the mesh the non dimensional ns equations are 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u ˆ u x v v ˆ u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u u ˆ v x v v ˆ v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 in eq 2 u ˆ and v ˆ are the velocity of the mesh nodes in the x and y directions respectively the motion of the cylinder is represented by the non dimensional motion equation 5 d 2 x d t 2 4 π ζ u r d x d t 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c f x π m where c fx is the non dimensional force in the x direction defined as c fx f x ρ d u m 2 2 f x is the fluid force in the x direction the cylinder surface is smooth and thus a no slip boundary condition is applied i e the fluid velocity on the cylinder surface is the same as the vibrating velocity of the cylinder on the left and right boundaries non dimensional sinusoidal oscillatory flow velocity is given as u t sin ω t where ω 2π kc is the non dimensional angular frequency the pressure on the left and right boundaries are p ω cos ω t x on the top and bottom boundaries symmetric boundary condition is used i e the velocity component in the y direction the vertical gradient of the velocity in the x direction and the vertical gradient of the pressure are zero the ns equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 a square non dimensional computational domain with a side length of 110 is used and the cylinder is located at the centre of the domain anagnostopoulos and minear 2004 reported that if the blockage the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the computational domain width is less than 0 2 its effect on the fluid force is negligible for kc 6 to ensure the vortices generated from the cylinder are not affected by the boundary the blockage of 0 0091 is used in this study the selected mesh size is based on the mesh dependency study for oscillatory flow past cylinders at re 150 conducted by zhao and cheng 2014 the computational domain is divided into 37040 four node quadrilateral finite elements and fig 2 shows the mesh near the cylinder the cylinder surface is divided into 160 elements and the minimum mesh size on the cylinder surface in the radial direction is 0 0008 the computational time step is δ t 0 0025 for accuracy and stability the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition must be satisfied i e the courant number defined as c u m δ t δ l must be less than 1 where δ l is the element size the courant number for numerical investigations in this paper is c 0 125 based on the incoming velocity and the element size on the cylinder surface in the tangential direction to validate the results numerical analysis was conducted using an open source spectral hp element code nektar cantwell et al 2015 which has been used by the second and fourth authors of this paper for simulating steady flow past oscillatory cylinders tang et al 2017 the set of equations 2 4 was solved through the velocity correction scheme along with a continuous galerkin projection from the unsteady incompressible ns solver a second order implicit explicit time integration scheme was chosen the code employs high order quadrilateral expansions within each element through the gauss lobatto legendre quadrature points n p the mesh and n p used in the nektar simulations are similar to that adopted in tang et al 2017 the incoming oscillatory flow velocity is the same harmonic function of time as given in equation 1 to avoid mesh deformation the cylinder oscillation is achieved through a moving frame fixed on the cylinder by introducing a forcing term in the momentum equations which is the additional acceleration as the result of the non inertial translation of the reference frame as detailed by newman and karniadakis 1997 fig 3 shows the comparison between the amplitudes of the cylinder vibration x m calculated by the present model and the ones calculated by nektar for r e 150 k c 5 and m 2 the vibration amplitude x m is defined as the maximum x within one period of vibration in the following discussion the non dimensional frequency of the oscillatory flow which is also referred to as frequency ratio is defined as f f w f n where f w is the oscillatory flow frequency and f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the relationship between the non dimensional oscillatory flow frequency and the reduced velocity is u r kc f excellent agreement between the two sets of results is observed in fig 3 the maximum difference between the two results is within 2 except at f 0 4 and 0 6 where x m changes with f rapidly to ensure the selected mesh is sufficiently dense for obtaining converged numerical results a mesh dependency study is conducted for two cases with different mesh densities as listed in table 1 here f 0 6 is the case with the highest relative velocity between the cylinder and fluid flow and f 4 is the largest frequency ratio studied in this work the number of nodes on the cylinder surface is represented by n s and the size of the first layer elements in the radial direction is represented by δr 1 mesh 1 is the mesh used for all calculations in this paper meshes 2 and 4 have double and half the mesh density along the surface of the cylinder respectively mesh 3 doubles the computational domain size the amplitude of the cylinder displacement xm and the standard deviation sd of the inline force cfx sd calculated from different meshes are compared with each other δx m and δc fx sd are the differences between the results of mesh 1 and other meshes in x m and c fx sd respectively the maximum difference 1 27 of the force occurs when f 4 and δt 0 00125 this investigation focuses on the vibration of a cylinder in the x direction only in an oscillatory flow two dimensional simulations at a low reynolds number of 150 is conducted to enable the vibration of the cylinder in a wide parametric space simulations are conducted for two k c values 5 and 10 and three m values 1 2 and 3 the reduced velocities are in the range between 1 and 20 corresponding to f ranging from 1 to 4 for kc 5 and 1 to 2 for kc 10 the flow in some cases are weakly three dimensional one three dimensional simulation with the largest relative velocity between the fluid and the cylinder was conducted the vibration displacement and the non dimensional inline force are found very close to the two dimensional numerical results the detailed comparison is shown in the appendix 3 result and discussion 3 1 the effect of the initial condition it is found that the flow develops to its equilibrium stage extremely slowly in some simulations to avoid treating not fully developed flow as the final result cases for kc 10 and m 1 are used as examples to discuss the effect of the initial condition simulations are firstly conducted for 100 oscillating periods with an initial condition where velocity and pressure are zero in the whole computational domain this initial condition is referred to as initial condition 1 ic1 fig 4 a shows an example of time histories of the lift force for all the reduced velocities for ic1 where t t t is defined as the period number the flow is initially symmetric resulting in a zero lift coefficient for all the cases the lift coefficient become nonzero after t 20 for many cases however the lift force is found still extremely small for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 at t 100 indicating that the vortex flow is still in the symmetric condition simulations for these cases were continued until t 300 the lift force become nonzero for f 0 55 but it is still very small for the rest of the cases the flow remains symmetric at t 300 for f 0 45 and 0 5 fig 5 a and b use contours of non dimensional vorticity and streaklines to present the flow patterns of the symmetric flow under ic1 streaklines are generated by releasing massless particles at 80 points that are evenly distributed on a circle with 0 02d outside the cylinder surface and 32 particles are released within one period with a time interval of t 32 at each point two vortices are shed from both the top and bottom sides of the cylinder simultaneously in each half period forming a horizontal vortex street on each side of the cylinder the lift coefficient for f 0 45 and 0 5 are not exactly zero because the flows in fig 5 a and b are not exactly symmetric although the flow is slightly asymmetric the disturbance is not sufficiently strong to make vortex shedding switch to regime f until t 300 to speed up the transition of the flow to its equilibrium state simulations for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 are repeated with a new initial condition which is the fully developed flow field at its nearest reduced velocity with the asymmetric vortex flow for example when f 0 3 is simulated the fully developed asymmetric flow field for f 0 35 is used as the initial condition this initial condition is referred to as initial condition 2 ic2 it can be seen in fig 4 b that for an asymmetric flow condition being used as the initial condition the lift force remains nonzero the vortex shedding flow for ic2 in fig 5 c and d are typical asymmetric regime f flow structure with 2 pairs of vortices being shed from the cylinder in one period the vortex flows for f 0 3 0 45 0 5 and 0 55 are believed to be intrinsically asymmetric because once the flow become asymmetric it never changes back to be symmetric all the simulations are checked and if the flow is found to be symmetric simulation was repeated with an asymmetric flow condition as initial condition fig 6 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude with the frequency ratio the initial results of kc 10 using ic1 is calculated using 10 periods of data from t 90 to 100 it can be seen that the not fully developed symmetric flow causes an increase in the vibration amplitude and it should not be used as the final result in all the simulations the resultant flow field are checked carefully to ensure fully developed flow is achieved it should be noted that the lift coefficient for f 0 9 is intrinsically small regardless of what initial condition is used or how long the simulation is conducted because the flow is in symmetric regime a which will be discussed in detail later on 3 2 vibration amplitude and effective kc number fig 7 a and b show the variation of the vibration amplitude with the frequency ratio for kc 5 and 10 respectively in each case x m follows the same trend i e the amplitude increases as f is increased from 0 1 until the amplitude reaches a peak and then it starts to decrease it is seen that the frequency ratio at which the maximum vibration amplitude occurs is less than 1 and the frequency ratio approaches 1 with the increase of m although the trends are very similar the smaller the m the higher the cylinders amplitude as f increases to its maximum investigated value the effect of m on the maximum vibration amplitude is similar to that of the vibration of cylinder in the transverse direction of a steady flow modir et al 2016 the results show that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder is greater than the amplitude of oscillatory water particles a d in fig 7 in a range of frequency ratios which narrows down as the mass ratio increases for m 1 x m approaches a d as f approaches infinity because a cylinder with the same density as fluid density drifts together with the flow as if the spring stiffness is zero the vibration amplitude of the cylinder for f decreases with the increase of the mass ratio the motion of the cylinder in the fluid makes the relative velocity between the cylinder and the fluid very different from the incoming fluid velocity the fluid force and the vortex flow pattern are affected significantly by the relative velocity v r between the fluid and cylinder which is calculated by v r u m sin 2 π t t d x d t and the amplitude of v r is defined as v rm the amplitude of the relative velocity v rm is found to be affected by the frequency ratio significantly as shown in fig 8 zero relative velocity which means the cylinder and flow are travelling at the same speed occurs when the mass ratio is 1 and f is infinity since the period of the oscillatory flow does not change the effective kc is defined based on the relative velocity v rm as k c eff v r m t d the reynolds number also changes and an effective reynolds number is defined as reeff v rm d ν fig 8 shows the variation of the relative velocity v rm and the effective kc eff with the frequency ratio the relative velocity is higher than 1 in a range of frequency ratios after v rm reaches its maximum value it monotonically decreases with the increase of f and approaches to zero as f is infinite and m 1 for m 2 and 3 after it peaks v rm reaches its minimum value which is nearly zero at a f greater than 1 then recovers and approaches to a non zero value as f approaches infinity it can be seen v rm reaches its minimum value at f 1 2 and 1 5 for m 3 and 2 respectively for m 1 v rm still decreases with the increase of f at the largest simulated f 4 by comparing fig 8 with fig 7 it is observed that the f where v rm reaches its minimum value coincides with f where x m a d proving that the fluid and cylinder oscillate with same velocity and amplitude the relative velocity v rm is always greater than 1 before it peaks to understand the frequency components of the vibration the vibration velocity of the cylinder is decomposed into harmonics as v x k 1 v s xk in k ω t ε k where v xk and ε k are the amplitude and phase of the k th harmonic respectively fig 9 shows the results of harmonic decomposition of the cylinder s velocity for m 1 the harmonic decomposition results for m 2 and 3 share the same characteristics as those for m 1 the 2nd and higher harmonics are insignificant compared to the 1st harmonic except for kc 10 and f 0 25 where the third and first harmonics are nearly the same to show the smaller higher order harmonics clearly diagrams with smaller scales of vertical axis are given in fig 9 in addition to the 1st harmonic it is found that the 3rd harmonic is the secondary component of the cylinder velocity the 3rd harmonic is the secondary component instead of the 2nd harmonic because the vortex shedding is in regime f with two pair of vortices being shed from the cylinder in one period correspondingly a 2p vortex shedding pattern results in a lift coefficient with a frequency three times the oscillatory flow frequency and furthermore a significant 3rd harmonics of the displacement as kc 5 the higher harmonics are consistently smaller than the 1st order while at kc 10 the third harmonic of the cylinder velocity is nearly the same as the 1st until f 0 25 beyond which the third harmonic reduces with the increase of f and almost diminish as f is about 1 since the velocity of the cylinder is nearly monochromatic with a dominant frequency the same as the oscillatory flow frequency the relative velocity of the cylinder v r is dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency this makes the vortex shedding patterns comparable with those for oscillation flow past a stationary cylinder the variation of kc eff with frequency ratio gives rise to the change in the vortex shedding pattern even for a constant reynolds number and a constant kc the kc eff for all the calculated cases are mapped on the regime map on the β kc eff plane in fig 10 the stokes numbers β d 2 νt for kc 5 and 10 are 30 and 15 respectively regardless of kc eff it can be seen that all the cases with kc 5 are distributed in regimes a a d and f on the map while those for kc 10 are distributed in regimes a a d and f in addition to all the regimes reported by tatsuno and bearman 1990 regime s marked in fig 10 is the symmetric flow regime that only occurs under ic1 and it does not transition to regime f within t 100 and t 300 for some cases regime s in the range of 13 2 k c eff 16 63 can only be seen when the configuration is ideally symmetric and there is no disturbance on the flow which may not exist in reality regime s also occurs in the case of oscillatory flow past a fixed cylinder a fixed cylinder with input parameters of k c 14 08 β 15 and r e 211 was simulated and the symmetrical pattern was present at the period number t 800 once the flow becomes asymmetric under ic2 the response amplitude and the velocity is reduced see fig 6 therefore kc eff is reduced to a value in regime f 3 3 vortex flow regimes the flow patterns around a vibrating cylinder in oscillatory flow changes with the change of kc eff figs 11 and 12 show some typical flow patterns for kc 5 and 10 respectively in each figure although the kc number is constant the flows are in different patterns depending on kc eff in fig 11 a vortices are not generated because kc eff is extremely small vortices are generated if the kc number exceed 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 the flows in figs 11 b and fig 12 a are typical regime a patterns where two vortices are generated in every half period these two vortices are not shed from the cylinder until the flow changes its direction fig 11 c is a typical regime d flow where one vortex is shed from only the bottom side of the cylinder in every half period and the two branches of vortex streets are in a v shape figs 11 d and fig 12 c are typical regime f flows where a pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder every half period forming a 2p vortex shedding pattern 3 4 correlation between force and vibration fig 13 shows the fft spectra of the vibration velocity and the inline force for some cases where the higher harmonics are significant in the small f range where f is the non dimensional frequency normalized by the frequency of the oscillatory flow the vibration velocity only has frequencies that are multiple of the frequency of the flow indicating the periodicity of the vibration from the fft spectra one can see that the dominant frequency of the vibration velocity is f 7 as f 0 1 and it reduces consecutively to f 5 3 and 1 as the frequency ratio increases to 0 15 0 3 and 0 4 respectively high vibration frequency was also reported when studying vibration of a cylinder in the crossflow direction in oscillatory flow kozakiewicz et al 1997 sumer and fredsoe 1988 the first harmonic of the vibration velocity is the same as the frequency of the oscillatory flow the dominance of 5th and 7th harmonic of the vibration velocity as the frequency ratio approaches zero is due to the modulation between different frequency components if one or multiple circulars are placed in oscillatory flow the dominant frequency of the inline force is equal to the frequency of the oscillating flow and its mean value is practically zero anagnostopoulos and dikarou 2011 the presence of the higher harmonics in the force is the result of the amplitude and frequency modulation shen et al 2017 the variation trends of x m and v rm with the frequency ratio are different from each other see figs 7 and 8 indicating that there is a phase difference between the fluid motion and the motion of the cylinder from fig 9 it can be seen that the vibration is dominated by the first harmonic except at very small frequency ratios where the vibration amplitude is very small the phase difference between the first harmonic of the cylinder s velocity and the oscillatory flow velocity is shown in fig 14 which are essentially the phase of the cylinder s velocity since the phase of the flow velocity is zero see eq 1 if two velocities v a and v b have the same frequency and defined as v a t a sin ω t ε a and v b t b sin ω t ε b respectively the amplitude of the relative velocity between them is a 2 b 2 a b cos ε a ε b 1 2 the amplitude of the relative velocity will be increased and is greater than a 2 b 2 1 2 if the phase between the two velocities is between 90 and 180 by comparing fig 14 with fig 8 it can be seen that the reason why the amplitude of the relative velocity v rm is greater than the amplitude of the fluid velocity is that the phase angle between the velocities of the fluid and the cylinder is between 90 and 180 with the increase of the frequency ratio f the phase difference ε in fig 14 becomes smaller than 90 and finally approaches zero correspondingly v rm in fig 8 reduces the phase difference ε varies weakly with f and is close to zero after f exceeds 1 the nearly in phase regime between the velocities of the cylinder and the fluid causes significant reduction in the relative velocity and effective kc number as shown in fig 8 fig 15 show the phase difference between the first harmonic of the inline force and the first harmonic of the vibration velocity since the structural damping is zero no net energy is transferred from the fluid to the cylinder and the phase between the inline force and the vibration velocity is either 90 or 90 the change of the phase from 90 to 90 occurs at f 1 fig 16 shows the variation of the standard deviation of the non dimensional inline force with the frequency ratio it is interesting to see that the force is zero when f 1 regardless of the mass ratio or the kc number because the damping ratio is zero the cylinder vibrates freely without any external force as f 1 in addition the vibration velocity and the vibration amplitude for all the mass ratios are the same as f 1 figs 7 and 8 at f 1 the vibration amplitudes for kc 5 and 10 are 1 298 and 2 364 respectively regardless of the mass ratio theoretically it is easy to understand that the force must be zero to ensure that the vibration has a finite vibration amplitude when the external force frequency and the natural frequency are the same any external force would cause infinite amplitude at synchronization without damping 4 conclusions flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow in the streamwise direction is investigated numerically two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for re 150 ζ 0 kc 5 and 10 m 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratios the main conclusions are summarized as follows it is found that the amplitude of the relative velocity of the moving cylinder to the fluid motion is greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity when the frequency ratio is smaller than some certain value the increased relative velocity results in a significant increase in the effective kc number kc eff on the other hand the kc eff reduces significantly as the frequency ratio is greater than 1 because kc eff changes with the frequency ratio for a constant kc number different flow regimes can be found the reason of the increase of kc eff is that the phase difference between the cylinder s velocity and the fluid velocity is between 90 and 180 causing the cylinder to move in the opposite direction of the flow most of the time within one period as the frequency ratio approaches infinity the phase between the cylinder motion and fluid motion becomes very small resulting in a very small relative velocity when the frequency ratio f 1 the drag force on the cylinder is zero and the cylinder vibrates freely without any external force or damping and interestingly the vibration amplitudes and the relative velocities for different mass ratios are the same the flow for some regime f cases remains symmetric until a few hundred periods of the flow provided the initial condition of the numerical simulation is that both the velocity and pressure in the whole domain are zero this symmetric flow pattern referred as regime s is unstable because it does not occur if an initial condition with an asymmetric flow is employed credit authorship contribution statement erfan taheri conceptualization investigation writing original draft

validation for simulating oscillatory flow past cylinders was proved by an et al 2015 fig 17 a and b shows the comparison between the 2d and 3d results of the vibration displacement and non dimensional inline force respectively the comparison shows very good agreement on the displacement amplitude and inline force of the cylinder the iso surface of ω 1 in fig 17 c show a three dimensional flow pattern where ω represents the vorticity in the spanwise direction of the cylinder however the vortex flow pattern on the two dimensional xy plane at the centre of the cylinder is in regime f which is similar to the regime f in figs 10 and 11 the difference is that the vortices dissipate faster and some small scale vortices exist in fig 17 d fig 17 2d and 3d comparison of the

21762,one of the main causes of the formation of internal waves is the ocean currents from the seabed s mounds for this reason numerous empirical studies have been carried out in laboratories on the flow of streams on artificial mounds or the passage of objects in a stratified medium the purpose of this study is to identify the changes in the density of the layers by internal waves due to the movement of the physical model in a stratified water with different froude numbers this study is done in a large stratified tank that density changes due to movement of spherical and airfoil bodies are recorded by an array of fast response sensors lee waves and the blocking area are well illustrated before and after waves created by passing objects are transmitted through the tank and are visualized using optical shadowgraph technique the results showed that the mean amplitude of waves increases with increasing froude numbers the average wave s periods before the object reaches the lowering point of 0 4d u d being the thickness of the moving object and u is its speed and then increases and the mean period after the arrival of the object decreases with the froude number keywords internal waves lee waves laboratory models non dimensional numbers 1 introduction the study of internal waves has attracted many researchers from the past due to their importance in marine environments there are many reasons for the occurrence of internal waves one of them is ocean currents especially tidal currents passing over the seabed s mounds which occurs frequently in marine environments meunier et al 2018 to investigate this phenomenon the laboratory studies are very popular in these studies flow over the artificial mounds aguilar et al 2006 baines and hoinka 1985 maxworthy 1979 miles 1971 zhang et al 2008 or passing objects in a stratified laboratory tank are used motions of the objects in a stratified fluids are also considered by numerical simulations bourgault and richards 2007 dimitrieva and chashechkin 2018 min and koo 2017 vasholz 2002 and experimental simulations hopfinger et al 1991 ko and cho 2017 meunier 2012 wang et al 2017 which can be used for the real environment analyses of internal waves effects of moving objects in a stratified environment depend on the buoyancy frequency n object s dimensions d and object s velocity u causing changes in the density field of the fluid in order to take into account the parameters mentioned together and the ability to generalize its results to marine environments it is usually customary to use the non dimensional numbers such as froude fr u nd and reynolds re ud υ υ is the fluid viscosity whose values indicate the type of disruption experienced in density field of the fluid with stratification in general the changes in density caused by object s movement in a stratified environment can be divided into three general categories 1 the changes caused by the motion of the object itself behind it which creates waves named lee waves and propagate in the environment usually with the same speed of the object voisin 2007 2 waves caused by pressure changes due to disturbances created behind the body brandt and rottier 2015 3 in addition to the waves mentioned changes occur in the front of the body which is referred to as the blocking phenomenon that can be considered as a wave with zero frequency and the length of the blocking area x b and can be calculated from eq 1 houcine et al 2012 1 x b d r i re 1 4 0 15 where ri is the inverse of the froude number it means that this phenomenon can be appear before the object arrive the purpose of this study is an experimental simulation of internal waves in a large stratified tank flow caused be moving objects and measurements of density field changes in the tank consisting of thin iso pycnal layers 2 methodology a tank with large dimensions of 7 length 1 width 1 deep meters with 17 mm thickness walls of crystal glass is used for this study fig 1 a traverse with movements in three directions with speeds of 1 up to 15 cm s along the tank which can be controlled by a computer is also used an airfoil body with dimensions 40 20 6 cm and two spherical body with diameters of 14 and 8 cm are used in this study to create linear stratification with double bucket method deldar et al 2018 two plastic containers with capacity of 750 l are used fig 2 the two plastic containers are connected with a 1 inch diameter hose and a valve another hose with the same diameter from the first container was guided into the glass tank and a thick sponge is mounted at its end to suppress turbulence with this method a linear stratification generated in the glass tank with salt concentration increasing with depth and the vertical profile of the fluid is measured by a salinity gauge once prior to the start of the experiment and once after each experiment buoyancy frequency n calculated from eq 2 2 n g ρ 0 ρ z 1 2 where g is gravity acceleration ρ 0 is background density ρ is density variation that calculate from salinity and temperature measurements and z is height of water column a typical salinity profile that is measured in the laboratory tank is shown in fig 3 wavelength of the internal waves and their other characteristics are measured by fast response salinity meter bidokhti 2000 and schlieren method dalziel et al 2000 in the salinity monitoring method a thin insolated stainless steel tube with a diameter of 3 mm with a length of 1 m is used as the fast response salinity probe in this method an array of four sensors with frequency response above 100 hz in different locations according to fig 4 is used to measured salinity variations with time as the waves pass the array of sensors is connected to a four channel digital scoop and their data was stored before starting the measurement each of the four sensors is moved slowly from bottom up to surface to calibrate the salinity sensors according to the tank stratification and that how much the output variation there is due to the density change from top to bottom of the tank according to wave property amplitude measurements by the repeat of the experiment the accuracy of this method for internal waves amplitude is about 1 mm which is comparable with other reported studies voisin 2007 indicating acceptable accuracy also an optical alignment system is used to observe the stratification s changes that are made in the channel consisting of a light source spaced well apart from the tank and a flat mirror that reflects the parallel beam of light towards the test section of the tank also using a tracer paper which is meshed with 5 5 cm squares and is attached on the other side of the channel glass wall to observe and record the images of the flow field the fluid stratification changes are captured using a ccd camera behind the channel after the setup of the stratification in the channel and setting up the alignments described above airfoil and spherical shaped bodies are moved through the fluid according to fig 5 when the traverse is in the beginning of the tank we assumed t 0 and x 0 and sensors array has been attached in x 3 m by these assumptions summary of these experiments are shown in table 1 and the results are recorded according to the techniques described above 3 results and discussions measurements of the fast response sensors since start of the motion of the body show wavy variations of salinity density for all near critical froude numbers as shown in fig 6 where here the amplitudes of the waves which have been made dimensionless with thickness of the body d and the time t and buoyancy frequency n the black middle line in fig 6 shows the location of the object arriving close to the sensors and clearly identifies the changes recorded before and after the passage of the object therefore the results are divided in to two parts and each part is described separately 3 1 variation before the body arrival according to fig 6 the first small wave begins to arrive leading to density oscillations then the oscillations are cut off and the flow field appears almost non oscillatory as the other studies bidokhti and bidokhti 2016 the wave s propagation velocity in the first region is equal to the velocity of the body the variation in amplitude and periods of waves in the first region for various froude numbers are given in figs 7 and 8 respectively it can be said that this region is related to the progressive internal waves associated with the movement of the body that is known as the lee waves in the measurements taken before the model arrived close to the sensors the lee waves which are far away from the airfoil s horizontal axis are recorded the characteristic feature of these waves which are obtained in previous studies wavelengths increase and wave amplitude decrease with increasing froude number meunier et al 2018 in figs 7 and 8 this trend is almost evident after the first changes that are related to the lee waves the unchanged area is recorded as shown in fig 6 this area is exactly in agreement with the blocking region calculated from equation 1 as shown in fig 9 the changes due to the blocking phenomenon are horizontally and since the stratification in the laboratory tank is vertically density changes in the sensors due to the blocking phenomenon have not been recorded and the region is detectable by data from before and after the changes due to the passing of the objects also fig 7 shows period of the recorded internal waves decreases where froude number is 0 5 and then it is increased if we draw the blocking range chart in terms of froude number and plot it in fig 7 we find that the reduction of the period of the internal waves have a direct relationship with increasing the length of the blocking area and vice versa figure 10 the highest internal wave s amplitude is found to be in the range of 0 4 0 7 d which have been reported in other studies have also brandt and rottier 2015 and robey 1997 this phenomenon is due to the fact that blocking area reaches its maximum where froude number is 0 5 and the effect of internal waves in this area is minimal in other words it can be stated that the blocking area prevents the propagation of internal waves and lee waves which is already mentioned in the other studies chomaz et al 1993 3 2 after body arrival after the blocking area the first peak of recorded internal waves is always higher than the others and this is also observed in other studies bidokhti and bidokhti 2016 bourgault and richards 2007 the next peaks are related to the internal waves due to the body itself the wake and turbulences which is very hard to analyze and separate these waves from turbulence signals of the wake of the body wang et al 2017 and the flow field is shown in fig 11 recorded by the camera for the waves formed after the arrival of the object as shown in fig 12 it can be said that the mean period of these waves is decreasing with the froude number but as shown in fig 13 it can be said that the mean amplitude of the waves is increased up to 0 6d with the froude number irregularly and then increases with increasing froude number fig 11 shows the variations in the mean period of the waves generated after the object passes the monitoring points for different froude numbers in figs 8 and 13 the froude numbers of waves peaks amplitudes measured in each of the four sensors for the after arrival model is 0 4d which is slightly different from 0 7 to 1 4d in the other papers wang et al 2017 4 conclusion in this paper an experimental study of the formation of internal waves caused by the passage of various forms of airfoil and spheres in a stratified water are addressed these models with various dimensions are moved at different speeds for froude numbers of 0 17 1 5 in a large laboratory tank variation of the density changes due to the passing of the model is recorded by an array of fast response salinity sensors in different locations the analysis of the period and the mean recorded amplitude showed that the model passing generated flow fields can be divided into two regions before and after the arrival of the model close to the sensors in the first area the measurements include the effects of the lee waves that were recorded earlier than all waves after which the effect of the blocking area was apparent because of the horizontal distribution of the blocking area its effect is visibly compared to before and after the transition in the second region disturbances caused in density field changes appear more intense due to both the wake and its internal waves due to the body movement itself the increasing trend of the amplitude of the recorded waves relative to the froude number before and after the model arrival close to the sensors are consistent with the results other studies in this regard credit authorship contribution

21763,this paper presents a resource aware state and uncertainty estimation method for dynamic positioning vessels subject to uncertain kinetics and unknown sea loads induced by wind waves and currents specifically an event triggered extended state observer eso is proposed such that unnecessary communications are avoided and sensor to observer communication cost are drastically reduced a realizable event triggering condition is established depending on the position heading measurements only it is proven that the observation errors are input to state stable iss and zeno behavior will

vessels simulation results show that the communication times are largely decreased compared with the time triggered esos keywords event triggered extended state observer dynamic positioning marine vessels uncertainty estimation state estimation 1 introduction a dynamic positioning system is defined as a control system which is able to keep the position and heading of marine vessels within predefined limits dynamic positioning systems have received significant attention due to its wide applications in offshore industries such as resource exploitation marine drilling underwater pipe laying etc sφrensen 2011 dynamic positioning vessels are subject to uncertain model uncertainties and unknown sea loads model uncertainties inherently exist in vessels due to unavailable model parameters unknown hydrodynamic coefficients and unmodeled dynamics in addition time varying sea loads are induced by wind waves and ocean currents in practical marine environment these uncertainties and disturbances may affect or even destroy the control performance of dynamic positioning vessels shi et al 2017a disturbance compensation is a fundamental issue in the control of dynamic positioning vessels and makes a great effect on the control performance plenty of methods have been developed in the literature to compensate for the uncertainties or disturbances and thus the control performance of dynamic positioning vessels can be improved the parametric adaptive method is one of the most common approaches where the uncertainties are expressed linearly in terms of unknown parameters chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2005 do and pan 2006 yin and xiao 2016 in skjetne et al 2005 an adaptive method is proposed to estimate the uncertain constant parameters for a maneuvering system of a model ship in do and pan 2006 a projection based adaptive control design is developed to deal with the unknown parameters and bounded disturbances for underactuated ships the robust control method is also widely used in marine vehicles control systems and the uncertainties are usually assumed to be bounded lekkas and fossen 2014 xiang et al 2017 in lekkas and fossen 2014 an adaptive sliding mode control method is used to handle parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics in xiang et al 2017 an adaptive sliding control design is developed to handle the unknown bounded uncertainties without a priori information of the bounds in recent years neural networks and fuzzy logic systems are used to identify the unknown functions in marine vehicle models yang et al 2003 chen and tan 2013 dai et

system in dai et al 2018b radial basis function neural networks are used to identify the unknown dynamics of a surface ship disturbance observer is also a useful tool to estimate external disturbances and has been applied to marine vehicle systems do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d in cui et al 2016 a disturbance observer is proposed for autonomous marine vessels provided that the disturbance is constant and bounded in chen et al 2016 a disturbance observer is developed to estimate unmodeled environmental disturbances due to wind waves and currents in aforementioned studies

2019 b do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d the uncertainties and disturbances are estimated based on velocity information while the velocity may not be directly measured in dynamic positioning vessels due to technical reasons or saving of cost shi et al 2017a disturbance or state estimation based on position yaw information is presented in tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2013 peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 in tee and ge 2006 a high gain observer is proposed for surface vessels based on position yaw information and the unknown velocities are recovered in chen et al 2013 a high gain observer is applied in a position mooring control system to estimate unmeasured velocities in the surge sway and yaw directions while the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances can not be identified in peng et al 2016 a neural network based observers is proposed for the cooperative dynamic positioning of marine vessels where a predictor module is developed for estimating the unmeasured velocities as well as unknown ocean disturbances in peng et al 2017b an echo state network based observer using recorded input output data is developed such that the unknown vessel dynamics and unmeasured velocity information are identified in peng et al 2015 a neural network based observer is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown velocities and iterative updating laws are designed using prediction errors note that for the observers designed in peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 the persistence of exciting is required to achieve the parameter convergence eso technique is applied to estimate the unknown velocity and disturbance for marine vehicles in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 where the condition of persistence of exciting is eliminated in cui et al 2017 a multiple input and multiple output eso is designed not only to estimate the unknown velocities but also to estimate unknown external disturbances in peng and wang 2018 an eso is developed for surface vehicles such that the unknown velocities internal model uncertainty and external disturbances are simultaneously compensated however the existing esos designed for marine vessels presented in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 rely on continuous sampling this means that the signals have to be transmitted during each execution cycle which will consume many network resources and calculation resources as for dynamic positioning vessels their working mode is position stabilization in most cases and the position and yaw angle are unchanging as a result it is highly desirable to develop a resource ware eso to evaluate and transmit signal to remove unnecessary samplings or communications motivated by the above discussions we consider the state and uncertainty estimation problem for dynamic positioning vessels with unmeasured velocities and limited resources the kinetic model of dynamic positioning vessels suffers from kinds of uncertainties including parametric uncertainties unmodelled dynamics and unknown sea loads in addition only the position heading information is measured by the equipments of global positioning system and magnetometer at first an event triggered extended state observer eso is proposed where the sensor to observer communication cost is reduced drastically an event triggering transmission is designed based on the position heading information only it is proven that the error dynamics is input to state stable iss and zeno phenomenon is excluded then to achieve the finite time convergence an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed by using a homogeneous lyapunov function the error dynamics is shown to be finite time iss simulation results illustrate that the communication cost can be substantially reduced using the event triggered esos compared to the time triggered esos the proposed event triggered esos can be applied to many marine vehicle systems including surface vehicles zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2016b underwater vehicles xiang et al 2015 shen et al 2019 yan et al 2019 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2020 and cooperative marine vehicle systems cui et al 2010 li et al 2018 shi et al 2017b liu et al 2019b the merits of the presented event triggered esos for dynamic positioning vessels are as follows 1 in the disturbance observers presented in do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d the esos proposed in gu et al 2019b peng et al 2019c and neural fuzzy uncertainty estimation methods in yang et al 2003 chen and tan 2013 dai et al 2016 2018a 2018b qin et al 2019 b liu et al 2017 2018 peng et al 2013 2017a 2019a 2019b the disturbance and uncertainty estimation rely on the velocity measurements by using the proposed event triggered esos the internal uncertainties and external disturbances can be estimated based on the position yaw information 2 in contrast to the high gain observers developed in tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2013 where only the unmeasured velocities can be recovered the unknown disturbances can be estimated in addition to the unmeasured velocities in contrast to the neural network based state observers presented in peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 where the uncertainties and velocity states can be estimated under the persistent of exciting the proposed event triggered esos guarantee estimation convergence without the persistence of exciting 3 in contrast to the esos proposed in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 where the position yaw measurements are transmitted in real time intermittent communication is allowed herein thanks to the proposed event triggered esos besides the proposed event triggered finite time convergent eso is able to achieve finite time convergence with reduced communication cost this paper is organized as follows some notations and mathematical model of dynamic positioning vessels is introduced in section 2 in section 3 an event triggered eso and an event triggered finite time convergent eso are developed and analyzed simulation results are given in section 4 to demonstrate the validity of the proposed esos section 5 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries and problem formulation in this section some notations are briefly introduced then the mathematical model of dynamic positioning vessels is introduced along with the problem formulation 2 1 notations r n represents the n dimensional euclidean space λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix and λ min is the minimum eigenvalue of a matrix is the euclidean norm f c p means f has a continuous pth derivative 2 2 problem formulation an inertial frame and a body fixed frame are used to describe the motion control of dynamic positioning vessels as shown in fig 1 neglecting the dynamics in heave pitch and roll the mathematical model of a dynamic positioning vessels can be expressed as fossen 2011 1 η t r ψ ν t m ν t c ν t ν t d ν t ν t g ν t η t τ w t τ t where r ψ t cos ψ t sin ψ t 0 sin ψ t cos ψ t 0 0 0 1 and η x y ψ t r 3 consists of position x y t and yaw angle ψ ν u v r t r 3 consists of surge velocity u sway velocity v and yaw rate r m m t r 3 3 is the inertial matrix r ψ r 3 3 is the rotate matrix c ν c ν r 3 3

the unknown sea loads induced by wind wave and ocean currents τ τ u τ v τ r t r 3 is the control input vector to facilitate design and analysis the internal model uncertainties and external disturbances are regarded as a total uncertainty vector σ t σ u t σ v t σ r t r 3 and is defined as follows σ t m 1 c ν t ν t d ν t ν t 2 g ν t η t τ w t then the vessle dynamics 1 becomes 3 η t r ψ t ν t ν t σ t m 1 τ t the position is measured by a global positioning system and the yaw angle is measured by a magnetometer while the velocity information ν t is not available here and need to be recovered from the position and yaw measurements the vector σ t including internal and external uncertainties is totally unknown we aim to estimate the uncertain vector σ t using the measurable information η t only note that the dynamic position vessels are implemented digitally using microprocessors with limited communication bandwidth computing resources while the common time triggered observers require to obtain the state signals periodically along a constant sampling rate and it would lead to wasteful use of communication and computation resources therefore it is of practical necessary to design esos for dynamic position vessels considering the resource limitations to summarize we aim to develop observers for dynamic position vessels 3 such that the following two objectives can be achieved 1 both the unmeasured velocities ν t and the total uncertainties σ t are recovered utilizing the measured position heading vector η t only 2 the sensor to observer communication times should be remarkably reduced while retaining an acceptable observation performance 3 design and analysis to solve the problem stated in the previous section two event triggered esos are developed and analyzed in this section firstly an event triggered nonlinear eso is designed and the estimation errors are proven to be iss then in order to reduce the convergence time an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed and the estimation errors are proven to be finite time iss two event triggering mechanisms are designed for the two event triggered esos respectively such that satisfactory observation performance can be achieved while using fewer communication resources the following standard assumptions are needed assumption 1 guo and zhao 2011 zhao and guo 2015 the unknown vector σ satisfies σ σ with σ being a positive constant assumption 2 the velocity of the dynamic positioning vessels are bounded such that ν ν with ν being a positive constant

heading measurements given by 6 ξ t η t k if d t 0 η t otherwise here t k is the previous event triggering time instant and d t is an event triggered mechanism designed as 7 d t 0 if q t m 1 otherwise with m 0 being a design threshold and 8 q t η t k η t ε 2 the diagram of the proposed event triggered eso is given in fig 2 at each sampling instant the event triggering condition is monitored to determine whether or not to transmit the latest position and yaw angle to the eso since the measurements are transmitted only at the event triggering instants the sensor to observer communication is remarkably reduced the proposed event triggered esos can provide accurate disturbance information for anti disturbance control methods such as active disturbance rejection control letting 9 η t η ˆ t

design next we will show the nonexistence of zeno phenomenon in the proposed event triggered eso proposition 1 consider the dynamic positioning vessel 1 the eso 5 and the triggering condition of 7 if assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied there exist ε 0 and ι 0 such that for any k 0 11 min t k 1 t k ι proof from definition of q in 8 the event triggering mechanism is equivalent to 12 d t η t k if η t k η t ε 2 m η t otherwise for the sample error η t k η t when t t k t k 1 we have 13 η t k η t t k t η ι d ι t k t r ψ ι ν ι d ι using assumption 2 it can be obtained that 14 η t k η t t t k ν thus there exists ι ε 2 m ν such that η t k η t ε 2 m holds for t t k ι this completes the proof proposition 1 shows that proposed event triggered eso is free from zeno behavior next the stability of the proposed event triggered eso is investigated to facilitate the stability analysis define z t z 1 t t z 2 t t z 3 t t t r 9 and then the error dynamics 10 can be expressed in a matrix equation as 15 z

the eso once the event happens the newest position and yaw measurements are fed to the eso via the sensor observer network 3 2 event triggered finite time convergent eso in the previous subsection an event triggered eso is developed and the observation error dynamics is proven to be iss while the transient estimation performance is not considered and the convergent time is unknown in this subsection an event triggered finite time convergent eso is designed such that satisfactory observation performance can be achieved in finite time at the same time sensor to observer communication frequency can be reduced an event triggered finite time convergent eso is designed as follows 28 η ˆ t 3 ε r ψ t r t ψ t η ˆ t ξ t ε 2 α r ψ t ν ˆ t ν ˆ t 3 r t ψ t η ˆ t ξ t ε 2 2 α 1 σ ˆ t m 1 τ t σ

concluded that system 36 is globally asymptotically stable define a proper function v 2 α e and a compact set s e r 3 v 2 1 e 1 besides define another function ϕ r s r α e v 2 note that ϕ is continuous then ϕ 1 r is an open subset of λ s containing the slice 1 s since s is compact it can be obtained from the tube lemma in perruquetti et al 2008 that ϕ 1 r contains some tube 1 ε 1 1 ε 2 s near 1 s obviously for all α e 1 ε 1 1 ε 2 s we have v 2 0 therefore the origin of 35 is locally asymptotically stable at the same time the origin of 33 is locally asymptotically stable next the second result of this paper is presented theorem 4 if assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied the error dynamics 31 with the state vector being e and the inputs being σ and q is finite time iss proof the vector field f in 34 is homogeneous of degree α 1 with respect to the weights 1 α 2 α 1 from lemma 3 system 33 is locally asymptotically stable according to theorem 2 in rosier 1992 there exists a

dynamic positioning vessels is position stabilization therefore the communication can be dramatically reduced by using the proposed event triggered mechanism if the vessel position is fast changing the communication times will increases accordingly for this case new event triggered mechanism is desirable to be designed in the future a design guideline is provided on how to select the control parameters firstly a smaller design control parameter ε can result in more accurate estimation performance while peaking and oscillation may be caused by a small ε in the presence of nonzero initial error secondly the parameter α is chosen to satisfy 2 3 α 1 thirdly the communication times can be reduced by enlarging the threshold m while too large threshold m will lead to decreased estimation performance hence a tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and communication reduction could be made 4 simulation results the theoretical design in the previous section is validated by using a numerical example a model ship of cybership ii is used here and its parameters are given in skjetne et al 2005 the external disturbances are as follows τ w u 0 3 0 3 cos 0 01 t cos 0 015 t τ w v 1 0 3

comparisons with time triggered eso and time triggered finite time convergent eso time triggered feso are given figs 3 5 plot the comparisons of estimation performance for the unmeasured surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity respectively similar to the time triggered esos well estimation performances can be achieved by the proposed event triggered esos in figs 6 8 the total uncertainties and the estimation value given by the four esos are plotted compared with the time triggered esos almost the same estimation performance can be achieved by the proposed event triggered esos fig 9 plots the comparisons of communication times for the time triggered esos the position heading measurements are transmitted to the esos in every sampling time while in the event triggered esos the condition d t is triggered only at certain time instants it can be concluded that the proposed event triggered esos can maintain a similar level of estimation performance to that of time triggered esos but the communication times can be obviously reduced in addition the communication times of the time triggered eso time triggered feso event triggered eso and event triggered feso are summarized in table 1 it demonstrates that the sensor to observer communication times can be substantially reduced by using the proposed event triggered esos 5 conclusions this paper presents two event triggered esos for dynamic positioning vessels such that the unmeasured states uncertain kinetics and unknown sea loads are estimated using reduced communication cost firstly an event triggered eso is designed to reconstruct the unknown velocities and estimate the total uncertainties based on the position heading measurements only an event triggering mechanism is designed to determine the communication instants such that observation performance is guaranteed using fewer communication resources the error dynamics of the event triggered eso is shown to be iss and zeno behavior will not occur then to achieve finite time convergence an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed by using a nonlinear error function the unmeasured velocities and total disturbances can be recovered in finite time the estimation error dynamics of the event triggered finite time convergent eso is proven to be finite time iss finally simulation and comparison results show that the proposed event triggered esos can achieve a similar level of estimation performance to that of time triggered esos whereas the communication costs can be obviously reduced acknowledgments this work

currents specifically an event triggered extended state observer eso is proposed such that unnecessary communications are avoided and sensor to observer communication cost are drastically reduced a realizable event triggering condition is established depending on the position heading measurements only it is proven that the observation errors are input to state stable iss and zeno behavior will not occur aimed at achieving finite time convergence an event triggered finite time convergent eso is further designed by resorting to a homogeneous lyapunov function the estimation errors are proven to be finite time iss a salient feature of the proposed event triggered esos is that a joint observation of the unmeasured velocities unknown kinetics and unknown sea loads can be achieved with reduced communication cost the proposed event triggered esos can be applied to various motion scenario such trajectory tracking path following target tracking and even formation control of marine vessels simulation results show that the communication times are largely decreased compared with the time triggered esos keywords event triggered extended state observer dynamic positioning marine vessels uncertainty estimation state estimation 1 introduction a dynamic positioning system is defined as a control system which is able to keep the position and heading of marine vessels within predefined limits dynamic positioning systems have received significant attention due to its wide applications in offshore industries such as resource exploitation marine drilling underwater pipe laying etc sφrensen 2011 dynamic positioning vessels are subject to uncertain model uncertainties and unknown sea loads model uncertainties inherently exist in vessels due to unavailable model parameters unknown hydrodynamic coefficients and unmodeled dynamics in addition time varying sea loads are induced by wind waves and ocean currents in practical marine environment these uncertainties and disturbances may affect or even destroy the control performance of dynamic positioning vessels shi et al 2017a disturbance compensation is a fundamental issue in the control of dynamic positioning vessels and makes a great effect on the control performance plenty of methods have been developed in the literature to compensate for the uncertainties or disturbances and thus the control performance of dynamic positioning vessels can be improved the parametric adaptive method is one of the most common approaches where the uncertainties are expressed linearly in terms of unknown parameters chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2005 do and pan 2006 yin and xiao 2016 in skjetne et al 2005 an adaptive method is proposed to estimate the uncertain constant parameters for a maneuvering system of a model ship in do and pan 2006 a projection based adaptive control design is developed to deal with the unknown parameters and bounded disturbances for underactuated ships the robust control method is also widely used in marine vehicles control systems and the uncertainties are usually assumed to be bounded lekkas and fossen 2014 xiang et al 2017 in lekkas and fossen 2014 an adaptive sliding mode control method is used to handle parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics in xiang et al 2017 an adaptive sliding control design is developed to handle the unknown bounded uncertainties without a priori information of the bounds in recent years neural networks and fuzzy logic systems are used to identify the unknown functions in marine vehicle models yang et al 2003 chen and tan 2013 dai et

system in dai et al 2018b radial basis function neural networks are used to identify the unknown dynamics of a surface ship disturbance observer is also a useful tool to estimate external disturbances and has been applied to marine vehicle systems do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d in cui et al 2016 a disturbance observer is proposed for autonomous marine vessels provided that the disturbance is constant and bounded in chen et al 2016 a disturbance observer is developed to estimate unmodeled environmental disturbances due to wind waves and currents in aforementioned studies chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2005 do and pan 2006 yin and xiao 2016 lekkas and fossen 2014 xiang et al 2017 yang et al 2003 chen and tan 2013 dai et al 2016 2018a 2018b peng et al 2013 qin et al 2019 b do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d the uncertainties and disturbances are estimated based on velocity information while the velocity may not be directly measured in dynamic positioning vessels due to technical reasons or saving of cost shi et al 2017a disturbance or state estimation based on position yaw information is presented in tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2013 peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 in tee and ge 2006 a high gain observer is proposed for surface vessels based on position yaw information and the unknown velocities are recovered in chen et al 2013 a high gain observer is applied in a position mooring control system to estimate unmeasured velocities in the surge sway and yaw directions while the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances can not be identified in peng et al 2016 a neural network based observers is proposed for the cooperative dynamic positioning of marine vessels where a predictor module is developed for estimating the unmeasured velocities as well as unknown ocean disturbances in peng et al 2017b an echo state network based observer using recorded input output data is developed such that the unknown vessel dynamics and unmeasured velocity information are identified in peng et al 2015 a neural network based observer is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown velocities and iterative updating laws are designed using prediction errors note that for the observers designed in peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 the persistence of exciting is required to achieve the parameter convergence eso technique is applied to estimate the unknown velocity and disturbance for marine vehicles in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 where the condition of persistence of exciting is eliminated in cui et al 2017 a multiple input and multiple output eso is designed not only to estimate the unknown velocities but also to estimate unknown external disturbances in peng and wang 2018 an eso is developed for surface vehicles such that the unknown velocities internal model uncertainty and external disturbances are simultaneously compensated however the existing esos designed for marine vessels presented in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 rely on continuous sampling this means that the signals have to be transmitted during each execution cycle which will consume many network resources and calculation resources as for dynamic positioning vessels their working mode is position stabilization in most cases and the position and yaw angle are unchanging as a result it is highly desirable to develop a resource ware eso to evaluate and transmit signal to remove unnecessary samplings or communications motivated by the above discussions we consider the state and uncertainty estimation problem for dynamic positioning vessels with unmeasured velocities and limited resources the kinetic model of dynamic positioning vessels suffers from kinds of uncertainties including parametric uncertainties unmodelled dynamics and unknown sea loads in addition only the position heading information is measured by the equipments of global positioning system and magnetometer at first an event triggered extended state observer eso is proposed where the sensor to observer communication cost is reduced drastically an event triggering transmission is designed based on the position heading information only it is proven that the error dynamics is input to state stable iss and zeno phenomenon is excluded then to achieve the finite time convergence an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed by using a homogeneous lyapunov function the error dynamics is shown to be finite time iss simulation results illustrate that the communication cost can be substantially reduced using the event triggered esos compared to the time triggered esos the proposed event triggered esos can be applied to many marine vehicle systems including surface vehicles zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2016b underwater vehicles xiang et al 2015 shen et al 2019 yan et al 2019 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2020 and cooperative marine vehicle systems cui et al 2010 li et al 2018 shi et al 2017b liu et al 2019b the merits of the presented event triggered esos for dynamic positioning vessels are as follows 1 in the disturbance observers presented in do 2011 cui et al 2016 chen et al 2016 peng et al 2019d the esos proposed in gu et al 2019b peng et al 2019c and neural fuzzy uncertainty estimation methods in yang et al 2003 chen and tan 2013 dai et al 2016 2018a 2018b qin et al 2019 b liu et al 2017 2018 peng et al 2013 2017a 2019a 2019b the disturbance and uncertainty estimation rely on the velocity measurements by using the proposed event triggered esos the internal uncertainties and external disturbances can be estimated based on the position yaw information 2 in contrast to the high gain observers developed in tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2013 where only the unmeasured velocities can be recovered the unknown disturbances can be estimated in addition to the unmeasured velocities in contrast to the neural network based state observers presented in peng et al 2016 2017b 2015 where the uncertainties and velocity states can be estimated under the persistent of exciting the proposed event triggered esos guarantee estimation convergence without the persistence of exciting 3 in contrast to the esos proposed in cui et al 2017 fu and linglingyu 2018 peng and wang 2018 peng et al 2019b gu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2016a 2019a jiang et al 2020 where the position yaw measurements are transmitted in real time intermittent communication is allowed herein thanks to the proposed event triggered esos besides the proposed event triggered finite time convergent eso is able to achieve finite time convergence with reduced communication cost this paper is organized as follows some notations and mathematical model of dynamic positioning vessels is introduced in section 2 in section 3 an event triggered eso and an event triggered finite time convergent eso are developed and analyzed simulation results are given in section 4 to demonstrate the validity of the proposed esos section 5 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries and problem formulation in this section some notations are briefly introduced then the mathematical model of dynamic positioning vessels is introduced along with the problem formulation 2 1 notations r n represents the n dimensional euclidean space λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix and λ min is the minimum eigenvalue of a matrix is the euclidean norm f c p means f has a continuous pth derivative 2 2 problem formulation an inertial frame and a body fixed frame are used to describe the motion control of dynamic positioning vessels as shown in fig 1 neglecting the dynamics in heave pitch and roll the mathematical model of a dynamic positioning vessels can be expressed as fossen 2011 1 η t r ψ ν t m ν t c ν t ν t d ν t ν t g ν t η t τ w t τ t where r ψ t cos ψ t sin ψ t 0 sin ψ t cos ψ t 0 0 0 1 and η x y ψ t r 3 consists of position x y t and yaw angle ψ ν u v r t r 3 consists of surge velocity u sway velocity v and yaw rate r m m t r 3 3 is the inertial matrix r ψ r 3 3 is the rotate matrix c ν c ν r 3 3 denotes the coriolis and centrifugal matrix d ν r 3 3 denotes the damping matrix g ν η g u ν t η t g v ν t η t g r ν t η t t r 3 presents the unmodelled hydrodynamics τ w τ w u τ w v τ w r t r 3 is the unknown sea loads induced by wind wave and ocean currents τ τ u τ v τ r t r 3 is the control input vector to facilitate design and analysis the internal model uncertainties and external disturbances are regarded as a total uncertainty vector σ t σ u t σ v t σ r t r 3 and is defined as follows σ t m 1 c ν t ν t d ν t ν t 2 g ν t η t τ w t then the vessle dynamics 1 becomes 3 η t r ψ t ν t ν t σ t m 1 τ t the position is measured by a global positioning system and the yaw angle is measured by a magnetometer while the velocity information ν t is not available here and need to be recovered from the position and yaw measurements the vector σ t including internal and external uncertainties is totally unknown we aim to estimate the uncertain vector σ t using the measurable information η t only note that the dynamic position vessels are implemented digitally using microprocessors with limited communication bandwidth computing resources while the common time triggered observers require to obtain the state signals periodically along a constant sampling rate and it would lead to wasteful use of communication and computation resources therefore it is of practical necessary to design esos for dynamic position vessels considering the resource limitations to summarize we aim to develop observers for dynamic position vessels 3 such that the following two objectives can be achieved 1 both the unmeasured velocities ν t and the total uncertainties σ t are recovered utilizing the measured position heading vector η t only 2 the sensor to observer communication times should be remarkably reduced while retaining an acceptable observation performance 3 design and analysis to solve the problem stated in the previous section two event triggered esos are developed and analyzed in this section firstly an event triggered nonlinear eso is designed and the estimation errors are proven to be iss then in order to reduce the convergence time an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed and the estimation errors are proven to be finite time iss two event triggering mechanisms are designed for the two event triggered esos respectively such that satisfactory observation performance can be achieved while using fewer communication resources the following standard assumptions are needed assumption 1 guo and zhao 2011 zhao and guo 2015 the unknown vector σ satisfies σ σ with σ being a positive constant assumption 2 the velocity of the dynamic positioning vessels are bounded such that ν ν with ν being a positive constant

heading measurements given by 6 ξ t η t k if d t 0 η t otherwise here t k is the previous event triggering time instant and d t is an event triggered mechanism designed as 7 d t 0 if q t m 1 otherwise with m 0 being a design threshold and 8 q t η t k η t ε 2 the diagram of the proposed event triggered eso is given in fig 2 at each sampling instant the event triggering condition is monitored to determine whether or not to transmit the latest position and yaw angle to the eso since the measurements are transmitted only at the event triggering instants the sensor to observer communication is remarkably reduced the proposed event triggered esos can provide accurate disturbance information for anti disturbance control methods such as active disturbance rejection control letting 9 η t η ˆ t

design next we will show the nonexistence of zeno phenomenon in the proposed event triggered eso proposition 1 consider the dynamic positioning vessel 1 the eso 5 and the triggering condition of 7 if assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied there exist ε 0 and ι 0 such that for any k 0 11 min t k 1 t k ι proof from definition of q in 8 the event triggering mechanism is equivalent to 12 d t η t k if η t k η t ε 2 m η t otherwise for the sample error η t k η t when t t k t k 1 we have 13 η t k η t t k t η ι d ι t k t r ψ ι ν ι d ι using assumption 2 it can be obtained that 14 η t k η t t t k ν thus there exists ι ε 2 m ν such that η t k η t ε 2 m holds for t t k ι this completes the proof proposition 1 shows that proposed event triggered eso is free from zeno behavior next the stability of the proposed event triggered eso is investigated to facilitate the stability analysis define z t z 1 t t z 2 t t z 3 t t t r 9 and then the error dynamics 10 can be expressed in a matrix equation as 15 z

the eso once the event happens the newest position and yaw measurements are fed to the eso via the sensor observer network 3 2 event triggered finite time convergent eso in the previous subsection an event triggered eso is developed and the observation error dynamics is proven to be iss while the transient estimation performance is not considered and the convergent time is unknown in this subsection an event triggered finite time convergent eso is designed such that satisfactory observation performance can be achieved in finite time at the same time sensor to observer communication frequency can be reduced an event triggered finite time convergent eso is designed as follows 28 η ˆ t 3 ε r ψ t r t ψ t η ˆ t ξ t ε 2 α r ψ t ν ˆ t ν ˆ t 3 r t ψ t η ˆ t ξ t ε 2 2 α 1 σ ˆ t m 1 τ t σ

dynamic positioning vessels is position stabilization therefore the communication can be dramatically reduced by using the proposed event triggered mechanism if the vessel position is fast changing the communication times will increases accordingly for this case new event triggered mechanism is desirable to be designed in the future a design guideline is provided on how to select the control parameters firstly a smaller design control parameter ε can result in more accurate estimation performance while peaking and oscillation may be caused by a small ε in the presence of nonzero initial error secondly the parameter α is chosen to satisfy 2 3 α 1 thirdly the communication times can be reduced by enlarging the threshold m while too large threshold m will lead to decreased estimation performance hence a tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and communication reduction could be made 4 simulation results the theoretical design in the previous section is validated by using a numerical example a model ship of cybership ii is used here and its parameters are given in skjetne et al 2005 the external disturbances are as follows τ w u 0 3 0 3 cos 0 01 t cos 0 015 t τ w v 1 0 3

comparisons with time triggered eso and time triggered finite time convergent eso time triggered feso are given figs 3 5 plot the comparisons of estimation performance for the unmeasured surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity respectively similar to the time triggered esos well estimation performances can be achieved by the proposed event triggered esos in figs 6 8 the total uncertainties and the estimation value given by the four esos are plotted compared with the time triggered esos almost the same estimation performance can be achieved by the proposed event triggered esos fig 9 plots the comparisons of communication times for the time triggered esos the position heading measurements are transmitted to the esos in every sampling time while in the event triggered esos the condition d t is triggered only at certain time instants it can be concluded that the proposed event triggered esos can maintain a similar level of estimation performance to that of time triggered esos but the communication times can be obviously reduced in addition the communication times of the time triggered eso time triggered feso event triggered eso and event triggered feso are summarized in table 1 it demonstrates that the sensor to observer communication times can be substantially reduced by using the proposed event triggered esos 5 conclusions this paper presents two event triggered esos for dynamic positioning vessels such that the unmeasured states uncertain kinetics and unknown sea loads are estimated using reduced communication cost firstly an event triggered eso is designed to reconstruct the unknown velocities and estimate the total uncertainties based on the position heading measurements only an event triggering mechanism is designed to determine the communication instants such that observation performance is guaranteed using fewer communication resources the error dynamics of the event triggered eso is shown to be iss and zeno behavior will not occur then to achieve finite time convergence an event triggered finite time convergent eso is developed by using a nonlinear error function the unmeasured velocities and total disturbances can be recovered in finite time the estimation error dynamics of the event triggered finite time convergent eso is proven to be finite time iss finally simulation and comparison results show that the proposed event triggered esos can achieve a similar level of estimation performance to that of time triggered esos whereas the communication costs can be obviously reduced acknowledgments this work

21764,the credibility in the results needs to be demonstrated in order to be able to use computational fluid dynamics cfd as an engineering tool this may be obtained by sufficient verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification this study investigates how to perform credible cfd simulations of floating offshore wind turbines fowts three methods to estimate discretisation errors were compared for three different problems related to fowts wave propagation in 2d wave loads on a circular cylinder and surge decay of a semi submersible fowt the three discretisation error estimation methods are a least squares formulation using the observed order of convergence in combination with a data quality measure for different spatial and temporal refinement another least squares fit method using the theoretical order of convergence for constant courant number grid refinement studies and the factor of safety method applying a ratio between observed and theoretical order of convergence we compared the final results to an analytical solution of the 2d wave signal and to experimental data for the wave loads and surge decay motions for validation purposes the results of this work show the advantages and disadvantages of the three error estimation methods the uncertainty bars for the discretisation uncertainty of the numerical simulations were mostly larger than the comparison error with the model test data and analytical solution keywords computational fluid dynamics verification validation floating offshore wind error uncertainty 1 introduction nowadays performing computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations is no longer an achievement in fact engineers and scientists can compute very complex maritime flow problems with a wide range of cfd solvers available for instance beyer et al 2015 quallen et al 2014 bozonnet and emery 2015 and burmester et al 2017 2020 conducted detailed investigations on the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines in these studies the researchers first investigated the usage and then different effects design considerations moorings etc on the dynamic behaviour of the floater moreover simulations of the whole floating offshore wind turbine with rotating rotor moving floater elastic deformations and dynamic moorings in wind and waves are possible by coupling cfd with other tools see e g tran and kim 2016 liu et al 2017 and liu and xiao 2019 the semi submersible floating wind turbine used in these studies is the oc4 offshore code comparison collaboration continued deepcwind semi submersible robertson et al 2014 combined with nrel s 5 mw baseline turbine jonkman et al 2009 thus these authors performed the simulations at full scale they demonstrated to be able to simulate a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers by comparing the results to standard engineering codes widely used in the industry the engineering tools were based on potential flow lumped mass and blade element momentum theory bemt approaches in their publications these authors showed aerodynamic hydrodynamic and structural results with good agreements the use of cfd as an engineering tool however requires verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification these studies need to be conducted for all relevant flow parameters thus for fowts this includes amongst others lift and drag on the wind turbine blades deformation of and loads on the structure motions of the floater wave propagation and mooring line forces see fig 1 the sensitivity to different numerical schemes turbulence models and the coupling with different models tools such as mooring models or structural deformation and rigid body motion solvers also need to be studied in order to achieve confidence and credibility full scale simulations of floating wind turbines are needed for the design prediction of dynamic behaviour and power output nevertheless model scale experiments of floating wind turbines help to understand the complex dynamic behaviour of these structures model test data also permit validation of numerical simulations and engineering models if errors and uncertainties of the model tests are available for validation with model test data the numerical simulations and engineering models need to be performed at model scale the physics and appropriate numerical models however are dissimilar to full scale in terms of prediction of viscous effects cfd and engineering models also behave differently between model and full scale because the well known reynolds froude dissimilarity is very problematic for scaled floating wind turbines gueydon and fernandes 2013 research institutes try to find work around solutions by either coupling a numerical code with the experiment in real time see e g sauder et al 2016 bayati et al 2018 or by performance matching of the turbine de ridder et al 2014 in the latter case the objective is to develop a new wind turbine that matches the performance characteristics of the full scale turbine when applying froude scaled conditions in model test basins the collaboration between marin and the university of maine resulted in the so called marin stock wind turbine mswt see e g de ridder et al 2014 martin et al 2012 make and vaz 2015 and burmester et al 2016 this turbine represents the performance coefficients of the nrel 5 mw turbine at full scale robertson et al 2017 used model test data of this turbine mounted on the oc5 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation deepcwind semi submersible for an extensive code comparison study then burmester et al 2017 2020 computed several surge decay simulations of this semi submersible floating system using cfd to analyse the effects of different numerical parameters on the flow characteristics and the hydrodynamic damping because of the possibility to conduct these complex numerical simulations and to improve their quality the credibility of such simulations has become more important for engineering designs credibility in the solution may be obtained by sufficient verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification the authors of papers with such complex cfd problems choose to use different methods to gain confidence in their solutions these methods range from showing convergence of the time traces of a given quantity to comparing results with experimental data or other widely used numerical tools to full estimation of errors and uncertainties see e g burmester et al 2020 make and vaz 2015 and wang et al 2018 there are several kinds of numerical errors ferziger and perić 2002 they can be distinguished in modelling discretisation iterative input statistical and round off errors for validation purposes the modelling errors unlike for verification the discretisation iteration and round off errors are the important quantities for unsteady flows the statistical errors are also important in order to validate a numerical solution the quantification of numerical and experimental errors owing to setup measurement repeatability input parameters and the computational errors is required to quantify these errors there are several methods available such as ittc 2008 asme 2009 aiaa 1998 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 eça and hoekstra 2014 brouwer et al 2015 xing and stern 2010 the guidelines of the ittc international towing tank conference asme american society of mechanical engineers and aiaa american institute of aeronautics and astronautics are generally accepted and have been extended by xing and stern 2010 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and eça and hoekstra 2014 the latter three use richardson extrapolation to estimate discretisation errors and uncertainties several researchers have applied these methods successfully for maritime flow problems however no researcher performed direct comparison of these techniques to analyse their advantages and disadvantages and to assess the uncertainties in these methods the work presented here follows the schematic in fig 1 aiming to analyse the ingredients towards a full elastic aero hydrodynamic fowt model with verification and validation techniques make and vaz 2015 already quantified errors and uncertainties for aerodynamic simulations of the mswt hence this study is focused on the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines it addresses different problems related to fowts such as wave propagation wave loads and rigid body motions of a semi submersible floater there are many different verification and validation procedures each having a different level of accuracy therefore we applied two methods to estimate discretisation errors and uncertainties in order to assess the differences between these methods the two discretisation error estimation techniques are the approaches by eça and hoekstra 2014 and by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 for comparison purposes we added the formulation proposed by xing and stern 2010 the test cases include free surface wave and turbulence modelling as well as coupling with a rigid body motion solver these cases started simple and increased in complexity the assessment of numerical errors allows solution verification to be performed for validation purposes we compared the wave load and rigid body motion results with experimental data these steps including solution verification as well as validation of the results improve confidence in and credibility of the results the paper starts with an introduction to the numerical methods theoretical background on numerical errors and the three discretisation error methods follow in the third section sections four five and six describe the test cases their specific settings verification studies and validation results the paper ends with conclusions and perspectives for future work 2 numerical methods we performed the numerical simulations with community based open source cfd code refresco http www refresco org vaz et al 2009 the code solves multiphase unsteady incompressible viscous flows using the navier stokes equations 2 1 governing equations the definition of the continuity and momentum navier stokes equation for newtonian and incompressible flows is as follows klaij et al 2018 moukalled et al 2016 1 ρ v 0 2 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g here v denotes the velocity vector ρ the density t the time and p the pressure the only body force considered is owing to the gravity vector g τ is the viscous part of the stress tensor and reads 3 τ μ v v t the superscript t represents the transpose and μ the dynamic viscosity turbulence models and volume fraction transport equations for different phases complement these equations vaz et al 2009 we used the volume of fluid vof method to model the free surface klaij et al 2018 this method models the multiphase flow by adopting a single continuum fluid in which the density ρ and viscosity μ can vary in space and time the following equation gives the density and viscosity for two different phases water and air 4 ρ ρ a c 1 c ρ w μ μ a c 1 c μ w the subscript w and a represent the material properties of water and air respectively c denotes the volume fraction and ranges from c 0 to c 1 a value of c 0 means that the cell is filled entirely by water and c 1 entirely by air consequently we term c also air volume fraction the volume fraction transport equation reads 5 c t c v 0 the discretisation of the equations follows a finite volume approach with cell centred collocated variables in strong conservation form implicit time discretisation and picard linearisation for the non linear terms are used iterative solvers are applied for the resulting linear system of equations gmres and or cg with block jacobi preconditioning the normalised residuals are equivalent to solution changes in a simple jacobi iteration a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm ensures mass conservation klaij and vuik 2013 the parallelisation of the code utilises the mpi message passing interface library the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces and if needed h refinement hanging nodes 2 2 free surface and wave setup several interface capturing schemes are available for the discretisation of the convection term of the volume fraction transport equation for the wave load on cylinder test case refrics refresco s interface capturing scheme klaij et al 2018 and hric high resolution interface capturing muzaferija et al 1999 showed very similar results in terms of iterative convergence computing time free surface representation wave propagation and wave loads these two schemes were significantly more accurate than quick quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics ferziger and perić 2002 and superbee roe 1985 therefore refrics was used in the three test cases the two test cases with wave generation utilised absorption zones also called damping zones or sponge layers in the literature perić and abdel maksoud 2016 at beginning and end of the computational domain to reduce the difference between initial and actual wave the absorption zone methods can be traced back to israeli and orszag 1981 the method used here is comparable to the method proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2018 however it differs to the latter method by omitted body force functions in the volume fraction transport equation which was found unnecessary by rapuc et al 2018 the momentum equation with added source term q may be written as 6 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g q the source term q follows a body force function f b in a plane in gravity direction 7 q i ρ f b u ˆ i u i u i are the cartesian components of the velocity vector the theoretical initial wave orbital velocity components are given by u ˆ i the body force function follows either a cosine or an exponential behaviour 8 f b 1 t r e f f m a x 1 cos π x b 2 9 f b 1 t r e f f m a x e x b 3 5 1 e 1 1 t r e f is a reference period typically equal to the wave period the body force function f b is valid between two predefined ellipses perpendicular to the gravity inside the inner ellipse the body force function is zero the inner ellipse gives the starting point for x b f b is constant outside of the outer ellipse the form of the ellipses can be changed from circular to rectangular if the distance between the two ellipses is related to the wave length f m a x can be considered independent of the wave period rapuc et al 2018 2 3 turbulence modelling the reynolds averaged form of the navier stokes equations was used for the test cases i e the time dependent quantities are replaced by a mean field and a statistical fluctuation quantity owing to turbulence these quantities are v and v for the momentum equation respectively then there arise the reynolds stresses ρ v v that can be calculated by the boussinesq approximation for linear eddy viscosity based turbulence models the missing eddy turbulent viscosity μ t and the turbulent kinetic energy k are a result of rans turbulence models for test case three the kskl k k l turbulence model was applied as described in menter and egorov 2010 this model showed advantage in convergence of the residuals for free surface applications and less unrealistic eddy viscosity compared to the k ω shear stress transport turbulence model sst 2003 by menter et al 2003 the solutions of the test cases with wave propagation and wave loads are pressure dominated for these test cases no turbulence model was applied as the viscous effects are negligible burmester and guérinel 2016 2 4 equation of motion solver the simulations for test case three also applied moving grids with a moving grid formulation i e the unsteady rans equations were written and solved in the earth fixed reference frame and the complete grid was able to translate and rotate coupling with structural equations of motion was done for this test case the equations of motion for a rigid body enable the description of this body s attitude to external loads rosetti and vaz 2017 the considered external loads are the hydrodynamic force f h the restoring force f c and the linear viscous mechanical damping force f d with a state vector for six degrees of freedom r x g y g z g ϕ g θ g ψ g t the dynamic equations are written as rosetti 2015 10 m r f h f c f d with f c c r and f d d r in this equation m denotes the mass d the damping and c the stiffness matrix the matrices are positive and diagonal as the body was assumed totally rigid the mechanical damping matrix was set to zero together these equations form a second order non linear initial value problem the problem is non linear because the hydrodynamic forces f h keep a non linear relation with r via the navier stokes equations we used a semi implicit coupled scheme to avoid numerical instabilities owing to low mass ratios and added mass constraints the scheme is based on the predictor corrector second order adams bashforth moulton scheme in which the communication between flow solution and rigid body system is done at the time loop level with the predictor and at the outer loop level with an iterative corrector step at each 10 th outer iteration more details on this procedure may be found in rosetti and vaz 2017 and rosetti 2015 3 numerical errors errors and uncertainties occur in numerical simulations their quantification are both part of validation and verification according to roache 2009 verification checks whether the equations are solved in a right way and validation whether the right equations are being solved verification is a mathematical exercise composed of code and solution verification code verification means to demonstrate that a computer code contains the correct implementation of the system of equations error and or uncertainty estimation of a numerical simulation for a case in which the exact solution is not known is part of solution verification one needs to conduct code verification before solution verification usually developers perform code verification and users need to focus on solution verification validation is an engineering activity to estimate the modelling error uncertainty it requires experimental data and should be done after solution verification validation is applied to the mathematical model and done for selected flow quantities eça et al 2016 it also requires the experimental errors uncertainties there are several kinds of numerical errors ferziger and perić 2002 they can be distinguished in modelling ϵ m discretisation ϵ d iterative ϵ i t input ϵ i and round off errors ϵ r o then the total computational error ϵ t of a quantity reads 11 ϵ t ϵ m ϵ i ϵ n s where the numerical simulation error ϵ n s follows as 12 ϵ n s ϵ i t ϵ r o ϵ d ϵ s t for validation purposes the modelling errors unlike for verification the numerical simulation errors are the important quantities the modelling error defines the difference between the numerical and exact solution of the mathematical model the round off error describes the difference between the calculated approximation of a number and its exact mathematical value in calculations with double precision dp i e 12 digits the round off error may be neglected the discretisation error denotes the difference between the exact solution of the conservation equations and the exact solution of the algebraic system of equations obtained by their discretisation spatial and temporal the iterative error is the difference between the iterative and exact solutions of the system of algebraic equations the residual level obtained controls the iterative error for residual levels of two orders of magnitude below the discretisation error the iterative error can be considered small enough so that the discretisation error follows as major source of numerical errors eça and hoekstra 2009 the input error arises because of differences between the physical and numerical problem such as insufficient experimental information or large numerical demands for unsteady flow problems the statistical errors ϵ s t are also important this error originates because of the finite length of the test domains and the duration of simulation time this uncertainty could be reduced by repeated simulations and averaging the results however reliable error estimates are needed for engineering approaches brouwer et al 2015 3 1 definition of errors and uncertainties the difference between the solution of a given quantity ϕ i and its exact value ϕ 0 defines the error δ mathematically 13 δ ϕ i ϕ 0 uncertainties give an interval around the exact solution this interval contains the exact solution with a certain degree of confidence the uncertainty u ϕ i is defined as 14 ϕ i u ϕ i ϕ 0 ϕ i u ϕ i eq 13 is the starting point for the estimation of the discretisation error uncertainty moreover we need to quantify the convergence of a quantity the type of convergence defines the error estimation method with three solutions the convergence ratio r can be estimated with 15 r ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 the input parameters ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 correspond to solutions with fine medium and coarse grid spacing respectively ittc 2008 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 eça and hoekstra 2014 present the convergence conditions as monotonic convergence 0 r 1 monotonic divergence r 1 oscillatory convergence r 0 and r 1 oscillatory divergence r 0 and r 1 3 2 approach by eça and hoekstra 2014 using richardson extrapolation as proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 extends eq 13 to 16 ϵ d δ r e ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p here p denotes the observed order of convergence h the relative grid spacing and α a constant related with the error level the relative grid spacing h i of a given grid depends on the typical grid spacing δ x i there are three unknowns in eq 16 i e at least three solutions ϕ i are needed to estimate the error for unstructured grids as used in this study the relative and typical grid spacing are estimated by eça 2016 17 δ x i 1 n c e l l s i 1 n d h i δ x i δ x 1 n c e l l s i is the number of cells of grid i and n d stands for the dimension of space i e n d 3 for three dimensional simulations the subscript 1 denotes the solution of the finest grid and time step for unsteady calculations both spatial and temporal discretisation play a role therefore eq 16 can be extended to 18 δ r e ϕ i ϕ 0 α x h i p x α t t i p t the subscripts x and t stand for space and time dependent values t i is the relative time step and is estimated with 19 t i δ t i δ t 1 n t 1 n t i the number of time steps for a certain time interval is denoted by n t i for a given simulation and δ t i the corresponding time step size thus the finest grid and time step are represented with h 1 1 and t 1 1 in eq 18 there are five unknowns i e at least five solutions for monotonic convergent data are required to solve this equation for simplification eq 16 for steady simulations is used to explain the procedure for the error and uncertainty estimation by eça and hoekstra 2014 if eq 16 does not deliver reliable or even impossible output then three other error estimators can be used i e the observed order of grid convergence p is either very small or very large the three estimators are 20 δ 1 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i 21 δ 2 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i 2 and 22 δ 12 ϕ i ϕ 0 α 1 h i α 2 h i 2 while eq 20 and eq 21 are suitable for monotonic converging solutions eq 21 can be applied also to non monotonic converging data three simulations are deemed not reliable since the error estimation with richardson extrapolation depends highly on the observed order of convergence p the equations might be ill conditioned for small data ranges the data can contain noise and the grids can be dissimilar consequently eça and hoekstra 2014 recommend to use at least one grid more than unknowns so the error estimation can be done in a least squares sense as an example just the least squares formulation for eq 16 is regarded the same as for eq 20 eq 21 and eq 22 ϕ 0 is determined from the minimum of the function 23 s r e w ϕ 0 α p i 1 n g w i ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 the least squares are summed over the number of grids n g the procedure can be weighted with w i in case more weight should be given to the finer grid solutions otherwise the weights w i equal 1 for all grids in addition the standard deviations are defined with 24 σ r e w i 1 n g n g w i ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 n g 3 in case of a non weighted approach n g w i is replaced by n g w i 1 once the error estimation is completed the uncertainty can be obtained therefore a safety factor is chosen according to roache 2009 this safety factor is f s 1 25 for a reliable error estimate and f s 3 otherwise the uncertainty estimation has three components the absolute value of the discretisation error times a safety factor the standard deviation of the fit and the absolute difference of the real data point ϕ i and the value obtained from the fit for the same grid density ϕ f i t more details may be found in eça and hoekstra 2014 this method is implemented in a tool and available on http www refresco org this tool was used in the work of this paper 3 3 approach by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 also published in oberhagemann 2016 requires uniform refinement in all spatial dimensions as well as time to achieve constant courant numbers for one dimension the cfl courant number is defined as 25 cfl u i δ t δ x i here the particle velocity in component notation is denoted by u i the time step by δ t and the grid spacing by δ x i oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 propose to use a taylor series expansion similar to eq 22 a non dimensional scalar grid refinement ratio υ is defined with 26 υ i 1 2 δ x i δ x 1 2 δ y i δ y 1 2 1 2 1 r x 2 i 1 1 r y 2 i 1 the spacing for a reference grid is indicated with subscript 1 potentially it is possible to refine the grid differently per spatial direction accordingly υ consists of δ x and δ y as the grid spacing in x and y respectively the individual refinement factors are defined with 27 r x δ x i 1 δ x i and r y δ y i 1 δ y i contrary to eça and hoekstra oberhagemann and el moctar define the coarse grid as the reference grid then the discretisation error δ d is estimated with 28 ϵ d δ d ϕ i ϕ 0 a 1 υ i a 2 υ i 2 the truncation of this polynomial should be chosen so that the expected order of grid convergence can be replicated oberhagemann 2016 again for each unknown at least one grid solution is needed i e for second order approximations a minimum of three grids are required in case of scatter in the data the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar follows the proposed least squares minimisation by eça and hoekstra 2014 e g 29 s 1 ϕ 0 a i 1 n g ϕ i ϕ 0 a υ i 2 for first order convergence and 30 s 2 ϕ 0 a 1 a 2 i 1 n g ϕ i ϕ 0 a 1 υ i a 2 υ i 2 2 for second order grid convergence more details may be found in oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and oberhagemann 2016 3 4 approach by xing and stern 2010 the approach by xing and stern 2010 is applied also to the cases chosen for the method by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 xing and stern 2010 name this approach factors of safety fs method the observed order of convergence follows from 31 p r e ln ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ln r in accordance with eça and hoekstra xing and stern 2010 define the fine grid as the reference grid thus ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 denote the fine medium and coarse grid solutions with the grid spacing δ x i the refinement factor r reads 32 r δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 following the ittc 2008 guidelines the error estimate is defined as 33 δ r e ϕ 2 ϕ 1 r p r e 1 xing and stern 2010 however recommend to multiply δ r e with the ratio of convergence p 34 p p r e p t h p gives the ratio between the observed order of convergence p r e and the theoretical order of convergence p t h limited by the discretisation schemes a p value of close to 1 i e p r e p t h represents grids in the asymptotic region following the work of phillips and roy 2014 we limited the minimum observed order of accuracy to p r e 0 5 the new error estimate becomes ϵ d p δ r e this error estimate takes into account the distance to the asymptotic region then the discretisation uncertainty is given by xing and stern 2010 35 u f s f s p δ r e 2 45 0 85 p δ r e 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ r e p 1 a set of three grids is required to solve the errors and uncertainties using this method as this approach is also widely used we chose to add its formulation and results to this paper for comparison purposes 4 wave propagation 4 1 test case description the input parameters for the wave generation and propagation simulations were previously used for tests in the basins at marin http www marin nl and dst https www dst org de the wave characteristics were as shown in table 1 following the applicability range defined by lé méhauté 1976 this wave corresponds to a deep water wave that can be modelled with stokes theory for 3rd order or higher in this case the wave was modelled with the 5th order theory following the definitions and implementations by skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 and lin 2008 the wave basin at dst is 60 m long 3 m wide and 2 8 m deep for waves propagating along the basin the water depth had to be reduced to 2 3 m 4 2 numerical setup the two dimensional computational domain for this case possessed the dimensions as specified in table 2 the wave boundary condition was used at inlet and outlet i e the three component velocity vector following a dirichlet condition is given at inlet while the pressure is extrapolated to the boundary and a non reflecting sommerfeld 1949 boundary condition was specified at outlet this frequency equalled the initial theoretical wave frequency the sides were modelled as a symmetry plane hence reflection at the outlet can occur only owing to a frequency change during the wave propagation and to numerical artefacts to reduce the difference between initial and actual wave and to reduce reflections an absorption zone was applied at the beginning and end of the domain the absorption zones were one wave length long thus a distance of three wave lengths was obtained between the inlet and outlet absorption zones the domain including absorption zones wave probe location and refinement boxes is presented in fig 2 4 3 numerical simulations we generated the grids with an unstructured hexahedral grid generator software following also the topology guidelines by rapuc et al 2018 they proposed to refine the grid according to the kinetic wave energy the first refinement box box a covered the wave elevation with a 20 margin above and below the wave the following two boxes box b and c captured 90 and 99 9 of the wave energy respectively in fig 3 the grid is shown stretched by a factor of three in vertical direction for visualisation purposes we generated four different grids with the same topology they are presented in table 3 the time steps studied were defined as a multiple of the wave period t δ t 1 t 280 δ t 2 t 400 δ t 3 t 600 δ t 4 t 800 and δ t 5 t 1200 between each grid and each time step constant refinement ratios were applied this corresponds to the recommendations of the ittc 2008 the theoretical cfl numbers for each calculation are summarised in table 4 cfl numbers below 1 6 are required to be tvd total variation diminishing when using the implicit second order backward scheme for time integration klaij et al 2018 achieving low cfl numbers leads to better iterative convergence 4 4 absorption zones the optimum of body force function f b and size of the absorption coefficient f m a x needed to be found therefore the reflection coefficient c r was taken as a quality measure the reflection coefficient is defined as ursell et al 1960 36 c r h m a x h m i n h m a x h m i n h m a x and h m i n are the largest and smallest wave height respectively for this investigation we took 15 consecutive waves to estimate the reflection coefficient this coefficient was plotted against the absorption coefficient for two different body force functions see fig 4 this figure represents the results of 16 simulations for the cosine and 11 for the exponential function fig 4 shows minima for the reflection coefficient at f m a x 5 for the cosine and at f m a x 15 for the exponential function the cosine function with f m a x 5 showed the lowest wave reflection thus we applied this body force function and coefficient for all wave propagation simulations hereinafter 4 5 wave propagation the wave elevation was recorded with a wave probe located at 2 5 wave lengths from the inflow boundary condition and thus in the centre of the domain fig 2 fig 5 presents the result for the wave elevation the wave elevations of the different simulations agreed well with each other in particular the zero crossings of the signal overlapped for each of the simulations fig 5 shows an overshoot and several non regular waves at the beginning of the simulation after about 10 wave periods the wave profile stabilised and became regular these two phenomena can be explained by the following reasons at the inflow boundary condition the wave kinematics were computed according to stokes 5 th order theory the wave kinematics need to be fully developed in the domain to obtain a regular wave as fluid in the domain was at rest at the beginning of the simulation a couple of wave periods were needed to reach a fully developed stage in addition we implemented a small ramp up function to ensure a smooth start of the simulations this ramp up resulted in small waves in the beginning these small waves propagated slower than the wave phase celerity of the defined wave and were eventually overtaken by the latter then superposition occurred and resulted in larger waves which is presented as an overshoot in the figure the mean and standard deviation of the wave height obtained after 10 wave periods for the finest grid and time step are 0 141463 m 0 000042 m 0 03 4 6 iterative convergence owing to the iterative solution process of the system of algebraic equations residuals remain at the end of each iteration these residuals should decrease up to a predefined convergence criterion or until the predefined maximum number of outer loop iterations is reached most papers targeting cfd topics do not show iterative convergence of the solution however if large residuals remain at the end of a time step they cannot be neglected for the verification study eça and hoekstra 2009 and eça 2016 proposed to achieve a residual level of two orders of magnitude below the discretisation error computational time can also be reduced with fast iterative convergence fig 6 shows the normalised residuals in l 2 and l norm i e the root mean square of all residuals in the domain and the largest residual in the computational domain fig 6 shows results for the smallest grid a and δ t t 1200 the medium grid c and δ t t 600 and the largest theoretical cfl number grid e and δ t t 280 of this test case residuals in l are generally more difficult to converge for capturing schemes than in l 2 norm because errors of order 1 are always present at jumps klaij et al 2018 here the higher residuals are located at the interface between air and water we applied l 10 4 as the convergence criteria for this test case both residual norms were two orders of magnitude below the expected range of the discretisation error the residual convergence was consistent with the wave propagation when the wave reached the outlet boundary and a regular wave was established in the whole computational domain the residual convergence stabilised also at a certain level this level increased with higher cfl numbers 4 7 discretisation error we performed the error and uncertainty estimation for the wave propagation test case on the wave characteristics i e the wave height and period these characteristics were taken from the results recorded by the wave probe monitor and presented in fig 5 because of the irregular wave behaviour at the beginning of the simulation we began the wave analysis when the first 10 waves had passed the observed location the differences in wave period were very small therefore results for the error and uncertainty estimations are presented just for the wave height eça and hoekstra approach we selected different data sets for the approach by eça and hoekstra to show the dependence of the error and uncertainty estimation on the combination of spatial and temporal discretisation fig 7 shows the results for the mean wave height per simulation red dots the fitted plane and an uncertainty bar for the finest grid and time step the results shown in these figures confirm the observation that wave heights fitted well with each other the error and uncertainty estimation following the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 revealed different results for the extrapolated grid and time step independent solution ϕ 0 depending on the selected sets of grids and time steps in each case the same finest solution was taken the results are listed in table 5 depending on the selected data sets a difference of 3 5 for the extrapolated value can be obtained and between 0 3 9 6 for the estimated uncertainty the differences in uncertainty arose owing to scatter in the data this scatter was more pronounced for results of simulations with coarser temporal and spatial resolution for finer spatial resolution however oscillatory convergence was observed eça et al 2019 demonstrated in a recent publication that discretisation errors are not independent from iterative errors as we kept the convergence criteria and number of outer loop iterations constant the influence of the iterative error increased with spatial and temporal discretisation in addition klaij et al 2018 stated that cfd simulations with interface capturing schemes have problems to converge to low levels in l norm because of their step function behaviour at the interface therefore oscillatory convergence in the data cannot be omitted for engineering applications and could be observed for solutions of the finer grids e g for grids c d and e furthermore the free surface should be defined based on kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions instead common procedure also applied in this paper is to define the free surface at a volume fraction of c 0 5 which does not fulfil the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions thus eskilsson et al 2017 took into account a dispersion of volume fraction values the estimated convergence and its order improved the error and uncertainty estimation however lead to increased values which suggest further grid refinement moreover eskilsson et al 2017 performed simulations with at least three times smaller cfl numbers than used in this work smaller cfl numbers also help to converge residuals faster and to lower residual levels which in turn helps to reduce oscillatory convergent behaviour eça et al 2019 these small cfl numbers cfl 0 01 are rather difficult to achieve for the complex simulations of the dynamics of fowts therefore these fine temporal discretisations were not considered in the paper nevertheless these studies show that wave computations with navier stokes equations solvers are difficult and associated with more uncertainties than one might expect comparison the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar requires constant cfl numbers and a constant refinement ratio this was achieved for the grids a c and e with the time steps δ t 1 t 280 δ t 3 t 600 and δ t 5 t 1200 the results showed monotonic convergence and were refined with a refinement factor of r 2 fig 8 presents the results for the oberhagemann and el moctar oem approach compared to the methods by eça and hoekstra eh and xing and stern xs here we used the notation of oberhagemann and el moctar the results of the cfd simulations are indicated with black circles and presented as a function of the non dimensional grid refinement factor ϒ υ the extrapolated values using eq 29 and eq 30 are presented with s1 and s2 respectively as comparison we utilised the results of the method by eça and hoekstra for nine and five solutions which correspond to the data set selected for the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar in addition the results of eça and hoekstra for 20 simulations and of xing and stern are presented as reference fig 8 shows a distribution of the results between 0 14042 and 0 14322 for oberhagemann and el moctar these results are very close to the input wave height of h 0 142 m to the mean wave height extrapolated with 20 solutions using the method by eça and hoekstra h m e a n 0 14193 m and to the result using the formulation by xing and stern h m e a n 0 14147 m the results for the finest grid and time step differ less than 1 2 from s1 and s2 and 0 38 from the input wave height the results of the method by eça and hoekstra with the same grids and time steps revealed larger differences these values are however also within 2 1 from the input wave height the result of xing and stern matches well with the solution of eça and hoekstra for 20 solutions and possesses less conservative values than for eça and hoekstra with 5 and 9 solutions moreover the results of eça and hoekstra were more conservative than of oberhagemann and el moctar and the results became less conservative for estimates with larger amount of solutions the results shown in table 6 present very small error and uncertainty estimates which indicate a converged solution for this test case 4 8 stokes 5 th order the wave investigated followed the stokes 5 th order theory therefore we compared the wave signal recorded by the probe with the analytical solution fig 9 presents this comparison the uncertainty bar represents the discretisation uncertainty for 20 simulations obtained with the approach by eça and hoekstra for h m e a n despite the small uncertainty of 1 the bar overlaps the difference between the analytical and the numerical wave elevation the numerical simulation represented the theoretical input wave for fine spatial and temporal discretisation although line by line comparison seemed very good there were uncertainties and differences that are not negligible and can be quantified 5 wave loads 5 1 test case description the wave loads on vertical surface piercing cylinder test case was also analysed by the oc5 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation consortium robertson et al 2015 using mostly potential flow solvers and by burmester and guérinel 2016 comparing potential flow and viscous flow solvers the test case consisted of a regular wave modelled with stokes 5th order theory the calibration for this case resulted in the wave parameters as summarised in table 7 the vertical cylinder placed as an obstacle in the wave propagation direction had a diameter of d 0 327 m and a draft below the free surface of 1 44 m in the model tests the cylinder was mounted to a carriage above the free surface thus the cylinder was restraint from motions the water depth was 10 m 5 2 numerical setup the computational domain was a three dimensional box and was generated with the dimensions listed in table 8 this domain was defined for one symmetrical half of the cylinder the boundary conditions for inlet top bottom outlet and the symmetry plane were the same as for the previous test case the free side was modelled with a slip wall boundary condition and the cylinder with a no slip condition the former boundary restrains the normal velocities while the latter restrains also those in tangential direction the absorption zones at inlet and outlet were one wave length long the same body force function and absorption coefficient as in the wave propagation test case were selected i e a cosine function with f m a x 5 5 3 numerical simulations in addition to the grid topology guidelines followed in the previous case extra refinement around the cylinder was achieved to capture wave diffraction effects the computational domain and three different perspectives on the grid are shown in fig 10 as shown in these figures the extra refinement boxes resolve the domain at free surface in horizontal directions only we kept the cell sizes in vertical direction constant around the free surface to avoid disturbance of the flow owing to grid refinement then five different grids were generated the grid characteristics are listed in table 9 the cells per wave height and length refer to the outer free surface refinement box thus one refinement level more was obtained in the vicinity and wake and two levels more directly on the surface of the cylinder these grids follow the proposed refinement ratio guideline of the ittc i e r 2 the time steps were defined as a ratio of the wave period t δ t 1 t 400 δ t 2 t 565 δ t 3 t 800 δ t 4 t 1131 δ t 5 t 1600 δ t 6 t 2263 and δ t 7 t 3200 the time steps follow exactly the same refinement ratio as the grids table 10 summarises all simulations and shows their theoretical cfl numbers 5 4 wave load results the results of the wave load test case for 22 simulations are shown in fig 11 the results showed that the loads increase with the level of discretisation certainly the differences between the coarsest and finest grid are very small and are visible only around the maxima and minima this indicates that the influence of the discretisation on the solution is small for the period and important for the wave load peaks 5 5 iterative convergence the residual convergence at the end of each time step is shown for two examples of test case two in fig 12 these two examples represent the simulations with the smallest and largest cfl number the residuals in l 2 norm are presented for each of these examples residuals larger than the results presented in these figures are possible hence the flow solution is analysed and quantified in fig 13 the flow solution presented in fig 13 shows the free surface in light blue and the highest residuals with rainbow colours the residuals were largest for the vertical velocity v z at the free surface at the outlet boundary condition and around the cylinder the residuals in the other control volumes converged below 10 7 and are blanked for visualisation purposes 5 6 discretisation error we employed the mean wave loads to estimate the discretisation error and uncertainty for test case two these loads are a sum of all loads acting on the cylinder in x direction eça and hoekstra approach the approach by eça and hoekstra was also applied using different data sets for this test case the sensitivity on the data set selected can be analysed in this way as a reference solution a result is given for all 22 simulations fig 14 presents the results the results of fig 14 show larger differences between each other than for test case one it can be seen from this figure that the shape of the fitted surface also changed depending on the selected cases the results of the error and uncertainty estimation are summarised in table 11 for this test case a difference of 6 7 for the extrapolated grid and time step independent value of the mean wave load f x was found depending on the data set selected the estimated uncertainty ranges from 3 5 22 7 this value has a larger difference from the estimated error for oscillatory convergent data and is closer to the solution of the finest grid and time step for monotonic convergent data monotonic convergence on the diagonal was achieved for the four results with five and nine grid sets then uncertainties were lower than for oscillatory data we can conclude that scatter in the data and too coarse discretisation penalise the uncertainty u ϕ 5 6 1 oberhagemann and el moctar approach fig 15 shows the results with the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar these are the data sets that produced monotonic convergence ten data sets could be found with monotonic convergent data eight sets are shown in fig 15 the results are also summarised in table 12 the results obtained with the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar for these ten data sets showed a distribution of extrapolated values for ϕ 0 ranging from 613 169 n to 663 282 n this is a difference of about 7 6 apart from two cases the linear method by oberhagemann and el moctar s 1 produced lower results for ϕ 0 than the result including a second order term s 2 the results with the first order term were also closer to the finest grid solution apart from the same two cases therefore the errors presented in table 12 were smaller for the first order than the first plus second order solution the data sets bcd with cfl 0 21 and abc cfl 0 07 are different and result in lower discretisation errors for s 2 these two sets presented results in the asymptotic region then the extrapolation leads to smaller errors as these simulations were conducted with second order approximations the results for s 2 are seen more reliable and taken for comparison with the results using the method by eça and hoekstra 5 6 2 comparison a comparison between the results for the three discretisation error estimation methods was done for this test case fig 16 shows the results the solutions of the grids a b c d and e for cfl numbers between 0 11 and 0 21 are presented in these figures as solid black markers their extrapolated values using five solutions for the method by eça and hoekstra eh 5 or nine eh 9 or 22 eh 22 the corresponding results by oberhagemann and el moctar oem and xing and stern xs are shown for ϒ 0 the results of fig 16 show that the extrapolated values with the method by eça and hoekstra were more conservative than those by oberhagemann and el moctar and both more conservative than xing and stern the solution obtained by eça and hoekstra for 22 simulations was closest to the solution by oberhagemann and el moctar for cfl 0 11 and five grids for this test case the results of xing and stern shown in table 13 revealed very small discretisation errors the uncertainties however are in a similar range as the values estimated using the approach by eça and hoekstra 5 7 validation the aim of such a large study should be to validate the numerical simulations with experimental data experimental data were available from the oc5 study robertson et al 2017 fig 17 shows the comparison of the numerical simulations with experimental data the uncertainty bars plotted in this figure represent the discretisation uncertainty of the finest grid and time step for 22 simulations obtained with eça and hoekstra table 11 no errors and uncertainties of the experiment were available thus no formal validation of the numerical simulations can be done for this test case the time trace and the uncertainty bars presented in fig 17 however showed a good match with the experimental results the mean and standard deviation of the wave loads f x obtained after 10 wave periods for the finest grid and time step were 640 320 n 1 6041 n 0 25 the corresponding values for the experiment for the last 28 waves were 672 108 n 12 9296 n 1 92 the comparison error between the experiment and the numerical simulation 4 96 was also smaller than the discretisation uncertainty for the statistical values 6 surge decay of a semi submersible fowt 6 1 test case description this test case consists of surge decay with the oc5 deepcwind semi submersible floating wind turbine robertson et al 2017 work with the same floater was also published in burmester et al 2017 2018 and robertson et al 2017 we simulated solely the floater geometry but the mass properties of the whole system floater tower nacelle and rotor were used the floater geometry is presented in fig 18 the main particulars of the floating system and the stiffness properties are summarised in table 14 and table 15 respectively the stiffness properties are the diagonal values of the linear mooring restoring matrix a right handed coordinate system was used in this work the x coordinate pointed in forward surge direction the y coordinate in transverse sway direction and the z coordinate vertically upwards heave the system s origin was set to the centre of gravity of the floating structure see table 15 the decay tests were performed with an initial displacement of 0 167 m in surge we performed the computations at model scale with a scaling factor of 50 6 2 numerical setup the computational domain for this test case was modelled as a semi cylinder in such a way that it forms a symmetric half with respect to the x z plane the domain had a total height of h 4 6 m a water depth of d 4 0 m and a radius of r 4 9 m the radius corresponds to six times the characteristic radius of the semi submersible r c 0 8174 m the water depth was adopted from the experiments the computational domain is shown in fig 19 at the bottom and top of the domain a static pressure was prescribed the boundaries of the semi submersible were represented with no slip conditions for the x z plane a symmetry condition was used the curved surface area was modelled as a non reflecting boundary condition of sommerfeld type sommerfeld 1949 in contrast to the previous test cases no waves were generated and therefore no absorption zones were used 6 3 numerical simulations we chose the grid topology in such a way that the cell size reduces towards the semi submersible floater and towards the free surface at the free surface the refinement in vertical direction was kept constant to reduce the amount of hanging nodes in this direction the grid was also refined on the curves and surfaces of the semi submersible the hull above water was refined as much as needed to cover curves and surfaces at critical geometrical points more refinement was needed to capture the contour of the geometry see fig 20 for these grids viscous layer cells were generated to guarantee a non dimensional wall distance value of y m a x 1 5 this goal was achieved regardless of the total grid size the grids used are summarised in table 16 the time steps were defined as a ratio of the oscillation period t 15 5563 s δ t 1 t 3200 δ t 2 t 4800 δ t 3 t 6400 δ t 4 t 8533 δ t 5 t 12800 the simulations are summarised in table 17 with the theoretical cfl numbers obtained there is a set of three grids that can be used for the oberhagemann and el moctar approach in addition results of all 18 simulations are suited for the approach by eça and hoekstra 6 4 hydrodynamic damping in fig 21 the 18 simulations are presented as decaying oscillations in surge over time because the difference of the solutions for different time steps was too small only four different lines can be seen in fig 21 hence the solutions of these simulations were more grid than time step size dependent the difference between the grids increases with progressing simulation time burmester et al 2020 proposed to use an improved pq method based on least squares fitting to analyse the hydrodynamic damping with linear b 1 and quadratic b 2 damping terms the original pq method was published by van der vegt 1984 then the damping function can be defined as 37 b x b 1 x b 2 x x the linear and quadratic damping terms are obtained with 38 b 1 p t n c 2 π 2 b 2 3 q t n 2 c 32 π 2 here the natural period is denoted by t n and the stiffness by c the linear and quadratic damping coefficients p and q are a result of the pq method in which p and q are estimated based on the peaks of a fitted least squares function the peak values are used to plot a new graph as shown in fig 22 b then a line is fitted through these data points this line has an intercept with the ordinate called p and a slope denoted with q p is a dimensionless number and q has the reciprocal of the motion dimension investigated i e 1 m for the surge motion applying this improved pq method to the surge decay time history for nine simulations delivers the results presented in fig 23 fig 23 shows an increase of linear damping for grid coarsening the quadratic damping generally increases for finer spatial resolution and reduces for finer temporal resolution the change of damping for finer spatial and temporal discretisation is a result of the reduced numerical diffusion and the better resolved geometry and viscous effects as presented in burmester et al 2020 linear damping is dominated by wave radiation more spatial refinement leads to better resolved curvatures of the geometry and thus less radiated waves but it resolves vortices and eddies better the former decreases the linear damping and the latter increases the quadratic damping reduced numerical diffusion owing to finer temporal and spatial discretisation decreases the damping as fewer energy is dissipated 6 5 iterative convergence fig 24 shows the iterative convergence at the end of each time step for the simulation with the largest and the smallest theoretical cfl number the result shows convergence below 10 4 for each simulation in l 2 and 10 2 in l norm a finer grid lowers the residual level in l 2 norm higher cfl numbers lead to higher residuals in l norm therefore fig 25 presents a plot to show the residuals for the simulation with the largest cfl number i e grid d with δ t t 3200 the highest residuals were found for the air volume fraction they were in the viscous layer cells at free surface residuals in the range of 10 8 to 10 7 can be found at the outlet boundary condition and around the floater at the height of the free surface as well as at wave fronts and backs thus all other locations converged well below 10 8 this shows that it is important to look into the locations of residual convergence 6 6 discretisation error initially we performed the error and uncertainty estimation for this test case on the linear and quadratic damping coefficients presented in fig 23 applying the method by eça and hoekstra however results in uncertainties of u ϕ 421 7 for p and u ϕ 87 for q for the solution of the finest grid and time step similarly integration to estimate the area enclosed by the surge decay motion graph leads to uncertainties of u ϕ 40 8 the quantities chosen for the estimation of errors and uncertainties need to be as least post processed as possible then the errors and uncertainties obtained are a result of the numerical simulations and not of the post processing technique in the above examples the pq analysis and the trapezoidal rule for integration in itself possess uncertainties which lead to unrealistic error uncertainty estimation therefore we performed the discretisation error estimation on the oscillation range i e the difference between one maximum and the following minimum of one oscillation the differences between the results increase with simulation time 6 6 1 eça and hoekstra approach fig 26 shows the results for different data sets for the second oscillation cycle table 18 summarises the results the form of the fitted plane changes from an almost straight to a curved shape the results for the error and uncertainty estimation scatter as in the previous test cases the extrapolated value differs by 7 3 and the uncertainty lays in a range of 10 to 31 the uncertainties for 18 and 9 data points were larger as the results showed more oscillatory behaviour the result for 12 data sets was obtained with larger temporal discretisation steps the differences of the solutions increased and led to monotonic convergence and therefore smaller uncertainties 6 6 2 comparison there is exactly one data set resulting in constant cfl numbers table 17 fig 27 shows a comparison between the three methods for this set the result of oberhagemann and el moctar oem with linear extrapolation is closer to the grid solutions thus the result with quadratic extrapolation obtained larger errors and is more conservative table 19 presents the results and their errors the three methods produce remarkably similar results for this test case and for the same data set nevertheless the data set selected was not in the asymptotic range consequently the method by xing and stern results in smaller errors than the other two methods see table 20 the uncertainties estimated are higher and fit well to the ones estimated by eça and hoekstra for 18 data points thus the error estimation using the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar and eça and hoekstra yielded more conservative values than the method by xing and stern 6 7 validation model test data was also available for this test case fig 28 presents the comparison of the results for the numerical simulation with finest grid and time step and the experiment the uncertainty bars represent the result for 18 simulations obtained with the method by eça and hoekstra i e u ϕ 31 the differences were large between the experiment and the numerical simulation burmester et al 2020 discussed reasons for the differences in period and motion damping in detail the deviation between experiments and simulations may be owing to the following issues there were differences in the set up between experiment and numerical simulation in the experiments the floater was moored with a catenary mooring line system these lines were towed with the motion of the floater and added drag as well as inertia to the motions of the system for the numerical simulations solely the stiffness of the moorings was accounted for in the linearised restoring matrix in addition the mswt was mounted on top of the floater and a large electrical power cable was connected between turbine tower and carriage the turbine although not rotating added damping to the system owing to the additional resistance of the rotor area and the power cable interacted dynamically with the tower for large motion amplitudes these effects were not considered in the numerical simulations we conducted the numerical simulations for one degree of freedom and omitted the coupling with other degrees of freedom this coupling was present and could be observed in the model tests it adds damping to the system flows around the cylindrical structures of the floater are difficult for two equation rans turbulence models to capture this is highlighted by the results of many cfd simulations of fluid flows around circular cylinders published in the literature in addition the symmetry plane boundary condition in the xz plane suppressed realistic turbulent effects around the front and centre column these reduced turbulent effects influence the quadratic damping of the floater the experiments were not repeated and measurement uncertainties are not known these five points contribute to large differences not associated with the discretisation uncertainty presented in this paper these points are part of the numerical modelling and experimental uncertainty turbulence modelling the symmetry of the domain coupling with other degrees of freedom and mooring modelling will be addressed in another study the experiments were carried out without uncertainty and error assessment consequently no formal validation of the numerical simulations are possible nevertheless the differences between the ends of the uncertainty bar and the presented experimental results are very small 7 conclusion this study investigated the credible simulation of floating wind turbines using cfd the work included the comparison of three methods to estimate the discretisation errors and uncertainties these methods are the approaches developed by eça and hoekstra 2014 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and xing and stern 2010 we tested these methods for three test cases wave propagation in 2d wave loads on a vertical surface piercing circular cylinder and surge decay simulations of a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine details on the numerical settings the computational setup and the iterative convergence were also given in addition we studied the difference of two wave absorption functions and found their optimum finally we compared the results of each test case either to the analytical solution test case one or to available experimental data these three test cases are different problems for the simulation of the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines see fig 1 the step by step approach with increasing complexity in the test cases and the comparison of three different methods to estimate the discretisation error provide a way towards increased credibility for the numerical simulation of engineering problems specifically fowts in total we computed 94 cfd simulations for the three test cases including the studies on wave absorption the total computational time for the simulations was between 3 h for the coarsest grid and time step of the wave propagation test case 1 3 s per time step and core using a single core on a local workstation intel xeon cpu e3 1270v5 with 3 60 ghz 31 2 gb of memory to 17 days for the finest grid and time step of the surge decay test case using 320 cores 0 06 s per time step and core on a high performance computing hpc cluster intel e5 2650v4 broadwell cpus with 2 20 ghz from this extensive study we can draw the following conclusions the first two test cases were very close to the analytical and experimental result 0 4 and 4 96 respectively the last test had large differences of 37 3 this was caused by errors owing to mooring modelling symmetry of the computational domain neglected aerodynamic damping of the turbine and tower restriction in the degrees of freedom not considered electrical power cable and uncertainties of the experiments etc more details on this topic were given in burmester et al 2020 the three techniques showed consistent output for the three different test cases the difference of the extrapolated grid and time step independent solutions for the different methods was always in the range of less than 10 in accordance with burmester et al 2020 we recommend to use as little post processing as possible of the quantities chosen for the discretisation error and or uncertainty estimation this reduces the uncertainties introduced by the post processing technique for most of the data sets the method by eça and hoekstra resulted in more conservative larger discretisation errors than the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar and both were larger than the results using the formulation by xing and stern in addition the uncertainty estimation by eça and hoekstra takes scatter in the data into account the technique by eça and hoekstra however requires at least five solutions to estimate an error while the methods of oberhagemann and el moctar and of xing and stern can yield reliable estimates with three solutions once the data is monotonic convergent the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar is less robust for more data against scatter and if the results are non monotonic nevertheless this method is faster and reduces computational costs additionally to the discretisation errors the approaches by eça and hoekstra and xing and stern provide uncertainty estimates the uncertainty estimates of xing and stern rely on just three solutions but yield similar results compared with the results of the formulation by eça and hoekstra experimental data including errors and uncertainties are important to formally perform validation errors and uncertainties for model test data are seldom provided and were not available here nevertheless the uncertainty bars for the solution with the finest grid and time step overlapped the experimental result for test case two and were very close to the physical result for test case three the results for errors and uncertainties of test case one also overlapped the analytical solution future work needs to include experiments with estimated errors and uncertainties to formally validate the numerical simulations moreover modelling errors owing to turbulence modelling symmetry of the domain and moorings require quantification statistical errors and iterative errors also need to be assessed to obtain a total computational error finally the aero hydrodynamic interaction for wind and wave excitation requires verification and validation to complete the assessment of cfd credibility for floating wind turbines credit authorship contribution statement simon burmester conceptualization

21764,the credibility in the results needs to be demonstrated in order to be able to use computational fluid dynamics cfd as an engineering tool this may be obtained by sufficient verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification this study investigates how to perform credible cfd simulations of floating offshore wind turbines fowts three methods to estimate discretisation errors were compared for three different problems related to fowts wave propagation in 2d wave loads on a circular cylinder and surge decay of a semi submersible fowt the three discretisation error estimation methods are a least squares formulation using the observed order of convergence in combination with a data quality measure for different spatial and temporal refinement another least squares fit method using the theoretical order of convergence for constant courant number grid refinement studies and the factor of safety method applying a ratio between observed and theoretical order of convergence we compared the final results to an analytical solution of the 2d wave signal and to experimental data for the wave loads and surge decay motions for validation purposes the results of this work show the advantages and disadvantages of the three error estimation methods the uncertainty bars for the discretisation uncertainty of the numerical simulations were mostly larger than the comparison error with the model test data and analytical solution keywords computational fluid dynamics verification validation floating offshore wind error uncertainty 1 introduction nowadays performing computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations is no longer an achievement in fact engineers and scientists can compute very complex maritime flow problems with a wide range of cfd solvers available for instance beyer et al 2015 quallen et al 2014 bozonnet and emery 2015 and burmester et al 2017 2020 conducted detailed investigations on the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines in these studies the researchers first investigated the usage and then different effects design considerations moorings etc on the dynamic behaviour of the floater moreover simulations of the whole floating offshore wind turbine with rotating rotor moving floater elastic deformations and dynamic moorings in wind and waves are possible by coupling cfd with other tools see e g tran and kim 2016 liu et al 2017 and liu and xiao 2019 the semi submersible floating wind turbine used in these studies is the oc4 offshore code comparison collaboration continued deepcwind semi submersible robertson et al 2014 combined with nrel s 5 mw baseline turbine jonkman et al 2009 thus these authors performed the simulations at full scale they demonstrated to be able to simulate a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers by comparing the results to standard engineering codes widely used in the industry the engineering tools were based on potential flow lumped mass and blade element momentum theory bemt approaches in their publications these authors showed aerodynamic hydrodynamic and structural results with good agreements the use of cfd as an engineering tool however requires verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification these studies need to be conducted for all relevant flow parameters thus for fowts this includes amongst others lift and drag on the wind turbine blades deformation of and loads on the structure motions of the floater wave propagation and mooring line forces see fig 1 the sensitivity to different numerical schemes turbulence models and the coupling with different models tools such as mooring models or structural deformation and rigid body motion solvers also need to be studied in order to achieve confidence and credibility full scale simulations of floating wind turbines are needed for the design prediction of dynamic behaviour and power output nevertheless model scale experiments of floating wind turbines help to understand the complex dynamic behaviour of these structures model test data also permit validation of numerical simulations and engineering models if errors and uncertainties of the model tests are available for validation with model test data the numerical simulations and engineering models need to be performed at model scale the physics and appropriate numerical models however are dissimilar to full scale in terms of prediction of viscous effects cfd and engineering models also behave differently between model and full scale because the well known reynolds froude dissimilarity is very problematic for scaled floating wind turbines gueydon and fernandes 2013 research institutes try to find work around solutions by either coupling a numerical code with the experiment in real time see e g sauder et al 2016 bayati et al 2018 or by performance matching of the turbine de ridder et al 2014 in the latter case the objective is to develop a new wind turbine that matches the performance characteristics of the full scale turbine when applying froude scaled conditions in model test basins the collaboration between marin and the university of maine resulted in the so called marin stock wind turbine mswt see e g de ridder et al 2014 martin et al 2012 make and vaz 2015 and burmester et al 2016 this turbine represents the performance coefficients of the nrel 5 mw turbine at full scale robertson et al 2017 used model test data of this turbine mounted on the oc5 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation deepcwind semi submersible for an extensive code comparison study then burmester et al 2017 2020 computed several surge decay simulations of this semi submersible floating system using cfd to analyse the effects of different numerical parameters on the flow characteristics and the hydrodynamic damping because of the possibility to conduct these complex numerical simulations and to improve their quality the credibility of such simulations has become more important for engineering designs credibility in the solution may be obtained by sufficient verification and validation studies involving error and uncertainty quantification the authors of papers with such complex cfd problems choose to use different methods to gain confidence in their solutions these methods range from showing convergence of the time traces of a given quantity to comparing results with experimental data or other widely used numerical tools to full estimation of errors and uncertainties see e g burmester et al 2020 make and vaz 2015 and wang et al 2018 there are several kinds of numerical errors ferziger and perić 2002 they can be distinguished in modelling discretisation iterative input statistical and round off errors for validation purposes the modelling errors unlike for verification the discretisation iteration and round off errors are the important quantities for unsteady flows the statistical errors are also important in order to validate a numerical solution the quantification of numerical and experimental errors owing to setup measurement repeatability input parameters and the computational errors is required to quantify these errors there are several methods available such as ittc 2008 asme 2009 aiaa 1998 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 eça and hoekstra 2014 brouwer et al 2015 xing and stern 2010 the guidelines of the ittc international towing tank conference asme american society of mechanical engineers and aiaa american institute of aeronautics and astronautics are generally accepted and have been extended by xing and stern 2010 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and eça and hoekstra 2014 the latter three use richardson extrapolation to estimate discretisation errors and uncertainties several researchers have applied these methods successfully for maritime flow problems however no researcher performed direct comparison of these techniques to analyse their advantages and disadvantages and to assess the uncertainties in these methods the work presented here follows the schematic in fig 1 aiming to analyse the ingredients towards a full elastic aero hydrodynamic fowt model with verification and validation techniques make and vaz 2015 already quantified errors and uncertainties for aerodynamic simulations of the mswt hence this study is focused on the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines it addresses different problems related to fowts such as wave propagation wave loads and rigid body motions of a semi submersible floater there are many different verification and validation procedures each having a different level of accuracy therefore we applied two methods to estimate discretisation errors and uncertainties in order to assess the differences between these methods the two discretisation error estimation techniques are the approaches by eça and hoekstra 2014 and by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 for comparison purposes we added the formulation proposed by xing and stern 2010 the test cases include free surface wave and turbulence modelling as well as coupling with a rigid body motion solver these cases started simple and increased in complexity the assessment of numerical errors allows solution verification to be performed for validation purposes we compared the wave load and rigid body motion results with experimental data these steps including solution verification as well as validation of the results improve confidence in and credibility of the results the paper starts with an introduction to the numerical methods theoretical background on numerical errors and the three discretisation error methods follow in the third section sections four five and six describe the test cases their specific settings verification studies and validation results the paper ends with conclusions and perspectives for future work 2 numerical methods we performed the numerical simulations with community based open source cfd code refresco http www refresco org vaz et al 2009 the code solves multiphase unsteady incompressible viscous flows using the navier stokes equations 2 1 governing equations the definition of the continuity and momentum navier stokes equation for newtonian and incompressible flows is as follows klaij et al 2018 moukalled et al 2016 1 ρ v 0 2 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g here v denotes the velocity vector ρ the density t the time and p the pressure the only body force considered is owing to the gravity vector g τ is the viscous part of the stress tensor and reads 3 τ μ v v t the superscript t represents the transpose and μ the dynamic viscosity turbulence models and volume fraction transport equations for different phases complement these equations vaz et al 2009 we used the volume of fluid vof method to model the free surface klaij et al 2018 this method models the multiphase flow by adopting a single continuum fluid in which the density ρ and viscosity μ can vary in space and time the following equation gives the density and viscosity for two different phases water and air 4 ρ ρ a c 1 c ρ w μ μ a c 1 c μ w the subscript w and a represent the material properties of water and air respectively c denotes the volume fraction and ranges from c 0 to c 1 a value of c 0 means that the cell is filled entirely by water and c 1 entirely by air consequently we term c also air volume fraction the volume fraction transport equation reads 5 c t c v 0 the discretisation of the equations follows a finite volume approach with cell centred collocated variables in strong conservation form implicit time discretisation and picard linearisation for the non linear terms are used iterative solvers are applied for the resulting linear system of equations gmres and or cg with block jacobi preconditioning the normalised residuals are equivalent to solution changes in a simple jacobi iteration a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm ensures mass conservation klaij and vuik 2013 the parallelisation of the code utilises the mpi message passing interface library the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces and if needed h refinement hanging nodes 2 2 free surface and wave setup several interface capturing schemes are available for the discretisation of the convection term of the volume fraction transport equation for the wave load on cylinder test case refrics refresco s interface capturing scheme klaij et al 2018 and hric high resolution interface capturing muzaferija et al 1999 showed very similar results in terms of iterative convergence computing time free surface representation wave propagation and wave loads these two schemes were significantly more accurate than quick quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics ferziger and perić 2002 and superbee roe 1985 therefore refrics was used in the three test cases the two test cases with wave generation utilised absorption zones also called damping zones or sponge layers in the literature perić and abdel maksoud 2016 at beginning and end of the computational domain to reduce the difference between initial and actual wave the absorption zone methods can be traced back to israeli and orszag 1981 the method used here is comparable to the method proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2018 however it differs to the latter method by omitted body force functions in the volume fraction transport equation which was found unnecessary by rapuc et al 2018 the momentum equation with added source term q may be written as 6 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g q the source term q follows a body force function f b in a plane in gravity direction 7 q i ρ f b u ˆ i u i u i are the cartesian components of the velocity vector the theoretical initial wave orbital velocity components are given by u ˆ i the body force function follows either a cosine or an exponential behaviour 8 f b 1 t r e f f m a x 1 cos π x b 2 9 f b 1 t r e f f m a x e x b 3 5 1 e 1 1 t r e f is a reference period typically equal to the wave period the body force function f b is valid between two predefined ellipses perpendicular to the gravity inside the inner ellipse the body force function is zero the inner ellipse gives the starting point for x b f b is constant outside of the outer ellipse the form of the ellipses can be changed from circular to rectangular if the distance between the two ellipses is related to the wave length f m a x can be considered independent of the wave period rapuc et al 2018 2 3 turbulence modelling the reynolds averaged form of the navier stokes equations was used for the test cases i e the time dependent quantities are replaced by a mean field and a statistical fluctuation quantity owing to turbulence these quantities are v and v for the momentum equation respectively then there arise the reynolds stresses ρ v v that can be calculated by the boussinesq approximation for linear eddy viscosity based turbulence models the missing eddy turbulent viscosity μ t and the turbulent kinetic energy k are a result of rans turbulence models for test case three the kskl k k l turbulence model was applied as described in menter and egorov 2010 this model showed advantage in convergence of the residuals for free surface applications and less unrealistic eddy viscosity compared to the k ω shear stress transport turbulence model sst 2003 by menter et al 2003 the solutions of the test cases with wave propagation and wave loads are pressure dominated for these test cases no turbulence model was applied as the viscous effects are negligible burmester and guérinel 2016 2 4 equation of motion solver the simulations for test case three also applied moving grids with a moving grid formulation i e the unsteady rans equations were written and solved in the earth fixed reference frame and the complete grid was able to translate and rotate coupling with structural equations of motion was done for this test case the equations of motion for a rigid body enable the description of this body s attitude to external loads rosetti and vaz 2017 the considered external loads are the hydrodynamic force f h the restoring force f c and the linear viscous mechanical damping force f d with a state vector for six degrees of freedom r x g y g z g ϕ g θ g ψ g t the dynamic equations are written as rosetti 2015 10 m r f h f c f d with f c c r and f d d r in this equation m denotes the mass d the damping and c the stiffness matrix the matrices are positive and diagonal as the body was assumed totally rigid the mechanical damping matrix was set to zero together these equations form a second order non linear initial value problem the problem is non linear because the hydrodynamic forces f h keep a non linear relation with r via the navier stokes equations we used a semi implicit coupled scheme to avoid numerical instabilities owing to low mass ratios and added mass constraints the scheme is based on the predictor corrector second order adams bashforth moulton scheme in which the communication between flow solution and rigid body system is done at the time loop level with the predictor and at the outer loop level with an iterative corrector step at each 10 th outer iteration more details on this procedure may be found in rosetti and vaz 2017 and rosetti 2015 3 numerical errors errors and uncertainties occur in numerical simulations their quantification are both part of validation and verification according to roache 2009 verification checks whether the equations are solved in a right way and validation whether the right equations are being solved verification is a mathematical exercise composed of code and solution verification code verification means to demonstrate that a computer code contains the correct implementation of the system of equations error and or uncertainty estimation of a numerical simulation for a case in which the exact solution is not known is part of solution verification one needs to conduct code verification before solution verification usually developers perform code verification and users need to focus on solution verification validation is an engineering activity to estimate the modelling error uncertainty it requires experimental data and should be done after solution verification validation is applied to the mathematical model and done for selected flow quantities eça et al 2016 it also requires the experimental errors uncertainties there are several kinds of numerical errors ferziger and perić 2002 they can be distinguished in modelling ϵ m discretisation ϵ d iterative ϵ i t input ϵ i and round off errors ϵ r o then the total computational error ϵ t of a quantity reads 11 ϵ t ϵ m ϵ i ϵ n s where the numerical simulation error ϵ n s follows as 12 ϵ n s ϵ i t ϵ r o ϵ d ϵ s t for validation purposes the modelling errors unlike for verification the numerical simulation errors are the important quantities the modelling error defines the difference between the numerical and exact solution of the mathematical model the round off error describes the difference between the calculated approximation of a number and its exact mathematical value in calculations with double precision dp i e 12 digits the round off error may be neglected the discretisation error denotes the difference between the exact solution of the conservation equations and the exact solution of the algebraic system of equations obtained by their discretisation spatial and temporal the iterative error is the difference between the iterative and exact solutions of the system of algebraic equations the residual level obtained controls the iterative error for residual levels of two orders of magnitude below the discretisation error the iterative error can be considered small enough so that the discretisation error follows as major source of numerical errors eça and hoekstra 2009 the input error arises because of differences between the physical and numerical problem such as insufficient experimental information or large numerical demands for unsteady flow problems the statistical errors ϵ s t are also important this error originates because of the finite length of the test domains and the duration of simulation time this uncertainty could be reduced by repeated simulations and averaging the results however reliable error estimates are needed for engineering approaches brouwer et al 2015 3 1 definition of errors and uncertainties the difference between the solution of a given quantity ϕ i and its exact value ϕ 0 defines the error δ mathematically 13 δ ϕ i ϕ 0 uncertainties give an interval around the exact solution this interval contains the exact solution with a certain degree of confidence the uncertainty u ϕ i is defined as 14 ϕ i u ϕ i ϕ 0 ϕ i u ϕ i eq 13 is the starting point for the estimation of the discretisation error uncertainty moreover we need to quantify the convergence of a quantity the type of convergence defines the error estimation method with three solutions the convergence ratio r can be estimated with 15 r ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 the input parameters ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 correspond to solutions with fine medium and coarse grid spacing respectively ittc 2008 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 eça and hoekstra 2014 present the convergence conditions as monotonic convergence 0 r 1 monotonic divergence r 1 oscillatory convergence r 0 and r 1 oscillatory divergence r 0 and r 1 3 2 approach by eça and hoekstra 2014 using richardson extrapolation as proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 extends eq 13 to 16 ϵ d δ r e ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p here p denotes the observed order of convergence h the relative grid spacing and α a constant related with the error level the relative grid spacing h i of a given grid depends on the typical grid spacing δ x i there are three unknowns in eq 16 i e at least three solutions ϕ i are needed to estimate the error for unstructured grids as used in this study the relative and typical grid spacing are estimated by eça 2016 17 δ x i 1 n c e l l s i 1 n d h i δ x i δ x 1 n c e l l s i is the number of cells of grid i and n d stands for the dimension of space i e n d 3 for three dimensional simulations the subscript 1 denotes the solution of the finest grid and time step for unsteady calculations both spatial and temporal discretisation play a role therefore eq 16 can be extended to 18 δ r e ϕ i ϕ 0 α x h i p x α t t i p t the subscripts x and t stand for space and time dependent values t i is the relative time step and is estimated with 19 t i δ t i δ t 1 n t 1 n t i the number of time steps for a certain time interval is denoted by n t i for a given simulation and δ t i the corresponding time step size thus the finest grid and time step are represented with h 1 1 and t 1 1 in eq 18 there are five unknowns i e at least five solutions for monotonic convergent data are required to solve this equation for simplification eq 16 for steady simulations is used to explain the procedure for the error and uncertainty estimation by eça and hoekstra 2014 if eq 16 does not deliver reliable or even impossible output then three other error estimators can be used i e the observed order of grid convergence p is either very small or very large the three estimators are 20 δ 1 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i 21 δ 2 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i 2 and 22 δ 12 ϕ i ϕ 0 α 1 h i α 2 h i 2 while eq 20 and eq 21 are suitable for monotonic converging solutions eq 21 can be applied also to non monotonic converging data three simulations are deemed not reliable since the error estimation with richardson extrapolation depends highly on the observed order of convergence p the equations might be ill conditioned for small data ranges the data can contain noise and the grids can be dissimilar consequently eça and hoekstra 2014 recommend to use at least one grid more than unknowns so the error estimation can be done in a least squares sense as an example just the least squares formulation for eq 16 is regarded the same as for eq 20 eq 21 and eq 22 ϕ 0 is determined from the minimum of the function 23 s r e w ϕ 0 α p i 1 n g w i ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 the least squares are summed over the number of grids n g the procedure can be weighted with w i in case more weight should be given to the finer grid solutions otherwise the weights w i equal 1 for all grids in addition the standard deviations are defined with 24 σ r e w i 1 n g n g w i ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 n g 3 in case of a non weighted approach n g w i is replaced by n g w i 1 once the error estimation is completed the uncertainty can be obtained therefore a safety factor is chosen according to roache 2009 this safety factor is f s 1 25 for a reliable error estimate and f s 3 otherwise the uncertainty estimation has three components the absolute value of the discretisation error times a safety factor the standard deviation of the fit and the absolute difference of the real data point ϕ i and the value obtained from the fit for the same grid density ϕ f i t more details may be found in eça and hoekstra 2014 this method is implemented in a tool and available on http www refresco org this tool was used in the work of this paper 3 3 approach by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 also published in oberhagemann 2016 requires uniform refinement in all spatial dimensions as well as time to achieve constant courant numbers for one dimension the cfl courant number is defined as 25 cfl u i δ t δ x i here the particle velocity in component notation is denoted by u i the time step by δ t and the grid spacing by δ x i oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 propose to use a taylor series expansion similar to eq 22 a non dimensional scalar grid refinement ratio υ is defined with 26 υ i 1 2 δ x i δ x 1 2 δ y i δ y 1 2 1 2 1 r x 2 i 1 1 r y 2 i 1 the spacing for a reference grid is indicated with subscript 1 potentially it is possible to refine the grid differently per spatial direction accordingly υ consists of δ x and δ y as the grid spacing in x and y respectively the individual refinement factors are defined with 27 r x δ x i 1 δ x i and r y δ y i 1 δ y i contrary to eça and hoekstra oberhagemann and el moctar define the coarse grid as the reference grid then the discretisation error δ d is estimated with 28 ϵ d δ d ϕ i ϕ 0 a 1 υ i a 2 υ i 2 the truncation of this polynomial should be chosen so that the expected order of grid convergence can be replicated oberhagemann 2016 again for each unknown at least one grid solution is needed i e for second order approximations a minimum of three grids are required in case of scatter in the data the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar follows the proposed least squares minimisation by eça and hoekstra 2014 e g 29 s 1 ϕ 0 a i 1 n g ϕ i ϕ 0 a υ i 2 for first order convergence and 30 s 2 ϕ 0 a 1 a 2 i 1 n g ϕ i ϕ 0 a 1 υ i a 2 υ i 2 2 for second order grid convergence more details may be found in oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and oberhagemann 2016 3 4 approach by xing and stern 2010 the approach by xing and stern 2010 is applied also to the cases chosen for the method by oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 xing and stern 2010 name this approach factors of safety fs method the observed order of convergence follows from 31 p r e ln ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ln r in accordance with eça and hoekstra xing and stern 2010 define the fine grid as the reference grid thus ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 denote the fine medium and coarse grid solutions with the grid spacing δ x i the refinement factor r reads 32 r δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 following the ittc 2008 guidelines the error estimate is defined as 33 δ r e ϕ 2 ϕ 1 r p r e 1 xing and stern 2010 however recommend to multiply δ r e with the ratio of convergence p 34 p p r e p t h p gives the ratio between the observed order of convergence p r e and the theoretical order of convergence p t h limited by the discretisation schemes a p value of close to 1 i e p r e p t h represents grids in the asymptotic region following the work of phillips and roy 2014 we limited the minimum observed order of accuracy to p r e 0 5 the new error estimate becomes ϵ d p δ r e this error estimate takes into account the distance to the asymptotic region then the discretisation uncertainty is given by xing and stern 2010 35 u f s f s p δ r e 2 45 0 85 p δ r e 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ r e p 1 a set of three grids is required to solve the errors and uncertainties using this method as this approach is also widely used we chose to add its formulation and results to this paper for comparison purposes 4 wave propagation 4 1 test case description the input parameters for the wave generation and propagation simulations were previously used for tests in the basins at marin http www marin nl and dst https www dst org de the wave characteristics were as shown in table 1 following the applicability range defined by lé méhauté 1976 this wave corresponds to a deep water wave that can be modelled with stokes theory for 3rd order or higher in this case the wave was modelled with the 5th order theory following the definitions and implementations by skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 and lin 2008 the wave basin at dst is 60 m long 3 m wide and 2 8 m deep for waves propagating along the basin the water depth had to be reduced to 2 3 m 4 2 numerical setup the two dimensional computational domain for this case possessed the dimensions as specified in table 2 the wave boundary condition was used at inlet and outlet i e the three component velocity vector following a dirichlet condition is given at inlet while the pressure is extrapolated to the boundary and a non reflecting sommerfeld 1949 boundary condition was specified at outlet this frequency equalled the initial theoretical wave frequency the sides were modelled as a symmetry plane hence reflection at the outlet can occur only owing to a frequency change during the wave propagation and to numerical artefacts to reduce the difference between initial and actual wave and to reduce reflections an absorption zone was applied at the beginning and end of the domain the absorption zones were one wave length long thus a distance of three wave lengths was obtained between the inlet and outlet absorption zones the domain including absorption zones wave probe location and refinement boxes is presented in fig 2 4 3 numerical simulations we generated the grids with an unstructured hexahedral grid generator software following also the topology guidelines by rapuc et al 2018 they proposed to refine the grid according to the kinetic wave energy the first refinement box box a covered the wave elevation with a 20 margin above and below the wave the following two boxes box b and c captured 90 and 99 9 of the wave energy respectively in fig 3 the grid is shown stretched by a factor of three in vertical direction for visualisation purposes we generated four different grids with the same topology they are presented in table 3 the time steps studied were defined as a multiple of the wave period t δ t 1 t 280 δ t 2 t 400 δ t 3 t 600 δ t 4 t 800 and δ t 5 t 1200 between each grid and each time step constant refinement ratios were applied this corresponds to the recommendations of the ittc 2008 the theoretical cfl numbers for each calculation are summarised in table 4 cfl numbers below 1 6 are required to be tvd total variation diminishing when using the implicit second order backward scheme for time integration klaij et al 2018 achieving low cfl numbers leads to better iterative convergence 4 4 absorption zones the optimum of body force function f b and size of the absorption coefficient f m a x needed to be found therefore the reflection coefficient c r was taken as a quality measure the reflection coefficient is defined as ursell et al 1960 36 c r h m a x h m i n h m a x h m i n h m a x and h m i n are the largest and smallest wave height respectively for this investigation we took 15 consecutive waves to estimate the reflection coefficient this coefficient was plotted against the absorption coefficient for two different body force functions see fig 4 this figure represents the results of 16 simulations for the cosine and 11 for the exponential function fig 4 shows minima for the reflection coefficient at f m a x 5 for the cosine and at f m a x 15 for the exponential function the cosine function with f m a x 5 showed the lowest wave reflection thus we applied this body force function and coefficient for all wave propagation simulations hereinafter 4 5 wave propagation the wave elevation was recorded with a wave probe located at 2 5 wave lengths from the inflow boundary condition and thus in the centre of the domain fig 2 fig 5 presents the result for the wave elevation the wave elevations of the different simulations agreed well with each other in particular the zero crossings of the signal overlapped for each of the simulations fig 5 shows an overshoot and several non regular waves at the beginning of the simulation after about 10 wave periods the wave profile stabilised and became regular these two phenomena can be explained by the following reasons at the inflow boundary condition the wave kinematics were computed according to stokes 5 th order theory the wave kinematics need to be fully developed in the domain to obtain a regular wave as fluid in the domain was at rest at the beginning of the simulation a couple of wave periods were needed to reach a fully developed stage in addition we implemented a small ramp up function to ensure a smooth start of the simulations this ramp up resulted in small waves in the beginning these small waves propagated slower than the wave phase celerity of the defined wave and were eventually overtaken by the latter then superposition occurred and resulted in larger waves which is presented as an overshoot in the figure the mean and standard deviation of the wave height obtained after 10 wave periods for the finest grid and time step are 0 141463 m 0 000042 m 0 03 4 6 iterative convergence owing to the iterative solution process of the system of algebraic equations residuals remain at the end of each iteration these residuals should decrease up to a predefined convergence criterion or until the predefined maximum number of outer loop iterations is reached most papers targeting cfd topics do not show iterative convergence of the solution however if large residuals remain at the end of a time step they cannot be neglected for the verification study eça and hoekstra 2009 and eça 2016 proposed to achieve a residual level of two orders of magnitude below the discretisation error computational time can also be reduced with fast iterative convergence fig 6 shows the normalised residuals in l 2 and l norm i e the root mean square of all residuals in the domain and the largest residual in the computational domain fig 6 shows results for the smallest grid a and δ t t 1200 the medium grid c and δ t t 600 and the largest theoretical cfl number grid e and δ t t 280 of this test case residuals in l are generally more difficult to converge for capturing schemes than in l 2 norm because errors of order 1 are always present at jumps klaij et al 2018 here the higher residuals are located at the interface between air and water we applied l 10 4 as the convergence criteria for this test case both residual norms were two orders of magnitude below the expected range of the discretisation error the residual convergence was consistent with the wave propagation when the wave reached the outlet boundary and a regular wave was established in the whole computational domain the residual convergence stabilised also at a certain level this level increased with higher cfl numbers 4 7 discretisation error we performed the error and uncertainty estimation for the wave propagation test case on the wave characteristics i e the wave height and period these characteristics were taken from the results recorded by the wave probe monitor and presented in fig 5 because of the irregular wave behaviour at the beginning of the simulation we began the wave analysis when the first 10 waves had passed the observed location the differences in wave period were very small therefore results for the error and uncertainty estimations are presented just for the wave height eça and hoekstra approach we selected different data sets for the approach by eça and hoekstra to show the dependence of the error and uncertainty estimation on the combination of spatial and temporal discretisation fig 7 shows the results for the mean wave height per simulation red dots the fitted plane and an uncertainty bar for the finest grid and time step the results shown in these figures confirm the observation that wave heights fitted well with each other the error and uncertainty estimation following the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 revealed different results for the extrapolated grid and time step independent solution ϕ 0 depending on the selected sets of grids and time steps in each case the same finest solution was taken the results are listed in table 5 depending on the selected data sets a difference of 3 5 for the extrapolated value can be obtained and between 0 3 9 6 for the estimated uncertainty the differences in uncertainty arose owing to scatter in the data this scatter was more pronounced for results of simulations with coarser temporal and spatial resolution for finer spatial resolution however oscillatory convergence was observed eça et al 2019 demonstrated in a recent publication that discretisation errors are not independent from iterative errors as we kept the convergence criteria and number of outer loop iterations constant the influence of the iterative error increased with spatial and temporal discretisation in addition klaij et al 2018 stated that cfd simulations with interface capturing schemes have problems to converge to low levels in l norm because of their step function behaviour at the interface therefore oscillatory convergence in the data cannot be omitted for engineering applications and could be observed for solutions of the finer grids e g for grids c d and e furthermore the free surface should be defined based on kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions instead common procedure also applied in this paper is to define the free surface at a volume fraction of c 0 5 which does not fulfil the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions thus eskilsson et al 2017 took into account a dispersion of volume fraction values the estimated convergence and its order improved the error and uncertainty estimation however lead to increased values which suggest further grid refinement moreover eskilsson et al 2017 performed simulations with at least three times smaller cfl numbers than used in this work smaller cfl numbers also help to converge residuals faster and to lower residual levels which in turn helps to reduce oscillatory convergent behaviour eça et al 2019 these small cfl numbers cfl 0 01 are rather difficult to achieve for the complex simulations of the dynamics of fowts therefore these fine temporal discretisations were not considered in the paper nevertheless these studies show that wave computations with navier stokes equations solvers are difficult and associated with more uncertainties than one might expect comparison the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar requires constant cfl numbers and a constant refinement ratio this was achieved for the grids a c and e with the time steps δ t 1 t 280 δ t 3 t 600 and δ t 5 t 1200 the results showed monotonic convergence and were refined with a refinement factor of r 2 fig 8 presents the results for the oberhagemann and el moctar oem approach compared to the methods by eça and hoekstra eh and xing and stern xs here we used the notation of oberhagemann and el moctar the results of the cfd simulations are indicated with black circles and presented as a function of the non dimensional grid refinement factor ϒ υ the extrapolated values using eq 29 and eq 30 are presented with s1 and s2 respectively as comparison we utilised the results of the method by eça and hoekstra for nine and five solutions which correspond to the data set selected for the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar in addition the results of eça and hoekstra for 20 simulations and of xing and stern are presented as reference fig 8 shows a distribution of the results between 0 14042 and 0 14322 for oberhagemann and el moctar these results are very close to the input wave height of h 0 142 m to the mean wave height extrapolated with 20 solutions using the method by eça and hoekstra h m e a n 0 14193 m and to the result using the formulation by xing and stern h m e a n 0 14147 m the results for the finest grid and time step differ less than 1 2 from s1 and s2 and 0 38 from the input wave height the results of the method by eça and hoekstra with the same grids and time steps revealed larger differences these values are however also within 2 1 from the input wave height the result of xing and stern matches well with the solution of eça and hoekstra for 20 solutions and possesses less conservative values than for eça and hoekstra with 5 and 9 solutions moreover the results of eça and hoekstra were more conservative than of oberhagemann and el moctar and the results became less conservative for estimates with larger amount of solutions the results shown in table 6 present very small error and uncertainty estimates which indicate a converged solution for this test case 4 8 stokes 5 th order the wave investigated followed the stokes 5 th order theory therefore we compared the wave signal recorded by the probe with the analytical solution fig 9 presents this comparison the uncertainty bar represents the discretisation uncertainty for 20 simulations obtained with the approach by eça and hoekstra for h m e a n despite the small uncertainty of 1 the bar overlaps the difference between the analytical and the numerical wave elevation the numerical simulation represented the theoretical input wave for fine spatial and temporal discretisation although line by line comparison seemed very good there were uncertainties and differences that are not negligible and can be quantified 5 wave loads 5 1 test case description the wave loads on vertical surface piercing cylinder test case was also analysed by the oc5 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation consortium robertson et al 2015 using mostly potential flow solvers and by burmester and guérinel 2016 comparing potential flow and viscous flow solvers the test case consisted of a regular wave modelled with stokes 5th order theory the calibration for this case resulted in the wave parameters as summarised in table 7 the vertical cylinder placed as an obstacle in the wave propagation direction had a diameter of d 0 327 m and a draft below the free surface of 1 44 m in the model tests the cylinder was mounted to a carriage above the free surface thus the cylinder was restraint from motions the water depth was 10 m 5 2 numerical setup the computational domain was a three dimensional box and was generated with the dimensions listed in table 8 this domain was defined for one symmetrical half of the cylinder the boundary conditions for inlet top bottom outlet and the symmetry plane were the same as for the previous test case the free side was modelled with a slip wall boundary condition and the cylinder with a no slip condition the former boundary restrains the normal velocities while the latter restrains also those in tangential direction the absorption zones at inlet and outlet were one wave length long the same body force function and absorption coefficient as in the wave propagation test case were selected i e a cosine function with f m a x 5 5 3 numerical simulations in addition to the grid topology guidelines followed in the previous case extra refinement around the cylinder was achieved to capture wave diffraction effects the computational domain and three different perspectives on the grid are shown in fig 10 as shown in these figures the extra refinement boxes resolve the domain at free surface in horizontal directions only we kept the cell sizes in vertical direction constant around the free surface to avoid disturbance of the flow owing to grid refinement then five different grids were generated the grid characteristics are listed in table 9 the cells per wave height and length refer to the outer free surface refinement box thus one refinement level more was obtained in the vicinity and wake and two levels more directly on the surface of the cylinder these grids follow the proposed refinement ratio guideline of the ittc i e r 2 the time steps were defined as a ratio of the wave period t δ t 1 t 400 δ t 2 t 565 δ t 3 t 800 δ t 4 t 1131 δ t 5 t 1600 δ t 6 t 2263 and δ t 7 t 3200 the time steps follow exactly the same refinement ratio as the grids table 10 summarises all simulations and shows their theoretical cfl numbers 5 4 wave load results the results of the wave load test case for 22 simulations are shown in fig 11 the results showed that the loads increase with the level of discretisation certainly the differences between the coarsest and finest grid are very small and are visible only around the maxima and minima this indicates that the influence of the discretisation on the solution is small for the period and important for the wave load peaks 5 5 iterative convergence the residual convergence at the end of each time step is shown for two examples of test case two in fig 12 these two examples represent the simulations with the smallest and largest cfl number the residuals in l 2 norm are presented for each of these examples residuals larger than the results presented in these figures are possible hence the flow solution is analysed and quantified in fig 13 the flow solution presented in fig 13 shows the free surface in light blue and the highest residuals with rainbow colours the residuals were largest for the vertical velocity v z at the free surface at the outlet boundary condition and around the cylinder the residuals in the other control volumes converged below 10 7 and are blanked for visualisation purposes 5 6 discretisation error we employed the mean wave loads to estimate the discretisation error and uncertainty for test case two these loads are a sum of all loads acting on the cylinder in x direction eça and hoekstra approach the approach by eça and hoekstra was also applied using different data sets for this test case the sensitivity on the data set selected can be analysed in this way as a reference solution a result is given for all 22 simulations fig 14 presents the results the results of fig 14 show larger differences between each other than for test case one it can be seen from this figure that the shape of the fitted surface also changed depending on the selected cases the results of the error and uncertainty estimation are summarised in table 11 for this test case a difference of 6 7 for the extrapolated grid and time step independent value of the mean wave load f x was found depending on the data set selected the estimated uncertainty ranges from 3 5 22 7 this value has a larger difference from the estimated error for oscillatory convergent data and is closer to the solution of the finest grid and time step for monotonic convergent data monotonic convergence on the diagonal was achieved for the four results with five and nine grid sets then uncertainties were lower than for oscillatory data we can conclude that scatter in the data and too coarse discretisation penalise the uncertainty u ϕ 5 6 1 oberhagemann and el moctar approach fig 15 shows the results with the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar these are the data sets that produced monotonic convergence ten data sets could be found with monotonic convergent data eight sets are shown in fig 15 the results are also summarised in table 12 the results obtained with the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar for these ten data sets showed a distribution of extrapolated values for ϕ 0 ranging from 613 169 n to 663 282 n this is a difference of about 7 6 apart from two cases the linear method by oberhagemann and el moctar s 1 produced lower results for ϕ 0 than the result including a second order term s 2 the results with the first order term were also closer to the finest grid solution apart from the same two cases therefore the errors presented in table 12 were smaller for the first order than the first plus second order solution the data sets bcd with cfl 0 21 and abc cfl 0 07 are different and result in lower discretisation errors for s 2 these two sets presented results in the asymptotic region then the extrapolation leads to smaller errors as these simulations were conducted with second order approximations the results for s 2 are seen more reliable and taken for comparison with the results using the method by eça and hoekstra 5 6 2 comparison a comparison between the results for the three discretisation error estimation methods was done for this test case fig 16 shows the results the solutions of the grids a b c d and e for cfl numbers between 0 11 and 0 21 are presented in these figures as solid black markers their extrapolated values using five solutions for the method by eça and hoekstra eh 5 or nine eh 9 or 22 eh 22 the corresponding results by oberhagemann and el moctar oem and xing and stern xs are shown for ϒ 0 the results of fig 16 show that the extrapolated values with the method by eça and hoekstra were more conservative than those by oberhagemann and el moctar and both more conservative than xing and stern the solution obtained by eça and hoekstra for 22 simulations was closest to the solution by oberhagemann and el moctar for cfl 0 11 and five grids for this test case the results of xing and stern shown in table 13 revealed very small discretisation errors the uncertainties however are in a similar range as the values estimated using the approach by eça and hoekstra 5 7 validation the aim of such a large study should be to validate the numerical simulations with experimental data experimental data were available from the oc5 study robertson et al 2017 fig 17 shows the comparison of the numerical simulations with experimental data the uncertainty bars plotted in this figure represent the discretisation uncertainty of the finest grid and time step for 22 simulations obtained with eça and hoekstra table 11 no errors and uncertainties of the experiment were available thus no formal validation of the numerical simulations can be done for this test case the time trace and the uncertainty bars presented in fig 17 however showed a good match with the experimental results the mean and standard deviation of the wave loads f x obtained after 10 wave periods for the finest grid and time step were 640 320 n 1 6041 n 0 25 the corresponding values for the experiment for the last 28 waves were 672 108 n 12 9296 n 1 92 the comparison error between the experiment and the numerical simulation 4 96 was also smaller than the discretisation uncertainty for the statistical values 6 surge decay of a semi submersible fowt 6 1 test case description this test case consists of surge decay with the oc5 deepcwind semi submersible floating wind turbine robertson et al 2017 work with the same floater was also published in burmester et al 2017 2018 and robertson et al 2017 we simulated solely the floater geometry but the mass properties of the whole system floater tower nacelle and rotor were used the floater geometry is presented in fig 18 the main particulars of the floating system and the stiffness properties are summarised in table 14 and table 15 respectively the stiffness properties are the diagonal values of the linear mooring restoring matrix a right handed coordinate system was used in this work the x coordinate pointed in forward surge direction the y coordinate in transverse sway direction and the z coordinate vertically upwards heave the system s origin was set to the centre of gravity of the floating structure see table 15 the decay tests were performed with an initial displacement of 0 167 m in surge we performed the computations at model scale with a scaling factor of 50 6 2 numerical setup the computational domain for this test case was modelled as a semi cylinder in such a way that it forms a symmetric half with respect to the x z plane the domain had a total height of h 4 6 m a water depth of d 4 0 m and a radius of r 4 9 m the radius corresponds to six times the characteristic radius of the semi submersible r c 0 8174 m the water depth was adopted from the experiments the computational domain is shown in fig 19 at the bottom and top of the domain a static pressure was prescribed the boundaries of the semi submersible were represented with no slip conditions for the x z plane a symmetry condition was used the curved surface area was modelled as a non reflecting boundary condition of sommerfeld type sommerfeld 1949 in contrast to the previous test cases no waves were generated and therefore no absorption zones were used 6 3 numerical simulations we chose the grid topology in such a way that the cell size reduces towards the semi submersible floater and towards the free surface at the free surface the refinement in vertical direction was kept constant to reduce the amount of hanging nodes in this direction the grid was also refined on the curves and surfaces of the semi submersible the hull above water was refined as much as needed to cover curves and surfaces at critical geometrical points more refinement was needed to capture the contour of the geometry see fig 20 for these grids viscous layer cells were generated to guarantee a non dimensional wall distance value of y m a x 1 5 this goal was achieved regardless of the total grid size the grids used are summarised in table 16 the time steps were defined as a ratio of the oscillation period t 15 5563 s δ t 1 t 3200 δ t 2 t 4800 δ t 3 t 6400 δ t 4 t 8533 δ t 5 t 12800 the simulations are summarised in table 17 with the theoretical cfl numbers obtained there is a set of three grids that can be used for the oberhagemann and el moctar approach in addition results of all 18 simulations are suited for the approach by eça and hoekstra 6 4 hydrodynamic damping in fig 21 the 18 simulations are presented as decaying oscillations in surge over time because the difference of the solutions for different time steps was too small only four different lines can be seen in fig 21 hence the solutions of these simulations were more grid than time step size dependent the difference between the grids increases with progressing simulation time burmester et al 2020 proposed to use an improved pq method based on least squares fitting to analyse the hydrodynamic damping with linear b 1 and quadratic b 2 damping terms the original pq method was published by van der vegt 1984 then the damping function can be defined as 37 b x b 1 x b 2 x x the linear and quadratic damping terms are obtained with 38 b 1 p t n c 2 π 2 b 2 3 q t n 2 c 32 π 2 here the natural period is denoted by t n and the stiffness by c the linear and quadratic damping coefficients p and q are a result of the pq method in which p and q are estimated based on the peaks of a fitted least squares function the peak values are used to plot a new graph as shown in fig 22 b then a line is fitted through these data points this line has an intercept with the ordinate called p and a slope denoted with q p is a dimensionless number and q has the reciprocal of the motion dimension investigated i e 1 m for the surge motion applying this improved pq method to the surge decay time history for nine simulations delivers the results presented in fig 23 fig 23 shows an increase of linear damping for grid coarsening the quadratic damping generally increases for finer spatial resolution and reduces for finer temporal resolution the change of damping for finer spatial and temporal discretisation is a result of the reduced numerical diffusion and the better resolved geometry and viscous effects as presented in burmester et al 2020 linear damping is dominated by wave radiation more spatial refinement leads to better resolved curvatures of the geometry and thus less radiated waves but it resolves vortices and eddies better the former decreases the linear damping and the latter increases the quadratic damping reduced numerical diffusion owing to finer temporal and spatial discretisation decreases the damping as fewer energy is dissipated 6 5 iterative convergence fig 24 shows the iterative convergence at the end of each time step for the simulation with the largest and the smallest theoretical cfl number the result shows convergence below 10 4 for each simulation in l 2 and 10 2 in l norm a finer grid lowers the residual level in l 2 norm higher cfl numbers lead to higher residuals in l norm therefore fig 25 presents a plot to show the residuals for the simulation with the largest cfl number i e grid d with δ t t 3200 the highest residuals were found for the air volume fraction they were in the viscous layer cells at free surface residuals in the range of 10 8 to 10 7 can be found at the outlet boundary condition and around the floater at the height of the free surface as well as at wave fronts and backs thus all other locations converged well below 10 8 this shows that it is important to look into the locations of residual convergence 6 6 discretisation error initially we performed the error and uncertainty estimation for this test case on the linear and quadratic damping coefficients presented in fig 23 applying the method by eça and hoekstra however results in uncertainties of u ϕ 421 7 for p and u ϕ 87 for q for the solution of the finest grid and time step similarly integration to estimate the area enclosed by the surge decay motion graph leads to uncertainties of u ϕ 40 8 the quantities chosen for the estimation of errors and uncertainties need to be as least post processed as possible then the errors and uncertainties obtained are a result of the numerical simulations and not of the post processing technique in the above examples the pq analysis and the trapezoidal rule for integration in itself possess uncertainties which lead to unrealistic error uncertainty estimation therefore we performed the discretisation error estimation on the oscillation range i e the difference between one maximum and the following minimum of one oscillation the differences between the results increase with simulation time 6 6 1 eça and hoekstra approach fig 26 shows the results for different data sets for the second oscillation cycle table 18 summarises the results the form of the fitted plane changes from an almost straight to a curved shape the results for the error and uncertainty estimation scatter as in the previous test cases the extrapolated value differs by 7 3 and the uncertainty lays in a range of 10 to 31 the uncertainties for 18 and 9 data points were larger as the results showed more oscillatory behaviour the result for 12 data sets was obtained with larger temporal discretisation steps the differences of the solutions increased and led to monotonic convergence and therefore smaller uncertainties 6 6 2 comparison there is exactly one data set resulting in constant cfl numbers table 17 fig 27 shows a comparison between the three methods for this set the result of oberhagemann and el moctar oem with linear extrapolation is closer to the grid solutions thus the result with quadratic extrapolation obtained larger errors and is more conservative table 19 presents the results and their errors the three methods produce remarkably similar results for this test case and for the same data set nevertheless the data set selected was not in the asymptotic range consequently the method by xing and stern results in smaller errors than the other two methods see table 20 the uncertainties estimated are higher and fit well to the ones estimated by eça and hoekstra for 18 data points thus the error estimation using the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar and eça and hoekstra yielded more conservative values than the method by xing and stern 6 7 validation model test data was also available for this test case fig 28 presents the comparison of the results for the numerical simulation with finest grid and time step and the experiment the uncertainty bars represent the result for 18 simulations obtained with the method by eça and hoekstra i e u ϕ 31 the differences were large between the experiment and the numerical simulation burmester et al 2020 discussed reasons for the differences in period and motion damping in detail the deviation between experiments and simulations may be owing to the following issues there were differences in the set up between experiment and numerical simulation in the experiments the floater was moored with a catenary mooring line system these lines were towed with the motion of the floater and added drag as well as inertia to the motions of the system for the numerical simulations solely the stiffness of the moorings was accounted for in the linearised restoring matrix in addition the mswt was mounted on top of the floater and a large electrical power cable was connected between turbine tower and carriage the turbine although not rotating added damping to the system owing to the additional resistance of the rotor area and the power cable interacted dynamically with the tower for large motion amplitudes these effects were not considered in the numerical simulations we conducted the numerical simulations for one degree of freedom and omitted the coupling with other degrees of freedom this coupling was present and could be observed in the model tests it adds damping to the system flows around the cylindrical structures of the floater are difficult for two equation rans turbulence models to capture this is highlighted by the results of many cfd simulations of fluid flows around circular cylinders published in the literature in addition the symmetry plane boundary condition in the xz plane suppressed realistic turbulent effects around the front and centre column these reduced turbulent effects influence the quadratic damping of the floater the experiments were not repeated and measurement uncertainties are not known these five points contribute to large differences not associated with the discretisation uncertainty presented in this paper these points are part of the numerical modelling and experimental uncertainty turbulence modelling the symmetry of the domain coupling with other degrees of freedom and mooring modelling will be addressed in another study the experiments were carried out without uncertainty and error assessment consequently no formal validation of the numerical simulations are possible nevertheless the differences between the ends of the uncertainty bar and the presented experimental results are very small 7 conclusion this study investigated the credible simulation of floating wind turbines using cfd the work included the comparison of three methods to estimate the discretisation errors and uncertainties these methods are the approaches developed by eça and hoekstra 2014 oberhagemann and el moctar 2020 and xing and stern 2010 we tested these methods for three test cases wave propagation in 2d wave loads on a vertical surface piercing circular cylinder and surge decay simulations of a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine details on the numerical settings the computational setup and the iterative convergence were also given in addition we studied the difference of two wave absorption functions and found their optimum finally we compared the results of each test case either to the analytical solution test case one or to available experimental data these three test cases are different problems for the simulation of the hydrodynamics of floating wind turbines see fig 1 the step by step approach with increasing complexity in the test cases and the comparison of three different methods to estimate the discretisation error provide a way towards increased credibility for the numerical simulation of engineering problems specifically fowts in total we computed 94 cfd simulations for the three test cases including the studies on wave absorption the total computational time for the simulations was between 3 h for the coarsest grid and time step of the wave propagation test case 1 3 s per time step and core using a single core on a local workstation intel xeon cpu e3 1270v5 with 3 60 ghz 31 2 gb of memory to 17 days for the finest grid and time step of the surge decay test case using 320 cores 0 06 s per time step and core on a high performance computing hpc cluster intel e5 2650v4 broadwell cpus with 2 20 ghz from this extensive study we can draw the following conclusions the first two test cases were very close to the analytical and experimental result 0 4 and 4 96 respectively the last test had large differences of 37 3 this was caused by errors owing to mooring modelling symmetry of the computational domain neglected aerodynamic damping of the turbine and tower restriction in the degrees of freedom not considered electrical power cable and uncertainties of the experiments etc more details on this topic were given in burmester et al 2020 the three techniques showed consistent output for the three different test cases the difference of the extrapolated grid and time step independent solutions for the different methods was always in the range of less than 10 in accordance with burmester et al 2020 we recommend to use as little post processing as possible of the quantities chosen for the discretisation error and or uncertainty estimation this reduces the uncertainties introduced by the post processing technique for most of the data sets the method by eça and hoekstra resulted in more conservative larger discretisation errors than the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar and both were larger than the results using the formulation by xing and stern in addition the uncertainty estimation by eça and hoekstra takes scatter in the data into account the technique by eça and hoekstra however requires at least five solutions to estimate an error while the methods of oberhagemann and el moctar and of xing and stern can yield reliable estimates with three solutions once the data is monotonic convergent the approach by oberhagemann and el moctar is less robust for more data against scatter and if the results are non monotonic nevertheless this method is faster and reduces computational costs additionally to the discretisation errors the approaches by eça and hoekstra and xing and stern provide uncertainty estimates the uncertainty estimates of xing and stern rely on just three solutions but yield similar results compared with the results of the formulation by eça and hoekstra experimental data including errors and uncertainties are important to formally perform validation errors and uncertainties for model test data are seldom provided and were not available here nevertheless the uncertainty bars for the solution with the finest grid and time step overlapped the experimental result for test case two and were very close to the physical result for test case three the results for errors and uncertainties of test case one also overlapped the analytical solution future work needs to include experiments with estimated errors and uncertainties to formally validate the numerical simulations moreover modelling errors owing to turbulence modelling symmetry of the domain and moorings require quantification statistical errors and iterative errors also need to be assessed to obtain a total computational error finally the aero hydrodynamic interaction for wind and wave excitation requires verification and validation to complete the assessment of cfd credibility for floating wind turbines credit authorship contribution statement simon burmester conceptualization
