1475,river sediment typically acts a sink or source of phosphorus for the overlying water owing to the adsorption of phosphorous by the sediment or release of phosphorous to the water respectively in this study a method is proposed for the determination of the equilibrium concentration of the total phosphorus ec tp and total phosphorus release rate r r phosphorus release experiments were conducted on natural river sediments in flowing water with a low velocity under different water temperatures an empirical equation was established for the correlation between ec tp and r r at an arbitrary temperature and at 20 c the results indicate that an increase in the water temperature significantly enhances the phosphorus release in comparison with total phosphorus dissolved phosphorus and particulate phosphorus in the overlying water do not change with the water temperature thus the results of this study aid in understanding the contaminant exchange between sediments and water in flowing rivers keywords sediment release phosphorus flowing water temperature 1 introduction phosphorus is an important biogenic substance in aquatic ecosystems its migration transformation and transportation in river systems are of ecological significance paytan and mclaughlin 2011 hashemi et al 2016 in natural river systems phosphorus typically exists in sediments water and aquatic organisms withers and jarvie 2008 chen et al 2018 the desorption of phosphorus from sediments to the overlying water is called release which is a type of phosphorus transformation in aquatic ecosystems because of the ecological significance of phosphorus researchers have been studying its release from sediments to the overlying water various factors such as water temperature affect the release of phosphorus from sediments to the overlying water jiang et al 2008 li et al 2013a previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in water temperature promotes the release of phosphorus that is it increases the release rate holdren and armstrong 1980 sarkar et al 2016 and release amount jensen and andersen 1992 yin et al 1994 zhou et al 2007 jiang et al 2008 wu et al 2014 these studies were conducted at two or three different experimental temperatures for example at 5 and 25 c representing low and high temperatures respectively however temperature gradient experiments were not conducted and thus few studies have established reasonable and quantitative correlations between the temperature and release rate or release amount of phosphorus to simulate the release of phosphorus from sediments to the overlying water various simulation devices have been developed which can be classified into three types 1 seepage devices wherein the water or solution flows through the sediments as seepage sánchez and boll 2005 2 centrifuge tubes 50 100 and 1000 ml or transparent rectangular perspex boxes jiang et al 2008 li et al 2013a xue and lu 2015 to simulate the phosphorus release from sediments to the overlying water sediment samples and a solution cacl2 or kcl or water are added to the centrifuge tubes shaking is used to simulate the disturbance conditions this method has been the most popular 3 flumes house et al 1995 li et al 2004 zhu et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 sediments are placed at the bottom of the flume and water flows over it notably flumes are more suitable for the simulation of phosphorus release processes from river sediments to the overlying water in comparison with the other two devices the experiments in this study were performed in a circulating flume the velocity of the water in the flume is a key factor in phosphorus release experiments a significantly high water velocity results in the suspension of sediments li et al 2004 zhu et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 in contrast the phosphorous release when the velocity is 0 m s is equivalent to that under still water conditions jiang et al 2008 xue and lu 2015 these two phosphorus release types have been extensively studied in this study the velocity of the water was set to be lower than the starting velocity of the sediments but greater than 0 m s therefore the experimental conditions can be summarised as flowing overlying water with low velocity plus static sediments the sediment samples used in this study were obtained from the bank of the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river it is known that the braided river morphology in the basin of the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river complicates the flow regime liu and wang 1998 li et al 2012 moreover setting the velocity lower than the starting velocity of the sediments reflects real conditions the spatiotemporal distribution and transportation characteristics of phosphorus in the yarlung zangbo river were obtained nan et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 the aim of this temperature dependent experimental study of the phosphorus release from sediments of the yarlung zangbo river is to explore the transition trend of phosphorous in a natural river ecosystem under different temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites the sediment samples used in this study were obtained from a bank slope along the yarlung zangbo river close to qushui county bridge 29 19 43 53 n 90 41 15 77 s as illustrated in fig 1 the sample location is 6 km from qushui county and 54 km from lhasa the reasons for the selection of this sample site are as follows the location is characterised by a braided river morphology and the river flow regime is complex and most likely reflects the experimental conditions that is flowing overlying water with a low velocity plus static sediments furthermore this location is convenient for the transport of the samples back to the laboratory for processing and analysis the sediment samples were collected from the riverbank near the water the sampling depth ranged from 0 to 10 cm sampling was conducted in november after the completion of sampling visible plant litter coarse root materials and stones were immediately removed the sediment samples were screened using a 30 mesh sieve before they were transported to the laboratory all sediment samples were placed in polyethylene bags immediately brought to the laboratory and air dried for two weeks based on our site surveys the water temperature in this basin ranges from 7 3 to 14 3 c in april 12 4 to 22 0 c in august and 6 4 to 16 2 c in november therefore phosphorus release experiments were conducted at 5 10 15 17 5 20 and 22 5 c in this study the selected temperature gradients cover all possible water temperatures of the natural environment 2 2 sediment properties table 1 lists the properties of the sediment samples used in these experiments air dried sediment samples were used for various types of sediment analyses d10 represents the particle size corresponding to a cumulative sample particle size distribution of 10 this implies that particles smaller than d10 account for 10 similarly d50 and d90 represent particle sizes corresponding to cumulative sample particle size distributions of 50 and 90 respectively tested with a mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical malvern uk the specific surface area was determined using a rise 1010 analysis meter jinan rise science technology jinan china loss on ignition loi tests were used to measure the organic matter content of the sediments energy dispersive spectroscopy inca250 oxford instruments oxford uk was utilised to analyse the elemental compositions of the sediment samples the extraction of various phosphorus species in this study was based on the guidelines for lake eutrophication survey second edition jin and tu 1990 in which a six step chemical sequential extraction method is proposed based on the guidelines the phosphorus species in the sediments can be categorised into inorganic phosphorus ip and organic phosphorus op inorganic phosphorus can be further classified into soluble phosphorus sp aluminium bound phosphorus alp calcium bound phosphorus cap iron bound phosphorus fep and occluded phosphorus oc p the sum of the concentrations of each phosphorus species represents the total phosphorus tp concentration 2 3 incipient velocity of sediment different researchers have established equations for the incipient sediment velocity based on multitudinous influencing factors the following equation was used to calculate the incipient velocity of the sediment in the flume zhang et al 2007 1 v c 1 34 h d 0 14 γ s γ γ gd 3 36 10 7 10 h d 0 72 0 5 where v c represents the incipient velocity of the sediments h represents the water depth of the flume d is the grain size of the sediments γ is the unit weight of water and γ s is the unit weight of the sediments the incipient velocity of the sediments differs depending on the grain size because the particle size of the sediment samples ranges from small to large a unified incipient velocity cannot be obtained however an incipient velocity corresponding to the sediment grain size of different cumulative frequencies can be calculated the results are presented in table 2 indicating that all starting velocities of the sediments with different grain sizes are greater than 0 20 m s to ensure that the sediments are in a static state in the entire flume the velocity of the overlying water was set to 0 03 m s which was significantly lesser than the starting velocity in addition a rectifier grid was set at the entrance of the flume to ensure the smooth and uniform flow of the overlying water 2 4 circulatory flume a newly designed circulating flume with a slope of 0 5 was used in this study fig 2 the pump pours the water from the downhill section to the uphill section the flow advects into the straight line section through a grid to reduce the turbulence caused by the pump the flume was 0 2 m wide 0 3 m high and 1 5 m long in the straight line section the inner and outer diameters of the arc section were 0 4 and 0 8 m respectively the overall length width and height of the experimental device were 2 3 0 8 and 0 3 m respectively this flume effectively prevents turbulence and the straight line section simulates the flow pattern of the waterbody under natural conditions well the experiments were conducted in duplicate under different temperatures 2 5 experimental setup and sample analysis to explore the differences in the phosphorus release process at different temperatures six temperatures were considered 5 10 15 17 5 20 and 22 5 c the experiments are conducted in a circulating flume as illustrated in fig s1 a to prevent a significant reduction of the water volume after sampling the water to sediment ratio was set to 20 1 during the experiments the water depth in the flume was 0 1 m to ensure that the overlying water flows through the flume and the sediment particles remain stationary the experimental velocity was set to 0 03 m s when the temperature experiments were conducted the flume was placed in a constant temperature and humidity chamber with a length of 4 m width of 3 m and height of 2 m as depicted in fig s1 b before commencement of the experiment the constant temperature and humidity chamber was set to the preset working temperature the sediments were placed at the bottom of the experiment flume and a separate container was filled with distilled water all samples were placed in the constant temperature and humidity chamber until the temperature of the distilled water reached the set temperature then distilled water was slowly and carefully poured into the flume triggering the phosphorous release process during the experiment 5 ml water samples were simultaneously obtained at heights of 1 and 7 cm below the water surface both of them were tested and the test results were averaged to represent the value of the overlying water the samples were centrifuged with a temperature controlled centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min and the supernatant was used for the determination of the tp concentration in the overlying water by molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry after digestion with potassium persulfate water quality determination of total phosphorus ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method the test procedure used for the dissolved phosphorus dp concentration was the same as that utilised for the tp concentration except that the water samples were separated using a 0 45 μm filter membrane the difference between the tp and dp concentrations is the particulate phosphorus pp concentration li et al 2013b he et al 2015 interstitial water samples were obtained from underneath the sediment water interface using a pinhole sampler which inevitably introduces a small amount of sediment to the sample the sampling volume was 5 ml therefore centrifugation with a temperature controlled centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min was required before the test and the supernatant was then used for the measurement the tp concentration of the interstitial water samples was determined using molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry after digestion with potassium persulfate based on previous studies jiang et al 2008 li et al 2013a it is known that physical and chemical parameters such as water ph do and redox potential eh also affect the release of phosphorus from the sediments in this study we focused on temperature assuming that the changes in the other parameters are insignificant to avoid isolating the phosphorus release processes table 3 presents the measurement results of these indicators ph was measured using fg2 elk mettler toledo usa do was measured using hq30d hach usa eh was measured using ct 8022 kedida china these parameters were only checked once in each temperature experiment 3 results 3 1 changes in tp concentration of the interstitial and overlying water the changes in the tp concentration of the interstitial and overlying water at different water temperatures are illustrated in fig 3 and fig s2 during the phosphorus release the tp concentration of the interstitial water gradually decreased whereas the tp concentration of the overlying water gradually increased within the first 120 min of the experiment the tp concentration of the interstitial water rapidly decreased whereas the tp concentration of the overlying water rapidly increased the rate of change in the phosphorus concentration was extremely high at the beginning of the experiment and then significantly decreased after 120 min and became extremely low finally when the tp concentrations of the interstitial and overlying water remained constant the phosphorus release processes were considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium with the increase in the experimental temperature the tp concentration change became more significant at 5 c the tp concentration of the interstitial water gradually decreased from 0 074 to 0 062 mg l fig s2 a but only two concentration values appeared in the entire release process an increase in the tp concentration of the overlying water was not observed as depicted in fig 3 a b and c the tp concentration of the interstitial water decreases tp concentration of the overlying water increases and the concentration gradient significantly changes with the increase in temperature when the temperature is further increased the concentration gradient significantly changes at 20 and 22 5 c as depicted in fig 3 d and fig s2 b respectively and the tp concentration curve of the interstitial water exhibits a downward trend whereas the tp concentration curve of the overlying water exhibits an upward trend overall phosphorus was transferred from the sediments and the interstitial water to the overlying water thereby increasing the tp concentration of the overlying water 3 2 equilibrium concentration of tp in the overlying water the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water during the release of phosphorus from the sediments at different water temperatures is illustrated in fig 4 at different temperatures the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water are similar with increasing time the tp concentration of the overlying water gradually increases when the experiment reaches an equilibrium the tp concentration of the overlying water does not further increase and the curve gradually flattens however the tp concentrations differ at different temperatures at a water temperature ranging from 5 to 20 c the equilibrium concentrations of tp in the overlying water increase with the increase in the temperature at 20 c the tp concentration of the overlying water is 0 058 mg l that is 2 4 times the equilibrium concentration at 5 c 1 9 times that at 10 c and 1 4 times that at 15 c at a temperature ranging from 20 to 22 5 c the tp equilibrium concentration only increases by 0 001 mg l and the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water are almost identical the correlation between the equilibrium concentration of the tp at an arbitrary temperature and that at 20 c is shown in fig 5 the equilibrium concentration of tp at an arbitrary temperature is related to the equilibrium concentration of tp at 20 c the correlation can be expressed as follows 2 ec tp t 0 9517 ec tp 20 e 0 0588 t 20 where ec tp t is the equilibrium concentration of the tp at an arbitrary temperature ec tp 20 is the equilibrium concentration of the tp at 20 c and t is the arbitrary temperature the correlation coefficient r 2 is 0 9539 3 3 distribution of phosphorus fractions in the overlying water when phosphorus is released into the overlying water two species can be observed pp and dp the species are classified based on whether they can pass through a 45 μm filter membrane and the tp concentration is the sum of concentrations of the two species the changes in the different phosphorus species in the overlying water under different water temperatures are depicted in fig 6 the results reveal that the changes in the pp and dp concentrations are inconsistent at 10 20 and 22 5 c fig 6 a d and fig s3 b respectively the pp concentration is higher than the dp concentration at 5 and 15 c fig s3 a and fig 6 b respectively the pp concentration is lower than the dp concentration at 17 5 c as is depicted in fig 6 c the pp and dp concentrations are significantly similar the phosphorus concentrations do not uniformly change with the change in temperature in addition the changes in the pp and dp concentrations with time remain uncertain from the beginning to the end of the release the dp concentration in the overlying water gradually increases similar to the tp concentration however the pp concentration in the overlying water does not uniformly increase or decrease particularly at 5 and 22 5 c fig s3 a and fig s3 b respectively but significantly fluctuates the numerical volatility diminishes over time 3 4 computation of tp release rate using the method discussed in section 3 1 the equilibrium times are determined as follows 5 c 10h 10 c 8 h 15 c 8 h 17 5 c 8 h 20 c 8 h and 22 5 c 6 h the phosphorus release rate of the sediments can be calculated using the following equation jiang et al 2008 jin et al 2007 3 r r m e a t e c e c 0 v e a t e where r r is the average tp release rate of the sediments in all the phosphorus release processes mg m2 h a is the area of the interface between the sediments and overlying water m2 m e is the total amount of phosphorus released from the sediments to the overlying water when the equilibrium is reached mg c e is the tp concentration of the overlying water when the release of phosphorus in the sediments reaches the equilibrium mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of the overlying water at the beginning of the experiment mg l v e is the volume of the overlying water when the phosphorus release reaches the equilibrium l and t e is the time it takes to reach the equilibrium h fig 7 depicts the correlation between the tp release rate r r of the sediments at various temperatures and that at 20 c in the range of 5 22 5 c the release rate of phosphorus in the sediments increases with increasing temperature the following equation can be used to calculate the release rate 4 r r t 1 0482 r r 20 e 0 099 t 20 where r r t is the tp release rate of the sediments at an arbitrary temperature and r r 20 is the tp release rate of the sediments at 20 c the correlation coefficient r 2 is 0 9911 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus release processes the results of previous studies indicated that phosphorus enters the overlying water through two processes that is molecular diffusion from the interstitial water to the overlying water chatelain and guizien 2010 steinberger and hondzo 1999 wang et al 2013a and desorption from the sediment surface to the overlying water andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 xie et al 2003 wang et al 2013b as depicted in fig 3 the tp concentrations of the interstitial water gradually decrease with increasing time and the tp concentrations of the overlying water increase during the release of phosphorus at different temperatures this suggests that molecular diffusion from the interstitial water to the overlying water occurs fig 8 depicts that the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water tp concentration of the interstitial water of the first sample gradually increases from 5 to 20 c this correlation agrees with the results of previous research which demonstrated that the amount of phosphorus release from the sediments to the interstitial water is enhanced in a warmer climate wang et al 2013a however the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water at 22 5 c is lower than that at 17 5 and 20 c this may be related to the reabsorption of phosphorus from the interstitial water by the sediments although the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water at 22 5 c is lower than that at 17 5 and 20 c the equilibrium tp concentration ec tp of the overlying water at 22 5 c is the highest among all temperatures as depicted in fig 8 this indicates that phosphorus may enter the overlying water through a different process thus desorption from the sediment surface to the overlying water also plays an important role in phosphorus release 4 2 time to reach equilibrium time in this study the phosphorus release process was considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium when the difference in the tp concentrations between two adjacent time points were less than 0 002 mg l the concentration at this time was considered as the equilibrium concentration and the corresponding sampling time was considered as the equilibrium time previous experimental studies of the phosphorus release process have demonstrated that the equilibrium time is not uniform owing to the different disturbance conditions of various studies table 4 presents the comparison of different phosphorus release processes when the experiment condition was static overlying water plus static sediments the disturbance intensity of the overlying water acting on the sediments was weak and the time it took to reach the equilibrium was expressed in days under conditions with flowing overlying water the time required to reach the equilibrium was expressed in hours therefore it can be concluded that the stronger the disturbance intensity the shorter the time required to reach the equilibrium in the phosphorus release process in conclusion the equilibrium time of the phosphorus release process is related to the intensity of disturbance note that the equilibrium time also depends on the overall design of the experiment and phosphorus concentrations of the sediments 4 3 equations for the calculation of the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp in this study the correlation between the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp at an arbitrary temperature and the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp at 20 c was analysed the ec tp and r r at any temperature can be calculated using eqs 2 and 4 respectively however the application of these equations to all phosphorus release processes has two limitations one is that different sediments have different phosphorus adsorption capacities and thus the phosphorus concentration that can be released also differs this was confirmed in a previous study sharpley and ahuja 1982 the second limitation is that the disturbance conditions of different studies may be different as discussed in section 4 2 the time taken to reach the equilibrium is directly affected by the disturbance intensity therefore the release rate may also be affected by the disturbance intensity thus these equations may not provide the basis for the calculation of the release of all types of sediments under various disturbance conditions however the method used to establish the empirical equations may be valuable for related research that is to establish the correlation between ec tp or r r at an arbitrary temperature and ec tp or r r at 20 c in comparison with the equations derived in this paper previous studies on the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release rate were either qualitative studies or found it difficult to apply the numerical relationship in practice the phosphorus release experiments were conducted in the dark at 5 25 and 35 c the results indicated that the concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved total phosphorus dtp and tp in the overlying water increased as the temperature increased jiang et al 2008 holdren and armstrong 1980 demonstrated that an increase in the temperature affected the phosphorus release rate in these two experimental studies the effects of temperature on the phosphorus release rate were qualitatively determined subsequent studies focused on the numerical relationship between the water temperature and phosphorus release rate for example the results of one study indicated that the tp release rate of the sediments increased by 13 20 36 98 and dtp release rate increased by 11 14 47 93 with each increase in the temperature by 10 c xue and lu 2015 however this study could not determine the equilibrium concentration of tp at an arbitrary temperature similarly another study demonstrated that the equilibrium concentration at 30 c was 3 3 times that at 20 c and 6 2 times that at 10 c wu et al 2014 in a previous study it was pointed out that the maximum cumulative amount of released phosphorus increases linearly with the increase in temperature a correlation equation of y 0 00317x 0 00928 r2 0 94731 y represents the maximum cumulative amount of phosphorus x represents the water temperature was obtained li et al 2013a thus it is meaningless to simply associate the water temperature with the amount of released phosphorus 4 4 possible reasons for the effect of temperature on the release of phosphorus the increase in temperature leads to an increase in the amount of released phosphorus as well as the release rate numerous studies have focused on the reason why the temperature promotes the phosphorus release with the increase in temperature the activity of microorganisms significantly increases jiang et al 2008 the do concentration in the overlying water decreases owing to the consumption by microorganisms leading to a decrease in the redox potential the transformation from fe3 to fe2 is enhanced resulting in the release of fe p from the sediments holdren and armstrong 1980 kosten et al 2012 similarly the results of another study indicated that elevated temperatures lead to a decrease in the thickness of the oxidised surface layer thereby inducing the release of fe bound phosphorus jensen and andersen 1992 in this study no measures were taken to limit the microbial activity it is possible that the increase in the temperature enhances the microbial activity and thus influences the release of phosphorus which may promote the desorption from the sediment surface to the interstitial and overlying water in addition in agreement with wang et al 2013a the tp concentrations of the interstitial water obtained in this study were higher than that of the overlying water the diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water occurred from high concentration to low concentration complying with fick s first law of diffusion based on fick s first law temperature affects the diffusion coefficient he et al 2006 and thus the release of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water in a previous study similar results were revealed lei et al 2018 in summary an increase in the temperature enhances the diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water 4 5 experimental interference factors in this study the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release processes was primarily studied however other factors that may interfere with the experiment were also examined the results are presented in table 3 during the temperature experiments the ph do and eh were measured after the first sampling in all experiments distilled water was used as the overlying water the ph ranged from 7 60 to 7 91 representing a small variation and values close to neutral values this implies that ph does not affect the phosphorus release the do ranged from 8 0 to 9 5 mg l the overlying water was placed in the incubator for a long time thus the water solubility changed colt 2012 leading to a change in the do content of the water based on the experimental design do was not consumed by or added to the overlying water the same ventilation system was used in all experiments the change in temperature resulted in a change in the do content in conclusion the change in the do content is reasonable and does not affect the results the eh ranged from 209 to 222 mv its variation range is significantly small and its change with temperature is not uniform therefore eh does not affect the accuracy of the experimental results 5 conclusions in conclusion the temperature significantly affects the release of phosphorus from the sediments to the overlying water this was reflected by the equilibrium concentration of tp ec tp in the overlying water and release rate of tp r r based on the temperature experiments the correlation between ec tp or r r at an arbitrary temperature and ec tp or r r at 20 c was established in this study a method is proposed that can be used to determine the effect of temperature on phosphorus release although it may not be applicable to different types of sediments and different disturbance intensities phosphorus release processes from the sediments to the overlying water and possible reasons of the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release were discussed in this paper the increase in the water temperature enhances both the activity of microorganisms and diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water thus affecting phosphorus release funding this work was

study was based on the guidelines for lake eutrophication survey second edition jin and tu 1990 in which a six step chemical sequential extraction method is proposed based on the guidelines the phosphorus species in the sediments can be categorised into inorganic phosphorus ip and organic phosphorus op inorganic phosphorus can be further classified into soluble phosphorus sp aluminium bound phosphorus alp calcium bound phosphorus cap iron bound phosphorus fep and occluded phosphorus oc p the sum of the concentrations of each phosphorus species represents the total phosphorus tp concentration 2 3 incipient velocity of sediment different researchers have established equations for the incipient sediment velocity based on multitudinous influencing factors the following equation was used to calculate the incipient velocity of the sediment in the flume zhang et al 2007 1 v c 1 34 h d 0 14 γ s γ γ gd 3 36 10 7 10 h d 0 72 0 5 where v c represents the incipient velocity of the sediments h represents the water depth of the flume d is the grain size of the sediments γ is the unit weight of water and γ s is the unit weight of the sediments the incipient velocity of the sediments differs depending on the grain size because the particle size of the sediment samples ranges from small to large a unified incipient velocity cannot be obtained however an incipient velocity corresponding to the sediment grain size of different cumulative frequencies can be calculated the results are presented in table 2 indicating that all starting velocities of the sediments with different grain sizes are greater than 0 20 m s to ensure that the sediments are in a static state in the entire flume the velocity of the overlying water was set to 0 03 m s which was significantly lesser than the starting velocity in addition a rectifier grid was set at the entrance of the flume to ensure the smooth and uniform flow of the overlying water 2 4 circulatory flume a newly designed circulating flume with a slope of 0 5 was used in this study fig 2 the pump pours the water from the downhill section to the uphill section the flow advects into the straight line section through a grid to reduce the turbulence caused by the pump the flume was 0 2 m wide 0 3 m high and 1 5 m long in the straight line section the inner and outer diameters of the arc section were 0 4 and 0 8 m respectively the overall length width and height of the experimental device were 2 3 0 8 and 0 3 m respectively this flume effectively prevents turbulence and the straight line section simulates the flow pattern of the waterbody under natural conditions well the experiments were conducted in duplicate under different temperatures 2 5 experimental setup and sample analysis to explore the differences in the phosphorus release process at different temperatures six temperatures were considered 5 10 15 17 5 20 and 22 5 c the experiments are conducted in a circulating flume as illustrated in fig s1 a to prevent a significant reduction of the water volume after sampling the water to sediment ratio was set to 20 1 during the experiments the water depth in the flume was 0 1 m to ensure that the overlying water flows through the flume and the sediment particles remain stationary the experimental velocity was set to 0 03 m s when the temperature experiments were conducted the flume was placed in a constant temperature and humidity chamber with a length of 4 m width of 3 m and height of 2 m as depicted in fig s1 b before commencement of the experiment the constant temperature and humidity chamber was set to the preset working temperature the sediments were placed at the bottom of the experiment flume and a separate container was filled with distilled water all samples were placed in the constant temperature and humidity chamber until the temperature of the distilled water reached the set temperature then distilled water was slowly and carefully poured into the flume triggering the phosphorous release process during the experiment 5 ml water samples were simultaneously obtained at heights of 1 and 7 cm below the water surface both of them were tested and the test results were averaged to represent the value of the overlying water the samples were centrifuged with a temperature controlled centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min and the supernatant was used for the determination of the tp concentration in the overlying water by molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry after digestion with potassium persulfate water quality determination of total phosphorus ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method the test procedure used for the dissolved phosphorus dp concentration was the same as that utilised for the tp concentration except that the water samples were separated using a 0 45 μm filter membrane the difference between the tp and dp concentrations is the particulate phosphorus pp concentration li et al 2013b he et al 2015 interstitial water samples were obtained from underneath the sediment water interface using a pinhole sampler which inevitably introduces a small amount of sediment to the sample the sampling volume was 5 ml therefore centrifugation with a temperature controlled centrifuge 1000 rpm 5 min was required before the test and the supernatant was then used for the measurement the tp concentration of the interstitial water samples was determined using molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry after digestion with potassium persulfate based on previous studies jiang et al 2008 li et al 2013a it is known that physical and chemical parameters such as water ph do and redox potential eh also affect the release of phosphorus from the sediments in this study we focused on temperature assuming that the changes in the other parameters are insignificant to avoid isolating the phosphorus release processes table 3 presents the measurement results of these indicators ph was measured using fg2 elk mettler toledo usa do was measured using hq30d hach usa eh was measured using ct 8022 kedida china these parameters were only checked once in each temperature experiment 3 results 3 1 changes in tp concentration of the interstitial and overlying water the changes in the tp concentration of the interstitial and overlying water at different water temperatures are illustrated in fig 3 and fig s2 during the phosphorus release the tp concentration of the interstitial water gradually decreased whereas the tp concentration of the overlying water gradually increased within the first 120 min of the experiment the tp concentration of the interstitial water rapidly decreased whereas the tp concentration of the overlying water rapidly increased the rate of change in the phosphorus concentration was extremely high at the beginning of the experiment and then significantly decreased after 120 min and became extremely low finally when the tp concentrations of the interstitial and overlying water remained constant the phosphorus release processes were considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium with the increase in the experimental temperature the tp concentration change became more significant at 5 c the tp concentration of the interstitial water gradually decreased from 0 074 to 0 062 mg l fig s2 a but only two concentration values appeared in the entire release process an increase in the tp concentration of the overlying water was not observed as depicted in fig 3 a b and c the tp concentration of the interstitial water decreases tp concentration of the overlying water increases and the concentration gradient significantly changes with the increase in temperature when the temperature is further increased the concentration gradient significantly changes at 20 and 22 5 c as depicted in fig 3 d and fig s2 b respectively and the tp concentration curve of the interstitial water exhibits a downward trend whereas the tp concentration curve of the overlying water exhibits an upward trend overall phosphorus was transferred from the sediments and the interstitial water to the overlying water thereby increasing the tp concentration of the overlying water 3 2 equilibrium concentration of tp in the overlying water the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water during the release of phosphorus from the sediments at different water temperatures is illustrated in fig 4 at different temperatures the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water are similar with increasing time the tp concentration of the overlying water gradually increases when the experiment reaches an equilibrium the tp concentration of the overlying water does not further increase and the curve gradually flattens however the tp concentrations differ at different temperatures at a water temperature ranging from 5 to 20 c the equilibrium concentrations of tp in the overlying water increase with the increase in the temperature at 20 c the tp concentration of the overlying water is 0 058 mg l that is 2 4 times the equilibrium concentration at 5 c 1 9 times that at 10 c and 1 4 times that at 15 c at a temperature ranging from 20 to 22 5 c the tp equilibrium concentration only increases by 0 001 mg l and the changes in the tp concentration of the overlying water are almost identical the correlation between the equilibrium concentration of the tp at an arbitrary temperature and that at 20 c is shown in fig 5 the equilibrium concentration of tp at an arbitrary temperature is related to the equilibrium concentration of tp at 20 c the correlation can be expressed as follows 2 ec tp t 0 9517 ec tp 20 e 0 0588 t 20 where ec tp t is the equilibrium concentration of the tp at an arbitrary temperature ec tp 20 is the equilibrium concentration of the tp at 20 c and t is the arbitrary temperature the correlation coefficient r 2 is 0 9539 3 3 distribution of phosphorus fractions in the overlying water when phosphorus is released into the overlying water two species can be observed pp and dp the species are classified based on whether they can pass through a 45 μm filter membrane and the tp concentration is the sum of concentrations of the two species the changes in the different phosphorus species in the overlying water under different water temperatures are depicted in fig 6 the results reveal that the changes in the pp and dp concentrations are inconsistent at 10 20 and 22 5 c fig 6 a d and fig s3 b respectively the pp concentration is higher than the dp concentration at 5 and 15 c fig s3 a and fig 6 b respectively the pp concentration is lower than the dp concentration at 17 5 c as is depicted in fig 6 c the pp and dp concentrations are significantly similar the phosphorus concentrations do not uniformly change with the change in temperature in addition the changes in the pp and dp concentrations with time remain uncertain from the beginning to the end of the release the dp concentration in the overlying water gradually increases similar to the tp concentration however the pp concentration in the overlying water does not uniformly increase or decrease particularly at 5 and 22 5 c fig s3 a and fig s3 b respectively but significantly fluctuates the numerical volatility diminishes over time 3 4 computation of tp release rate using the method discussed in section 3 1 the equilibrium times are determined as follows 5 c 10h 10 c 8 h 15 c 8 h 17 5 c 8 h 20 c 8 h and 22 5 c 6 h the phosphorus release rate of the sediments can be calculated using the following equation jiang et al 2008 jin et al 2007 3 r r m e a t e c e c 0 v e a t e where r r is the average tp release rate of the sediments in all the phosphorus release processes mg m2 h a is the area of the interface between the sediments and overlying water m2 m e is the total amount of phosphorus released from the sediments to the overlying water when the equilibrium is reached mg c e is the tp concentration of the overlying water when the release of phosphorus in the sediments reaches the equilibrium mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of the overlying water at the beginning of the experiment mg l v e is the volume of the overlying water when the phosphorus release reaches the equilibrium l and t e is the time it takes to reach the equilibrium h fig 7 depicts the correlation between the tp release rate r r of the sediments at various temperatures and that at 20 c in the range of 5 22 5 c the release rate of phosphorus in the sediments increases with increasing temperature the following equation can be used to calculate the release rate 4 r r t 1 0482 r r 20 e 0 099 t 20 where r r t is the tp release rate of the sediments at an arbitrary temperature and r r 20 is the tp release rate of the sediments at 20 c the correlation coefficient r 2 is 0 9911 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus release processes the results of previous studies indicated that phosphorus enters the overlying water through two processes that is molecular diffusion from the interstitial water to the overlying water chatelain and guizien 2010 steinberger and hondzo 1999 wang et al 2013a and desorption from the sediment surface to the overlying water andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 xie et al 2003 wang et al 2013b as depicted in fig 3 the tp concentrations of the interstitial water gradually decrease with increasing time and the tp concentrations of the overlying water increase during the release of phosphorus at different temperatures this suggests that molecular diffusion from the interstitial water to the overlying water occurs fig 8 depicts that the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water tp concentration of the interstitial water of the first sample gradually increases from 5 to 20 c this correlation agrees with the results of previous research which demonstrated that the amount of phosphorus release from the sediments to the interstitial water is enhanced in a warmer climate wang et al 2013a however the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water at 22 5 c is lower than that at 17 5 and 20 c this may be related to the reabsorption of phosphorus from the interstitial water by the sediments although the initial tp concentration of the interstitial water at 22 5 c is lower than that at 17 5 and 20 c the equilibrium tp concentration ec tp of the overlying water at 22 5 c is the highest among all temperatures as depicted in fig 8 this indicates that phosphorus may enter the overlying water through a different process thus desorption from the sediment surface to the overlying water also plays an important role in phosphorus release 4 2 time to reach equilibrium time in this study the phosphorus release process was considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium when the difference in the tp concentrations between two adjacent time points were less than 0 002 mg l the concentration at this time was considered as the equilibrium concentration and the corresponding sampling time was considered as the equilibrium time previous experimental studies of the phosphorus release process have demonstrated that the equilibrium time is not uniform owing to the different disturbance conditions of various studies table 4 presents the comparison of different phosphorus release processes when the experiment condition was static overlying water plus static sediments the disturbance intensity of the overlying water acting on the sediments was weak and the time it took to reach the equilibrium was expressed in days under conditions with flowing overlying water the time required to reach the equilibrium was expressed in hours therefore it can be concluded that the stronger the disturbance intensity the shorter the time required to reach the equilibrium in the phosphorus release process in conclusion the equilibrium time of the phosphorus release process is related to the intensity of disturbance note that the equilibrium time also depends on the overall design of the experiment and phosphorus concentrations of the sediments 4 3 equations for the calculation of the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp in this study the correlation between the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp at an arbitrary temperature and the equilibrium concentration and release rate of tp at 20 c was analysed the ec tp and r r at any temperature can be calculated using eqs 2 and 4 respectively however the application of these equations to all phosphorus release processes has two limitations one is that different sediments have different phosphorus adsorption capacities and thus the phosphorus concentration that can be released also differs this was confirmed in a previous study sharpley and ahuja 1982 the second limitation is that the disturbance conditions of different studies may be different as discussed in section 4 2 the time taken to reach the equilibrium is directly affected by the disturbance intensity therefore the release rate may also be affected by the disturbance intensity thus these equations may not provide the basis for the calculation of the release of all types of sediments under various disturbance conditions however the method used to establish the empirical equations may be valuable for related research that is to establish the correlation between ec tp or r r at an arbitrary temperature and ec tp or r r at 20 c in comparison with the equations derived in this paper previous studies on the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release rate were either qualitative studies or found it difficult to apply the numerical relationship in practice the phosphorus release experiments were conducted in the dark at 5 25 and 35 c the results indicated that the concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved total phosphorus dtp and tp in the overlying water increased as the temperature increased jiang et al 2008 holdren and armstrong 1980 demonstrated that an increase in the temperature affected the phosphorus release rate in these two experimental studies the effects of temperature on the phosphorus release rate were qualitatively determined subsequent studies focused on the numerical relationship between the water temperature and phosphorus release rate for example the results of one study indicated that the tp release rate of the sediments increased by 13 20 36 98 and dtp release rate increased by 11 14 47 93 with each increase in the temperature by 10 c xue and lu 2015 however this study could not determine the equilibrium concentration of tp at an arbitrary temperature similarly another study demonstrated that the equilibrium concentration at 30 c was 3 3 times that at 20 c and 6 2 times that at 10 c wu et al 2014 in a previous study it was pointed out that the maximum cumulative amount of released phosphorus increases linearly with the increase in temperature a correlation equation of y 0 00317x 0 00928 r2 0 94731 y represents the maximum cumulative amount of phosphorus x represents the water temperature was obtained li et al 2013a thus it is meaningless to simply associate the water temperature with the amount of released phosphorus 4 4 possible reasons for the effect of temperature on the release of phosphorus the increase in temperature leads to an increase in the amount of released phosphorus as well as the release rate numerous studies have focused on the reason why the temperature promotes the phosphorus release with the increase in temperature the activity of microorganisms significantly increases jiang et al 2008 the do concentration in the overlying water decreases owing to the consumption by microorganisms leading to a decrease in the redox potential the transformation from fe3 to fe2 is enhanced resulting in the release of fe p from the sediments holdren and armstrong 1980 kosten et al 2012 similarly the results of another study indicated that elevated temperatures lead to a decrease in the thickness of the oxidised surface layer thereby inducing the release of fe bound phosphorus jensen and andersen 1992 in this study no measures were taken to limit the microbial activity it is possible that the increase in the temperature enhances the microbial activity and thus influences the release of phosphorus which may promote the desorption from the sediment surface to the interstitial and overlying water in addition in agreement with wang et al 2013a the tp concentrations of the interstitial water obtained in this study were higher than that of the overlying water the diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water occurred from high concentration to low concentration complying with fick s first law of diffusion based on fick s first law temperature affects the diffusion coefficient he et al 2006 and thus the release of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water in a previous study similar results were revealed lei et al 2018 in summary an increase in the temperature enhances the diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water 4 5 experimental interference factors in this study the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release processes was primarily studied however other factors that may interfere with the experiment were also examined the results are presented in table 3 during the temperature experiments the ph do and eh were measured after the first sampling in all experiments distilled water was used as the overlying water the ph ranged from 7 60 to 7 91 representing a small variation and values close to neutral values this implies that ph does not affect the phosphorus release the do ranged from 8 0 to 9 5 mg l the overlying water was placed in the incubator for a long time thus the water solubility changed colt 2012 leading to a change in the do content of the water based on the experimental design do was not consumed by or added to the overlying water the same ventilation system was used in all experiments the change in temperature resulted in a change in the do content in conclusion the change in the do content is reasonable and does not affect the results the eh ranged from 209 to 222 mv its variation range is significantly small and its change with temperature is not uniform therefore eh does not affect the accuracy of the experimental results 5 conclusions in conclusion the temperature significantly affects the release of phosphorus from the sediments to the overlying water this was reflected by the equilibrium concentration of tp ec tp in the overlying water and release rate of tp r r based on the temperature experiments the correlation between ec tp or r r at an arbitrary temperature and ec tp or r r at 20 c was established in this study a method is proposed that can be used to determine the effect of temperature on phosphorus release although it may not be applicable to different types of sediments and different disturbance intensities phosphorus release processes from the sediments to the overlying water and possible reasons of the effect of temperature on the phosphorus release were discussed in this paper the increase in the water temperature enhances both the activity of microorganisms and diffusion of phosphorus from the interstitial water to the overlying water thus affecting phosphorus release funding this work was

1476,globally groundwater heavy metal hm pollution is a serious concern threatening drinking water safety as well as human and animal health therefore evaluation of groundwater hm pollution is essential to prevent accompanying hazardous ecological impacts in this aspect the effectiveness of various groundwater hm pollution evaluation approaches should be examined for their level of trustworthiness in this study 226 groundwater samples from arang of chhattisgarh state india were collected and analyzed measured concentration for various hms were further used to calculate six groundwater pollution indices such as the hm pollution index hpi hm evaluation index hei contamination index ci entropy weight based hm contamination index ehci heavy metal index hmi and principal component analysis based metal index pmi groundwater in the study area was mainly contaminated by elevated cd fe and pb concentrations due to natural and anthropogenic pollution moreover this study explored the performance of deep learning dl based predictive models via comparative study two hidden layers with 26 and 19 neurons in the first and second hidden layers respectively were optimised along with rectified linear unit activation function a mini batch gradient descent was also applied to ensure smooth convergence of the training dataset into the model results demonstrated that the dl pmi scored lowest errors 0 022 for mean square error mse 0 140 for mean absolute error mae and 0 148 for root mean square error rmse in the model validation than the other dl based groundwater hm pollution model prediction performances of all pollution indices were also verified using artificial neural network ann based models which also highlighted the lowest validation error for ann pmi mse 3 93 mae 1 38 and rmse 1 98 furthermore the prediction accuracies of pmi using both ann and dl models scored the highest r2 value of 0 95 and 0 99 respectively therefore it is suggested that groundwater hm pollution using pmi as the best indexing approach in the present study area moreover compared to benchmark ann the dl performed better hence it could be concluded that the proposed dl model may be suitable approach in the field of computational chemistry by handling overfitting problems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater hm pollution indices deep learning geographical information system pollution zones india 1 introduction this paper aims to assess the effectiveness of groundwater hm pollution indices using ml technique in order to achieve this target a systematic groundwater pollution study was conducted by considering nine hm concentrations to compute six well established pollution indices which were further taken into account to develop groundwater pollution prediction models with the aid of ml techniques viz ann and dl in the current study as per the best knowledge of authors for the first time the application of dl model was proposed to predict the effectiveness of groundwater hm pollution indices on the other hand a parallel study was also conducted using a shallow neural network model i e ann to compare the prediction performances of the model with that of the performances achieved by the dl model several earlier studies had examined the effectiveness of hm pollution indices by traditional statistical approaches despite the ample of studies were performed for the improvement of hm pollution assessment through various indices no attempt has been made so far to investigate the effectiveness of these indices by ml techniques therefore to fill in this gap an attempt was made to evaluate the most effective groundwater hm pollution indexing method based on the predictability of ml models heavy metals hms are the most studied contaminants in potable water resources because of their high toxicity even at low concentrations marcovecchio et al 2007 according to ali et al 2019 hms is among the most hazardous pollutants particularly because of the biogeochemical recycling toxicity and environmental risks of these substances in ecosystems highly toxic hms at levels even marginally exceeding prescribed limits may render water more hazardous than would the presence of comparatively low toxicity metals at much higher concentrations apart from the risk appraisal of hms in water various index based quality measures have been implemented globally to assess hm pollution level of groundwater surface water and sediments islam et al 2015 singh et al 2017 ahn et al 2019 saleh et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2020 groundwater pollution due to excessive hm concentrations is commonly evaluated by determining the hm pollution index hpi mohan et al 1996 hm evaluation index hei edet and offiong 2002 and contamination index ci prasanna et al 2012 entropy weight based contamination index ehci singh et al 2019 hm index hmi dash et al 2019 and pca based metal index pmi giri and singh 2019 however there is no such globally standard hm pollution index to assess metal pollutions in groundwater sources the drawbacks in computation of these indices are time taking lengthy tedious chances of human error involvement and have discrepancies as hm indices use different computational equations the solution to overcome these problems may be achieved by adopting a non physical approach which can efficiently predict hm pollution through ml technique moreover based on the literature survey the superiority of the newly developed hm pollution indices such as ehci hmi and pmi were established by comparing their computed results with the traditional hm pollution indices i e hpi hei and ci in the respective studies in this regards authors had proved the effectiveness of their proposed indices by examining or comparing the pollution status of each sampling locations using both newly developed indices and traditional indices and conducting correlation analysis between them till date none of the study has investigated the effectiveness of hm pollution indices using a ml platform in this context ml based water quality index prediction models have been utilized by some researchers by considering various physicochemical parameters liu et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 bui et al 2020 prediction of hm concentration in river water and groundwater implementing ml techniques such as artificial neural network ann general regression neural network grnn multiple linear regression mlr multi output adaptive neural fuzzy inference system manfis support vector machine svm have been also reported by several researchers gholami et al 2011 aryafar et al 2012 bayatzadeh fard et al 2017 sonmez et al 2018 bhagat et al 2020 boudaghpour and malekmohammadi 2020 in their respective studies in many parts of the world in all of these research works hm concentrations were predicted through ml based prediction models nevertheless till date none of the research work has been reported on the application of ml technique to predict hm pollution indices the role of ml in the field of hydrology and water resources has become popular in recent years one such ml technique is the ann widely applied in water resource this information processing system works on learning the features memorizing them and generalizing of input dataset that are assigned in the training process application of ann in groundwater related studies can be utilized with significant level of accuracy for the development of management policies in a wide range of groundwater issues related to both qualitative and quantitative concerns yang et al 2009 behzad et al 2010 the deep learning dl technique is topical in current artificial intelligence research this technique has been gaining attention for its capability of managing multi dimensional datasets because of its flexible model structure powerful generalization and strong learning capabilities heo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 several

2020 yim et al 2020 in the current study groundwater pollution was evaluated via hm concentrations of groundwater samples collected from arang chhattisgarh india arang was selected because it represents a rural part of chhattisgarh where agricultural fertilizer and manure have extensively been applied over a long period deteriorating the groundwater quality in the area singha et al 2019 in the present research nine hms including as cd cu cr fe mn ni pb and zn were used to compute six well reported hm pollution indices namely hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi two ml techniques namely ann and

administering a standard solution of each hm to be analyzed the quality of analyzed values was ensured by analyzing a certified reference material srm 1640a blank sample and standards mean values of three replicates were employed for each metal determination analytical precession was checked to ensure an analytical error of less than 3 by calibrating the instrument with standards as well as blanks after performing experiments for every 10 samples the detection limit of as cd cu cr fe mn ni pb and zn were 0 3 0 00025 4 0 00242 15 2 0 00857 0 00388 and 4 μg l respectively the minimum value for as and mn were recorded as below detection limit bdl during sample collection a portable global positioning system device was used to record the latitude and longitude of each groundwater sampling point 3 2 empirically assessed hm pollution indices the analyzed results of the hm concentrations were further used to determine six quality protocols for groundwater pollution comprising hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi out of 226 groundwater samples the concentration of as and mn for three samples two and one respectively were measured as bdl the concentrations of as and mn were excluded from the computation of various indices for these three groundwater samples the values of hpi hei ci ehci and hmi were computed as per the limits prescribed by bis 2012 table 1 the description of these hm pollution indices are illustrated below 3 2 1 hpi hpi assesses the combined impact of individual hm on the overall water quality status mohan et al 1996 it s computation process is based on the rating system value ranges between 0 and 1 to the selected hms that can be assigned either depending on the relative significance of individual hm in view of quality concerns or by determining the values inversely proportional to the maximum permissible s i and maximum desirable limits i i for the respective hm bis 2012 hpi values for the groundwater samples were calculated as per the equation given in table 2 the groundwater quality of the study area can be classified into five categories namely excellent 25 good 25 50 poor 50 75 very poor 75 100 and unsuitable 100 the drinking water critical value for hpi is 100 as proposed by prasad and bose 2001 3 2 2 hei hei is the similar method like hpi that provides the overall water quality with respect to hms edet and offiong 2002 in this method the hei value of a sample was computed by dividing the measured concentration of any particular hm by the maximum permissible concentration s i bis 2012 of the corresponding hm as per the equation given in table 2 since there is no critical value suggested for hei evaluation of pollution level in this metric depends on the worker s judgment hence to identify the pollution level in the study area the multiple of mean approach prasanna et al 2012 was adopted for classifying the groundwater into three pollution categories as low moderate and high 3 2 3 ci the ci provides the degree of contamination by summarizing the combined effects of several quality parameters considered harmful to domestic water backman et al 1998 in the present analysis the ci values were computed by adding the contamination factors of individual hms exceeding the maximum permissible value c si bis 2012 ci values were estimated as per the equation given in table 2 the groundwater ci values can be categorized into three pollution classes namely low 1 moderate 1 3 and high 3 backman et al 1998 edet and offiong 2002 critical value of ci is 3 for household consumption as suggested by backman et al 1998 3 2 4 ehci the ehci provides the water quality based on information entropy concept singh et al 2019 in this method entropy weight w i for hms were computed using shannon entropy information technique and then sub indices q i were coupled with the weights to calculate the ehci value as per the equation given in table 2 ehci values can be categorized into five classes namely excellent 50 good 50 100 average 100 150 poor 150 200 and unsuitable 200 as per the drinking water consideration the critical value of ehci is 200 singh et al 2019 3 2 5 hmi the hmi is a principal component analysis pca based multivariate statistical technique which represents the water quality of an area dash et al 2019 in this method pca provides the factor loadings by considering factors having eigenvalues greater than 1 the multiplied value of pca based relative eigenvalues and factor loading generates corresponding hm weight p i which is further used to calculate hmi as per the equation given in table 2 hmi values can be categorized into five classes namely excellent 50 good 50 100 average 100 200 poor 200 300 and unsuitable 300 the drinking water critical value of ehci is 300 and above this value water is unfit for drinking dash et al 2019 3 2 6 pmi the pmi is a pca based multivariate metal indexing approach which does not require any permissible limit or desirable limits in the process of computation as proposed by giri and singh 2019 a non standardized pca metal index nspmi of each sampling point is calculated using initially extracted factor score fs i of individual factor variance explain by corresponding factor v i and the total variance explained v t the nspmi for all derived factors are added in which both negative and positive value may arise hence a standardized pca based metal index pmi is further calculated to interpret the results in a convenient way as per the equation given in table 2 all pmi values were used to estimate three quantiles and accordingly groundwater samples were categorized into three pollution classes namely low moderate and high however critical value of pmi is not specific and it depends on the third quantile value 3 3 application of ml techniques in the present study in the present study two ml techniques namely ann and dl were applied for the prediction of hm pollution indices using supervised learning where the sample wise selected nine hm concentrations and their corresponding pollution indices were considered as the model inputs and outputs respectively the computed indices and concentration of each hm for all groundwater samples were normalized and used as dataset by ann and dl models namely ann hpi ann hei ann ci ann ehci ann hmi ann pmi dl hpi dl hei dl ci dl ehci dl hmi and dl pmi dataset were annotated for the supervised learning in both the models 3 3 1 ann approach ann based prediction models are the mostly applied approaches used for the simulation of hms in last two decades bhagat et al 2020 the basic structure of ann consists of three layers including the input layer hidden layer and the output layer the selection of neurons in the hidden layer depends upon the bias minimization associated with the existing problem bishop 1995 among various learning algorithm the back propagation bp is the most frequently utilized method for training a neural network banerjee et al 2019 in the interconnected network all the neurons are activated by a sigmoid function which is described by the following equation 1 f y 1 1 e y where y is the input data in the stage of model output a linear kernel function was used to minimise the computing time and enhance the robustness of the ann model the finalization of the optimal neural network is a trial and error based approach sun et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 jafari and javidi 2020 ann model comprising two hidden layers helps to reduce the bias in the neural network and protects from overfitting issue yurtsever et al 2014 bokde et al 2018 however to maintain smooth model learning process for nine inputs the prediction ability of ann was improved by constructing two hidden layers six and three neurons in first and second hidden layers respectively in the current study suditu et al 2013 esmaeili and aghababai beni 2015 package neuralnet was used to run the ann model in r software version 3 6 1 however the application of ann and its detailed methodology have been reported elsewhere rojas 1996 ham and kostanic 2000 russell and norvig 2010 3 3 2 dl approach the dl based model formed a major part of the method in this study the complexity of deep neural networks is greater than that of conventional neural networks in the latter the three layer back propagated structure namely input hidden and output layers is mainly adopted which determines the weights of connected links between nodes depending on the training dataset and processes to minimise the least mean square error of the neural network wang et al 2011 the current dl method is a two layer approach involving model calibration and validation during model calibration splitting of dataset into two parts namely training and testing datasets mini batch mb processing of the training dataset and model optimisation were performed model validation mainly comprised error estimation based on model predictions and actual values using various statistical indices these steps are expounded in the next section the basic architecture of the present deep neural network comprises three part including multi inputs a1 to a9 two hidden layers with multiple neurons 1st hidden layer h11 to h126 and 2nd hidden layer h21 to h219 and a single output p fig 3 the analyses done in the present research were performed in r software specially keras package https www rproject org was used exclusively to run the dl models in r 3 3 3 model calibration in the proposed dl based back propagated feed forward neural network model the entire dataset was split for model training and testing purposes to eliminate the inverse impact of input variables because of their varying scale nine input variable data hms and computed pollution indices were normalized to bring them to the same scale 0 1 data normalization leads to the steady convergence of datasets into the model kılıçaslan et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 the present dataset was pre processed through normalization using the following equation 2 r r r min r max r min where r is the normalized input data and r min and r max are the minimum and maximum values of the input data respectively another essential component adopted in the present study was the allocation of the training dataset to an mb the total dataset was 226 and out of which a total of 184 numbers dataset were allotted for model training furthermore groundwater samples three samples having as and mn concentration below detection limit were identified through a close investigation and eliminated from model training dataset 184 nos as it could mislead the supervised learning process of prediction model therefore 181 dataset were finalized for the model training purpose an mb size of 25 32 was considered for the proposed model even though 25 mb is the default size and may vary depending on the training dataset many researchers have suggested this mb size as superior based on their best model performance bengio 2012 masters and luschi 2018 moreover the training dataset of the back propagated network was treated with a gradient descent optimising algorithm and l2 regularization ridge regularization which provided the optimal parameter weight to prevent overfitting issues and model complexity kabán 2013 wang and cao 2017 ahmed et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in the data driven model and to ensure the stable convergence of each mb training dataset into the model qian et al 2015 an mb gradient descent mbgd optimisation algorithm rather than full batch gradient or stochastic gradient descent was used because of the slow learning speed caused by the convergence of whole training datasets for a single iteration epoch in the case of full batch gradient descent whereas the faster learning speed through poor convergence of the training dataset into the model was ensured by stochastic gradient descent furthermore in terms of penalty adding of l2 regularization in the dl algorithm computes the summation of the absolute values of the weight parameters to the loss function which reduces the model complexity the mse loss function l o was used in mbgd calculations in the following equation 3 l o 1 n i 1 n o p 2 where l o is the loss function n is the number of training datasets and o and p respectively represent the observed and predicted output value of ith sample to achieve the revised weight parameters in terms of a new loss function l l2 regularization and l o were jointly considered in the mbgd algorithm 4 l l o λ 2 n i 1 n ε i 2 where l 2 λ 2 n i 1 n ε i 2 where l is the loss function along with l o λ 0 represents the l2 regularization coefficient and ε is the weight parameter matrix as the number of parameters is more than one the partial derivative of the loss function with regards to ε was used as follows 5 l ε l o ε λ n ε thus the calculation of ε in each gradient could be determined by the following equations 6a ε ε α l o ε λ n ε 6b ε α l o ε λ n ε ε 1 α λ n α l o ε where the learning rate of the mbgd calculation is denoted by α and α 0 the value of α for the optimal algorithm was considered as 0 001 hence for all the positive values of α n and λ the values computed in the weight parameter matrix decreased batch normalization bn was implemented in the dl algorithm to overcome the problem of no convergence and overfitting ma et al 2020 fig 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of applying bn to the dl algorithm which prevent the falling of the model from plateau effect ioffe and szegedy 2015 bn conveniently converge the given dataset in every batch in the dl model according to ioffe and szegedy 2015 the transformation of bn ensures that the layer in the training model can prolong learning for given inputs accelerating the training via a small internal covariate shift the dl model normalizes the dataset in every activation layer helping to minimise the complexity of the mbgd thus enhancing model performance ioffe and szegedy 2015 the following equation was used for bn in the current model 7 r i r i x b y b 2 where x b and y b respectively represent the actual layer output batch mean and standard deviation is a constant with an arbitrarily small value non zero to prevent the denominator from being zero subsequently the batch normalized layer was run and the weight and bias were computed as follows 8 p i batchnormalised layer ε δ ε r i δ where p i is the final model output and ε and δ are the weight and bias of the model respectively the rectified linear unit relu function was used for each hidden layer input this was a simpler estimator compared to the commonly applied sigmoid activation function since it did not require the exponential function in addition relu secures the training process of back propagated gradient descent from the vanishing descent event which is detrimental to the model learning progress glorot et al 2011 goodfellow et al 2016 the following mathematical expression for relu is given as 9 p x x 0 if x 0 if x 0 where max 0 x where p is the activation function and x is the neuron input signal the derivative of eq 9 was further used to perform the back propagation structure using the following equation 10 p x x 0 if x 0 if x 0 3 3 4 validation model the ann and dl models were validated by considering randomly selected 42 groundwater samples data of the training datasets the performance of the proposed prediction models was evaluated based on errors between the final model prediction results and actual values using three statistical indices namely mean square error mse mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 mse measures the average of squared error computed by model overall the input instances the smaller the value of mse better the model performance ranković et al 2010 mae measures the average of absolute values of individual prediction errors by model overall the input instances while in the rmse the model performance is measured by computing the root value of averaged errors in this process errors are squared before they are averaged the range of mae and rmse may be in between 0 and infinity however the smaller value of mae and rmse signifies the better model performance pak et al 2020 r2 measures the proportion of fluctuation exists among the predicted and actual value in other words it represents the strength of linear association between predicted and actual value where r2 0 8 and 0 5 represents strong and weak linear relationship respectively 4 results groundwater hm pollution by evaluating different indices was considered and the performances of prediction models and preciseness of computed indices were explored in this section the results and findings are discussed to investigate the model accuracy based on actual and predicted groundwater hm pollution indices for a regional groundwater system 4 1 statistics of groundwater hm concentration and indices the statistical report of groundwater hm concentrations is presented in table 1 the statistical results show that except for the mean concentrations of cd fe and pb the mean hm concentrations of rest of the metals were below the maximum permissible limits bis 2012 a total of approximately 51 92 and 93 of groundwater samples having concentrations of cd fe and pb above the maximum permissible limits respectively whereas about 2 1 and 4 had as ni and cu concentrations above the maximum permissible limits bis 2012 respectively furthermore a considerable number of samples approx 27 had mn concentrations that exceeded the maximum permissible limits of the bis 2012 the groundwater hm pollution indices using various approaches were computed as per the adopted procedures table 2 the statistics of computed hm pollution indices showed that hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi varied from approximately 5 to 396 2 to 42 0 to 37 23 to 589 36 to 834 and 18 to 82 with the approximate mean value of 116 7 4 104 156 and 44 respectively table 3 4 2 spatial distribution of hm pollution indices to visualise the variation in spatial distribution of groundwater hm pollution in the study area all the sampling locations and their various computed observed indices were imported into arcgis 10 3 software to prepare the hm pollution indices maps fig 5 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was adopted to prepare the spatial distribution maps due to its robustness gong et al 2014 elumalai et al 2017 moharir et al 2019 according to miri et al 2016 idw is the non statistical process which predicts the concentration of pollutant at any unmeasured site by optimal spatial predicting method as there is no critical value suggested for hei a multiple mean approach was considered for this metric for better understanding the hm pollution level in groundwater the computed mean value of hei within the study area was approximately 7 and accordingly the whole study area was categorized into three pollution categories namely low hei 7 moderate hei 7 to 14 and high hei 14 furthermore the pmi indices of all sample locations were used to estimate the 3 quantiles to reclassify the study area into hm pollution zones according to their pmi values as suggested by giri and singh 2019 the pmi values varied from approximately 18 to 82 with an average of approx 44 table 3 groundwater samples having higher pmi value represents higher pollution status and vice versa accordingly the study area was categorized into three sub classes based on the estimated three quantile values namely low approx 18 37 moderate approx 37 49 and high approx 49 82 pmi zones spatial distribution maps of various indices are shown in fig 5 a f the hpi spatial distribution map showed that the north western central and south eastern portions of the study region had hpi 150 i e groundwater of these areas fell under average to unsuitable for drinking category fig 5a a similar pattern of groundwater pollution status were noticed in hei ci ehci and hmi where the central and lower northern part of study area had hei 14 moderate to high pollution category ci 3 unsuitable for domestic purpose ehci 150 average to unsuitable for drinking category and hmi 200 poor to unsuitable for drinking category fig 5b e the pmi map showed that the north western central central eastern and few pockets of central northern parts of the study region fell under high polluted criteria due to pmi 37 fig 5f 4 3 performance of ml based prediction models the performances of ml based prediction model are reported after performing the model optimization procedure in preliminary model run stage in this stage the algorithms and structures of ann and dl models were finalized based on trial and error method then after the final performances of the models were executed and recorded 4 3 1 preliminary model run of proposed dl model before finalizing the proposed dl model optimal structure and its algorithm parallel experiments were conducted in the training stage initially to conduct the experiments only one prediction model namely dl pmi was selected as a representative model instead of selecting all the dl based models according to the results obtained from dl pmi the data splitting and structure of the network was fixed for all the models a series of split ratios namely 70 30 75 25 80 20 and 85 15 were initially chosen for the network based on the best i e lowest rmse result an 80 20 partitioning ratio was used for all the dl based models table 4 all the split ratios of the training and testing datasets were applied five times to the pmi prediction model i e dl pmi the means of the rmse values are shown in table 4 the basic network structure of dl models includes the number of input layers hidden layers neurons in each hidden layer and output layers in this study the total number of input layers was nine concentrations of nine hms and a single output layer index value of associated hm pollution approach hence to find the optimal structure for the proposed network the number of hidden layers and neurons was determined by varying the number of hidden layers by varying a common difference between the consecutive numbers of neurons in the hidden layers this approach was based on the study of fan and cheng 2018 moreover dl pmi with an 80 20 dataset split ratio was used for the experiment and the performance results were recorded table 5 shows the test performance results and the best results having been obtained from the structure with a set of 9 26 19 1 showing that the network structure with two hidden layers exhibited the lowest rmse value 0 002 with 26 neurons in the first hidden layer and 19 in the second henceforth the optimal network structure 9 26 19 1 was used for all the dl based prediction models 4 3 2 outcomes based on prediction models the proposed prediction models structure and algorithm were finalized by determining the best performance via several tests experiments ann based prediction model for various indices were run by considering two hidden layer with a set of six and three neurons at a split ratio of 80 20 for training and testing was run with two repetitions the performance statistics of ann based prediction models in training and testing process were evaluated using mse and mae table 6 based on the model performance evaluation results it is observed that ann hpi scores the highest mse values i e 18 29 and 20 33 during training of model and highest mae values of 2 51 and 2 64 during testing of model respectively whereas the ann pmi scores the lowest error values mse 4 19 and 4 66 mae 1 52 and 1 73 in both model training and testing process table 6 the back propagated feed forward neural network with two hidden layers with a combination of 26 and 19 neurons at a split ratio of 80 20 for training and testing was run for 400 epochs to predict the groundwater hm pollution indices using dl hpi dl hei dl ci dl ehci dl hmi and dl pmi fig 6a b shows that the dl pmi attained the lowest loss values i e 0 017 based on the training dataset and 0 001 based on the testing dataset and mae values of 0 033 and 0 004 for the training and testing datasets respectively in the model calibration stage whereas the lowest mse 0 022 mae 0 140 and rmse 0 148 values obtained in the model validation stage table 7 the highest values of model loss 1 304 and 0 611 in the training and testing datasets respectively and mae 1 492 and 0 709 in the training and testing datasets respectively were observed for the dl hpi fig 6a b the validation of both ml based models were performed with randomly selected 42 data from training dataset and four performance indices namely mse mae rmse and r2 were computed to evaluate the model performances table 7 exhibits that all the models were performed well with statistical r2 0 75 on the basis of obtained results the value of r2 indicated model prediction capability where ann pmi and dl pmi attained the highest accuracy r2 0 95 and 0 99 as compared to the other models moreover these two models also scored the lowest mse 3 93 0 022 mae 1 38 0 140 and rmse 1 98 0 148 whereas ann hpi and dl hpi had the highest mse 16 88 0 217 mae 2 46 0 418 and rmse 4 11 0 465 in the validation respectively table 7 the overall model performance results clearly show that dl pmi model outperformed the other models especially in terms of consistency with mse mae rmse and r2 the predicted and actual observed values were then plotted for each dl based model fig 7 moreover to check the random fitting of the dataset in the neural network the residuals estimated from each model verses their associated observed and model predicted values were plotted according to singh et al 2007 and banerjee et al 2019 the distribution of non randomised behaviour of the residuals with respect to their simulated values indicates the poor fitting of the dataset to the model in the current study plots between the model residual versus observed and model predicted value show the randomised distribution of the estimated residuals for all the models fig 8a b confirming that the randomised model dataset fitting into the applied dl algorithm notably the pmi and hmi based dl models showed higher accuracies for hm pollution prediction than obtained from the other models to determine the certainty of the dl pmi model outcome another dl algorithm for the pmi model was run 10 times trials with new randomly sampled training and validation datasets the validation results with the newly randomised sample are presented in table 8 which shows that the prediction performance of the new model was quite unwavering the minimum and maximum mse values were 0 011 and 0 061 with mean and sd of 0 024 and 0 015 respectively table 8 the minimum and maximum values for mae were 0 109 and 0 271 respectively with a mean and sd of 0 146 and 0 049 respectively the highest and lowest rmse values were 0 115 and 0 283 respectively with a mean and sd of 0 153 and 0 05 respectively a high consistency in the r2 value mean r2 0 99 was observed from the ten times model validation process table 8 these results revealed that groundwater hm pollution indices using the pmi indexing approach were robust and reliable for the current dataset of arang 5 discussion groundwater in the study area is mainly affected due to the excess hm concentration such as cd fe and pb table 1 statistical results showed that excess hm in groundwater were due to their high observed standard deviation sd values table 1 the cd concentration in groundwater is associated with both natural e g weathering of carbonate sulfides and phosphorites rock minerals and anthropogenic sources e g mining farming with phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer the average cd content in sedimentary rocks such as limestone sandstone and shale are 0 1 0 028 and 1 0 mg kg respectively thornton 1986 hammons et al 1978 gong et al 1977 hence presence of carbonated rocks in the present study area may be the possible source of high cd concentration in groundwater additionally groundwater cd concentrations can largely be attributed to the leaching of water through agricultural soil treated with fertilizers and pesticides for crop production kubier et al 2019 farmers in the study area frequently apply single superphosphate ssp to their fields which may leads to higher cd level in the groundwater in another study nokes and weaver 2014 reported that the high cd level in groundwater was due to the application of ssp for agricultural practices the high fe and mn concentration in the groundwater of the current study area is mainly attributed to geogenic source presence of lateritic deposits within the study region significantly contributes to the higher fe and mn content in groundwater according to chowdhury et al 1965 most of the laterite deposits in india contain high iron and manganese oxide in another study carried out in india also reported that elevated fe concentration in groundwater is primarily due to the presence of laterite capping in rocks rao 2008 in the current study a total of 217 groundwater samples were collected from pitcher pumps and 187 of which exceeded pb concentration of 10 μg l maximum permissible limit as prescribed by bis 2012 akers et al 2015 in their studies reported that excessive pb concentrations in groundwater are generally caused by the corrosion of pitcher pump systems presence of quartz sandstone and carbonated rock deposits in the present study area may also be responsible for the formation of pb rich minerals in aquifer systems leading to high groundwater pb content patel et al 2006 patel et al 2006 also suggested that the mean surface soil pb concentration in central india was approximately 115 μg l and had anthropogenic origins moreover groundwater high concentration of cd fe mn ni and pb in the study region may be due to the anthropogenic activities viz opencast limestone mining and illegal disposal of domestic sewerage nearby geogenic inputs most of the mining quarries within the study area were located close to the residential area and local people frequently dispose the domestic waste water into the mining pits the groundwater as 04 samples and cu 09 samples concentration exceeded the maximum permissible limit bis 2012 are attributed to the application of fertilizers pesticides and herbicides in agricultural field in the study area in the present research work groundwater hm pollution indices were computed using six methods namely hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi in the computation process mostly the indexing methods involve judgmental or subjective approach such as assigning weight to the parameters hms based on their relative importance with respect to groundwater quality concern considering the maximum permissible limit s i and desirable limit i i of the respective hm except the pmi indexing method though ehci and hmi calculates the hms weight using the objective approach information entropy system and pca based weighting system but involvement of s i and i i plays a vital role in the final calculation step of these indices in contrast to this the calculation of pca based hm index pmi is fully based on multivariate statistical technique objective approach and this method does not require any permissible or desirable limit for its calculation giri and singh 2019 moreover pca extracts the information of most significant parameters which is capable to explain the overall dataset characteristics by summarizing statistical correlation among input parameters without any major loss of original information busico et al 2018 hence this way of science makes pca as a robust multivariate statistical tool in the present study six hm pollution indices were considered to assess the groundwater pollution and out of them four hm pollution indices namely hpi ci ehci and hmi represents the drinking and domestic water suitability whereas hei and pmi only describes the pollution level due presence of hms in water moreover the methodologies used for categorizations of all the pollution indices are different from each other and hence it is difficult to compare all these selected indices by a single criteria i e drinking water suitability or pollution level the spatial distribution maps of various indices are shown in fig 5 which indicated that groundwater in eastern portion of the study region is relatively more polluted as compared to the western portion both geogenic and anthropogenic inputs such as presence of limestone and shale deposits ongoing opencast limestone mining activities application of fertilizer and pesticides in agricultural fields openly disposal of domestic waste water plays a significant role for the excess hms concentration especially cd pb and mn in groundwater that leads the groundwater pollution in the study area the validation performance of ann and dl prediction models were compared with four performance indices mse mae rmse and r2 table 7 it is clearly seen from table 7 that the applied algorithms for the ann and dl based six prediction models achieved satisfactory results r2 0 75 results revealed that prediction models for pmi scored the highest accuracies r2 value of 0 95 and 0 99 for ann pmi and dl pmi respectively table 7 the computation of pmi involves multivariate statistical computational process pca moreover neural networks work on the gaussian statistical probability distribution function goodfellow et al 2016 according to arminger and enache 1996 and ciampi and lechevallier 2007 neural network of supervised learning can be interpreted as statistical model which is capable to capture the existing scientific information at data learning process therefore the above mentioned factors may be the significant contributors towards scoring highest accuracies by the ann pmi and dl pmi prediction models which signifies the robustness of pmi in the field of groundwater hm pollution studies as compared to the other selected indices in the present study another key factor of the current analysis is that the range of accuracy r2 0 98 to 0 99 for dl based prediction models are relatively higher than the accuracy achieved by ann based models r2 0 88 to 0 95 table 7 also the lowest errors mse mae and rmse computed by all the six dl based prediction models during model calibration fig 6a b and validation stage table 7 which clearly supports the best prediction capability of dl model for the present study a significant improvement in r2 values between ann and dl based prediction models were noticed for all the indices approximately 11 in dl hpi 10 in dl hei 14 in dl ci 08 in dl hcei 06 in dl hmi and 04 in dl pmi which signifies the robustness of applied dl algorithm as per the overall outcomes of both ml models it is suggested that the proposed dl based model is very much capable to predict groundwater pollution indices with the present dataset the dl model predicted indices and their respective observed values were plotted fig 7 which clearly shows that all the predicted indices were nearer to their observed values fig 8a b shows the randomised distribution of measured residuals with respect to the observed and model predicted values which signifies the authenticity of the proposed dl model in the present study the consistency of the dl pmi model was verified by running 10 times the model with reshuffled dataset for the both training and validation purpose results show that dl model performed well and the mean value of mse 0 024 mae 0 146 rmse 0 153 and r2 0 99 table 8 also very close to the dl pmi performance results as shown in table 8 even after considering the new randomised dataset with the same algorithm which emphasized the reliability of the proposed dl based model in the current study results were produced for research purpose but have a potential for the use of decision makers working in the study region as it is evident that mostly the groundwater within arang was found highly polluted by cd fe and pb hms which can cause severe health issues among local inhabitants hence prior treatment of groundwater before consumption is highly required in the study area moreover application of chemical fertilizers in the agricultural field can be reduced by encouraging local farmers for the use of organic fertilizers however model based future research works related to groundwater hm pollution from the present research area will enhance and support the results of this study 6 conclusions in the present study the dl algorithm was proposed for the prediction of hm pollution in groundwater of arang india the proposed dl model with a combination of two hidden layers and multiple neurons along with generalization capability was efficient for determining the complex relationships in given dataset model wise prediction accuracies suggested that pca based metal indexing approach pmi was the most effective method for assessing groundwater hm pollution as compared to the other methods in the study area the main constraint of the present study was that a single season hm dataset was used for the model multi season datasets can assure more realistic results and deeper insights into the status of hm pollution in groundwater the current model can be improved by the latest technologies and by increasing the dimensions of the datasets for more accurate results in water management studies the model tuning optimization process

1476,globally groundwater heavy metal hm pollution is a serious concern threatening drinking water safety as well as human and animal health therefore evaluation of groundwater hm pollution is essential to prevent accompanying hazardous ecological impacts in this aspect the effectiveness of various groundwater hm pollution evaluation approaches should be examined for their level of trustworthiness in this study 226 groundwater samples from arang of chhattisgarh state india were collected and analyzed measured concentration for various hms were further used to calculate six groundwater pollution indices such as the hm pollution index hpi hm evaluation index hei contamination index ci entropy weight based hm contamination index ehci heavy metal index hmi and principal component analysis based metal index pmi groundwater in the study area was mainly contaminated by elevated cd fe and pb concentrations due to natural and anthropogenic pollution moreover this study explored the performance of deep learning dl based predictive models via comparative study two hidden layers with 26 and 19 neurons in the first and second hidden layers respectively were optimised along with rectified linear unit activation function a mini batch gradient descent was also applied to ensure smooth convergence of the training dataset into the model results demonstrated that the dl pmi scored lowest errors 0 022 for mean square error mse 0 140 for mean absolute error mae and 0 148 for root mean square error rmse in the model validation than the other dl based groundwater hm pollution model prediction performances of all pollution indices were also verified using artificial neural network ann based models which also highlighted the lowest validation error for ann pmi mse 3 93 mae 1 38 and rmse 1 98 furthermore the prediction accuracies of pmi using both ann and dl models scored the highest r2 value of 0 95 and 0 99 respectively therefore it is suggested that groundwater hm pollution using pmi as the best indexing approach in the present study area moreover compared to benchmark ann the dl performed better hence it could be concluded that the proposed dl model may be suitable approach in the field of computational chemistry by handling overfitting problems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater hm pollution indices deep learning geographical information system pollution zones india 1 introduction this paper aims to assess the effectiveness of groundwater hm pollution indices using ml technique in order to achieve this target a systematic groundwater pollution study was conducted by considering nine hm concentrations to compute six well established pollution indices which were further taken into account to develop groundwater pollution prediction models with the aid of ml techniques viz ann and dl in the current study as per the best knowledge of authors for the first time the application of dl model was proposed to predict the effectiveness of groundwater hm pollution indices on the other hand a parallel study was also conducted using a shallow neural network model i e ann to compare the prediction performances of the model with that of the performances achieved by the dl model several earlier studies had examined the effectiveness of hm pollution indices by traditional statistical approaches despite the ample of studies were performed for the improvement of hm pollution assessment through various indices no attempt has been made so far to investigate the effectiveness of these indices by ml techniques therefore to fill in this gap an attempt was made to evaluate the most effective groundwater hm pollution indexing method based on the predictability of ml models heavy metals hms are the most studied contaminants in potable water resources because of their high toxicity even at low concentrations marcovecchio et al 2007 according to ali et al 2019 hms is among the most hazardous pollutants particularly because of the biogeochemical recycling toxicity and environmental risks of these substances in ecosystems highly toxic hms at levels even marginally exceeding prescribed limits may render water more hazardous than would the presence of comparatively low toxicity metals at much higher concentrations apart from the risk appraisal of hms in water various index based quality measures have been implemented globally to assess hm pollution level of groundwater surface water and sediments islam et al 2015 singh et al 2017 ahn et al 2019 saleh et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2020 groundwater pollution due to excessive hm concentrations is commonly evaluated by determining the hm pollution index hpi mohan et al 1996 hm evaluation index hei edet and offiong 2002 and contamination index ci prasanna et al 2012 entropy weight based contamination index ehci singh et al 2019 hm index hmi dash et al 2019 and pca based metal index pmi giri and singh 2019 however there is no such globally standard hm pollution index to assess metal pollutions in groundwater sources the drawbacks in computation of these indices are time taking lengthy tedious chances of human error involvement and have discrepancies as hm indices use different computational equations the solution to overcome these problems may be achieved by adopting a non physical approach which can efficiently predict hm pollution through ml technique moreover based on the literature survey the superiority of the newly developed hm pollution indices such as ehci hmi and pmi were established by comparing their computed results with the traditional hm pollution indices i e hpi hei and ci in the respective studies in this regards authors had proved the effectiveness of their proposed indices by examining or comparing the pollution status of each sampling locations using both newly developed indices and traditional indices and conducting correlation analysis between them till date none of the study has investigated the effectiveness of hm pollution indices using a ml platform in this context ml based water quality index prediction models have been utilized by some researchers by considering various physicochemical parameters liu et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 bui et al 2020 prediction of hm concentration in river water and groundwater implementing ml techniques such as artificial neural network ann general regression neural network grnn multiple linear regression mlr multi output adaptive neural fuzzy inference system manfis support vector machine svm have been also reported by several researchers gholami et al 2011 aryafar et al 2012 bayatzadeh fard et al 2017 sonmez et al 2018 bhagat et al 2020 boudaghpour and malekmohammadi 2020 in their respective studies in many parts of the world in all of these research works hm concentrations were predicted through ml based prediction models nevertheless till date none of the research work has been reported on the application of ml technique to predict hm pollution indices the role of ml in the field of hydrology and water resources has become popular in recent years one such ml technique is the ann widely applied in water resource this information processing system works on learning the features memorizing them and generalizing of input dataset that are assigned in the training process application of ann in groundwater related studies can be utilized with significant level of accuracy for the development of management policies in a wide range of groundwater issues related to both qualitative and quantitative concerns yang et al 2009 behzad et al 2010 the deep learning dl technique is topical in current artificial intelligence research this technique has been gaining attention for its capability of managing multi dimensional datasets because of its flexible model structure powerful generalization and strong learning capabilities heo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 several

2020 yim et al 2020 in the current study groundwater pollution was evaluated via hm concentrations of groundwater samples collected from arang chhattisgarh india arang was selected because it represents a rural part of chhattisgarh where agricultural fertilizer and manure have extensively been applied over a long period deteriorating the groundwater quality in the area singha et al 2019 in the present research nine hms including as cd cu cr fe mn ni pb and zn were used to compute six well reported hm pollution indices namely hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi two ml techniques namely ann and dl were used to develop supervised learning prediction models for the selected groundwater hm pollution indices and a comparative study was performed to find out the best pollution indexing approach

analysis groundwater samples were collected from 226 locations in the study area via dug wells and hand pumping at depths of 8 83 m during april june 2019 purging was performed for 5 10 min before sample collection groundwater samples were collected in 250 milliliter high density polyethylene containers which were washed several times with the representative water prior to collection collected water samples were then filtered using 0 45 μm filter papers whatman the ph 2 of collected samples was carefully maintained by acidifying them in situ using ultrapure hno3 which also prevented metal precipitation and biological growth after proper labelling all samples were kept in an eps thermocol ice box and brought to the laboratory the groundwater samples were refrigerated below 4 c until further analysis a total of nine hms in each samples namely as cd cu cr fe mn ni pb and zn were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 8000 pg instruments ltd uk for this purpose water samples were aspirated into the atomic absorption spectrophotometer at corresponding wavelengths groundwater samples were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer with hydride technique and sodium borohydride solution and potassium iodide was used as a reductant the inert gas argon was used as a carrier gas for the determination of fe mn zn and cu concentrations air acetylene was used as a fuel gas for direct flame system furthermore cd cr pb ni and co concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a graphite furnace a standard curve was achieved by administering a standard solution of each hm to be analyzed the quality of analyzed values was ensured by analyzing a certified reference material srm 1640a blank sample and standards mean values of three replicates were employed for each metal determination analytical precession was checked to ensure an analytical error of less than 3 by calibrating the instrument with standards as well as blanks after performing experiments for every 10 samples the detection limit of as cd cu cr fe mn ni pb and zn were 0 3 0 00025 4 0 00242 15 2 0 00857 0 00388 and 4 μg l respectively the minimum value for as and mn were recorded as below detection limit bdl during sample collection a portable global positioning system device was used to record the latitude and longitude of each groundwater sampling point 3 2 empirically assessed hm pollution indices the analyzed results of the hm concentrations were further used to determine six quality protocols for groundwater pollution comprising hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi out of 226 groundwater samples the concentration of as and mn for three samples two and one respectively were measured as bdl the concentrations of as and mn were excluded from the computation of various indices for these three groundwater samples the values of hpi hei ci ehci and hmi were computed as per the limits prescribed by bis 2012 table 1 the description of these hm pollution indices are illustrated below 3 2 1 hpi hpi assesses the combined impact of individual hm on the overall water quality status mohan et al 1996 it s computation process is based on the rating system value ranges between 0 and 1 to the selected hms that can be assigned either depending on the relative significance of individual hm in view of quality concerns or by determining the values inversely proportional to the maximum permissible s i and maximum desirable limits i i for the respective hm bis 2012 hpi values for the groundwater samples were calculated as per the equation given in table 2 the groundwater quality of the study area can be classified into five categories namely excellent 25 good 25 50 poor 50 75 very poor 75 100 and unsuitable 100 the drinking water critical value for hpi is 100 as proposed by prasad and bose 2001 3 2 2 hei hei is the similar method like hpi that provides the overall water quality with respect to hms edet and offiong 2002 in this method the hei value of a sample was computed by dividing the measured concentration of any particular hm by the maximum permissible concentration s i bis 2012 of the corresponding hm as per the equation given in table 2 since there is no critical value suggested for hei evaluation of pollution level in this metric depends on the worker s judgment hence to identify the pollution level in the study area the multiple of mean approach prasanna et al 2012 was adopted for classifying the groundwater into three pollution categories as low moderate and high 3 2 3 ci the ci provides the degree of contamination by summarizing the combined effects of several quality parameters considered harmful to domestic water backman et al 1998 in the present analysis the ci values were computed by adding the contamination factors of individual hms exceeding the maximum permissible value c si bis 2012 ci values were estimated as per the equation given in table 2 the groundwater ci values can be categorized into three pollution classes namely low 1 moderate 1 3 and high 3 backman et al 1998 edet and offiong 2002 critical value of ci is 3 for household consumption as suggested by backman et al 1998 3 2 4 ehci the ehci provides the water quality based on information entropy concept singh et al 2019 in this method entropy weight w i for hms were computed using shannon entropy information technique and then sub indices q i were coupled with the weights to calculate the ehci value as per the equation given in table 2 ehci values can be categorized into five classes namely excellent 50 good 50 100 average 100 150 poor 150 200 and unsuitable 200 as per the drinking water consideration the critical value of ehci is 200 singh et al 2019 3 2 5 hmi the hmi is a principal component analysis pca based multivariate statistical technique which represents the water quality of an area dash et al 2019 in this method pca provides the factor loadings by considering factors having eigenvalues greater than 1 the multiplied value of pca based relative eigenvalues and factor loading generates corresponding hm weight p i which is further used to calculate hmi as per the equation given in table 2 hmi values can be categorized into five classes namely excellent 50 good 50 100 average 100 200 poor 200 300 and unsuitable 300 the drinking water critical value of ehci is 300 and above this value water is unfit for drinking dash et al 2019 3 2 6 pmi the pmi is a pca based multivariate metal indexing approach which does not require any permissible limit or desirable limits in the process of computation as proposed by giri and singh 2019 a non standardized pca metal index nspmi of each sampling point is calculated using initially extracted factor score fs i of individual factor variance explain by corresponding factor v i and the total variance explained v t the nspmi for all derived factors are added in which both negative and positive value may arise hence a standardized pca based metal index pmi is further calculated to interpret the results in a convenient way as per the equation given in table 2 all pmi values were used to estimate three quantiles and accordingly groundwater samples were categorized into three pollution classes namely low moderate and high however critical value of pmi is not specific and it depends on the third quantile value 3 3 application of ml techniques in the present study in the present study two ml techniques namely ann and dl were applied for the prediction of hm pollution indices using supervised learning where the sample wise selected nine hm concentrations and their corresponding pollution indices were considered as the model inputs and outputs respectively the computed indices and concentration of each hm for all groundwater samples were normalized and used as dataset by ann and dl models namely ann hpi ann hei ann ci ann ehci ann hmi ann pmi dl hpi dl hei dl ci dl ehci dl hmi and dl pmi dataset were annotated for the supervised learning in both the models 3 3 1 ann approach ann based prediction models are the mostly applied approaches used for the simulation of hms in last two decades bhagat et al 2020 the basic structure of ann consists of three layers including the input layer hidden layer and the output layer the selection of neurons in the hidden layer depends upon the bias minimization associated with the existing problem bishop 1995 among various learning algorithm the back propagation bp is the most frequently utilized method for training a neural network banerjee et al 2019 in the interconnected network all the neurons are activated by a sigmoid function which is described by the following equation 1 f y 1 1 e y where y is the input data in the stage of model output a linear kernel function was used to minimise the computing time and enhance the robustness of the ann model the finalization of the optimal neural network is a trial and error based approach sun et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 jafari and javidi 2020 ann model comprising two hidden layers helps to reduce the bias in the neural network and protects from overfitting issue yurtsever et al 2014 bokde et al 2018 however to maintain smooth model learning process for nine inputs the prediction ability of ann was improved by constructing two hidden layers six and three neurons in first and second hidden layers respectively in the current study suditu et al 2013 esmaeili and aghababai beni 2015 package neuralnet was used to run the ann model in r software version 3 6 1 however the application of ann and its detailed methodology have been reported elsewhere rojas 1996 ham and kostanic 2000 russell and norvig 2010 3 3 2 dl approach the dl based model formed a major part of the method in this study the complexity of deep neural networks is greater than that of conventional neural networks in the latter the three layer back propagated structure namely input hidden and output layers is mainly adopted which determines the weights of connected links between nodes depending on the training dataset and processes to minimise the least mean square error of the neural network wang et al 2011 the current dl method is a two layer approach involving model calibration and validation during model calibration splitting of dataset into two parts namely training and testing datasets mini batch mb processing of the training dataset and model optimisation were performed model validation mainly comprised error estimation based on model predictions and actual values using various statistical indices these steps are expounded in the next section the basic architecture of the present deep neural network comprises three part including multi inputs a1 to a9 two hidden layers with multiple neurons 1st hidden layer h11 to h126 and 2nd hidden layer h21 to h219 and a single output p fig 3 the analyses done in the present research were performed in r software specially keras package https www rproject org was used exclusively to run the dl models in r 3 3 3 model calibration in the proposed dl based back propagated feed forward neural network model the entire dataset was split for model training and testing purposes to eliminate the inverse impact of input variables because of their varying scale nine input variable data hms and computed pollution indices were normalized to bring them to the same scale 0 1 data normalization leads to the steady convergence of datasets into the model kılıçaslan et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 the present dataset was pre processed through normalization using the following equation 2 r r r min r max r min where r is the normalized input data and r min and r max are the minimum and maximum values of the input data respectively another essential component adopted in the present study was the allocation of the training dataset to an mb the total dataset was 226 and out of which a total of 184 numbers dataset were allotted for model training furthermore groundwater samples three samples having as and mn concentration below detection limit were identified through a close investigation and eliminated from model training dataset 184 nos as it could mislead the supervised learning process of prediction model therefore 181 dataset were finalized for the model training purpose an mb size of 25 32 was considered for the proposed model even though 25 mb is the default size and may vary depending on the training dataset many researchers have suggested this mb size as superior based on their best model performance bengio 2012 masters and luschi 2018 moreover the training dataset of the back propagated network was treated with a gradient descent optimising algorithm and l2 regularization ridge regularization which provided the optimal parameter weight to prevent overfitting issues and model complexity kabán 2013 wang and cao 2017 ahmed et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in the data driven model and to ensure the stable convergence of each mb training dataset into the model qian et al 2015 an mb gradient descent mbgd optimisation algorithm rather than full batch gradient or stochastic gradient descent was used because of the slow learning speed caused by the convergence of whole training datasets for a single iteration epoch in the case of full batch gradient descent whereas the faster learning speed through poor convergence of the training dataset into the model was ensured by stochastic gradient descent furthermore in terms of penalty adding of l2 regularization in the dl algorithm computes the summation of the absolute values of the weight parameters to the loss function which reduces the model complexity the mse loss function l o was used in mbgd calculations in the following equation 3 l o 1 n i 1 n o p 2 where l o is the loss function n is the number of training datasets and o and p respectively represent the observed and predicted output value of ith sample to achieve the revised weight parameters in terms of a new loss function l l2 regularization and l o were jointly considered in the mbgd algorithm 4 l l o λ 2 n i 1 n ε i 2 where l 2 λ 2 n i 1 n ε i 2 where l is the loss function along with l o λ 0 represents the l2 regularization coefficient and ε is the weight parameter matrix as the number of parameters is more than one the partial derivative of the loss function with regards to ε was used as follows 5 l ε l o ε λ n ε thus the calculation of ε in each gradient could be determined by the following equations 6a ε ε α l o ε λ n ε 6b ε α l o ε λ n ε ε 1 α λ n α l o ε where the learning rate of the mbgd calculation is denoted by α and α 0 the value of α for the optimal algorithm was considered as 0 001 hence for all the positive values of α n and λ the values computed in the weight parameter matrix decreased batch normalization bn was implemented in the dl algorithm to overcome the problem of no convergence and overfitting ma et al 2020 fig 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of applying bn to the dl algorithm which prevent the falling of the model from plateau effect ioffe and szegedy 2015 bn conveniently converge the given dataset in every batch in the dl model according to ioffe and szegedy 2015 the transformation of bn ensures that the layer in the training model can prolong learning for given inputs accelerating the training via a small internal covariate shift the dl model normalizes the dataset in every activation layer helping to minimise the complexity of the mbgd thus enhancing model performance ioffe and szegedy 2015 the following equation was used for bn in the current model 7 r i r i x b y b 2 where x b and y b respectively represent the actual layer output batch mean and standard deviation is a constant with an arbitrarily small value non zero to prevent the denominator from being zero subsequently the batch normalized layer was run and the weight and bias were computed as follows 8 p i batchnormalised layer ε δ ε r i δ where p i is the final model output and ε and δ are the weight and bias of the model respectively the rectified linear unit relu function was used for each hidden layer input this was a simpler estimator compared to the commonly applied sigmoid activation function since it did not require the exponential function in addition relu secures the training process of back propagated gradient descent from the vanishing descent event which is detrimental to the model learning progress glorot et al 2011 goodfellow et al 2016 the following mathematical expression for relu is given as 9 p x x 0 if x 0 if x 0 where max 0 x where p is the activation function and x is the neuron input signal the derivative of eq 9 was further used to perform the back propagation structure using the following equation 10 p x x 0 if x 0 if x 0 3 3 4 validation model the ann and dl models were validated by considering randomly selected 42 groundwater samples data of the training datasets the performance of the proposed prediction models was evaluated based on errors between the final model prediction results and actual values using three statistical indices namely mean square error mse mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 mse measures the average of squared error computed by model overall the input instances the smaller the value of mse better the model performance ranković et al 2010 mae measures the average of absolute values of individual prediction errors by model overall the input instances while in the rmse the model performance is measured by computing the root value of averaged errors in this process errors are squared before they are averaged the range of mae and rmse may be in between 0 and infinity however the smaller value of mae and rmse signifies the better model performance pak et al 2020 r2 measures the proportion of fluctuation exists among the predicted and actual value in other words it represents the strength of linear association between predicted and actual value where r2 0 8 and 0 5 represents strong and weak linear relationship respectively 4 results groundwater hm pollution by evaluating different indices was considered and the performances of prediction models and preciseness of computed indices were explored in this section the results and findings are discussed to investigate the model accuracy based on actual and predicted groundwater hm pollution indices for a regional groundwater system 4 1 statistics of groundwater hm concentration and indices the statistical report of groundwater hm concentrations is presented in table 1 the statistical results show that except for the mean concentrations of cd fe and pb the mean hm concentrations of rest of the metals were below the maximum permissible limits bis 2012 a total of approximately 51 92 and 93 of groundwater samples having concentrations of cd fe and pb above the maximum permissible limits respectively whereas about 2 1 and 4 had as ni and cu concentrations above the maximum permissible limits bis 2012 respectively furthermore a considerable number of samples approx 27 had mn concentrations that exceeded the maximum permissible limits of the bis 2012 the groundwater hm pollution indices using various approaches were computed as per the adopted procedures table 2 the statistics of computed hm pollution indices showed that hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi varied from approximately 5 to 396 2 to 42 0 to 37 23 to 589 36 to 834 and 18 to 82 with the approximate mean value of 116 7 4 104 156 and 44 respectively table 3 4 2 spatial distribution of hm pollution indices to visualise the variation in spatial distribution of groundwater hm pollution in the study area all the sampling locations and their various computed observed indices were imported into arcgis 10 3 software to prepare the hm pollution indices maps fig 5 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was adopted to prepare the spatial distribution maps due to its robustness gong et al 2014 elumalai et al 2017 moharir et al 2019 according to miri et al 2016 idw is the non statistical process which predicts the concentration of pollutant at any unmeasured site by optimal spatial predicting method as there is no critical value suggested for hei a multiple mean approach was considered for this metric for better understanding the hm pollution level in groundwater the computed mean value of hei within the study area was approximately 7 and accordingly the whole study area was categorized into three pollution categories namely low hei 7 moderate hei 7 to 14 and high hei 14 furthermore the pmi indices of all sample locations were used to estimate the 3 quantiles to reclassify the study area into hm pollution zones according to their pmi values as suggested by giri and singh 2019 the pmi values varied from approximately 18 to 82 with an average of approx 44 table 3 groundwater samples having higher pmi value represents higher pollution status and vice versa accordingly the study area was categorized into three sub classes based on the estimated three quantile values namely low approx 18 37 moderate approx 37 49 and high approx 49 82 pmi zones spatial distribution maps of various indices are shown in fig 5 a f the hpi spatial distribution map showed that the north western central and south eastern portions of the study region had hpi 150 i e groundwater of these areas fell under average to unsuitable for drinking category fig 5a a similar pattern of groundwater pollution status were noticed in hei ci ehci and hmi where the central and lower northern part of study area had hei 14 moderate to high pollution category ci 3 unsuitable for domestic purpose ehci 150 average to unsuitable for drinking category and hmi 200 poor to unsuitable for drinking category fig 5b e the pmi map showed that the north western central central eastern and few pockets of central northern parts of the study region fell under high polluted criteria due to pmi 37 fig 5f 4 3 performance of ml based prediction models the performances of ml based prediction model are reported after performing the model optimization procedure in preliminary model run stage in this stage the algorithms and structures of ann and dl models were finalized based on trial and error method then after the final performances of the models were executed and recorded 4 3 1 preliminary model run of proposed dl model before finalizing the proposed dl model optimal structure and its algorithm parallel experiments were conducted in the training stage initially to conduct the experiments only one prediction model namely dl pmi was selected as a representative model instead of selecting all the dl based models according to the results obtained from dl pmi the data splitting and structure of the network was fixed for all the models a series of split ratios namely 70 30 75 25 80 20 and 85 15 were initially chosen for the network based on the best i e lowest rmse result an 80 20 partitioning ratio was used for all the dl based models table 4 all the split ratios of the training and testing datasets were applied five times to the pmi prediction model i e dl pmi the means of the rmse values are shown in table 4 the basic network structure of dl models includes the number of input layers hidden layers neurons in each hidden layer and output layers in this study the total number of input layers was nine concentrations of nine hms and a single output layer index value of associated hm pollution approach hence to find the optimal structure for the proposed network the number of hidden layers and neurons was determined by varying the number of hidden layers by varying a common difference between the consecutive numbers of neurons in the hidden layers this approach was based on the study of fan and cheng 2018 moreover dl pmi with an 80 20 dataset split ratio was used for the experiment and the performance results were recorded table 5 shows the test performance results and the best results having been obtained from the structure with a set of 9 26 19 1 showing that the network structure with two hidden layers exhibited the lowest rmse value 0 002 with 26 neurons in the first hidden layer and 19 in the second henceforth the optimal network structure 9 26 19 1 was used for all the dl based prediction models 4 3 2 outcomes based on prediction models the proposed prediction models structure and algorithm were finalized by determining the best performance via several tests experiments ann based prediction model for various indices were run by considering two hidden layer with a set of six and three neurons at a split ratio of 80 20 for training and testing was run with two repetitions the performance statistics of ann based prediction models in training and testing process were evaluated using mse and mae table 6 based on the model performance evaluation results it is observed that ann hpi scores the highest mse values i e 18 29 and 20 33 during training of model and highest mae values of 2 51 and 2 64 during testing of model respectively whereas the ann pmi scores the lowest error values mse 4 19 and 4 66 mae 1 52 and 1 73 in both model training and testing process table 6 the back propagated feed forward neural network with two hidden layers with a combination of 26 and 19 neurons at a split ratio of 80 20 for training and testing was run for 400 epochs to predict the groundwater hm pollution indices using dl hpi dl hei dl ci dl ehci dl hmi and dl pmi fig 6a b shows that the dl pmi attained the lowest loss values i e 0 017 based on the training dataset and 0 001 based on the testing dataset and mae values of 0 033 and 0 004 for the training and testing datasets respectively in the model calibration stage whereas the lowest mse 0 022 mae 0 140 and rmse 0 148 values obtained in the model validation stage table 7 the highest values of model loss 1 304 and 0 611 in the training and testing datasets respectively and mae 1 492 and 0 709 in the training and testing datasets respectively were observed for the dl hpi fig 6a b the validation of both ml based models were performed with randomly selected 42 data from training dataset and four performance indices namely mse mae rmse and r2 were computed to evaluate the model performances table 7 exhibits that all the models were performed well with statistical r2 0 75 on the basis of obtained results the value of r2 indicated model prediction capability where ann pmi and dl pmi attained the highest accuracy r2 0 95 and 0 99 as compared to the other models moreover these two models also scored the lowest mse 3 93 0 022 mae 1 38 0 140 and rmse 1 98 0 148 whereas ann hpi and dl hpi had the highest mse 16 88 0 217 mae 2 46 0 418 and rmse 4 11 0 465 in the validation respectively table 7 the overall model performance results clearly show that dl pmi model outperformed the other models especially in terms of consistency with mse mae rmse and r2 the predicted and actual observed values were then plotted for each dl based model fig 7 moreover to check the random fitting of the dataset in the neural network the residuals estimated from each model verses their associated observed and model predicted values were plotted according to singh et al 2007 and banerjee et al 2019 the distribution of non randomised behaviour of the residuals with respect to their simulated values indicates the poor fitting of the dataset to the model in the current study plots between the model residual versus observed and model predicted value show the randomised distribution of the estimated residuals for all the models fig 8a b confirming that the randomised model dataset fitting into the applied dl algorithm notably the pmi and hmi based dl models showed higher accuracies for hm pollution prediction than obtained from the other models to determine the certainty of the dl pmi model outcome another dl algorithm for the pmi model was run 10 times trials with new randomly sampled training and validation datasets the validation results with the newly randomised sample are presented in table 8 which shows that the prediction performance of the new model was quite unwavering the minimum and maximum mse values were 0 011 and 0 061 with mean and sd of 0 024 and 0 015 respectively table 8 the minimum and maximum values for mae were 0 109 and 0 271 respectively with a mean and sd of 0 146 and 0 049 respectively the highest and lowest rmse values were 0 115 and 0 283 respectively with a mean and sd of 0 153 and 0 05 respectively a high consistency in the r2 value mean r2 0 99 was observed from the ten times model validation process table 8 these results revealed that groundwater hm pollution indices using the pmi indexing approach were robust and reliable for the current dataset of arang 5 discussion groundwater in the study area is mainly affected due to the excess hm concentration such as cd fe and pb table 1 statistical results showed that excess hm in groundwater were due to their high observed standard deviation sd values table 1 the cd concentration in groundwater is associated with both natural e g weathering of carbonate sulfides and phosphorites rock minerals and anthropogenic sources e g mining farming with phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer the average cd content in sedimentary rocks such as limestone sandstone and shale are 0 1 0 028 and 1 0 mg kg respectively thornton 1986 hammons et al 1978 gong et al 1977 hence presence of carbonated rocks in the present study area may be the possible source of high cd concentration in groundwater additionally groundwater cd concentrations can largely be attributed to the leaching of water through agricultural soil treated with fertilizers and pesticides for crop production kubier et al 2019 farmers in the study area frequently apply single superphosphate ssp to their fields which may leads to higher cd level in the groundwater in another study nokes and weaver 2014 reported that the high cd level in groundwater was due to the application of ssp for agricultural practices the high fe and mn concentration in the groundwater of the current study area is mainly attributed to geogenic source presence of lateritic deposits within the study region significantly contributes to the higher fe and mn content in groundwater according to chowdhury et al 1965 most of the laterite deposits in india contain high iron and manganese oxide in another study carried out in india also reported that elevated fe concentration in groundwater is primarily due to the presence of laterite capping in rocks rao 2008 in the current study a total of 217 groundwater samples were collected from pitcher pumps and 187 of which exceeded pb concentration of 10 μg l maximum permissible limit as prescribed by bis 2012 akers et al 2015 in their studies reported that excessive pb concentrations in groundwater are generally caused by the corrosion of pitcher pump systems presence of quartz sandstone and carbonated rock deposits in the present study area may also be responsible for the formation of pb rich minerals in aquifer systems leading to high groundwater pb content patel et al 2006 patel et al 2006 also suggested that the mean surface soil pb concentration in central india was approximately 115 μg l and had anthropogenic origins moreover groundwater high concentration of cd fe mn ni and pb in the study region may be due to the anthropogenic activities viz opencast limestone mining and illegal disposal of domestic sewerage nearby geogenic inputs most of the mining quarries within the study area were located close to the residential area and local people frequently dispose the domestic waste water into the mining pits the groundwater as 04 samples and cu 09 samples concentration exceeded the maximum permissible limit bis 2012 are attributed to the application of fertilizers pesticides and herbicides in agricultural field in the study area in the present research work groundwater hm pollution indices were computed using six methods namely hpi hei ci ehci hmi and pmi in the computation process mostly the indexing methods involve judgmental or subjective approach such as assigning weight to the parameters hms based on their relative importance with respect to groundwater quality concern considering the maximum permissible limit s i and desirable limit i i of the respective hm except the pmi indexing method though ehci and hmi calculates the hms weight using the objective approach information entropy system and pca based weighting system but involvement of s i and i i plays a vital role in the final calculation step of these indices in contrast to this the calculation of pca based hm index pmi is fully based on multivariate statistical technique objective approach and this method does not require any permissible or desirable limit for its calculation giri and singh 2019 moreover pca extracts the information of most significant parameters which is capable to explain the overall dataset characteristics by summarizing statistical correlation among input parameters without any major loss of original information busico et al 2018 hence this way of science makes pca as a robust multivariate statistical tool in the present study six hm pollution indices were considered to assess the groundwater pollution and out of them four hm pollution indices namely hpi ci ehci and hmi represents the drinking and domestic water suitability whereas hei and pmi only describes the pollution level due presence of hms in water moreover the methodologies used for categorizations of all the pollution indices are different from each other and hence it is difficult to compare all these selected indices by a single criteria i e drinking water suitability or pollution level the spatial distribution maps of various indices are shown in fig 5 which indicated that groundwater in eastern portion of the study region is relatively more polluted as compared to the western portion both geogenic and anthropogenic inputs such as presence of limestone and shale deposits ongoing opencast limestone mining activities application of fertilizer and pesticides in agricultural fields openly disposal of domestic waste water plays a significant role for the excess hms concentration especially cd pb and mn in groundwater that leads the groundwater pollution in the study area the validation performance of ann and dl prediction models were compared with four performance indices mse mae rmse and r2 table 7 it is clearly seen from table 7 that the applied algorithms for the ann and dl based six prediction models achieved satisfactory results r2 0 75 results revealed that prediction models for pmi scored the highest accuracies r2 value of 0 95 and 0 99 for ann pmi and dl pmi respectively table 7 the computation of pmi involves multivariate statistical computational process pca moreover neural networks work on the gaussian statistical probability distribution function goodfellow et al 2016 according to arminger and enache 1996 and ciampi and lechevallier 2007 neural network of supervised learning can be interpreted as statistical model which is capable to capture the existing scientific information at data learning process therefore the above mentioned factors may be the significant contributors towards scoring highest accuracies by the ann pmi and dl pmi prediction models which signifies the robustness of pmi in the field of groundwater hm pollution studies as compared to the other selected indices in the present study another key factor of the current analysis is that the range of accuracy r2 0 98 to 0 99 for dl based prediction models are relatively higher than the accuracy achieved by ann based models r2 0 88 to 0 95 table 7 also the lowest errors mse mae and rmse computed by all the six dl based prediction models during model calibration fig 6a b and validation stage table 7 which clearly supports the best prediction capability of dl model for the present study a significant improvement in r2 values between ann and dl based prediction models were noticed for all the indices approximately 11 in dl hpi 10 in dl hei 14 in dl ci 08 in dl hcei 06 in dl hmi and 04 in dl pmi which signifies the robustness of applied dl algorithm as per the overall outcomes of both ml models it is suggested that the proposed dl based model is very much capable to predict groundwater pollution indices with the present dataset the dl model predicted indices and their respective observed values were plotted fig 7 which clearly shows that all the predicted indices were nearer to their observed values fig 8a b shows the randomised distribution of measured residuals with respect to the observed and model predicted values which signifies the authenticity of the proposed dl model in the present study the consistency of the dl pmi model was verified by running 10 times the model with reshuffled dataset for the both training and validation purpose results show that dl model performed well and the mean value of mse 0 024 mae 0 146 rmse 0 153 and r2 0 99 table 8 also very close to the dl pmi performance results as shown in table 8 even after considering the new randomised dataset with the same algorithm which emphasized the reliability of the proposed dl based model in the current study results were produced for research purpose but have a potential for the use of decision makers working in the study region as it is evident that mostly the groundwater within arang was found highly polluted by cd fe and pb hms which can cause severe health issues among local inhabitants hence prior treatment of groundwater before consumption is highly required in the study area moreover application of chemical fertilizers in the agricultural field can be reduced by encouraging local farmers for the use of organic fertilizers however model based future research works related to groundwater hm pollution from the present research area will enhance and support the results of this study 6 conclusions in the present study the dl algorithm was proposed for the prediction of hm pollution in groundwater of arang india the proposed dl model with a combination of two hidden layers and multiple neurons along with generalization capability was efficient for determining the complex relationships in given dataset model wise prediction accuracies suggested that pca based metal indexing approach pmi was the most effective method for assessing groundwater hm pollution as compared to the other methods in the study area the main constraint of the present study was that a single season hm dataset was used for the model multi season datasets can assure more realistic results and deeper insights into the status of hm pollution in groundwater the current model can be improved by the latest technologies and by increasing the dimensions of the datasets for more accurate results in water management studies the model tuning optimization process needs to be cross verified in a large scale for supplementing the reliability of proposed dl model field applications of the present dl based model are not limited to predict index values and this approach can also be used to classify pollution zones for both groundwater and surface water future research of the current study can focus on examining proposed model performance by considering multi dimensional data climatological morphological hydrogeological meteorological etc to predict groundwater hm pollution credit author statement the corresponding author is responsible for the

1477,spring breakthrough curves induced by conventional advection and dispersion often present a gentle smooth change of concentration with time we investigated an electrical conductivity breakthrough curve which originated from a chemical release into the aquifer matrix and was measured in june 2007 at qinglondong spring southwest china the curve presented abrupt rising and falling limbs modeling efforts were focused on the migration of the contaminants from the conduit wall to the spring the conduit production segment was defined to be the conduit section where the chemical plume entered the conduit from aquifer fractures the first model assumed that the time variance of the plume front reaching the conduit wall was much shorter than transport time over the conduit production segment the model yielded a decrease of spring discharge which was inconsistent with the observed increase with time in the second model the above assumption was relaxed and wall contaminant flux was inverted as function of downstream distance and time the observed abrupt rising and falling in the breakthrough curve were interpreted as 1 taylor dispersion was too small to identify for a short conduit 2 seepage from the fractures to the conduit was monodirectional and diluting keywords conduit advectve mixing monodirectional seepage taylor dispersion 1 introduction karst aquifers are prevalent with pores fractures and conduits in the sense of volume pores and fractures store the majority of groundwater and are called matrix in this paper while conduits only store a small portion of water kresic 2012 in the sense of flux rate conduit flow is relatively fast and often turbulent because conduits have large radius while flow in the aquifer matrix is slow and laminar due to the narrow space this difference causes a mathematical singularity i e the equation for turbulent conduit flow is distinctly different from that for laminar seepage in the matrix contaminants can be released into karst aquifers in the manner of point source or non point source to help investigate the processes of contaminant migration in aquifers hydrogeologists intentionally use tracers as a proxy in karst aquifers dye tracing experiments are widely used in which dye tracers are often released at sinkholes and their concentrations are monitored at downstream springs goldscheider and drew 2007 when contaminant laden water flushes through karst conduits breakthrough curves sampled at springs often present a feature of smooth rising much slower more gentle falling and very long tailing the simplest mechanism is taylor dispersion fischer 1979 in a solid wall tube arising from the variance of flow velocity in the cross section besides that there are a variety of retention retarding mechanisms to smoothen sharp changes in the breakthrough curves vortexes at conduit enlargements can roll back contaminants hauns et al 2001 conduit bedforms are able to cause small scale convection in the conduit subsurface and result in two way exchange of water between conduit and matrix thibodeaux and boyle 1987 elliot and brooks 1997 between mobile and immobile water regions there is diffusive solute transfer toride et al 1993 when conduit water pressure is higher than matrix water pressure contaminants are emplaced into the matrix temporarily staying there when the conduit water pressure is lower than the matrix water pressure the sequestered contaminants return with reverse wall seepage back into conduits martin and dean 2001 screaton et al 2004 birk et al 2006 li et al 2008 li and field 2016 two regions non equilibrium 2rne model toride et al 1993 1995 in which the aquifer matrix is treated as a sink source is very popular for simulating dye tracer transport from sinkhole to spring field and pinsky 2000 note that 2rne used diffusion for simulating tracer transfer between a conduit and matrix when tracer laden water flushes in the conduit the matrix acts as a sink to tentatively store part of the tracer when the primary tracer has passed the conduit the portion of tracer tentatively stored in the matrix is released back into the conduit the matrix behaves like a source the 2rne can reproduce strong skewness gradual spreading and long tailing in the predicted breakthrough curves birk et al 2005 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2008 but conceptually has four disadvantages in the application to transport in a conduit 1 it is good for the boundary value problem the initial value problem such as dye tracing experiments and the zero order production problem the production is steady and constant but not designed for the production value problem in which the production is transient changing with time 2 flow velocity was assumed to be a constant along the conduit no water exchange between conduit and matrix was considered 3 dilution by tracer free waters from other tributary conduits any fractures and pores of the rock was ignored and 4 tracer transfer between conduit and matrix was assumed to be diffusive based on the far field approach from the near field viewpoint tracer transfer between conduit and matrix is advective and driven by wall seepage whether diffusion between conduit and matrix can simulate tracer transfer driven by advective seepage between them remains a topic of debate a model of contaminant transport from a sinkhole to a spring was developed by li and loper 2011 in which advection dilution and dispersion were all included li 2011 sought approximate solutions for the initial value problem and the boundary value problem and successfully simulated a dye tracing experiment in northwest florida usa the above models are for contaminants or tracers that enter through a sinkhole and then flush through a conduit transport of solute represented by calcium in a karst conduit was studied by birk et al 2006 they modeled the discharge response and breakthrough curve at a spring in which the recharge at the sinkhole was solute free while water released from the matrix was rich in calcium both the water exchange and solute transfer between conduit and matrix were assumed to be diffusive a significant finding was that in that case a secondary dip of calcium concentration appears following the major dip of concentration in the predicted breakthrough curve birk et al 2006 fig 3 li and field 2016 attempted to explain the mechanism modflow and mt3d are numerical models for flow and transport in non karst aquifers as modflow was unable to simulate turbulent conduit flow characterized by a nonlinear hydraulic gradient reimann et al 2011a the conduit flow process cfp version of modflow was designed to simulate turbulent conduit flow reimann et al 2012 but the exchange factor between conduit and matrix had to account for the scale dependency reimann et al 2011b developed a new karst flow model modbrac in which variably filled conduits characterized with non pressurized flow and saturated conduits characterized with pressurized flow were both considered reimann et al 2011b found 1 if conduits are partially filled water pressure transmits very slowly due to surface waves of water in the conduits 2 spring discharge presents a special pattern when conduit flow changes from pressurized state to free surface state 3 water exchange between conduits and matrix is reduced when free surface flow prevails in the conduits more recently sullivan et al 2019 used cfp and cmt3d conduit mass transport 3d to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi arid and sub humid climate conditions and the statistics of their calibration with available data was good dispersion arises from different velocities within a flow field and is often quantified based on the assumption that fickian law is valid bear 1972 consequently the predicted breakthrough curves are not quite anomalous continuous time random walk ctrw conceptualized solute transport as a series of particle jumps or transitions with spatially varying velocities previously the theory was used for modeling non fickian transport in nonkarst aquifers which yielded strong skewness and long tailing in concentration breakthrough curves berkowitz et al 2006 most recently goeppert et al 2020 applied ctrw to anomalous tracer transport in karst aquifers for the first time which is reasonable as water velocity does vary significantly in the conduit cross section dye tracing experiments often yield spring breakthrough curves which present smooth gradual rising and falling because dispersion over a long period of time or a long distance has invariably smoothened any sharp variations of concentration different from the conventional advection and dispersion over a short conduit length the effect of dispersion may be very small compared to advection such that the induced breakthrough curve is observed to own abrupt changes of concentration with time called advective mixing li and field 2016 showed that without any dispersion the resulting breakthrough curves exhibit skewness but no gradual spreading in the laboratory experiments by li 2004 the earlier procedure in his experiments smeared any sharp fronts it is unclear whether spring breakthrough curves can present abrupt rising and falling if a contaminant enters a conduit from the aquifer fractures rather than from a sinkhole like dye tracing experiments numerical models such as cfp and cmt3d are not quite suitable for answering this question the reasons are 1 the models have numerical dispersion thomas 1995 2 they requires specifying hydrogeologic conditions but often the stratigraphy epikarst and vadose zone are not well known 3 the modeling approach is conductance fitting from cause to result rather than inversion from result to cause this paper uses a breakthrough curve measured at qinglondong spring in kunming southwest china which originated from a point release of chemicals from a cement factory into the aquifer fractures in early june 2007 the distance from the place where chemicals entered the conduit to the spring was about 200 m which means a short conduit distance moreover over such a short conduit close to the spring seepage from fissures is expected to be monodirectional we shall answer an interesting scientific question on when spring breakthrough curves are observed to own abrupt changes of concentration with time the goal is to refine our understanding and to gain insight of transport from the aquifer matrix to a conduit to a spring the breakthrough curve was observed to own both sharp rising and falling shocks the points with slope discontinuity meaning advective mixing in the transport from the measured curve the specific contaminant flux across the conduit wall is inverted as function of downstream distance and time finally this field study is compared with dye tracing experiments 2 hydrogeological background southwest china is widely distributed with karst aquifers see the world karst aquifer map the study area is located in the town of dabanqiao northeast kunming southwest china dolomite there is of the devonian or carboniferous period while limestone is of the permian period as depicted in fig 1 karst aquifers of different periods are separated by poorly permeable clastic rocks of the cambrian carboniferous or permian with a thickness of 20 50 m along the streams are alluvial sediments of the quaternary period the landscape consists of shallow depressions and gentle karst hills with a topographic relief of 50 m the shallow depressions may have sinkholes at their bottom qinglondong spring and huanglondong spring are two major springs in the area located between the karst aquifers and the alluvial sediments of the quaternary period note that the two springs are the upstream ends of two surface streams on the quaternary sediments see fig 1 the two springs are 400 m away from each other as depicted in fig 1 a belt of poorly permeable classic rocks of the permian which is dislocated by a strike slip fault in the northwest direction separates the two springs hydraulically which has been confirmed by dye tracing experiments knez et al 2012 as depicted in fig 1 qinglondong spring is fed by the karst aquifer p permian without surface streams but recharged by rainfall although soil nearby is approximately one meter thick and karrens are not readily evident downward seepage is very fast via fractures especially at the bottom of those depressions the vadose zone has a thickness ranging from 40 to 50 m however the vadose zone had only a minor effect on the contaminant transport as the chemicals entered the aquifer from the cement factory via big fractures at the bottom of a karst depression the spring has an average annual discharge of 0 473 m3 s with a minimum discharge of 0 003 m s and a maximum discharge of 3 m s kunming has an average annual precipitation of approximately 1000 mm from the discharge precipitation and evapotranspiration the springshed of qinglondong spring was estimated at 39 km2 knez et al 2012 qinglondong spring is part of the water supply system for the city of kunming in 2002 the spring was abandoned due to pesticide pollution in the year of 2005 the spring was restored as a water supply source due to a severe drought besides pesticides there are two potential pollution sources for the spring the cement factory and an oil storage depot fig 1 the oil storage depot is located on carbonate rocks of the devonian or carboniferous karst aquifer d or c denoting the devonian or carboniferous as depicted in fig 1 a belt of clastic rocks separates the depot from karst aquifer of the permian we once observed oil pollutants at qinglondong spring suggesting that after a long time oil leakage from the depot can seep through the belt of clastic rocks and finally reach the spring in addition possibly because the belt is not very thick or the clastic rocks are not completely impermeable a series of depressions appear in a linear manner in the southwest direction suggesting that karst aquifers d c are connected with karst aquifer p the connection is believed to be associated with a long transport time thus unimportant for our breakthrough curve of a short duration we did not analyze the chemical components of the event the chemicals were released by the cement factory into the aquifer fractures and finally reached qinglondong spring there are two reasons to exclude the oil storage depot from the contaminant source 1 we had samples of spring water contaminated by oil and our eyes was able to see the floating oil on the water surface but we did not see any floating oil on the water surface in the event 2 the oil storage depot is 8 km upstream of the spring and over such a long distance dispersion would have smeared any sharp changes in spring breakthrough curves the event is inferred to be caused by the cement factory located on a karst highland 1 5 km away from the spring rather than the oil storage depot for non karst aquifers it may take months or years for a contaminant to travel over a distance of 100 m and dispersion tends to smoothen any sharp plumes because the fissures in rocks like sandstone are very narrow however for karst aquifers travel time over a matrix distance of 100 m may be one day or so and dispersion can be small because the fractures enlarged by dissolution by carbon dioxide are distinctly different the narrow fissures in non karst aquifers a few sinkholes were found near the oil storage depot as mentioned above we once found oil at qinglondong spring therefore it is inferred that the whole conduit extends from the depot to the spring fig 1 for such a long conduit the average conduit radius should not vary much close to the spring at the spring outlet the conduit radius a was measured to be 0 7 m also because the entire conduit is from the oil storage depot to qinglondong spring the straight line distance from the cement factory to the conduit was estimated to be approximately 500 m fig 1 dissolved chemicals increase the total electrical conductivity of water when the concentrations of chemicals change very much the total electrical conductivity may be non linear with the concentrations when the concentrations of chemicals change with a small amplitude the change of electrical conductivity is almost linear with the change of concentration this is because a globe nonlinearity is linear locally in mathematics which is the reason why the total conductivity was subtracted with the background conductivity the procedure of measurement was this way a probe in which a tube was surrounded by a sensor was put along the streamline of spring flow an electrical cord connected the sensor of the probe to the conductivity meter the conductivity meter was greenspan ctdp300 made in australia as spring water flowed into the tube its electrical conductivity was detected by the sensor in electrical voltage the sampling interval was routinely set to 15 min the conductivity meter converted the voltage to the electrical conductivity with the unit of μs cm the real time data were stored in a disk of the conductivity meter the data was downloaded from the disk to a computer using the greenspan ctdp300 software installed in the computer the software was able to transfer the downloaded dat file to an excel file 3 first quasi synchronous model spatially a sharp plume has a front and a back the first model assumes that contaminants on the width of the plume front reached the conduit wall quasi simultaneously the back was similar that is the time variance of the plume front reaching the conduit wall is assumed to be much shorter than transport time over the conduit production segment fig 2 3 1 breakthrough curve under steady flow as depicted in fig 2 the contaminant plume reaches a conduit segment with length l the contaminant enters the conduit in terms of specific contaminant flux across the wall the contaminated water in the conduit segment mixes with contaminant free recharge at the segment entrance and finally reaches the segment exit to yield a breakthrough curve fig 3 the first model is essentially a production value problem in which wall contaminant flux is the source term for transport li and liu 2014 li and field 2016 ignoring any dispersion specific wall contaminant flux denoted as j c is a step function as follows 1 j c t c p q w 0 for 0 t t s t t s where t s is step duration c p and q w are contaminant concentration and specific water flux averaged over conduit perimeter respectively the contaminant enters the conduit from fractures via the segment wall rather than from the segment entrance see fig 2 if the conduit radius a and specific water flux q w are nearly uniform along the segment then water mass conservation will yield traveling time t c from the segment entrance z 0 to the exit z l as follows 2 t c τ ln q l q 0 where q 0 andq l are water fluxes at the segment entrance and exit respectively and 3 τ a 2 q w is wall seepage time according to li 2009 or li 2004 box 5 2 in the case of t c t s the model yields a breakthrough curve as follows 4 c l c p 1 e t τ 1 e t c τ e t s t τ e t c τ 0 for 0 t t c t c t t s t s t t s t c t s t c t the breakthrough curve is featured with a rising shock at zero moment and a falling shock at t t s which arise from instantaneous rising and falling of step like j c respectively over a duration of the flat amplitude of c l namely t c t t s the polluted water flux across the wall q p q l q 0 has pollutant concentration c p satisfying 5 c p c l q l q p which is derived from a simple binary mixing between contaminant free q 0 and polluted q p 3 2 breakthrough curve under two stage flow a two stage flow is used to roughly represent transient flow the rising limb of a breakthrough curve is in stage i while the falling limb of the curve is in stage ii accordingly eq 4 is modified to 6a c l c p 1 e t τ 1 1 e t c 1 τ 1 for 0 t t c 1 t c 1 t t s 6b c l c p e t s t τ 2 e t c 2 τ 2 0 for t s t t

breakthrough curve during t c1 t t s in eq 4 should change with time however as will been seen in application subsection such an amplitude change is very minor the rising and falling shocks occur at moments of 0 and t s respectively resulting from our analytical solution not incorporating dispersion on the measured breakthrough curve t s is identifiable we fit t c1 and τ 1 for the rising limb incorporating eq 3 water flux q p1 in stage i is as follows 7 q p 1 2 π alq w 1 2 πl a 2 τ 1 eq 2 is then rewritten as 8 q p 1 q l 1 1 e t c 1 τ 1 substituting fitted values of t c1 and τ 1 into eqs 7 and 8 yields q p1and q l1 in stage i similarly water fluxes in stage ii falling limb can be calculated with the same procedure we have 9 q p 2 2 π alq w 2 2 πl a 2 τ 2 10 q p 2 q l 2 1 e t c 2 τ 2 3 3 application to qinglondong spring at first a step duration t s is read to be the moment time of the falling shock minus that of the rising shock in spring breakthrough curve t s 705 minutes by fitting the rising limb fig 4 we get t c1 120 minutes and τ 1 24 minutes similarly by fitting the falling limb we get t c2 225 minutes and τ 2 64minutes the spring discharge was estimated to be 0 2 1 0 m3 s using eqs 7 and 8 we calculated the polluted water flux from fractures q p1 and the discharge at the exit q l1 in stage i for a prescribed l similarly via eqs 9 and 10 we calculated the q p2 and q l2 in stage ii for the same l prescribed finally for a prescribed l of 300 m the predicted exit discharges were 0 646 m3 s and 0 248 m3 s for stages i and ii respectively in stage i t c1 is 120 min for l 300 m which is reasonable because estimated velocities were similar in a nearby region the distance from the cement factory to qinglondong spring is 1 5 km and a conduit production segment of 300 m long is too large as the distance from the cement factory to the conduit was estimated to be 500 m in karst aquifers it is unlikely that a point source will spread to a width of 300 m after a traveling distance of 500 m the measured fitted and predicted parameters are summarized in table 1 in fig 5 at 23 45 pm on june 9 2007 the water level at qinglondong spring increased abruptly which decreased the ratio of contaminated water from fractures in spring discharge and caused the flat amplitude to dip slightly this time was the transition time of the two stage flow the dip of the spring water level at 9 15 am june 10 was caused by the opening of a sluice gate immediately downstream of qinglondong spring consequently contaminant in the aquifer was flushed to the spring and contaminant concentration was increased as manifested by the small peak of the measured breakthrough curve at 10 am june 10 2007 fig 4 the exit of the conduit production segment is close to qinglondong spring such that the spring breakthrough curve is used as the breakthrough curve at the segment exit if the segment exit is far upstream of the spring conduit dispersion would have smoothened the rising and falling shocks observed in the spring breakthrough curve according to eq 8 t c τ suggesting that the polluted water flux q p is dominant in spring discharge according to eqs 7 and 9 q p in stage i is much larger than in stage ii these two results show that the spring discharge decreased with time which is inconsistent with the observed increase of spring discharge with time fig 5 as expected the model for quasi synchronous arrival is invalid although it can predict the rising and falling shocks in stages i and ii the mixing ratios between contaminant free recharge q 0 and exit discharge q l appear to be 0 0067 and 0 0297 respectively which are too small to be realistic because the total length of the conduit was estimated to be 8 km and the production length l is 300 m at most 4 second nonsynchronous model the second model is more realistic than the first model in that the contaminants on the width of the plume front reached the conduit wall nonsynchronously 4 1 inversion for wall contaminant flux from spring breakthrough curve a contaminant plume enters a conduit in terms of wall contaminant flux j c as depicted in fig 6 the plume front and back along with z 0 and l enclose the plume in terms of j c the integral path black dash line represent the coordinates of water that will reach z l simultaneously the integral path intersects the plume front or back at t ins z ins for t t s the integral path intersects the plume front and is from t t c through t ins while for t t s the integral path intersects the plume back and is from t ins through t referring to li 2004 box

value was 0 3 m3 s for a distance of 500 m from the cement factory to the conduit the production segment is estimated to be 100 m long parameters of the second model are summarized in table 2 using the parameters in table 2 we invert for wall contaminant flux j c from the measured spring breakthrough curve via eqs 11 and 12 see the results in fig 7 the four red lines in that figure enclose the plume in terms of j c the negative time at z 0 means that the plume arriving at the location at t t c will eventually reach the spring z l at t 0 5 discussion taylor dispersion fischer 1979 tends to smoothen a sharp plume the thickness of the plume boundary layer due to taylor dispersion is δ l dt 11 8 m where t is traveling time from the production segment to the spring taylor dispersion is d au a and u are the conduit radius and the average velocity of conduit flow respectively see li et al 2008 note that a 0 7 m and the traveling distance from the production segment to the spring has been estimated to be about 200 m in introduction from table 2 we have u q l π a 2 0 19 m s the time scale associated with the plume boundary layer due to taylor dispersion is δ t bl δ l u 62 s which requires a sampling interval of ten seconds to resolve however the sampling interval of time was 15 min fig 4 because the time scale due to taylor dispersion was much shorter than the sampling interval taylor dispersion cannot be observed in this study according to fig 3 the spreading durations of the observed front and back were t c1 120 and t c2 225 minutes respectively see table 1 as depicted in fig 4 the sample interval of 15 min has successfully resolved the spreadings of the plume front and back in short the two spreading durations observed were much longer than the sampling interval that was much longer than the time scale of taylor dispersion such that taylor dispersion was not observed the effect of two way water exchange between a conduit and matrix on dye tracer transport can be explained using the lagrange approach for the sharp front of a high concentration tracer moving in the conduit tracer is partially emplaced into the matrix when the tracer front passes the wall section where conduit water seeps into the matrix some of tracer free matrix water is freshly added to the front water when the tracer front passes the wall section where matrix water seeps into the conduit which significantly decreases the tracer concentration of the front water for tracer laden water following the tracer front its tracer is partially emplaced into the matrix when the water passes the wall section where conduit water seeps into the matrix the tracer tentatively sequestered inside the matrix left by the earlier tracer front is released back into the conduit when the water following the tracer front passes the wall section where matrix water seeps into the conduit thibodeaux and boyle 1987 elliot and brooks 1997 as such the concentration of the following water only decreases a little in short the front water has a much decreased tracer concentration whereas the following water has a slightly decreased tracer concentration in this manner the sharp front will become gentler and gentler the gently rising front of tracer in a dye tracing experiment is likely to be controlled by this two way mechanism such that few sharp fronts have been previously observed after traveling over a long conduit in this study the contaminants in the conduit were close to the spring and water between matrix and conduit was diluting and monodirectional as the contaminants moved from the segment exit to the spring the sharp front water and the following water both were subject to the same dilution by contaminant free fracture water as they moved from the segment exit to the spring in this manner the whole plume was subject to the same dilution by diluting water monodirectional from the aquifer fractures consequently the sharp front remained sharp which was observed as a step like front in the breakthrough curve this conclusion is somewhat similar to kelvin s circulation theorem in vortex dynamics that irrotational flow of inviscid fluid will remain irrational kundu 1990 the electrical conductivity of spring water may arise from different contamination causes compared with the variability of electrical conductivity under other conditions e g desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 fig 4 was typical in the change amplitude of electrical conductivity however the shape of our breakthrough curve was unusual the reason was that the cement factory used a sluice gate to release the polluted water in addition this event may have extended effects and a long period measurement would be desirable nevertheless we have measured the primary signal evidently extended effects would require tremendous efforts and the associated small amplitudes are often much more difficult to identify from the background electrical conductivity 6 conclusions we studied the electrical conductivity breakthrough curve which originated from a chemical release into the aquifer fractures and was measured in june 2007 at qinglondong spring southwest china the curve was featured with abrupt rising and falling limbs in the first model we assumed that the contaminants on the width of the plume front reached a conduit production segment quasi simultaneously which appeared to be unrealistic the second nonsynchronous model relaxed the aforementioned assumption wall contaminant flux was for the first time directly calculated from the field breakthrough curve rather than via numerical modeling as the conduit polluted segment was very close to the spring seepage was monodirectional and diluting from the fractures to the conduit as the contaminant plume migrated from the segment exit z l to the spring the sampling interval 15 min was much longer than the calculated timescale of conduit taylor dispersion 62 s such that taylor dispersion was not observed in the breakthrough curve though it existed this is the remarkable contribution of this paper i e rendering the answer to the scientific question proposed in the introduction section conversely if abrupt change is observed in a spring breakthrough curve we can get the upperlimit of conduit radius in dye tracing experiments tracers are often released from a sinkhole initially the tracer plume is also sharp however taylor dispersion can be important over a long conduit distance moreover dye tracing experiments have the two way exchange of water between conduit and matrix which tends to introduce additional dispersion and thus yield a tracer front rising smoothly and gently the back is similar author statement hong liu funding acquisition investigation resources data

1477,spring breakthrough curves induced by conventional advection and dispersion often present a gentle smooth change of concentration with time we investigated an electrical conductivity breakthrough curve which originated from a chemical release into the aquifer matrix and was measured in june 2007 at qinglondong spring southwest china the curve presented abrupt rising and falling limbs modeling efforts were focused on the migration of the contaminants from the conduit wall to the spring the conduit production segment was defined to be the conduit section where the chemical plume entered the conduit from aquifer fractures the first model assumed that the time variance of the plume front reaching the conduit wall was much shorter than transport time over the conduit production segment the model yielded a decrease of spring discharge which was inconsistent with the observed increase with time in the second model the above assumption was relaxed and wall contaminant flux was inverted as function of downstream distance and time the observed abrupt rising and falling in the breakthrough curve were interpreted as 1 taylor dispersion was too small to identify for a short conduit 2 seepage from the fractures to the conduit was monodirectional and diluting keywords conduit advectve mixing monodirectional seepage taylor dispersion 1 introduction karst aquifers are prevalent with pores fractures and conduits in the sense of volume pores and fractures store the majority of groundwater and are called matrix in this paper while conduits only store a small portion of water kresic 2012 in the sense of flux rate conduit flow is relatively fast and often turbulent because conduits have large radius while flow in the aquifer matrix is slow and laminar due to the narrow space this difference causes a mathematical singularity i e the equation for turbulent conduit flow is distinctly different from that for laminar seepage in the matrix contaminants can be released into karst aquifers in the manner of point source or non point source to help investigate the processes of contaminant migration in aquifers hydrogeologists intentionally use tracers as a proxy in karst aquifers dye tracing experiments are widely used in which dye tracers are often released at sinkholes and their concentrations are monitored at downstream springs goldscheider and drew 2007 when contaminant laden water flushes through karst conduits breakthrough curves sampled at springs often present a feature of smooth rising much slower more gentle falling and very long tailing the simplest mechanism is taylor dispersion fischer 1979 in a solid wall tube arising from the variance of flow velocity in the cross section besides that there are a variety of retention retarding mechanisms to smoothen sharp changes in the breakthrough curves vortexes at conduit enlargements can roll back contaminants hauns et al 2001 conduit bedforms are able to cause small scale convection in the conduit subsurface and result in two way exchange of water between conduit and matrix thibodeaux and boyle 1987 elliot and brooks 1997 between mobile and immobile water regions there is diffusive solute transfer toride et al 1993 when conduit water pressure is higher than matrix water pressure contaminants are emplaced into the matrix temporarily staying there when the conduit water pressure is lower than the matrix water pressure the sequestered contaminants return with reverse wall seepage back into conduits martin and dean 2001 screaton et al 2004 birk et al 2006 li et al 2008 li and field 2016 two regions non equilibrium 2rne model toride et al 1993 1995 in which the aquifer matrix is treated as a sink source is very popular for simulating dye tracer transport from sinkhole to spring field and pinsky 2000 note that 2rne used diffusion for simulating tracer transfer between a conduit and matrix when tracer laden water flushes in the conduit the matrix acts as a sink to tentatively store part of the tracer when the primary tracer has passed the conduit the portion of tracer tentatively stored in the matrix is released back into the conduit the matrix behaves like a source the 2rne can reproduce strong skewness gradual spreading and long tailing in the predicted breakthrough curves birk et al 2005 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2008 but conceptually has four disadvantages in the application to transport in a conduit 1 it is good for the boundary value problem the initial value problem such as dye tracing experiments and the zero order production problem the production is steady and constant but not designed for the production value problem in which the production is transient changing with time 2 flow velocity was assumed to be a constant along the conduit no water exchange between conduit and matrix was considered 3 dilution by tracer free waters from other tributary conduits any fractures and pores of the rock was ignored and 4 tracer transfer between conduit and matrix was assumed to be diffusive based on the far field approach from the near field viewpoint tracer transfer between conduit and matrix is advective and driven by wall seepage whether diffusion between conduit and matrix can simulate tracer transfer driven by advective seepage between them remains a topic of debate a model of contaminant transport from a sinkhole to a spring was developed by li and loper 2011 in which advection dilution and dispersion were all included li 2011 sought approximate solutions for the initial value problem and the boundary value problem and successfully simulated a dye tracing experiment in northwest florida usa the above models are for contaminants or tracers that enter through a sinkhole and then flush through a conduit transport of solute represented by calcium in a karst conduit was studied by birk et al 2006 they modeled the discharge response and breakthrough curve at a spring in which the recharge at the sinkhole was solute free while water released from the matrix was rich in calcium both the water exchange and solute transfer between conduit and matrix were assumed to be diffusive a significant finding was that in that case a secondary dip of calcium concentration appears following the major dip of concentration in the predicted breakthrough curve birk et al 2006 fig 3 li and field 2016 attempted to explain the mechanism modflow and mt3d are numerical models for flow and transport in non karst aquifers as modflow was unable to simulate turbulent conduit flow characterized by a nonlinear hydraulic gradient reimann et al 2011a the conduit flow process cfp version of modflow was designed to simulate turbulent conduit flow reimann et al 2012 but the exchange factor between conduit and matrix had to account for the scale dependency reimann et al 2011b developed a new karst flow model modbrac in which variably filled conduits characterized with non pressurized flow and saturated conduits characterized with pressurized flow were both considered reimann et al 2011b found 1 if conduits are partially filled water pressure transmits very slowly due to surface waves of water in the conduits 2 spring discharge presents a special pattern when conduit flow changes from pressurized state to free surface state 3 water exchange between conduits and matrix is reduced when free surface flow prevails in the conduits more recently sullivan et al 2019 used cfp and cmt3d conduit mass transport 3d to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi arid and sub humid climate conditions and the statistics of their calibration with available data was good dispersion arises from different velocities within a flow field and is often quantified based on the assumption that fickian law is valid bear 1972 consequently the predicted breakthrough curves are not quite anomalous continuous time random walk ctrw conceptualized solute transport as a series of particle jumps or transitions with spatially varying velocities previously the theory was used for modeling non fickian transport in nonkarst aquifers which yielded strong skewness and long tailing in concentration breakthrough curves berkowitz et al 2006 most recently goeppert et al 2020 applied ctrw to anomalous tracer transport in karst aquifers for the first time which is reasonable as water velocity does vary significantly in the conduit cross section dye tracing experiments often yield spring breakthrough curves which present smooth gradual rising and falling because dispersion over a long period of time or a long distance has invariably smoothened any sharp variations of concentration different from the conventional advection and dispersion over a short conduit length the effect of dispersion may be very small compared to advection such that the induced breakthrough curve is observed to own abrupt changes of concentration with time called advective mixing li and field 2016 showed that without any dispersion the resulting breakthrough curves exhibit skewness but no gradual spreading in the laboratory experiments by li 2004 the earlier procedure in his experiments smeared any sharp fronts it is unclear whether spring breakthrough curves can present abrupt rising and falling if a contaminant enters a conduit from the aquifer fractures rather than from a sinkhole like dye tracing experiments numerical models such as cfp and cmt3d are not quite suitable for answering this question the reasons are 1 the models have numerical dispersion thomas 1995 2 they requires specifying hydrogeologic conditions but often the stratigraphy epikarst and vadose zone are not well known 3 the modeling approach is conductance fitting from cause to result rather than inversion from result to cause this paper uses a breakthrough curve measured at qinglondong spring in kunming southwest china which originated from a point release of chemicals from a cement factory into the aquifer fractures in early june 2007 the distance from the place where chemicals entered the conduit to the spring was about 200 m which means a short conduit distance moreover over such a short conduit close to the spring seepage from fissures is expected to be monodirectional we shall answer an interesting scientific question on when spring breakthrough curves are observed to own abrupt changes of concentration with time the goal is to refine our understanding and to gain insight of transport from the aquifer matrix to a conduit to a spring the breakthrough curve was observed to own both sharp rising and falling shocks the points with slope discontinuity meaning advective mixing in the transport from the measured curve the specific contaminant flux across the conduit wall is inverted as function of downstream distance and time finally this field study is compared with dye tracing experiments 2 hydrogeological background southwest china is widely distributed with karst aquifers see the world karst aquifer map the study area is located in the town of dabanqiao northeast kunming southwest china dolomite there is of the devonian or carboniferous period while limestone is of the permian period as depicted in fig 1 karst aquifers of different periods are separated by poorly permeable clastic rocks of the cambrian carboniferous or permian with a thickness of 20 50 m along the streams are alluvial sediments of the quaternary period the landscape consists of shallow depressions and gentle karst hills with a topographic relief of 50 m the shallow depressions may have sinkholes at their bottom qinglondong spring and huanglondong spring are two major springs in the area located between the karst aquifers and the alluvial sediments of the quaternary period note that the two springs are the upstream ends of two surface streams on the quaternary sediments see fig 1 the two springs are 400 m away from each other as depicted in fig 1 a belt of poorly permeable classic rocks of the permian which is dislocated by a strike slip fault in the northwest direction separates the two springs hydraulically which has been confirmed by dye tracing experiments knez et al 2012 as depicted in fig 1 qinglondong spring is fed by the karst aquifer p permian without surface streams but recharged by rainfall although soil nearby is approximately one meter thick and karrens are not readily evident downward seepage is very fast via fractures especially at the bottom of those depressions the vadose zone has a thickness ranging from 40 to 50 m however the vadose zone had only a minor effect on the contaminant transport as the chemicals entered the aquifer from the cement factory via big fractures at the bottom of a karst depression the spring has an average annual discharge of 0 473 m3 s with a minimum discharge of 0 003 m s and a maximum discharge of 3 m s kunming has an average annual precipitation of approximately 1000 mm from the discharge precipitation and evapotranspiration the springshed of qinglondong spring was estimated at 39 km2 knez et al 2012 qinglondong spring is part of the water supply system for the city of kunming in 2002 the spring was abandoned due to pesticide pollution in the year of 2005 the spring was restored as a water supply source due to a severe drought besides pesticides there are two potential pollution sources for the spring the cement factory and an oil storage depot fig 1 the oil storage depot is located on carbonate rocks of the devonian or carboniferous karst aquifer d or c denoting the devonian or carboniferous as depicted in fig 1 a belt of clastic rocks separates the depot from karst aquifer of the permian we once observed oil pollutants at qinglondong spring suggesting that after a long time oil leakage from the depot can seep through the belt of clastic rocks and finally reach the spring in addition possibly because the belt is not very thick or the clastic rocks are not completely impermeable a series of depressions appear in a linear manner in the southwest direction suggesting that karst aquifers d c are connected with karst aquifer p the connection is believed to be associated with a long transport time thus unimportant for our breakthrough curve of a short duration we did not analyze the chemical components of the event the chemicals were released by the cement factory into the aquifer fractures and finally reached qinglondong spring there are two reasons to exclude the oil storage depot from the contaminant source 1 we had samples of spring water contaminated by oil and our eyes was able to see the floating oil on the water surface but we did not see any floating oil on the water surface in the event 2 the oil storage depot is 8 km upstream of the spring and over such a long distance dispersion would have smeared any sharp changes in spring breakthrough curves the event is inferred to be caused by the cement factory located on a karst highland 1 5 km away from the spring rather than the oil storage depot for non karst aquifers it may take months or years for a contaminant to travel over a distance of 100 m and dispersion tends to smoothen any sharp plumes because the fissures in rocks like sandstone are very narrow however for karst aquifers travel time over a matrix distance of 100 m may be one day or so and dispersion can be small because the fractures enlarged by dissolution by carbon dioxide are distinctly different the narrow fissures in non karst aquifers a few sinkholes were found near the oil storage depot as mentioned above we once found oil at qinglondong spring therefore it is inferred that the whole conduit extends from the depot to the spring fig 1 for such a long conduit the average conduit radius should not vary much close to the spring at the spring outlet the conduit radius a was measured to be 0 7 m also because the entire conduit is from the oil storage depot to qinglondong spring the straight line distance from the cement factory to the conduit was estimated to be approximately 500 m fig 1 dissolved chemicals increase the total electrical conductivity of water when the concentrations of chemicals change very much the total electrical conductivity may be non linear with the concentrations when the concentrations of chemicals change with a small amplitude the change of electrical conductivity is almost linear with the change of concentration this is because a globe nonlinearity is linear locally in mathematics which is the reason why the total conductivity was subtracted with the background conductivity the procedure of measurement was this way a probe in which a tube was surrounded by a sensor was put along the streamline of spring flow an electrical cord connected the sensor of the probe to the conductivity meter the conductivity meter was greenspan ctdp300 made in australia as spring water flowed into the tube its electrical conductivity was detected by the sensor in electrical voltage the sampling interval was routinely set to 15 min the conductivity meter converted the voltage to the electrical conductivity with the unit of μs cm the real time data were stored in a disk of the conductivity meter the data was downloaded from the disk to a computer using the greenspan ctdp300 software installed in the computer the software was able to transfer the downloaded dat file to an excel file 3 first quasi synchronous model spatially a sharp plume has a front and a back the first model assumes that contaminants on the width of the plume front reached the conduit wall quasi simultaneously the back was similar that is the time variance of the plume front reaching the conduit wall is assumed to be much shorter than transport time over the conduit production segment fig 2 3 1 breakthrough curve under steady flow as depicted in fig 2 the contaminant plume reaches a conduit segment with length l the contaminant enters the conduit in terms of specific contaminant flux across the wall the contaminated water in the conduit segment mixes with contaminant free recharge at the segment entrance and finally reaches the segment exit to yield a breakthrough curve fig 3 the first model is essentially a production value problem in which wall contaminant flux is the source term for transport li and liu 2014 li and field 2016 ignoring any dispersion specific wall contaminant flux denoted as j c is a step function as follows 1 j c t c p q w 0 for 0 t t s t t s where t s is step duration c p and q w are contaminant concentration and specific water flux averaged over conduit perimeter respectively the contaminant enters the conduit from fractures via the segment wall rather than from the segment entrance see fig 2 if the conduit radius a and specific water flux q w are nearly uniform along the segment then water mass conservation will yield traveling time t c from the segment entrance z 0 to the exit z l as follows 2 t c τ ln q l q 0 where q 0 andq l are water fluxes at the segment entrance and exit respectively and 3 τ a 2 q w is wall seepage time according to li 2009 or li 2004 box 5 2 in the case of t c t s the model yields a breakthrough curve as follows 4 c l c p 1 e t τ 1 e t c τ e t s t τ e t c τ 0 for 0 t t c t c t t s t s t t s t c t s t c t the breakthrough curve is featured with a rising shock at zero moment and a falling shock at t t s which arise from instantaneous rising and falling of step like j c respectively over a duration of the flat amplitude of c l namely t c t t s the polluted water flux across the wall q p q l q 0 has pollutant concentration c p satisfying 5 c p c l q l q p which is derived from a simple binary mixing between contaminant free q 0 and polluted q p 3 2 breakthrough curve under two stage flow a two stage flow is used to roughly represent transient flow the rising limb of a breakthrough curve is in stage i while the falling limb of the curve is in stage ii accordingly eq 4 is modified to 6a c l c p 1 e t τ 1 1 e t c 1 τ 1 for 0 t t c 1 t c 1 t t s 6b c l c p e t s t τ 2 e t c 2 τ 2 0 for t s t t s t c 2 t s t c 2 t when flow changes from stage i to stage ii the mixing ratio between the entrance water flux q 0 and the polluted water flux q p will change consequently the flat amplitude of the breakthrough curve during t c1 t t s in eq 4 should change with time however as will been seen in application subsection such an amplitude change is very minor the rising and falling shocks occur at moments of 0 and t s respectively resulting from our analytical solution not incorporating dispersion on the measured breakthrough curve t s is identifiable we fit t c1 and τ 1 for the rising limb incorporating eq 3 water flux q p1 in stage i is as follows 7 q p 1 2 π alq w 1 2 πl a 2 τ 1 eq 2 is then rewritten as 8 q p 1 q l 1 1 e t c 1 τ 1 substituting fitted values of t c1 and τ 1 into eqs 7 and 8 yields q p1and q l1 in stage i similarly water fluxes in stage ii falling limb can be calculated with the same procedure we have 9 q p 2 2 π alq w 2 2 πl a 2 τ 2 10 q p 2 q l 2 1 e t c 2 τ 2 3 3 application to qinglondong spring at first a step duration t s is read to be the moment time of the falling shock minus that of the rising shock in spring breakthrough curve t s 705 minutes by fitting the rising limb fig 4 we get t c1 120 minutes and τ 1 24 minutes similarly by fitting the falling limb we get t c2 225 minutes and τ 2 64minutes the spring discharge was estimated to be 0 2 1 0 m3 s using eqs 7 and 8 we calculated the polluted water flux from fractures q p1 and the discharge at the exit q l1 in stage i for a prescribed l similarly via eqs 9 and 10 we calculated the q p2 and q l2 in stage ii for the same l prescribed finally for a prescribed l of 300 m the predicted exit discharges were 0 646 m3 s and 0 248 m3 s for stages i and ii respectively in stage i t c1 is 120 min for l 300 m which is reasonable because estimated velocities were similar in a nearby region the distance from the cement factory to qinglondong spring is 1 5 km and a conduit production segment of 300 m long is too large as the distance from the cement factory to the conduit was estimated to be 500 m in karst aquifers it is unlikely that a point source will spread to a width of 300 m after a traveling distance of 500 m the measured fitted and predicted parameters are summarized in table 1 in fig 5 at 23 45 pm on june 9 2007 the water level at qinglondong spring increased abruptly which decreased the ratio of contaminated water from fractures in spring discharge and caused the flat amplitude to dip slightly this time was the transition time of the two stage flow the dip of the spring water level at 9 15 am june 10 was caused by the opening of a sluice gate immediately downstream of qinglondong spring consequently contaminant in the aquifer was flushed to the spring and contaminant concentration was increased as manifested by the small peak of the measured breakthrough curve at 10 am june 10 2007 fig 4 the exit of the conduit production segment is close to qinglondong spring such that the spring breakthrough curve is used as the breakthrough curve at the segment exit if the segment exit is far upstream of the spring conduit dispersion would have smoothened the rising and falling shocks observed in the spring breakthrough curve according to eq 8 t c τ suggesting that the polluted water flux q p is dominant in spring discharge according to eqs 7 and 9 q p in stage i is much larger than in stage ii these two results show that the spring discharge decreased with time which is inconsistent with the observed increase of spring discharge with time fig 5 as expected the model for quasi synchronous arrival is invalid although it can predict the rising and falling shocks in stages i and ii the mixing ratios between contaminant free recharge q 0 and exit discharge q l appear to be 0 0067 and 0 0297 respectively which are too small to be realistic because the total length of the conduit was estimated to be 8 km and the production length l is 300 m at most 4 second nonsynchronous model the second model is more realistic than the first model in that the contaminants on the width of the plume front reached the conduit wall nonsynchronously 4 1 inversion for wall

for t t s the integral path intersects the plume front and is from t t c through t ins while for t t s the integral path intersects the plume back and is from t ins through t referring to li 2004 box

where t is time since the arrival of the contaminant at the spring t s is the time of the falling shock this time is the last time of binary mixing between polluted water and clean recharge to the conduit segment such that 13 c 0 c l t s q l q p 4 2 application to qinglondong spring as the cement factory released chemicals into the aquifer spring discharge was likely to be high the estimated value was 0 3 m3 s for a distance of 500 m from the cement factory to the conduit the production segment is estimated to be 100 m long parameters of the second model are summarized in table 2 using the parameters in table 2 we invert for wall contaminant flux j c from the measured spring breakthrough curve via eqs 11 and 12 see the results in fig 7 the four red lines in that figure enclose the plume in terms of j c the negative time at z 0 means that the plume arriving at the location at t t c will eventually reach the spring z l at t 0 5 discussion taylor dispersion fischer 1979 tends to smoothen a sharp plume the thickness of the plume boundary layer due to taylor dispersion is δ l dt 11 8 m where t is traveling time from the production segment to the spring taylor dispersion is d au a and u are the conduit radius and the average velocity of conduit flow respectively see li et al 2008 note that a 0 7 m and the traveling distance from the production segment to the spring has been estimated to be about 200 m in introduction from table 2 we have u q l π a 2 0 19 m s the time scale associated with the plume boundary layer due to taylor dispersion is δ t bl δ l u 62 s which requires a sampling interval of ten seconds to resolve however the sampling interval of time was 15 min fig 4 because the time scale due to taylor dispersion was much shorter than the sampling interval taylor dispersion cannot be observed in this study according to fig 3 the spreading durations of the observed front and back were t c1 120 and t c2 225 minutes respectively see table 1 as depicted in fig 4 the sample interval of 15 min has successfully resolved the spreadings of the plume front and back in short the two spreading durations observed were much longer than the sampling interval that was much longer than the time scale of taylor dispersion such that taylor dispersion was not observed the effect of two way water exchange between a conduit and matrix on dye tracer transport can be explained using the lagrange approach for the sharp front of a high concentration tracer moving in the conduit tracer is partially emplaced into the matrix when the tracer front passes the wall section where conduit water seeps into the matrix some of tracer free matrix water is freshly added to the front water when the tracer front passes the wall section where matrix water seeps into the conduit which significantly decreases the tracer concentration of the front water for tracer laden water following the tracer front its tracer is partially emplaced into the matrix when the water passes the wall section where conduit water seeps into the matrix the tracer tentatively sequestered inside the matrix left by the earlier tracer front is released back into the conduit when the water following the tracer front passes the wall section where matrix water seeps into the conduit thibodeaux and boyle 1987 elliot and brooks 1997 as such the concentration of the following water only decreases a little in short the front water has a much decreased tracer concentration whereas the following water has a slightly decreased tracer concentration in this manner the sharp front will become gentler and gentler the gently rising front of tracer in a dye tracing experiment is likely to be controlled by this two way mechanism such that few sharp fronts have been previously observed after traveling over a long conduit in this study the contaminants in the conduit were close to the spring and water between matrix and conduit was diluting and monodirectional as the contaminants moved from the segment exit to the spring the sharp front water and the following water both were subject to the same dilution by contaminant free fracture water as they moved from the segment exit to the spring in this manner the whole plume was subject to the same dilution by diluting water monodirectional from the aquifer fractures consequently the sharp front remained sharp which was observed as a step like front in the breakthrough curve this conclusion is somewhat similar to kelvin s circulation theorem in vortex dynamics that irrotational flow of inviscid fluid will remain irrational kundu 1990 the electrical conductivity of spring water may arise from different contamination causes compared with the variability of electrical conductivity under other conditions e g desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 fig 4 was typical in the change amplitude of electrical conductivity however the shape of our breakthrough curve was unusual the reason was that the cement factory used a sluice gate to release the polluted water in addition this event may have extended effects and a long period measurement would be desirable nevertheless we have measured the primary signal evidently extended effects would require tremendous efforts and the associated small amplitudes are often much more difficult to identify from the background electrical conductivity 6 conclusions we studied the electrical conductivity breakthrough curve which originated from a chemical release into the aquifer fractures and was measured in june 2007 at qinglondong spring southwest china the curve was featured with abrupt rising and falling limbs in the first model we assumed that the contaminants on the width of the plume front reached a conduit production segment quasi simultaneously which appeared to be unrealistic the second nonsynchronous model relaxed the aforementioned assumption wall contaminant flux was for the first time directly calculated from the field breakthrough curve rather than via numerical modeling as the conduit polluted segment was very close to the spring seepage was monodirectional and diluting from the fractures to the conduit as the contaminant plume migrated from the segment exit z l to the spring the sampling interval 15 min was much longer than the calculated timescale of conduit taylor dispersion 62 s such that taylor dispersion was not observed in the breakthrough curve though it existed this is the remarkable contribution of this paper i e rendering the answer to the scientific question proposed in the introduction section conversely if abrupt change is observed in a spring breakthrough curve we can get the upperlimit of conduit radius in dye tracing experiments tracers are often released from a sinkhole initially the tracer plume is also sharp however taylor dispersion can be important over a long conduit distance moreover dye tracing experiments have the two way exchange of water between conduit and matrix which tends to introduce additional dispersion and thus yield a tracer front rising smoothly and gently the back is similar author statement hong liu funding acquisition investigation resources data

1478,the interactions between surface water and groundwater in river corridors lead to temporal fluctuations in subsurface water fluxes which have a critical role on solute transport dynamics in this work we develop a framework to analyze the relative impacts of different temporal frequencies of the flow field in a spatially heterogeneous aquifer on solute transport our analysis indicates that the advection dispersion equation behaves as a low pass filter by wiping out the effect of high frequency velocity fluctuations on the first two spatial moments of the solute plume namely its center of mass and spreading the concepts discussed in the theoretical analysis are then applied to understand solute transport dynamics at the 300 area of the hanford site usa adjacent to the columbia river we examine the temporal behavior of the solute plume s spatial moments for different temporal frequencies utilizing geostatistical parameters estimated in the 300 area due to the proximity to the columbia river groundwater fluxes at the hanford site are highly dynamic resulting in a large range of characteristic temporal frequencies nonetheless similar to the theoretical analysis our results show that the effect of high frequency fluctuations is filtered with most of the solute transport dynamics being controlled by fluctuations characterized by a large characteristic period keywords solute transport groundwater temporal flow fluctuations 1 introduction groundwater and surface water interactions in the river corridor are affected by external factors that are variable in space and time these external factors can be divided into two categories natural and anthropogenic for example natural factors impact aquifer recharge through precipitation while the river stage may depend on glacier melting cycles as for anthropogenic factors examples consist of irrigation activities assouline et al 2006 dam operations hucks sawyer et al 2009 and groundwater pumping libera et al 2017 these natural and anthropogenic factors have significant roles in risk analysis and remediation of contaminated sites e g libera et al 2017 libera et al 2019 batlleaguilar et al 2014 when they are imposed in river corridors they induce multi frequency flow variations spanning from sub daily to seasonal scales which consequently impact water and solute i e contaminants and nutrients fluxes in aquifers within the river corridor harvey and gooseff 2015 several studies showed how temporal fluctuations of the river stage can enhance mass exchange in the river corridor e g boutt and fleming

groundwater flow and increase solute exchange boutt and fleming 2009 highlights how human induced small amplitude daily oscillation of stream stage impacts solute mass fluxes in groundwater systems the effects of temporal variability of surface water bodies on aquifers in coastal environments have also been investigated e g reilly and goodman 1985 yim and mohsen 1992 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 pool et al 2015 in addition to climatic and anthropogenic factors solute transport in river corridors is strongly affected by river morphology e g boano et al 2006 faulkner et al 2012 hester and doyle

2013 di dato et al 2018 several studies concluded that fluctuations of the velocity magnitude increase the solute plume s longitudinal macrodispersion while fluctuations of the velocity direction increase transverse macrodispersion e g rehfeldt and gelhar 1992 dagan et al 1996 wood and kavvas 1999 cirpka and attinger 2003 de dreuzy et al 2012 using the continuous time random walk method nissan et al nissan et al 2017 showed that temporal flow fluctuations increase anomalies in the solute transport processes thus augmenting the plume spreading rates in both longitudinal and transverse directions through numerical experiments pool and dentz 2018 showed that the connectivity is a key feature in enhancing the overall mixing behavior of the plume in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations moreover pool et al 2016 found that the mixing of two fluids with different density is controlled by the characteristic time period of the boundary condition fluctuations a possible method to analyze the effect of flow fluctuations on solute transport is to use a spectral decomposition of the solute response riml and wörman 2015 wörman et al 2012 however a fully upscaled ade equation is usually employed not allowing the detection of non linear effects and anomalies due to the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and flow fluctuations given the results of aforementioned works more research efforts are needed to improve our overall understanding of the implications of a time variable flow field on the transport of dissolved chemical species in the river corridor in many cases high frequency fluctuations are not taken into account for example data collected at a given sampling frequency is usually employed to characterize the flow field therefore effects characterized by a time frequency that is smaller than two times the sampling frequency are usually neglected i e nyquist shannon sampling theorem page 176 of bras and rodriguez iturbe 1985 similarly the complexity of the numerical simulations increases when high frequency fluctuations are present in the boundary conditions this is because the time discretization must be fine enough i e time step employed in numerical codes must be small in order to capture the effect of such high frequencies on model outputs understanding the impact of high frequency fluctuations relative to low frequency fluctuations can provide insights on what sampling frequency or numerical time step may be employed in order to better allocate computational and site characterization efforts the main objective of this paper is to identify the relative impact of different characteristic time periods of the subsurface flow field on solute transport in spatially heterogeneous aquifers for this task we utilize solute transport in a heterogeneous 2d aquifer subject to an unsteady flow field deriving analytical results showing the relative impact of different frequency fluctuations on the solute center of mass and spreading moreover we provide an additional analysis using a multi frequency flow velocities induced by river stage fluctuations measured within the hanford site this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define the physical model used for the analysis in section 3 we analyze the behavior of a solute plume immersed in a simple flow field composed by two terms oscillating at different frequencies while in section 4 we consider a complex flow signal based on hydrological data collected at the hanford site finally in section 5 we provide a summary and conclusions 2 methods 2 1 physical model and transport equation hydrological exchange flows naturally occur between a river and a shallow aquifer located in its proximity as a consequence groundwater flow within the aquifer is influenced by the river stage and pressure drop along the river moreover for a gravel bed river corridor horizontal flows dominate over the vertical flows and fluctuations in river stage induce fluctuations in the horizontal groundwater flows for the present work we consider a horizontal two dimensional 2d flow field with cartesian coordinates x x y due to the heterogeneity of the permeability field groundwater flow is spatially variable groundwater will flow along the river i e y direction in fig 1 due to the pressure drop in the latter simultaneously fluctuations of the river stage regulate groundwater motion in the direction orthogonal to the river i e x direction in fig 1 for this specific flow configuration the governing equation for the concentration c x y t of a dissolved non reactive solute is given by the advection diffusion equation ade 1 c x y t t u o x y c x y t d m c x y t 0 in eq 1 d m represents the molecular diffusion coefficient whereas u o x y is the darcy scale velocity following de dreuzy et al 2012 we further assume quasi steady state flow conditions i e negligible storativity and re write u o x y as follows 2 u o x y u t u x x y v u y x y the velocity is the sum of two contributions one for each direction the u x is the normalized steady state velocity with average hydraulic head orthogonal to the river i e u x 1 0 t where is the spatially averaged operator over all the domain and u is the spatially averaged groundwater velocity orthogonal to the river see fig 1 the u y is the normalized steady state velocity with average hydraulic head along the river i e u y 0 1 t and v is the spatially averaged groundwater velocity along the river if u t 0 the groundwater is moving toward the river i e groundwater discharge to the river while if u t 0 the groundwater is moving away from the river i e river seepage to the aquifer in genera for this study we assume the velocity along the river to be constant in time i e v is constant to simplify the following analysis pore scale dispersion is not included in eq 1 under the assumption that it is much smaller than macrodispersion de dreuzy et al 2012 2 2 spatially averaged transport equation to provide an analytical analysis of the effect of the river stage fluctuations on solute transport we average eq 1 along the y direction i e along the river applying the y average operator y to 1 we obtain the equation for the y averaged concentration c x t c x y t y 3 c x t t d m 2 c x t x 2 u t u x x y c x y t y v u y x y c x y t y 0 we now define the velocity fluctuations around the y average velocity as u x x y u x x y u x x y y and u y x y u y x y u y x y y assuming the velocity field to be spatially stationary we have that u x x y y 1 0 t and u y x y y 0 1 t using this decomposition for the last two terms in the left hand side of eq 3 we obtain 4 u t u x x y c x y t y u t c x t x u t u x x y c x y t y 5 v u y x y c x y t y v c x t y v u y x y c x y t y v u y x y c x y t y next we apply fickian closure to the last terms in eq 4 and 5 obtaining 6 u t u x x y c x y t y d xx t 2 c x t x 2 7 v u y x y c x y t y d xy t 2 c x t x 2 where d xx indicates the effective dispersion in the x direction due to the velocity in the x direction longitudinal dispersion and d xy indicates the effective dispersion in the x direction due to the velocity in the y direction transverse dispersion finally using the eqs 3 7 we obtain the 1d governing equation for the y averaged concentration field 8 c x t t u t c x t x d t 2 c x t x 2 0 where the total dispersion is given by d t d xx t d xy t d m if the solute is initially located along a vertical line in x 0 the initial condition for the y averaged concentration becomes 9 c x 0 c 0 δ x where c 0 c 0 y 0 y is the initial y averaged concentration and δ is the dirac function if d t 0 the solution of eq 8 with initial condition 9 is a moving gaussian with a time varying variance see appendix a for the derivation 10 c x t c 0 2 πσ 2 t exp x x t 2 2 σ 2 t where x t is the center of mass of the y averaged solute plume defined as 11 x t 0 t u t dt and σ 2 t is the spreading coefficient of the y averaged solute plume 12 σ 2 t 2 0 t d t dt for the following analysis we will assume the effective dispersion d xx longitudinal dispersion and the effective dispersion d xy transverse dispersion to be equal to the classical asymptotic i e fickian macrodispersions found using a steady average flow 13 d t d xx t d xy t d m α l u t α t v d m α l u t where α l and α t are the asymptotic longitudinal and transverse macrodispersivities the second approximation in eq 13 is due to the fact that the asymptotic transverse macrodispersivity is smaller than the longitudinal macrodispersivity being equal to zero for 2d random fields attinger et al 2004 and that the molecular diffusion is in general much smaller than the longitudinal dispersion in section 4 we will compare the analytical solution of the averaged eq 8 with the numerical solution of the original 2d eq 1 see appendix b for details about the particle tracking simulation in general using the asymptotic macrodispersivities results in an overestimation of the solute spreading nonetheless the y averaged solution for the concentration field can give key insights on the transport dynamics of a flow characterized by multiple frequencies 2 3 overview and modeling of the hanford 300 area groundwater flow in the hanford site a flood plain aquifer in washington state managed by the u s department of energy displays a wide range of characteristic frequencies the coarse textured hanford aquifer is located in the proximity of the columbia river the river discharge in the hanford site is impacted by both naturally occurring hydrologic processes and events e g snowmelt and flooding and anthropogenic activities e g upstream dam regulation leading to multi frequency river stage fluctuations up to 0 5m daily and 2 3m annually arntzen et al 2006 these stage variations cause significant pressure changes along the river shoreline which lead to a highly dynamic flow field in the hanford aquifer zachara et al 2016 in a previous study song et al 2020 a 3d bank storage model has been built for the hanford 300 area fig 2a to simulate the its long term 2008 2015 river water and groundwater interactions the 1600m 900m 20m model domain fig 2b contains three distinct hydrogeological units 1 high permeability hanford gravelly hg unit consisting of coarse gravelly sand and sandy gravel 2 low permeability ringold fine hf unit composed primarily of silt and fine sand 3 the ringold gravels rg with the mixture of gravels and fine sand these geological structures and hydraulic properties table 1 in song et al 2018 was informed by previous geological and geophysical surveys williams et al 2008 and earlier modeling work chen et al 2013 the grid size was 4m in the horizontal and 0 5m in the vertical with 3 6 million grid cells the transient hydraulic heads at the inland lateral boundaries of the 3d model were kriged from hourly groundwater level data from groundwater monitoring wells located inside and outside of the model domain hydraulic heads along the river boundary of the 3d model were linearly interpolated using the hourly dynamic river stage outputs from a river routing model the modular aquatic simulation system in 1 dimension mass1 which has been well calibrated against river gauge observations with the mean absolute error ranging from 4 to 18 cm richmond and perkins 2009 a constant rate recharge of 55 4 mm yr was applied on the upper model boundary based on monitoring results at nearby locations fayer and walters 1995 the bottom boundaries were set as no flow because the model bottom was well constrained by the fine grained ringold formation the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code pflotran pflotran org hammond et al 2014 was used to simulate groundwater flow field in the aquifer 2 4 numerical analysis for multi frequency flow in hanford site for the multi frequency flow analysis carried out in this work we derived the 2d spatial averaged velocities i e u t and v used in eq 1 from the existing 3d simulation results section 2 3 the groundwater flow simulation produced eight year 2008 2015 3d flow fields with hourly resolution from which we generated the averaged darcy velocity in the saturated hg unit as input for data analysis the first year of the simulation is used for model spin up and not included in our analysis the space average groundwater velocity orthogonal to the river was calculated by 14 u t i 1 n u i t i i hg t i 1 n i i hg t where u i t is the darcy velocity orthogonal to the river in cell i at time t and i i hg t is an indicator function that is equal 1 if the cell i is inside the hg unit and saturated at time t 0 otherwise the space and time average groundwater velocity along the river was calculated by 15 v 1 n t t 1 n t i 1 n v i t i i hg t i 1 n i i hg t where v i t is the darcy velocity along the river in cell i at time t and n t is the number of time steps the space and time average velocity estimated using eq 15 is v 1 8084 m d to emulate the physics due to the spatial heterogeneity of the hanford formation we use a 2d multi gaussian random space function rsf with an isotropic exponential variogram model the parameters used in this analysis are derived from previous studies song et al 2018 the average log conductivity is μ y 2 62 the log conductivity variance is σ y 2 3 65 the integral scale is i y 20m and the effective porosity assumed constant is n e 0 2 since the log conductivity variance is relatively high the longitudinal macrodispersivity contributing to the total macrodispersion d defined in eq 13 is estimated using the empirical relation reported by gotovac et al gotovac et al 2009 16 α l i y σ y 2 4 σ y 4 5 σ y 6 500 4 3 3 2 exp σ y 4 5 fig 3 shows the random realization of the hydraulic conductivity field that is used for the numerical simulation and the initial position of the solute the 2d transport equations are solved using particle tracking and details pertaining the numerical simulations are reported in appendix b to analyze the impact of the fickian assumption used for the dispersion in the y averaged eq 13 we analyze solute transport within the hanford site using both the original transport eq 1 and the y averaged eq 8 note that 8 is equivalent to adding the fickian macrodispersion to the original eq 1 while considering an homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field equal to the geometric mean k g e μ y therefore this comparison will highlight the errors introduced by using a macrodispersion coefficient valid for a constant in time space average flow e g gotovac et al 2009 in scenarios characterized by a time variable space average flow 3 theoretical analysis for a two frequency flow we first illustrate the role of temporal fluctuations on transport by means of the y averaged model described in section 2 2 for a simple time variable flow field for this experiment we analyze the impact of temporal fluctuations on the center of mass 11 and spreading coefficient 12 describing the solute plume we start by considering a simple spatial averaged velocity signal composed by two components 17 u t ε n ϕ u 0 sin 2 π t t ε sin 2 πn t t ϕ the first term of 17 is the principal component characterized by the amplitude u 0 and period t the second term of 17 represents the secondary component and can be controlled by three parameters 1 ε the ratio between the secondary and principal components amplitudes 2 n the number of periods of the secondary component for every t 3 ϕ the phase shift of the secondary component to compute the impact due to the secondary component in u 17 we compare all the results to the ones characterized by a velocity field displaying only the principal component i e ε 0 we start by analyzing the center of mass i e first spatial moment of the solute plume defined in 11 for any set of parameters ε n and ϕ the center of mass is equal to the time integral of the velocity therefore 18 x t ε n ϕ 0 t u t ε n ϕ dt u 0 t 1 cos 2 π t t 2 π ε n cos ϕ cos 2 πn t t ϕ 2 π to understand the impact of the secondary component of the velocity on the plume s center of mass we define the first error indicator as the distance of the center of mass defined in 18 from the one obtained by including only the principal component of the velocity 17 i e ε 0 19 e x t ε n ϕ x t ε n ϕ x t 0 0 0 ε u 0 t n cos ϕ cos 2 πn t t ϕ 2 π close inspection of eq 19 informs that the error e x t is bounded since e x t ε u 0 t πn therefore it is not possible to find a set of parameters ε n and ϕ such that the error e x t diverges in time the error is proportional to the amplitude of the secondary component εu 0 more interestingly the error is proportional to the period of the secondary component t n to better understand the behavior of the error defined in 19 we consider a velocity field with principal component oscillating in time with a period t 365 days and a secondary component defined by different characteristic periods i e varying n while all the other parameters are maintained constant i e u 0 1 ε 1 ϕ π 2 fig 4 shows the results for x and e x obtained for n 2 12 and 72 it is evident that the error on the center of mass e x as defined in 19 decreases when n is increasing effectively making the effect on the center of mass of secondary components with very high frequencies negligible if we consider the velocity field as an input signal and the center of mass the output signal the results indicate that the advection dispersion equation can be interpreted as a low pass filter neutralizing the effect of high frequency fluctuations of the flow field thus if the center of mass is the quantity of interest most of the characterization effort should be dedicated to the low frequency fluctuations of the groundwater velocity field next we analyze the spreading coefficient i e second central spatial moment of the solute plume as defined in 12 for any set of parameters and using the velocity defined in 17 we obtain 20 σ 2 t ε n ϕ 2 0 t d t dt 2 α l 0 t u t ε n ϕ dt we now define the second error indicator as the distance between the two spreading coefficients 21 e σ 2 t ε n ϕ σ 2 t ε n ϕ σ 2 t 0 0 0 2 α l 0 t u t ε n ϕ u t 0 0 0 dt due to the integral of the difference of the absolute values it is not possible to derive an analytical solution for the error e σ 2 instead numerical integration is used to compute the spreading coefficient error fig 5 shows the behavior of the solute plume spreading coefficient σ 2 and the corresponding error indicator e σ 2 for velocities with different secondary components the parameters chosen for this analysis are a combination of ε 0 25 1 and n 12 36 while all the others are maintained constant i e u 0 1 ϕ π 2 as shown in fig 5 the error e σ 2 is not bounded and it increases with time moreover the frequency of the secondary term controlled by n has a minor influence on the spreading coefficient behavior in fact the error rapidly increases when the principal component changes sign in this case at t 0 t 2 t and this behavior is not affected by the frequency e g compare the cases with n 12 and 36 for a fixed ε either 1 or 0 25 in spite of that the amplitude of the secondary term ε has a strong impact on the error as expected and the error e σ 2 decreases when ε decreases 4 transport in a multi frequency flow field the hanford site next we analyze how the solute transport is affected by the interaction between spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface environment and flow fluctuations characterizing the hanford site river corridor to understand the relative impact of the high frequency fluctuation of the darcy scale flow field we express the spatial averaged velocity u t defined in 14 as a fourier series 22 u t m ε 0 2 n 1 m ε n sin 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n where ϕ n t n and ε n ϕ n are the fourier coefficients computed as follow 23 a n 2 0 t u t cos 2 πt ϕ n dt 24 b n 2 0 t u t sin 2 πt ϕ n dt 25 ε n a n 2 b n 2 26 ϕ n arctan 2 a n b n where u t defined in 14 is the spatial averaged velocity orthogonal to the river extracted from the hanford site as explained in section 2 3 the parameter m in eq 22 indicates the number of components we include in the velocity or in other words the smallest period included in the filtered series is t m consequentially u t represents the original velocity i e including all the components fig 6a shows the filtered velocity for different values of m for example as depicted in fig 6a a week filter removes all the components with a period smaller than one week i e m 312 that is equal to the number of weeks in 6 years similarly the month filter is characterized by m 72 the season filter i e three months by m 24 and the year filter by m 6 it is clear that by decreasing m the velocity profile becomes smother a similar smoothing behavior could be obtained with other low pass filters such as a moving average filter fig 6b shows the magnitude of the fourier coefficients ε n for the original velocity i e the frequency spectrum the frequency spectrum displays three peaks the greater coefficient corresponds to n 6 i e 1 year this area of the spectrum represents the impact of seasonal fluctuations of the river stage e g rainfalls melting glaciers etc then we can see two more peaks at n 313 and n 2190 near by the weekly and daily components this part of the spectrum represents the fluctuations of the velocity field induced by the short period fluctuations of the river stage note that the river stage is affected daily by the upstream dam schedule as shown by duncan et al 2007 and song et al 2018 similar to section 3 we compute the error due the missing high frequencies fluctuations in the filtered velocities as the absolute difference from the original velocity of the solute center of mass e x t and the spreading coefficient e σ 2 t the first error can be computed analytically as 27 e x t m 0 t u t d t 0 t u t m d t 0 t n m 1 ε n sin 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n dt n m 1 ε n ϕ n cos 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n 2 π n m 1 ε n ϕ n 2 π note that e x t m is bounded therefore it is not possible to find a velocity signal such that e x diverges in time moreover the contribution of each element n to the error is proportional to the element period ϕ n that decreases with n next we define the second error as the distance between the two spreading coefficients 28 e σ 2 t m 2 α l 0 t u t u t m dt fig 7 shows the results for the center of mass and spreading coefficient obtained for a six year period using both the analytical and numerical methods in the first column we use the original one hour resolution velocity u t while in the other columns the velocity has been filtered using a week month season and year filter as shown in fig 6a the first row of fig 7 reports the particle density at the end of the simulation time i e after six years estimated using a kernel density estimator kde with a bandwidth chosen according to the scott s rule scott 2015 for more complicated particles distributions or domains refer to fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 pedretti and fernàndez garcia 2013 sole mari et al 2019 the second row shows the center of mass trajectory using the y averaged analytical results and the particle tracking method the third row the spreading along the x direction and the fourth row the dispersion along the x direction even if the size of the initial plume is relatively small 100m or 5 integral scales we can see how the y integrated analytical center of mass is very close to the particle tracking results see second row of fig 7 some difference exists only in the first 1 5 years of the simulation on the contrary the analytical solution for the spreading coefficient in eq 13 tends to overestimate the particle tracking spreading as a result of the fickian assumption since the direction of the mean flow repeatedly changes the plume will not reach the fickian state even after six years from the third row of fig 7 it is interesting to note that the spreading of the analytical solution using the fickian assumption decreases with increasing m i e increasing the size of the spectrum removed by the filter however our results show that this is not true for the particle tracking simulation where the spreading evolution does not significantly change even with a low pass season filter applied to the velocity this indicates that the non fickian features of the solute transport due to the change of direction of the mean velocity field act as a low pass filter on the spreading coefficient when a year filter is applied i e only m 6 sines of the fourier expansion are kept we can observe a change of the center of mass and spreading coefficient trajectories using particle tracking note that it is not possible to scale the total dispersion i e reduce the macrodispersivity α l to match the numerical results since it would not take into account the low pass filter behavior to better compare the analytical and particle tracking solutions we report the two errors e x and e σ 2 in fig 8 the magnitude of the error e x estimated by the analytical solution is similar to the particle tracking solution of the 2d equation with some differences in the early stage of the simulation due to the small initially plume the trend in the spreading error e σ 2 is different with the numerical simulations showing an error that is one to two order of magnitude smaller than the y averaged analytical solution error contrary to e x the error e σ 2 is accumulating and increasing with time we remark that these results are valid in fields with a similar velocity spectrum with stronger low frequency fluctuations as shown in fig 6b the level at which the effect of high frequency velocities is truncated strictly depend on the amplitude of the latter however a similar framework can be implemented to understand the information lost by for example neglecting high frequency fluctuations 5 conclusions and discussions quantifying hydrological exchange flows in the river corridor is challenging due to the intrinsic time and space variability of such systems flows in aquifers located within the river corridor often fluctuates at different frequencies due to climatic factors and human activities a clear example is given by the hanford site located in the state of washington usa the hanford site is characterized by a highly dynamic flow field resulting from its proximity to the columbia river which in turn is affected by natural and human induced variabilities in this work we aimed to investigate the relative impact of temporal variability in key solute transport quantities such as the temporal evolution of the plume s center of mass and spreading behavior i e the plume s first two spatial moments in order to quantify the relative impact of flow fluctuations on transport and gain physical understanding we analyzed a simple flow field composed by two components with two different characteristic periods for this analysis we used a simpler transport model for an heterogeneous aquifer derived by averaging along the river i e orthogonal to the direction of the velocity fluctuation and by assuming a fickian dispersion then we compared the simpler model to the original transport equation using a multi frequency flow signal characteristic of the hanford site river corridor our results indicate that the center of mass of the plume is mainly controlled by the low frequencies fluctuations of the flow field the analysis carried out in this work show that the ade behaves as a low pass filter when the quantity of interest is the plume s center of mass or in other words the high frequency fluctuations of the velocity signal are naturally filter by the ade this is evident in both the analytical and numerical results on the other hand the computational analysis regarding the relative impact of temporal variability in the spreading behavior of the solute plume is more complex adopting fickian conditions in transport high frequency fluctuations of the flow field have a clear impact enhancing the spreading of the plume the effect of this contribution becomes evident when the mean flow changes direction however the comparison with particle tracking simulations reveals that the plume will not reach the fickian state since the direction of the spatial average velocity continuously changes within the river corridor the spreading will therefore be smaller than the one obtained using the fickian assumption but most importantly these non fickian features behave as a low pass filter further dampening the effect of high frequency fluctuations of the flow field on the plume s spreading both the analytical solution and particle tracking simulations using the hanford data revealed a significant spreading of the plume induced by the heterogeneous sediments third row in fig 7 this can be explained analytically using eqs 20 and 16 where the analytical spreading coefficient has a linear relation to the asymptotic longitudinal macrodispersivity 20 and thus a linear relation to the integral scale and a superlinear relation to the log conductivity variance 16 for strongly heterogeneous and highly permeable aquifers such as in the hanford site the magnitude of the spreading caused by the interaction between heterogeneity and flow fluctuations can be extremely large see fig 7 for this reason solute and thermal mixing might be highly underestimated when using large scale models with homogeneous assumptions e g faulkner et al 2012 shuai et al 2019 the above conclusions were based on the assumption that the solute transport only occurred within the river corridor and the total mass of the solute did not change i e no exchange between the river and aquifer and absence of reactions during the transport process under this assumption the high frequency fluctuations are filtered by the ade for the center of mass and by non fickian features due to the change of direction of the spatial average velocity for the spreading however many studies showed the hot spots of mixing and biogeochemical reactions occur in the river aquifer interface where river water and groundwater mix with different chemistries boano et al 2014 harvey and gooseff 2015 marzadri et al 2011 the number of mixing hot spots increases with streambed heterogeneity as shown by tonina et al tonina et al 2016 in these cases the high frequency fluctuations may have much more significant impacts on the solute transport since they may alter the total solute mass inside the aquifer hucks sawyer et al 2009 shuai et al 2019 song et al 2018 yellen and boutt 2015 extending our analytical and numerical schemes to include the exchanges between river and aquifer will be topic of future work the analytical results were derived using quasi steady state and confined aquifers assumptions the outcome of these assumptions is that the signal river stage fluctuations instantly propagate through all the domain adding symmetry with respect to the y axis this assumption is valid for relatively small plumes and or highly connected aquifers such as the hanford site nonetheless we expect that the low pass filter effect due to the aquifer heterogeneity depends on the distance from the river and on the initial plume distribution therefore future numerical studies could focus on this aspect of the problem finally this study has important implications on the contaminant remediation efforts in waste management sites adjacent to the river corridor wu et al 2018 yabusaki et al 2017 zachara et al 2013 high frequency fluctuations can increase the mixing and spreading of the contaminant plume and enhance reactions which can be beneficial for groundwater remediation di dato et al 2018 essaid et al 2015 piscopo et al 2013 trefry et al 2019 however our results suggest that the high frequency river fluctuation may have little impacts on the migrations of contaminant distant from shoreline even if the flow field is still highly impacted by the river dynamics which may partially explain the persistence of contaminant in these types of sites zachara et al 2016 declaration of competing

for this analysis we neglect the contributions due to molecular diffusion and local scale dispersion since they are much smaller than macrodispersion induced by the k heterogeneity 
1478,the interactions between surface water and groundwater in river corridors lead to temporal fluctuations in subsurface water fluxes which have a critical role on solute transport dynamics in this work we develop a framework to analyze the relative impacts of different temporal frequencies of the flow field in a spatially heterogeneous aquifer on solute transport our analysis indicates that the advection dispersion equation behaves as a low pass filter by wiping out the effect of high frequency velocity fluctuations on the first two spatial moments of the solute plume namely its center of mass and spreading the concepts discussed in the theoretical analysis are then applied to understand solute transport dynamics at the 300 area of the hanford site usa adjacent to the columbia river we examine the temporal behavior of the solute plume s spatial moments for different temporal frequencies utilizing geostatistical parameters estimated in the 300 area due to the proximity to the columbia river groundwater fluxes at the hanford site are highly dynamic resulting in a large range of characteristic temporal frequencies nonetheless similar to the theoretical analysis our results show that the effect of high frequency fluctuations is filtered with most of the solute transport dynamics being controlled by fluctuations characterized by a large characteristic period keywords solute transport groundwater temporal flow fluctuations 1 introduction groundwater and surface water interactions in the river corridor are affected by external factors that are variable in space and time these external factors can be divided into two categories natural and anthropogenic for example natural factors impact aquifer recharge through precipitation while the river stage may depend on glacier melting cycles as for anthropogenic factors examples consist of irrigation activities assouline et al 2006 dam operations hucks sawyer et al 2009 and groundwater pumping libera et al 2017 these natural and anthropogenic factors have significant roles in risk analysis and remediation of contaminated sites e g libera et al 2017 libera et al 2019 batlleaguilar et al 2014 when they are imposed in river corridors they induce multi frequency flow variations spanning from sub daily to seasonal scales which consequently impact water and solute i e contaminants and nutrients fluxes in aquifers within the river corridor harvey and gooseff 2015 several studies showed how temporal fluctuations of the river stage can enhance mass exchange in the river corridor e g boutt and fleming

groundwater flow and increase solute exchange boutt and fleming 2009 highlights how human induced small amplitude daily oscillation of stream stage impacts solute mass fluxes in groundwater systems the effects of temporal variability of surface water bodies on aquifers in coastal environments have also been investigated e g reilly and goodman 1985 yim and mohsen 1992 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 pool et al 2015 in addition to climatic and anthropogenic factors solute transport in river corridors is strongly affected by river morphology e g boano et al 2006 faulkner et al 2012 hester and doyle

2013 di dato et al 2018 several studies concluded that fluctuations of the velocity magnitude increase the solute plume s longitudinal macrodispersion while fluctuations of the velocity direction increase transverse macrodispersion e g rehfeldt and gelhar 1992 dagan et al 1996 wood and kavvas 1999 cirpka and attinger 2003 de dreuzy et al 2012 using the continuous time random walk method nissan et al nissan et al 2017 showed that temporal flow fluctuations increase anomalies in the solute transport processes thus augmenting the plume spreading rates in both longitudinal and transverse directions through numerical experiments pool and dentz 2018 showed that the connectivity is a key feature in enhancing the overall mixing behavior of the plume in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations moreover pool et al 2016 found that the mixing of two fluids with different density is controlled by the characteristic time period of the boundary condition fluctuations a possible method to analyze the effect of flow fluctuations on solute transport is to use a spectral decomposition of the solute response riml and wörman 2015 wörman et al 2012 however a fully upscaled ade equation is usually employed not allowing the detection of non linear effects and anomalies due to the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and flow fluctuations given the results of aforementioned works more research efforts are needed to improve our overall understanding of the implications of a time variable flow field on the transport of dissolved chemical species in the river corridor in many cases high frequency fluctuations are not taken into account for example data collected at a given sampling frequency is usually employed to characterize the flow field therefore effects characterized by a time frequency that is smaller than two times the sampling frequency are usually neglected i e nyquist shannon sampling theorem page 176 of bras and rodriguez iturbe 1985 similarly the complexity of the numerical simulations increases when high frequency fluctuations are present in the boundary conditions this is because the time discretization must be fine enough i e time step employed in numerical codes must be small in order to capture the effect of such high frequencies on model outputs understanding the impact of high frequency fluctuations relative to low frequency fluctuations can provide insights on what sampling frequency or numerical time step may be employed in order to better allocate computational and site characterization efforts the main objective of this paper is to identify the relative impact of different characteristic time periods of the subsurface flow field on solute transport in spatially heterogeneous aquifers for this task we utilize solute transport in a heterogeneous 2d aquifer subject to an unsteady flow field deriving analytical results showing the relative impact of different frequency fluctuations on the solute center of mass and spreading moreover we provide an additional analysis using a multi frequency flow velocities induced by river stage fluctuations measured within the hanford site this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define the physical model used for the analysis in section 3 we analyze the behavior of a solute plume immersed in a simple flow field composed by two terms oscillating at different frequencies while in section 4 we consider a complex flow signal based on hydrological data collected at the hanford site finally in section 5 we provide a summary and conclusions 2 methods 2 1 physical model and transport equation hydrological exchange flows naturally occur between a river and a shallow aquifer located in its proximity as a consequence groundwater flow within the aquifer is influenced by the river stage and pressure drop along the river moreover for a gravel bed river corridor horizontal flows dominate over the vertical flows and fluctuations in river stage induce fluctuations in the horizontal groundwater flows for the present work we consider a horizontal two dimensional 2d flow field with cartesian coordinates x x y due to the heterogeneity of the permeability field groundwater flow is spatially variable groundwater will flow along the river i e y direction in fig 1 due to the pressure drop in the latter simultaneously fluctuations of the river stage regulate groundwater motion in the direction orthogonal to the river i e x direction in fig 1 for this specific flow configuration the governing equation for the concentration c x y t of a dissolved non reactive solute is given by the advection diffusion equation ade 1 c x y t t u o x y c x y t d m c x y t 0 in eq 1 d m represents the molecular diffusion coefficient whereas u o x y is the darcy scale velocity following de dreuzy et al 2012 we further assume quasi steady state flow conditions i e negligible storativity and re write u o x y as follows 2 u o x y u t u x x y v u y x y the velocity is the sum of two contributions one for each direction the u x is the normalized steady state velocity with average hydraulic head orthogonal to the river i e u x 1 0 t where is the spatially averaged operator over all the domain and u is the spatially averaged groundwater velocity orthogonal to the river see fig 1 the u y is the normalized steady state velocity with average hydraulic head along the river i e u y 0 1 t and v is the spatially averaged groundwater velocity along the river if u t 0 the groundwater is moving toward the river i e groundwater discharge to the river while if u t 0 the groundwater is moving away from the river i e river seepage to the aquifer in genera for this study we assume the velocity along the river to be constant in time i e v is constant to simplify the following analysis pore scale dispersion is not included in eq 1 under the assumption that it is much smaller than macrodispersion de dreuzy et al 2012 2 2 spatially averaged transport equation to provide an analytical analysis of the effect of the river stage fluctuations on solute transport we average eq 1 along the y direction i e along the river applying the y average operator y to 1 we obtain the equation for the y averaged concentration c x t c x y t y 3 c x t t d m 2 c x t x 2 u t u x x y c x y t y v u y x y c x y t y 0 we now define the velocity fluctuations around the y average velocity as u x x y u x x y u x x y y and u y x y u y x y u y x y y assuming the velocity field to be spatially stationary we have that u x x y y 1 0 t and u y x y y 0 1 t using this decomposition for the last two terms in the left hand side of eq 3 we obtain 4 u t u x x y c x y t y u t c x t x u t u x x y c x y t y 5 v u y x y c x y t y v c x t y v u y x y c x y t y v u y x y c x y t y next we apply fickian closure to the last terms in eq 4 and 5 obtaining 6 u t u x x y c x y t y d xx t 2 c x t x 2 7 v u y x y c x y t y d xy t 2 c x t x 2 where d xx indicates the effective dispersion in the x direction due to the velocity in the x direction longitudinal dispersion and d xy indicates the effective dispersion in the x direction due to the velocity in the y direction transverse dispersion finally using the eqs 3 7 we obtain the 1d governing equation for the y averaged concentration field 8 c x t t u t c x t x d t 2 c x t x 2 0 where the total dispersion is given by d t d xx t d xy t d m if the solute is initially located along a vertical line in x 0 the initial condition for the y averaged concentration becomes 9 c x 0 c 0 δ x where c 0 c 0 y 0 y is the initial y averaged concentration and δ is the dirac function if d t 0 the solution of eq 8 with initial condition 9 is a moving gaussian with a time varying variance see appendix a for the derivation 10 c x t c 0 2 πσ 2 t exp x x t 2 2 σ 2 t where x t is the center of mass of the y averaged solute plume defined as 11 x t 0 t u t dt and σ 2 t is the spreading coefficient of the y averaged solute plume 12 σ 2 t 2 0 t d t dt for the following analysis we will assume the effective dispersion d xx longitudinal dispersion and the effective dispersion d xy transverse dispersion to be equal to the classical asymptotic i e fickian macrodispersions found using a steady average flow 13 d t d xx t d xy t d m α l u t α t v d m α l u t where α l and α t are the asymptotic longitudinal and transverse macrodispersivities the second approximation in eq 13 is due to the fact that the asymptotic transverse macrodispersivity is smaller than the longitudinal macrodispersivity being equal to zero for 2d random fields attinger et al 2004 and that the molecular diffusion is in general much smaller than the longitudinal dispersion in section 4 we will compare the analytical solution of the averaged eq 8 with the numerical solution of the original 2d eq 1 see appendix b for details about the particle tracking simulation in general using the asymptotic macrodispersivities results in an overestimation of the solute spreading nonetheless the y averaged solution for the concentration field can give key insights on the transport dynamics of a flow characterized by multiple frequencies 2 3 overview and modeling of the hanford 300 area groundwater flow in the hanford site a flood plain aquifer in washington state managed by the u s department of energy displays a wide range of characteristic frequencies the coarse textured hanford aquifer is located in the proximity of the columbia river the river discharge in the hanford site is impacted by both naturally occurring hydrologic processes and events e g snowmelt and flooding and anthropogenic activities e g upstream dam regulation leading to multi frequency river stage fluctuations up to 0 5m daily and 2 3m annually arntzen et al 2006 these stage variations cause significant pressure changes along the river shoreline which lead to a highly dynamic flow field in the hanford aquifer zachara et al 2016 in a previous study song et al 2020 a 3d bank storage model has been built for the hanford 300 area fig 2a to simulate the its long term 2008 2015 river water and groundwater interactions the 1600m 900m 20m model domain fig 2b contains three distinct hydrogeological units 1 high permeability hanford gravelly hg unit consisting of coarse gravelly sand and sandy gravel 2 low permeability ringold fine hf unit composed primarily of silt and fine sand 3 the ringold gravels rg with the mixture of gravels and fine sand these geological structures and hydraulic properties table 1 in song et al 2018 was informed by previous geological and geophysical surveys williams et al 2008 and earlier modeling work chen et al 2013 the grid size was 4m in the horizontal and 0 5m in the vertical with 3 6 million grid cells the transient hydraulic heads at the inland lateral boundaries of the 3d model were kriged from hourly groundwater level data from groundwater monitoring wells located inside and outside of the model domain hydraulic heads along the river boundary of the 3d model were linearly interpolated using the hourly dynamic river stage outputs from a river routing model the modular aquatic simulation system in 1 dimension mass1 which has been well calibrated against river gauge observations with the mean absolute error ranging from 4 to 18 cm richmond and perkins 2009 a constant rate recharge of 55 4 mm yr was applied on the upper model boundary based on monitoring results at nearby locations fayer and walters 1995 the bottom boundaries were set as no flow because the model bottom was well constrained by the fine grained ringold formation the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code pflotran pflotran org hammond et al 2014 was used to simulate groundwater flow field in the aquifer 2 4 numerical analysis for multi frequency flow in hanford site for the multi frequency flow analysis carried out in this work we derived the 2d spatial averaged velocities i e u t and v used in eq 1 from the existing 3d simulation results section 2 3 the groundwater flow simulation produced eight year 2008 2015 3d flow fields with hourly resolution from which we generated the averaged darcy velocity in the saturated hg unit as input for data analysis the first year of the simulation is used for model spin up and not included in our analysis the space average groundwater velocity orthogonal to the river was calculated by 14 u t i 1 n u i t i i hg t i 1 n i i hg t where u i t is the darcy velocity orthogonal to the river in cell i at time t and i i hg t is an indicator function that is equal 1 if the cell i is inside the hg unit and saturated at time t 0 otherwise the space and time average groundwater velocity along the river was calculated by 15 v 1 n t t 1 n t i 1 n v i t i i hg t i 1 n i i hg t where v i t is the darcy velocity along the river in cell i at time t and n t is the number of time steps the space and time average velocity estimated using eq 15 is v 1 8084 m d to emulate the physics due to the spatial heterogeneity of the hanford formation we use a 2d multi gaussian random space function rsf with an isotropic exponential variogram model the parameters used in this analysis are derived from previous studies song et al 2018 the average log conductivity is μ y 2 62 the log conductivity variance is σ y 2 3 65 the integral scale is i y 20m and the effective porosity assumed constant is n e 0 2 since the log conductivity variance is relatively high the longitudinal macrodispersivity contributing to the total macrodispersion d defined in eq 13 is estimated using the empirical relation reported by gotovac et al gotovac et al 2009 16 α l i y σ y 2 4 σ y 4 5 σ y 6 500 4 3 3 2 exp σ y 4 5 fig 3 shows the random realization of the hydraulic conductivity field that is used for the numerical simulation and the initial position of the solute the 2d transport equations are solved using particle tracking and details pertaining the numerical simulations are reported in appendix b to analyze the impact of the fickian assumption used for the dispersion in the y averaged eq 13 we analyze solute transport within the hanford site using both the original transport eq 1 and the y averaged eq 8 note that 8 is equivalent to adding the fickian macrodispersion to the original eq 1 while considering an homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field equal to the geometric mean k g e μ y therefore this comparison will highlight the errors introduced by using a macrodispersion coefficient valid for a constant in time space average flow e g gotovac et al 2009 in scenarios characterized by a time variable space average flow 3 theoretical analysis for a two frequency flow we first illustrate the role of temporal fluctuations on transport by means of the y averaged model described in section 2 2 for a simple time variable flow field for this experiment we analyze the impact of temporal fluctuations on the center of mass 11 and spreading coefficient 12 describing the solute plume we start by considering a simple spatial averaged velocity signal composed by two components 17 u t ε n ϕ u 0 sin 2 π t t ε sin 2 πn t t ϕ the first term of 17 is the principal component characterized by the amplitude u 0 and period t the second term of 17 represents the secondary component and can be controlled by three parameters 1 ε the ratio between the secondary and principal components amplitudes 2 n the number of periods of the secondary component for every t 3 ϕ the phase shift of the secondary component to compute the impact due to the secondary component in u 17 we compare all the results to the ones characterized by a velocity field displaying only the principal component i e ε 0 we start by analyzing the center of mass i e first spatial moment of the solute plume defined in 11 for any set of parameters ε n and ϕ the center of mass is equal to the time integral of the velocity therefore 18 x t ε n ϕ 0 t u t ε n ϕ dt u 0 t 1 cos 2 π t t 2 π ε n cos ϕ cos 2 πn t t ϕ 2 π to understand the impact of the secondary component of the velocity on the plume s center of mass we define the first error indicator as the distance of the center of mass defined in 18 from the one obtained by including only the principal component of the velocity 17 i e ε 0 19 e x t ε n ϕ x t ε n ϕ x t 0 0 0 ε u 0 t n cos ϕ cos 2 πn t t ϕ 2 π close inspection of eq 19 informs that the error e x t is bounded since e x t ε u 0 t πn therefore it is not possible to find a set of parameters ε n and ϕ such that the error e x t diverges in time the error is proportional to the amplitude of the secondary component εu 0 more interestingly the error is proportional to the period of the secondary component t n to better understand the behavior of the error defined in 19 we consider a velocity field with principal component oscillating in time with a period t 365 days and a secondary component defined by different characteristic periods i e varying n while all the other parameters are maintained constant i e u 0 1 ε 1 ϕ π 2 fig 4 shows the results for x and e x obtained for n 2 12 and 72 it is evident that the error on the center of mass e x as defined in 19 decreases when n is increasing effectively making the effect on the center of mass of secondary components with very high frequencies negligible if we consider the velocity field as an input signal and the center of mass the output signal the results indicate that the advection dispersion equation can be interpreted as a low pass filter neutralizing the effect of high frequency fluctuations of the flow field thus if the center of mass is the quantity of interest most of the characterization effort should be dedicated to the low frequency fluctuations of the groundwater velocity field next we analyze the spreading coefficient i e second central spatial moment of the solute plume as defined in 12 for any set of parameters and using the velocity defined in 17 we obtain 20 σ 2 t ε n ϕ 2 0 t d t dt 2 α l 0 t u t ε n ϕ dt we now define the second error indicator as the distance between the two spreading coefficients 21 e σ 2 t ε n ϕ σ 2 t ε n ϕ σ 2 t 0 0 0 2 α l 0 t u t ε n ϕ u t 0 0 0 dt due to the integral of the difference of the absolute values it is not possible to derive an analytical solution for the error e σ 2 instead numerical integration is used to compute the spreading coefficient error fig 5 shows the behavior of the solute plume spreading coefficient σ 2 and the corresponding error indicator e σ 2 for velocities with different secondary components the parameters chosen for this analysis are a combination of ε 0 25 1 and n 12 36 while all the others are maintained constant i e u 0 1 ϕ π 2 as shown in fig 5 the error e σ 2 is not bounded and it increases with time moreover the frequency of the secondary term controlled by n has a minor influence on the spreading coefficient behavior in fact the error rapidly increases when the principal component changes sign in this case at t 0 t 2 t and this behavior is not affected by the frequency e g compare the cases with n 12 and 36 for a fixed ε either 1 or 0 25 in spite of that the amplitude of the secondary term ε has a strong impact on the error as expected and the error e σ 2 decreases when ε decreases 4 transport in a multi frequency flow field the hanford site next we analyze how the solute transport is affected by the interaction between spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface environment and flow fluctuations characterizing the hanford site river corridor to understand the relative impact of the high frequency fluctuation of the darcy scale flow field we express the spatial averaged velocity u t defined in 14 as a fourier series 22 u t m ε 0 2 n 1 m ε n sin 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n where ϕ n t n and ε n ϕ n are the fourier coefficients computed as follow 23 a n 2 0 t u t cos 2 πt ϕ n dt 24 b n 2 0 t u t sin 2 πt ϕ n dt 25 ε n a n 2 b n 2 26 ϕ n arctan 2 a n b n where u t defined in 14 is the spatial averaged velocity orthogonal to the river extracted from the hanford site as explained in section 2 3 the parameter m in eq 22 indicates the number of components we include in the velocity or in other words the smallest period included in the filtered series is t m consequentially u t represents the original velocity i e including all the components fig 6a shows the filtered velocity for different values of m for example as depicted in fig 6a a week filter removes all the components with a period smaller than one week i e m 312 that is equal to the number of weeks in 6 years similarly the month filter is characterized by m 72 the season filter i e three months by m 24 and the year filter by m 6 it is clear that by decreasing m the velocity profile becomes smother a similar smoothing behavior could be obtained with other low pass filters such as a moving average filter fig 6b shows the magnitude of the fourier coefficients ε n for the original velocity i e the frequency spectrum the frequency spectrum displays three peaks the greater coefficient corresponds to n 6 i e 1 year this area of the spectrum represents the impact of seasonal fluctuations of the river stage e g rainfalls melting glaciers etc then we can see two more peaks at n 313 and n 2190 near by the weekly and daily components this part of the spectrum represents the fluctuations of the velocity field induced by the short period fluctuations of the river stage note that the river stage is affected daily by the upstream dam schedule as shown by duncan et al 2007 and song et al 2018 similar to section 3 we compute the error due the missing high frequencies fluctuations in the filtered velocities as the absolute difference from the original velocity of the solute center of mass e x t and the spreading coefficient e σ 2 t the first error can be computed analytically as 27 e x t m 0 t u t d t 0 t u t m d t 0 t n m 1 ε n sin 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n dt n m 1 ε n ϕ n cos 2 πt ϕ n ϕ n 2 π n m 1 ε n ϕ n 2 π note that e x t m is bounded therefore it is not possible to find a velocity signal such that e x diverges in time moreover the contribution of each element n to the error is proportional to the element period ϕ n that decreases with n next we define the second error as the distance between the two spreading coefficients 28 e σ 2 t m 2 α l 0 t u t u t m dt fig 7 shows the results for the center of mass and spreading coefficient obtained for a six year period using both the analytical and numerical methods in the first column we use the original one hour resolution velocity u t while in the other columns the velocity has been filtered using a week month season and year filter as shown in fig 6a the first row of fig 7 reports the particle density at the end of the simulation time i e after six years estimated using a kernel density estimator kde with a bandwidth chosen according to the scott s rule scott 2015 for more complicated particles distributions or domains refer to fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 pedretti and fernàndez garcia 2013 sole mari et al 2019 the second row shows the center of mass trajectory using the y averaged analytical results and the particle tracking method the third row the spreading along the x direction and the fourth row the dispersion along the x direction even if the size of the initial plume is relatively small 100m or 5 integral scales we can see how the y integrated analytical center of mass is very close to the particle tracking results see second row of fig 7 some difference exists only in the first 1 5 years of the simulation on the contrary the analytical solution for the spreading coefficient in eq 13 tends to overestimate the particle tracking spreading as a result of the fickian assumption since the direction of the mean flow repeatedly changes the plume will not reach the fickian state even after six years from the third row of fig 7 it is interesting to note that the spreading of the analytical solution using the fickian assumption decreases with increasing m i e increasing the size of the spectrum removed by the filter however our results show that this is not true for the particle tracking simulation where the spreading evolution does not significantly change even with a low pass season filter applied to the velocity this indicates that the non fickian features of the solute transport due to the change of direction of the mean velocity field act as a low pass filter on the spreading coefficient when a year filter is applied i e only m 6 sines of the fourier expansion are kept we can observe a change of the center of mass and spreading coefficient trajectories using particle tracking note that it is not possible to scale the total dispersion i e reduce the macrodispersivity α l to match the numerical results since it would not take into account the low pass filter behavior to better compare the analytical and particle tracking solutions we report the two errors e x and e σ 2 in fig 8 the magnitude of the error e x estimated by the analytical solution is similar to the particle tracking solution of the 2d equation with some differences in the early stage of the simulation due to the small initially plume the trend in the spreading error e σ 2 is different with the numerical simulations showing an error that is one to two order of magnitude smaller than the y averaged analytical solution error contrary to e x the error e σ 2 is accumulating and increasing with time we remark that these results are valid in fields with a similar velocity spectrum with stronger low frequency fluctuations as shown in fig 6b the level at which the effect of high frequency velocities is truncated strictly depend on the amplitude of the latter however a similar framework can be implemented to understand the information lost by for example neglecting high frequency fluctuations 5 conclusions and discussions quantifying hydrological exchange flows in the river corridor is challenging due to the intrinsic time and space variability of such systems flows in aquifers located within the river corridor often fluctuates at different frequencies due to climatic factors and human activities a clear example is given by the hanford site located in the state of washington usa the hanford site is characterized by a highly dynamic flow field resulting from its proximity to the columbia river which in turn is affected by natural and human induced variabilities in this work we aimed to investigate the relative impact of temporal variability in key solute transport quantities such as the temporal evolution of the plume s center of mass and spreading behavior i e the plume s first two spatial moments in order to quantify the relative impact of flow fluctuations on transport and gain physical understanding we analyzed a simple flow field composed by two components with two different characteristic periods for this analysis we used a simpler transport model for an heterogeneous aquifer derived by averaging along the river i e orthogonal to the direction of the velocity fluctuation and by assuming a fickian dispersion then we compared the simpler model to the original transport equation using a multi frequency flow signal characteristic of the hanford site river corridor our results indicate that the center of mass of the plume is mainly controlled by the low frequencies fluctuations of the flow field the analysis carried out in this work show that the ade behaves as a low pass filter when the quantity of interest is the plume s center of mass or in other words the high frequency fluctuations of the velocity signal are naturally filter by the ade this is evident in both the analytical and numerical results on the other hand the computational analysis regarding the relative impact of temporal variability in the spreading behavior of the solute plume is more complex adopting fickian conditions in transport high frequency fluctuations of the flow field have a clear impact enhancing the spreading of the plume the effect of this contribution becomes evident when the mean flow changes direction however the comparison with particle tracking simulations reveals that the plume will not reach the fickian state since the direction of the spatial average velocity continuously changes within the river corridor the spreading will therefore be smaller than the one obtained using the fickian assumption but most importantly these non fickian features behave as a low pass filter further dampening the effect of high frequency fluctuations of the flow field on the plume s spreading both the analytical solution and particle tracking simulations using the hanford data revealed a significant spreading of the plume induced by the heterogeneous sediments third row in fig 7 this can be explained analytically using eqs 20 and 16 where the analytical spreading coefficient has a linear relation to the asymptotic longitudinal macrodispersivity 20 and thus a linear relation to the integral scale and a superlinear relation to the log conductivity variance 16 for strongly heterogeneous and highly permeable aquifers such as in the hanford site the magnitude of the spreading caused by the interaction between heterogeneity and flow fluctuations can be extremely large see fig 7 for this reason solute and thermal mixing might be highly underestimated when using large scale models with homogeneous assumptions e g faulkner et al 2012 shuai et al 2019 the above conclusions were based on the assumption that the solute transport only occurred within the river corridor and the total mass of the solute did not change i e no exchange between the river and aquifer and absence of reactions during the transport process under this assumption the high frequency fluctuations are filtered by the ade for the center of mass and by non fickian features due to the change of direction of the spatial average velocity for the spreading however many studies showed the hot spots of mixing and biogeochemical reactions occur in the river aquifer interface where river water and groundwater mix with different chemistries boano et al 2014 harvey and gooseff 2015 marzadri et al 2011 the number of mixing hot spots increases with streambed heterogeneity as shown by tonina et al tonina et al 2016 in these cases the high frequency fluctuations may have much more significant impacts on the solute transport since they may alter the total solute mass inside the aquifer hucks sawyer et al 2009 shuai et al 2019 song et al 2018 yellen and boutt 2015 extending our analytical and numerical schemes to include the exchanges between river and aquifer will be topic of future work the analytical results were derived using quasi steady state and confined aquifers assumptions the outcome of these assumptions is that the signal river stage fluctuations instantly propagate through all the domain adding symmetry with respect to the y axis this assumption is valid for relatively small plumes and or highly connected aquifers such as the hanford site nonetheless we expect that the low pass filter effect due to the aquifer heterogeneity depends on the distance from the river and on the initial plume distribution therefore future numerical studies could focus on this aspect of the problem finally this study has important implications on the contaminant remediation efforts in waste management sites adjacent to the river corridor wu et al 2018 yabusaki et al 2017 zachara et al 2013 high frequency fluctuations can increase the mixing and spreading of the contaminant plume and enhance reactions which can be beneficial for groundwater remediation di dato et al 2018 essaid et al 2015 piscopo et al 2013 trefry et al 2019 however our results suggest that the high frequency river fluctuation may have little impacts on the migrations of contaminant distant from shoreline even if the flow field is still highly impacted by the river dynamics which may partially explain the persistence of contaminant in these types of sites zachara et al 2016 declaration of competing

for this analysis we neglect the contributions due to molecular diffusion and local scale dispersion since they are much smaller than macrodispersion induced by the k heterogeneity 
1479,in recent years a number of methods have been used to measure the biodegradation of petroleum light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl at petroleum release sites a process known as natural source zone depletion nszd most commonly nszd rates have been measured at sites with unconsolidated geology and relatively shallow groundwater 50 ft bgs 15 m bgs for this study we have used two methods 1 carbon dioxide flux measured using carbon traps and 2 heat flux based on subsurface temperature gradients to measure nszd rates at a petroleum release site in hawaii with basalt geology and deep groundwater 300 ft bgs 100 m bgs both methods documented the occurrence of nszd at the facility and the two methods yield estimates of the nszd rate that agreed within a factor of 2 4600 to 7400 gal yr 17 000 to 28 000 l yr for the flux method and 8600 to 13 000 gal yr 33 000 to 49 000 l yr for the temperature method soil gas samples collected directly above the water table and at shallower depths within the vadose zone indicated aerobic conditions throughout the vadose zone oxygen 13 and no detectable methane these results indicate that nszd occurs at this site through the direct aerobic biodegradation of lnapl rather than the two step process of anaerobic methanogenesis followed by methane oxidation at a shallow depth interval documented at other sites keywords aerobic biodegradation lnapl basalt nszd 1 introduction thousands of sites around the world are affected by historical releases of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl such as crude oil refined fuels lubricants and heating oil traditionally active treatment technologies e g hydraulic recovery air sparging multi phase extraction soil vapor extraction sve etc have been applied as common remediation approaches for most lnapl sites us epa 2005 itrc 2009 mchugh et al 2014 except for complete excavation none of these in situ remediation technologies has been demonstrated to completely remove all the lnapl within the treatment zone sookhak lari et al 2020 in recent years however there has been an increasing recognition that bacterial degradation of petroleum constituents within lnapl source areas is an important contributor to lnapl removal a process known as natural source zone depletion nszd garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 a number of methods have been developed to quantify nszd rates based on tracking the consumption of oxygen and or the generation of carbon dioxide co2 associated with biological degradation of petroleum api 2017 crc care 2018 these include measurement of co2 and oxygen concentration gradients itrc 2009 and the use of dynamic closed chambers sihota et al 2011 and passive co2 traps mccoy et al 2015 to measure co2 flux at the ground surface above lnapl source areas all of these methods utilize the measured flux of oxygen into the lnapl source area or flux of co2 out of the lnapl source area to determine the lnapl degradation rate i e the amount of lnapl degradation required to account for the measured amount of oxygen consumption or co2 production more recently researchers have developed and demonstrated a temperature based monitoring method to measure nszd rates for petroleum lnapl source areas warren and bekins 2015 askarani et al 2018 sale et al 2014 this approach utilizes measurement of the heat generated from biological lnapl degradation to quantify the lnapl degradation rate for this approach i vertical temperature profiles are collected recording the soil temperature from ground surface down through the lnapl source area ii this temperature profile is used to determine the heat flux away from the biological reaction zone and iii this heat flux is used to calculate the amount of petroleum being degraded i e the volume of petroleum per unit area per unit time required to account for the amount of heat being generated these flux and temperature nszd measurement methods have shown lnapl biodegradation rates of 100 s to 1000 s of gallons of lnapl per acre per year roughly 1000 s to 10 000 s of kilograms per hectare per year garg et al 2017 at almost every site where nszd rates were measured in addition these lnapl removal rates commonly exceed what can be achieved with long term active lnapl recovery remedies as a result nszd is gaining broad acceptance as a viable and cost effective remedy for mature lnapl releases sale et al 2018a 2018b however to date nszd rates have been reported in the literature at only a few dozen sites in a limited range of environmental settings typically sites with unconsolidated soils relatively shallow groundwater 50 ft bgs and permeable surface cover i e no pavement or buildings at these sites nszd typically occurs as a two step process i anaerobic methanogenic degradation of petroleum constituents within the lnapl source area and ii methane oxidation in the vadose zone above the lnapl source area at the depth interval where upward diffusing methane meets downward diffusing oxygen from the ground surface because the methane oxidation is the primary heat source for this two step process the interval of heat generation corresponds to this methane oxidation zone rather than the depth of the lnapl source area warren and bekins 2015 for lnapls with a significant volatile fraction oxidation of vocs in the vadose zone may also contribute to nszd sookhak lari et al 2019 in this paper we demonstrate the measurement of nszd rates for an lnapl source area at the red hill bulk fuel storage facility rhbfsf on oahu hawaii characterized by a high permeability basalt vadose zone greater than 300 ft thick a weathered basalt saprolite layer overlies the facility minimizing recharge from rainfall to our knowledge this is one of only a few sites where nszd rates have been measured in a consolidated rock geologic setting and the first example of nszd that appears attributable to direct aerobic degradation within the lnapl source area 2 methods the study site consists of 20 very large 12 5 million gallon 47 million l steel lined reinforced concrete two and a half to four foot thick underground storage tanks installed within a thick basalt vadose zone such that the base of the tanks is approximately 120 ft 40 m above the groundwater table each tank is approximately 250 ft 75 m tall and 100 ft 30 m in diameter the tanks have been in service since the mid 1940s and 18 of the tanks remain in service the tanks have been utilized primarily for storage of middle distillate fuels jet fuels marine diesel fuels with more limited past storage of gasoline range fuel the tanks are arranged in two rows of ten tanks each running from ese to wnw a lower access tunnel runs between the two rows of tanks just below the base of the tanks and an upper access tunnel runs between the two rows of tanks at an elevation of approximately 180 ft 55 m above the bottom of the tanks fig 1 in addition to providing access to the tanks for maintenance the lower access tunnel provides access to 47 soil gas monitoring points two to three points below each tank three monitoring wells installed within the tank farm area and one monitoring well installed downgradient of the tank farm area fig 2 additional monitoring wells outside the tank farm area used for this study are accessible from ground surface fig 2 aside from the access tunnels the native rock around the tanks is largely undisturbed the basalt is highly permeable relative to most contaminated sites in unconsolidated settings the high permeability components of the basalt include massive a ā thick chunky lava flows clinker zones layers of gravel like lava fragments between a ā layers described as high permeability material analogous to coarse clean gravel and pāhoehoe thin smooth lava flows that have high intrinsic permeability similar to that of carbonate rocks hunt 1996 overall hunt 1996 reports that when averaged over several lava flow thicknesses the lateral hydraulic conductivity of dike free lava flows such as found in the vicinity of red hill is about 500 to 5000 ft per day 0 18 to 1 8 cm s this is about 23 to 230 times higher than the median hydraulic conductivity of 0 008 cm s for 191 contaminated sand and gravel groundwater sites from newell et al 1990 due to this high permeability advective or diffusive air penetration into the unsaturated basalt is much more likely than for sites comprised of unconsolidated media prior investigation results indicate historical petroleum fuel releases prior to 1988 of unknown volume from several tanks and one more recent release of 27 000 gal 100 000l of jet fuel in 2014 evidence of prior releases includes visible staining and detection of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in rock cores collected from angled borings completed below the fuel tanks in the late 1990s and early 2000s documenting the presence of lnapl within a depth interval of approximately 10 ft to 30 ft 3 to 10 m below the bottom of the fuel tanks these angled borings were later converted to soil gas monitoring points fig 1 lnapl has not been observed in groundwater approximately 120 ft 35 m below the bottom of the fuel tanks in any of the monitoring wells the rhbfsf has implemented modern release prevention and release detection technologies the purpose of this study was to better understand nszd rates and processes for historical releases three methods were applied to quantify nszd rates for lnapl associated with these prior releases i the passive co2 trap method with traps installed at the surface of the facility ii an adapted co2 trap method where co2 was measured in the exhaust from the ventilated red hill tunnel system and iii the temperature method in addition oxygen co2 and methane concentrations and differential pressure were measured at each below tank soil gas point and monitoring well headspace 2 1 carbon trap measurements carbon traps from e flux fort collins co were used to measure the flux of co2 at the ground surface and through the two access tunnels flux at the ground surface was measured by deploying eight standard e flux carbon traps two transect lines of four traps were deployed each transverse to the rows of tanks resulting in two carbon traps north of the tanks four traps above the tanks and two traps south of the tanks the surface traps were deployed for 14 days in the fall of 2017 fig 3 co2 flux within the two tunnels was measured using custom packed carbon trap cartridges from e flux these cartridges were deployed at three locations i an air intake point for the tunnel system ii the air exhaust point for the upper tunnel and iii the air exhaust point for the lower tunnel at each location two consecutive 24 h samples were collected in the fall of 2017 by pumping air through the carbon traps at a constant pumping rate of 1 06 l min a mass flow controller was used to maintain a constant air pumping rate the carbon trap samples were analyzed by e flux to measure the mass of co2 on each trap 14c measurements were used to apportion the mass of co2 in each sample between modern sources and fossil fuel sources hua et al 2013 mccoy et al 2015 for the aboveground traps the mass of fossil fuel associated co2 was converted into a carbon flux by e flux e flux 2014 for the tunnel carbon trap cartridges the co2 mass was converted into a concentration in tunnel air using the known sample volume this concentration was converted into a flux by multiplying the concentration by the forced air ventilation rate for the tunnel the co2 flux rate was used to calculate a fuel degradation rate using the stoichiometry of fuel degradation 1 mol c11h24 yields 11 mol co2 2 2 temperature measurements vertical temperature profiles were collected october 2017 and april 2019 during both events temperature profiles were measured at the four monitoring wells accessed from the lower access tunnel one outside well was measured in october 2017 and seven outside wells were measured in april 2019 temperature measurements were obtained using a high accuracy type t thermocouple physitemp instruments during the october 2017 event well air temperatures were measured two ways 1 by allowing the thermocouple to hang vertically at each measurement depth in air within the well and 2 by pressing the thermocouple against the sidewall using a pipe test ball plug to obtain well sidewall temperatures at each depth the thermocouple reading typically stabilized within 2 3 min the two temperature measurement techniques provided similar results in april 2019 only well air temperatures method 1 were measured because the two measurement methods yielded comparable results in october 2017 in october 2017 temperature measurements were collected at five foot 1 5 m depth intervals from the ground surface to the bottom of each well in april 2019 variable depth intervals were used ranging from 1 ft to 20 ft 0 3 to 6 m 2 3 methane oxygen co2 and differential pressure methane oxygen co2 and differential pressure were measured in september 2017 at the soil gas monitoring points underlying the facility tanks and at in tunnel monitoring wells with screens partially above the water table i e rhmw02 rhmw03 and rhmw05 the monitoring wells were sealed with a gas tight cap at least 24 h before sample collection at each sample point a syringe pump was used to pump 750 ml of headspace vapor into a tedlar bag for these monitoring locations the sample was collected using a weighted 1 8 in 3 mm nylon tube threaded through the gas tight cap and lowered into the well to a depth of two feet above the water table so that the sample was collected within the uncased well interval immediately above the water table a gem5000 landfill gas meter was used to measure oxygen co2 and methane concentrations in the bag the meter reading typically stabilized after approximately 1 min i e 500 ml based on a pumping rate for the landfill gas meter of approximately 500 ml min and the reading was recorded when the bag was almost emptied by the meter a charcoal filter cartridge was installed in the sample line between the water filter and the tedlar bag to prevent false positive methane readings associated with petroleum vapors in the samples the charcoal filter removes larger petroleum vocs but does not remove methane jewell and wilson 2011 following completion of the fixed gas readings differential pressure was measured by connecting the gem5000 directly to the soil vapor well or monitoring well for all of the monitoring well headspace sample locations and 18 of the below tank soil gas points samples were also collected using a 2 7 l summa canister for analysis of oxygen co2 methane and nitrogen by epa method 3c by alpha analytical laboratory westborough ma samples were analyzed for an expanded list of 90 petroleum vocs by epa method to 15 total petroleum voc concentrations were low 6 to 300 ppbv median 20 ppb in all samples and are not discussed further 3 results 3 1 methane oxygen co2 high oxygen and low co2 concentrations were recorded at almost all measurement locations in the 47 below tank soil vapor points oxygen concentrations ranged from 13 7 to 20 6 with only two readings below 18 co2 concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 3 2 with most readings less than 1 for the well headspace samples oxygen was 6 6 21 and co2 was 0 1 8 5 methane was never detected in any measurement location using either the landfill gas meter detection limit 0 1 or samples analyzed off site by epa method 3c detection limit 0 06 these results show an aerobic environment throughout the vadose zone the lowest oxygen concentrations were measured in the headspaces of rhmw02 6 6 and rhmw03 17 locations where the temperature measurements indicated the occurrence of nszd the results for the individual sample points are provided as supplemental materials table s 1 3 2 differential pressure for 39 of the 46 below tank soil vapor wells tested and three of four monitoring wells the differential pressure measurements showed a negative pressure in the tunnel relative to the basalt i e a pressure gradient indicating gas flow from the vadose zone into the tunnel at most of these locations the differential pressure was greater than 0 1 in h2o i e 25 pa for comparison a differential pressure of 0 02 in h2o 5 pa is typically considered sufficient to support advective flow for vapor intrusion mitigation i e sufficient for effective sub slab depressurization systems these results indicate that tunnel exhaust system maintains a negative air pressure that supports advective air flow from the vadose zone into the tunnels mimicking the effects of a soil vapor extraction system 3 3 carbon trap results eight passive co2 traps were used to measure the flux of fossil fuel associated co2 to the ground surface no fossil fuel co2 was detected on four of the traps 0 001 g for the remaining four traps over the 14 day deployment time the mass of fossil fuel co2 accumulated on each trap ranged from 0 002 g to 0 06 g corresponding to equivalent nszd rates of 2 to 84 gal acre yr 19 to 784 kg ha yr fig 3 the average nszd rate across the eight traps was 16 29 gal acre yr 149 271 kg ha yr the variability in nszd rates between traps was not unexpected due to i the large vertical distance of greater than 300 ft between the likely nszd reaction zone and ground surface and ii the heterogenous spatial nature of co2 flux to the surface that can cause orders of magnitude differences in spatial samples e g garg et al 2017 a layer of variable thickness lower permeability saprolite at ground surface directly above the tanks and exposed basalt layers north and south of the tanks may affect the area where co2 from nszd is expressed at ground surface an estimate of overall nszd attributable to the flux of co2 to ground surface was calculated by multiplying the average nszd rate from the eight traps 16 gal acre yr by the ground surface area at the facility within the carbon trap deployment area 61 acres yielding a site wide nszd rate of 980 gal year note that the 61 acre ground surface area includes the approximately 13 acre area of the tank farm plus additional land area to the north and south included within the carbon trap test area to evaluate lateral migration of co2 within the subsurface fig 3 in the second carbon trap method six carbon cartridges were used to trap co2 from a known volume of air 1401 l to 1540 l from the tunnel system that provides access to the fuel storage tanks following a 24 h sample period the mass of fossil fuel co2 accumulated on each trap ranged from 0 006 g to 0 085 g table 1 the small negative value for one of the samples at the tunnel air intake point reflects analytical variability and uncertainly associated with use of 14c composition to distinguish between modern co2 and fossil fuel co2 the detection of excess fossil fuel co2 at tunnel air intake was not expected because the 14c correction accounts for the typical composition of co2 in atmospheric air e flux 2014 however during sample collection a large diesel generator was operating outdoors approximately 50 ft from the air intake where the intake air sample was collected the generator may have been a source of the excess fossil fuel co2 in the intake air sample collected on day 1 table 1 for safety reasons no combustion engines or other fossil fuel combustion sources are allowed within the tunnel system as a result the increase in fossil fuel co2 between the tunnel air intake and the tunnel air exhaust points indicates capture of co2 from the biodegradation of lnapl sources areas within the basalt the tunnel system has two primary air intakes the second air intake is located several hundred feet from any combustion sources because testing was conducted at only one of the air intake points there was some uncertainty regarding the average concentration of excess fossil fuel co2 in the air being taken into the tunnel system during the testing program to address this uncertainty upper and lower bound nszd rates were calculated for nszd attributable to fossil fuel co2 at the tunnel air exhaust points the upper bound nszd rates were calculated assuming that 100 of the fossil fuel co2 at the tunnel exhaust points was attributable to biodegradation of lnapl the lower bound nszd rates were calculated based on the difference in fossil fuel co2 between the measured tunnel air intake and the tunnel air exhaust combining the nszd attributable to the flux of fossil fuel co2 to the ground surface with the nszd attributable to the flux of fossil fuel co2 into the access tunnel system yields an overall nszd rate at the facility of 4600 to 7400 gal year 17 000 to 28 000 l yr table 2 assuming a tank farm area of 13 acres this corresponds to a nszd rate of 350 to 570 gal per acre per year 3200 to 5300 kg ha yr note that an area of 61 acres was used to calculate the co2 flux at ground surface corresponding to the surface area covered by the network of ground surface carbon traps however a smaller area of 13 acres was used to estimate the overall nszd rate per unit area 13 acres corresponds to the area containing the 20 fuel tanks fig 3 this is the maximum area impacted by fuel releases from the facility assuming that lateral migration of lnapl has been minimal the assumed lnapl impacted area affects nszd rate per unit area but does not affect the total nszd rate for the facility estimated from the flux of fossil fuel co2 3 4 temperature results most applications of the temperature method for quantifying nszd rates have utilized in place thermocouples to record daily vertical temperature profiles over a period of months or longer in the vadose zone at locations within and outside the petroleum impacted area warren and bekins 2015 askarani et al 2018 long term installation of temperature profiling equipment was determined not to be feasible at this facility however sweeney and ririe 2014 indicate that snap shot temperature profiles provide a reliable way to understand in situ biodegradation at this site the thick vadose zone 120 ft from the base of the fuel tanks to the water table was expected to yield a more stable vertical temperature profile compared to sites with shallow groundwater increasing the reliability of the snap shot approach subsurface temperatures were measured during two field events october 2017 and april 2019 supplemental materials table s 2 and s 3 the first event included four monitoring wells installed inside the lower access tunnel and one well installed outside the tunnel system the second field program included these five wells plus six additional wells installed outside the tunnel system for each well temperatures were measured at 16 to 61 depth intervals from the surface to the bottom of the well generally 10 ft to 20 ft 3 to 6 m below the water table during the october 2017 event measurements of well air temperature and well wall temperature yielded similar results fig 4 based on this finding only well air temperatures were measured during the april 2019 event for consistency between the two events the well air temperature data have been used for the evaluation of nszd rates the seven monitoring wells used in this study outside of the lower access tunnel are located north or south of the tank farm area fig 2 these wells exhibited relatively consistent vertical temperature profiles with temperatures near ground surface that were close to the mean annual air temperature at the honolulu international airport 25 4 c 1981 2010 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2020 for these wells temperature decreased with depth down to the groundwater reaching a temperature of 21 0 c to 22 5 c consistent with background groundwater temperatures in the area supplemental materials table s 3 none of these wells exhibited an increase in temperature within the depth interval between the base of the fuel tanks and the water table suggesting an absence of subsurface heating associated with biodegradation of lnapl the four wells located inside the lower access tunnel showed very consistent temperature profiles between the october 2017 and april 2019 field events particularly at depths of more than 15 ft below the top of the well although the lower tunnel is located more than 350 ft 110 m below ground surface the use of ambient air for tunnel ventilation is expected to cause some seasonal variation in tunnel temperature that could impact vadose zone temperatures within a few feet of the tunnel for the purpose of determining nszd rates vertical temperature profiles are used to determine the upward temperature gradient from heat source to the lower tunnel and downward temperature gradients from heat source to groundwater from the aerobic nszd reaction zone between the lower tunnel and groundwater these temperature gradients were used to determine temperature based nszd rates as described in sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2015 and sale et al 2014 sale et al 2018b determining the upward temperature gradient attributable to subsurface heating typically requires a background location to correct for the effect of seasonal temperature variations on shallow vadose zone temperatures askarani et al 2018 two tunnel wells located within the tank farm rhmw02 and rhwm03 exhibited temperatures profiles consistent with a subsurface heat source below the lower tunnel within the depth interval of 80 ft to 100 ft 24 to 30 m above mean sea level msl because all the site soil gas and high permeability geology indicates that nszd related biodegradation at this site is aerobic the temperature profiles provide reliable information about the vertical interval of lnapl in the vadose zone in the vicinity of the monitoring wells at these two locations the groundwater temperature at the top of the water table 23 8 c and 26 0 c was well above the background range of 21 0 c to 22 5 c and the groundwater temperature decreased with depth below the water table two factors consistent with a substantial vadose zone heat source the other two tunnel wells rhmw01 and rhmw05 are located between the tank farm area and a large pumping well that likely controls the flow of groundwater within the area assuming groundwater flow from the tank farm to the pumping well rhmw01 is located at the downgradient edge of the tank farm and rhmw05 is located approximately halfway between the edge of the tank farm and the pumping well these two wells exhibited elevated groundwater temperatures at the top of the water table 22 8 c and 24 5 c but vadose zone temperature profiles were less indicative of vadose zone heating suggesting that these two wells are both located downgradient of the primary nszd heat generation area while the temperature profile for rhmw05 shows no evidence of vadose zone heating the temperature profile for rhmw01 show a small inflection at depth of approximately 25 ft below the lower tunnel floor that could be indicative of a small amount of heat generation see supplemental materials because the temperature profile for rhmw01 was potentially consistent with either background temperature conditions or with a small amount of vadose zone heat generation two set of nszd rates were calculated i nszd rates were calculated for three locations rhmw01 rhmw02 and rhmw03 using rhmw05 for background correction and ii nszd rates were calculated for two locations rhmw02 and rhmw03 using rhmw01 for background correction the nszd calculations are provided as supplemental materials and the results are summarized in table 3 averaging across the three wells located within the tank farm area and using a tank farm area of 13 acres the temperature data indicate an overall nszd rate for the facility of 8600 gal year to 13 000 gal year 33 000 to 49 000 l yr within a factor of two of the rate range estimated based on the co2 flux 4 discussion two different methods co2 flux and heat flux were used to measure the rate of nszd at a large petroleum storage facility in hawaii both fossil fuel associated co2 and excess heat were measured at the facility providing strong evidence that nszd is occurring the estimated petroleum degradation rates were 4600 to 7400 gal year 17 000 to 28 000 l yr based on co2 flux and 8600 to 13 000 gal year 33 000 to 49 000 l yr based on heat flux the relatively close agreement in nszd rates between the two methods provides increased confidence in the overall findings in addition the monitoring wells adjacent to the tanks and screened below likely zones of lnapl within the vadose zone showed groundwater temperatures were elevated by 3 c to 5 c relative to monitoring wells not located in the immediate vicinity of the tanks data not shown confirming the presence of a large biodegradation related heat source in the vadose zone note that the datasets for the two evaluation methods co2 flux and heat flux do not support an evaluation of spatial consistency i e whether or not the two methods indicate that nszd is occurring in the same area oxygen co2 and methane concentrations were measured in vadose zone samples collected from available soil gas monitoring points installed below the fuel tanks and well headspace samples for monitoring wells screened across the water table these samples showed no detectable methane 0 1 in any samples and oxygen concentrations indicative of aerobic conditions throughout the vadose zone these results indicate that the common nszd two step process of anaerobic methanogenic degradation of petroleum constituents within the lnapl source area and methane oxidation at a shallower depth interval in the vadose zone e g garg et al 2017 warren and bekins 2015 is not applicable at this site instead the occurrence of high oxygen concentrations throughout the vadose zone suggest that nszd is occurring through the direct aerobic degradation of lnapl within the vadose zone fig 5 and that the elevated temperature in the vertical temperature profiles at two of the monitoring wells correspond to the location of lnapl that is being biodegraded aerobically although no methane was detected above or below the lnapl source no methane or oxygen measurements were taken directly within the lnapl source area thus it is possible that the lnapl source area may contain an anaerobic methanogenic core with methane oxidation occurring above and below this anaerobic core the differential pressure measurements indicate that the pressure within the lower tunnel is lower than the pressure in the surrounding basalt supporting the flow of air from the basalt into the tunnel in addition the measurement of fossil fuel associated co2 in the lower tunnel is consistent with air flow from the lnapl source area into the lower tunnel together these results indicate that the low pressure in the lower tunnel is acting as a very large vapor extraction system inducing air flow through the vadose zone into the lower tunnel this induced air flow may contribute to the maintenance of aerobic conditions within the lnapl source area to our knowledge this is the first petroleum release site where the available data support a conceptual model of direct aerobic biodegradation of lnapl in the vadose zone and provides nszd rates of lnapl

1479,in recent years a number of methods have been used to measure the biodegradation of petroleum light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl at petroleum release sites a process known as natural source zone depletion nszd most commonly nszd rates have been measured at sites with unconsolidated geology and relatively shallow groundwater 50 ft bgs 15 m bgs for this study we have used two methods 1 carbon dioxide flux measured using carbon traps and 2 heat flux based on subsurface temperature gradients to measure nszd rates at a petroleum release site in hawaii with basalt geology and deep groundwater 300 ft bgs 100 m bgs both methods documented the occurrence of nszd at the facility and the two methods yield estimates of the nszd rate that agreed within a factor of 2 4600 to 7400 gal yr 17 000 to 28 000 l yr for the flux method and 8600 to 13 000 gal yr 33 000 to 49 000 l yr for the temperature method soil gas samples collected directly above the water table and at shallower depths within the vadose zone indicated aerobic conditions throughout the vadose zone oxygen 13 and no detectable methane these results indicate that nszd occurs at this site through the direct aerobic biodegradation of lnapl rather than the two step process of anaerobic methanogenesis followed by methane oxidation at a shallow depth interval documented at other sites keywords aerobic biodegradation lnapl basalt nszd 1 introduction thousands of sites around the world are affected by historical releases of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl such as crude oil refined fuels lubricants and heating oil traditionally active treatment technologies e g hydraulic recovery air sparging multi phase extraction soil vapor extraction sve etc have been applied as common remediation approaches for most lnapl sites us epa 2005 itrc 2009 mchugh et al 2014 except for complete excavation none of these in situ remediation technologies has been demonstrated to completely remove all the lnapl within the treatment zone sookhak lari et al 2020 in recent years however there has been an increasing recognition that bacterial degradation of petroleum constituents within lnapl source areas is an important contributor to lnapl removal a process known as natural source zone depletion nszd garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 a number of methods have been developed to quantify nszd rates based on tracking the consumption of oxygen and or the generation of carbon dioxide co2 associated with biological degradation of petroleum api 2017 crc care 2018 these include measurement of co2 and oxygen concentration gradients itrc 2009 and the use of dynamic closed chambers sihota et al 2011 and passive co2 traps mccoy et al 2015 to measure co2 flux at the ground surface above lnapl source areas all of these methods utilize the measured flux of oxygen into the lnapl source area or flux of co2 out of the lnapl source area to determine the lnapl degradation rate i e the amount of lnapl degradation required to account for the measured amount of oxygen consumption or co2 production more recently researchers have developed and demonstrated a temperature based monitoring method to measure nszd rates for petroleum lnapl source areas warren and bekins 2015 askarani et al 2018 sale et al 2014 this approach utilizes measurement of the heat generated from biological lnapl degradation to quantify the lnapl degradation rate for this approach i vertical temperature profiles are collected recording the soil temperature from ground surface down through the lnapl source area ii this temperature profile is used to determine the heat flux away from the biological reaction zone and iii this heat flux is used to calculate the amount of petroleum being degraded i e the volume of petroleum per unit area per unit time required to account for the amount of heat being generated these flux and temperature nszd measurement methods have shown lnapl biodegradation rates of 100 s to 1000 s of gallons of lnapl per acre per year roughly 1000 s to 10 000 s of kilograms per hectare per year garg et al 2017 at almost every site where nszd rates were measured in addition these lnapl removal rates commonly exceed what can be achieved with long term active lnapl recovery remedies as a result nszd is gaining broad acceptance as a viable and cost effective remedy for mature lnapl releases sale et al 2018a 2018b however to date nszd rates have been reported in the literature at only a few dozen sites in a limited range of environmental settings typically sites with unconsolidated soils relatively shallow groundwater 50 ft bgs and permeable surface cover i e no pavement or buildings at these sites nszd typically occurs as a two step process i anaerobic methanogenic degradation of petroleum constituents within the lnapl source area and ii methane oxidation in the vadose zone above the lnapl source area at the depth interval where upward diffusing methane meets downward diffusing oxygen from the ground surface because the methane oxidation is the primary heat source for this two step process the interval of heat generation corresponds to this methane oxidation zone rather than the depth of the lnapl source area warren and bekins 2015 for lnapls with a significant volatile fraction oxidation of vocs in the vadose zone may also contribute to nszd sookhak lari et al 2019 in this paper we demonstrate the measurement of nszd rates for an lnapl source area at the red hill bulk fuel storage facility rhbfsf on oahu hawaii characterized by a high permeability basalt vadose zone greater than 300 ft thick a weathered basalt saprolite layer overlies the facility minimizing recharge from rainfall to our knowledge this is one of only a few sites where nszd rates have been measured in a consolidated rock geologic setting and the first example of nszd that appears attributable to direct aerobic degradation within the lnapl source area 2 methods the study site consists of 20 very large 12 5 million gallon 47 million l steel lined reinforced concrete two and a half to four foot thick underground storage tanks installed within a thick basalt vadose zone such that the base of the tanks is approximately 120 ft 40 m above the groundwater table each tank is approximately 250 ft 75 m tall and 100 ft 30 m in diameter the tanks have been in service since the mid 1940s and 18 of the tanks remain in service the tanks have been utilized primarily for storage of middle distillate fuels jet fuels marine diesel fuels with more limited past storage of gasoline range fuel the tanks are arranged in two rows of ten tanks each running from ese to wnw a lower access tunnel runs between the two rows of tanks just below the base of the tanks and an upper access tunnel runs between the two rows of tanks at an elevation of approximately 180 ft 55 m above the bottom of the tanks fig 1 in addition to providing access to the tanks for maintenance the lower access tunnel provides access to 47 soil gas monitoring points two to three points below each tank three monitoring wells installed within the tank farm area and one monitoring well installed downgradient of the tank farm area fig 2 additional monitoring wells outside the tank farm area used for this study are accessible from ground surface fig 2 aside from the access tunnels the native rock around the tanks is largely undisturbed the basalt is highly permeable relative to most contaminated sites in unconsolidated settings the high permeability components of the basalt include massive a ā thick chunky lava flows clinker zones layers of gravel like lava fragments between a ā layers described as high permeability material analogous to coarse clean gravel and pāhoehoe thin smooth lava flows that have high intrinsic permeability similar to that of carbonate rocks hunt 1996 overall hunt 1996 reports that when averaged over several lava flow thicknesses the lateral hydraulic conductivity of dike free lava flows such as found in the vicinity of red hill is about 500 to 5000 ft per day 0 18 to 1 8 cm s this is about 23 to 230 times higher than the median hydraulic conductivity of 0 008 cm s for 191 contaminated sand and gravel groundwater sites from newell et al 1990 due to this high permeability advective or diffusive air penetration into the unsaturated basalt is much more likely than for sites comprised of unconsolidated media prior investigation results indicate historical petroleum fuel releases prior to 1988 of unknown volume from several tanks and one more recent release of 27 000 gal 100 000l of jet fuel in 2014 evidence of prior releases includes visible staining and detection of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in rock cores collected from angled borings completed below the fuel tanks in the late 1990s and early 2000s documenting the presence of lnapl within a depth interval of approximately 10 ft to 30 ft 3 to 10 m below the bottom of the fuel tanks these angled borings were later converted to soil gas monitoring points fig 1 lnapl has not been observed in groundwater approximately 120 ft 35 m below the bottom of the fuel tanks in any of the monitoring wells the rhbfsf has implemented modern release prevention and release detection technologies the purpose of this study was to better understand nszd rates and processes for historical releases three methods were applied to quantify nszd rates for lnapl associated with these prior releases i the passive co2 trap method with traps installed at the surface of the facility ii an adapted co2 trap method where co2 was measured in the exhaust from the ventilated red hill tunnel system and iii the temperature method in addition oxygen co2 and methane concentrations and differential pressure were measured at each below tank soil gas point and monitoring well headspace 2 1 carbon trap measurements carbon traps from e flux fort collins co were used to measure the flux of co2 at the ground surface and through the two access tunnels flux at the ground surface was measured by deploying eight standard e flux carbon traps two transect lines of four traps were deployed each transverse to the rows of tanks resulting in two carbon traps north of the tanks four traps above the tanks and two traps south of the tanks the surface traps were deployed for 14 days in the fall of 2017 fig 3 co2 flux within the two tunnels was measured using custom packed carbon trap cartridges from e flux these cartridges were deployed at three locations i an air intake point for the tunnel system ii the air exhaust point for the upper tunnel and iii the air exhaust point for the lower tunnel at each location two consecutive 24 h samples were collected in the fall of 2017 by pumping air through the carbon traps at a constant pumping rate of 1 06 l min a mass flow controller was used to maintain a constant air pumping rate the carbon trap samples were analyzed by e flux to measure the mass of co2 on each trap 14c measurements were used to apportion the mass of co2 in each sample between modern sources and fossil fuel sources hua et al 2013 mccoy et al 2015 for the aboveground traps the mass of fossil fuel associated co2 was converted into a carbon flux by e flux e flux 2014 for the tunnel carbon trap cartridges the co2 mass was converted into a concentration in tunnel air using the known sample volume this concentration was converted into a flux by multiplying the concentration by the forced air ventilation rate for the tunnel the co2 flux rate was used to calculate a fuel degradation rate using the stoichiometry of fuel degradation 1 mol c11h24 yields 11 mol co2 2 2 temperature measurements vertical temperature profiles were collected october 2017 and april 2019 during both events temperature profiles were measured at the four monitoring wells accessed from the lower access tunnel one outside well was measured in october 2017 and seven outside wells were measured in april 2019 temperature measurements were obtained using a high accuracy type t thermocouple physitemp instruments during the october 2017 event well air temperatures were measured two ways 1 by allowing the thermocouple to hang vertically at each measurement depth in air within the well and 2 by pressing the thermocouple against the sidewall using a pipe test ball plug to obtain well sidewall temperatures at each depth the thermocouple reading typically stabilized within 2 3 min the two temperature measurement techniques provided similar results in april 2019 only well air temperatures method 1 were measured because the two measurement methods yielded comparable results in october 2017 in october 2017 temperature measurements were collected at five foot 1 5 m depth intervals from the ground surface to the bottom of each well in april 2019 variable depth intervals were used ranging from 1 ft to 20 ft 0 3 to 6 m 2 3 methane oxygen co2 and differential pressure methane oxygen co2 and differential pressure were measured in september 2017 at the soil gas monitoring points underlying the facility tanks and at in tunnel monitoring wells with screens partially above the water table i e rhmw02 rhmw03 and rhmw05 the monitoring wells were sealed with a gas tight cap at least 24 h before sample collection at each sample point a syringe pump was used to pump 750 ml of headspace vapor into a tedlar bag for these monitoring locations the sample was collected using a weighted 1 8 in 3 mm nylon tube threaded through the gas tight cap and lowered into the well to a depth of two feet above the water table so that the sample was collected within the uncased well interval immediately above the water table a gem5000 landfill gas meter was used to measure oxygen co2 and methane concentrations in the bag the meter reading typically stabilized after approximately 1 min i e 500 ml based on a pumping rate for the landfill gas meter of approximately 500 ml min and the reading was recorded when the bag was almost emptied by the meter a charcoal filter cartridge was installed in the sample line between the water filter and the tedlar bag to prevent false positive methane readings associated with petroleum vapors in the samples the charcoal filter removes larger petroleum vocs but does not remove methane jewell and wilson 2011 following completion of the fixed gas readings differential pressure was measured by connecting the gem5000 directly to the soil vapor well or monitoring well for all of the monitoring well headspace sample locations and 18 of the below tank soil gas points samples were also collected using a 2 7 l summa canister for analysis of oxygen co2 methane and nitrogen by epa method 3c by alpha analytical laboratory westborough ma samples were analyzed for an expanded list of 90 petroleum vocs by epa method to 15 total petroleum voc concentrations were low 6 to 300 ppbv median 20 ppb in all samples and are not discussed further 3 results 3 1 methane oxygen co2 high oxygen and low co2 concentrations were recorded at almost all measurement locations in the 47 below tank soil vapor points oxygen concentrations ranged from 13 7 to 20 6 with only two readings below 18 co2 concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 3 2 with most readings less than 1 for the well headspace samples oxygen was 6 6 21 and co2 was 0 1 8 5 methane was never detected in any measurement location using either the landfill gas meter detection limit 0 1 or samples analyzed off site by epa method 3c detection limit 0 06 these results show an aerobic environment throughout the vadose zone the lowest oxygen concentrations were measured in the headspaces of rhmw02 6 6 and rhmw03 17 locations where the temperature measurements indicated the occurrence of nszd the results for the individual sample points are provided as supplemental materials table s 1 3 2 differential pressure for 39 of the 46 below tank soil vapor wells tested and three of four monitoring wells the differential pressure measurements showed a negative pressure in the tunnel relative to the basalt i e a pressure gradient indicating gas flow from the vadose zone into the tunnel at most of these locations the differential pressure was greater than 0 1 in h2o i e 25 pa for comparison a differential pressure of 0 02 in h2o 5 pa is typically considered sufficient to support advective flow for vapor intrusion mitigation i e sufficient for effective sub slab depressurization systems these results indicate that tunnel exhaust system maintains a negative air pressure that supports advective air flow from the vadose zone into the tunnels mimicking the effects of a soil vapor extraction system 3 3 carbon trap results eight passive co2 traps were used to measure the flux of fossil fuel associated co2 to the ground surface no fossil fuel co2 was detected on four of the traps 0 001 g for the remaining four traps over the 14 day deployment time the mass of fossil fuel co2 accumulated on each trap ranged from 0 002 g to 0 06 g corresponding to equivalent nszd rates of 2 to 84 gal acre yr 19 to 784 kg ha yr fig 3 the average nszd rate across the eight traps was 16 29 gal acre yr 149 271 kg ha yr the variability in nszd rates between traps was not unexpected due to i the large vertical distance of greater than 300 ft between the likely nszd reaction zone and ground surface and ii the heterogenous spatial nature of co2 flux to the surface that can cause orders of magnitude differences in spatial samples e g garg et al 2017 a layer of variable thickness lower permeability saprolite at ground surface directly above the tanks and exposed basalt layers north and south of the tanks may affect the area where co2 from nszd is expressed at ground surface an estimate of overall nszd attributable to the flux of co2 to ground surface was calculated by multiplying the average nszd rate from the eight traps 16 gal acre yr by the ground surface area at the facility within the carbon trap deployment area 61 acres yielding a site wide nszd rate of 980 gal year note that the 61 acre ground surface area includes the approximately 13 acre area of the tank farm plus additional land area to the north and south included within the carbon trap test area to evaluate lateral migration of co2 within the subsurface fig 3 in the second carbon trap method six carbon cartridges were used to trap co2 from a known volume of air 1401 l to 1540 l from the tunnel system that provides access to the fuel storage tanks following a 24 h sample period the mass of fossil fuel co2 accumulated on each trap ranged from 0 006 g to 0 085 g table 1 the small negative value for one of the samples at the tunnel air intake point reflects analytical variability and uncertainly associated with use of 14c composition to distinguish between modern co2 and fossil fuel co2 the detection of excess fossil fuel co2 at tunnel air intake was not expected because the 14c correction accounts for the typical composition of co2 in atmospheric air e flux 2014 however during sample collection a large diesel generator was operating outdoors approximately 50 ft from the air intake where the intake air sample was collected the generator may have been a source of the excess fossil fuel co2 in the intake air sample collected on day 1 table 1 for safety reasons no combustion engines or other fossil fuel combustion sources are allowed within the tunnel system as a result the increase in fossil fuel co2 between the tunnel air intake and the tunnel air exhaust points indicates capture of co2 from the biodegradation of lnapl sources areas within the basalt the tunnel system has two primary air intakes the second air intake is located several hundred feet from any combustion sources because testing was conducted at only one of the air intake points there was some uncertainty regarding the average concentration of excess fossil fuel co2 in the air being taken into the tunnel system during the testing program to address this uncertainty upper and lower bound nszd rates were calculated for nszd attributable to fossil fuel co2 at the tunnel air exhaust points the upper bound nszd rates were calculated assuming that 100 of the fossil fuel co2 at the tunnel exhaust points was attributable to biodegradation of lnapl the lower bound nszd rates were calculated based on the difference in fossil fuel co2 between the measured tunnel air intake and the tunnel air exhaust combining the nszd attributable to the flux of fossil fuel co2 to the ground surface with the nszd attributable to the flux of fossil fuel co2 into the access tunnel system yields an overall nszd rate at the facility of 4600 to 7400 gal year 17 000 to 28 000 l yr table 2 assuming a tank farm area of 13 acres this corresponds to a nszd rate of 350 to 570 gal per acre per year 3200 to 5300 kg ha yr note that an area of 61 acres was used to calculate the co2 flux at ground surface corresponding to the surface area covered by the network of ground surface carbon traps however a smaller area of 13 acres was used to estimate the overall nszd rate per unit area 13 acres corresponds to the area containing the 20 fuel tanks fig 3 this is the maximum area impacted by fuel releases from the facility assuming that lateral migration of lnapl has been minimal the assumed lnapl impacted area affects nszd rate per unit area but does not affect the total nszd rate for the facility estimated from the flux of fossil fuel co2 3 4 temperature results most applications of the temperature method for quantifying nszd rates have utilized in place thermocouples to record daily vertical temperature profiles over a period of months or longer in the vadose zone at locations within and outside the petroleum impacted area warren and bekins 2015 askarani et al 2018 long term installation of temperature profiling equipment was determined not to be feasible at this facility however sweeney and ririe 2014 indicate that snap shot temperature profiles provide a reliable way to understand in situ biodegradation at this site the thick vadose zone 120 ft from the base of the fuel tanks to the water table was expected to yield a more stable vertical temperature profile compared to sites with shallow groundwater increasing the reliability of the snap shot approach subsurface temperatures were measured during two field events october 2017 and april 2019 supplemental materials table s 2 and s 3 the first event included four monitoring wells installed inside the lower access tunnel and one well installed outside the tunnel system the second field program included these five wells plus six additional wells installed outside the tunnel system for each well temperatures were measured at 16 to 61 depth intervals from the surface to the bottom of the well generally 10 ft to 20 ft 3 to 6 m below the water table during the october 2017 event measurements of well air temperature and well wall temperature yielded similar results fig 4 based on this finding only well air temperatures were measured during the april 2019 event for consistency between the two events the well air temperature data have been used for the evaluation of nszd rates the seven monitoring wells used in this study outside of the lower access tunnel are located north or south of the tank farm area fig 2 these wells exhibited relatively consistent vertical temperature profiles with temperatures near ground surface that were close to the mean annual air temperature at the honolulu international airport 25 4 c 1981 2010 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2020 for these wells temperature decreased with depth down to the groundwater reaching a temperature of 21 0 c to 22 5 c consistent with background groundwater temperatures in the area supplemental materials table s 3 none of these wells exhibited an increase in temperature within the depth interval between the base of the fuel tanks and the water table suggesting an absence of subsurface heating associated with biodegradation of lnapl the four wells located inside the lower access tunnel showed very consistent temperature profiles between the october 2017 and april 2019 field events particularly at depths of more than 15 ft below the top of the well although the lower tunnel is located more than 350 ft 110 m below ground surface the use of ambient air for tunnel ventilation is expected to cause some seasonal variation in tunnel temperature that could impact vadose zone temperatures within a few feet of the tunnel for the purpose of determining nszd rates vertical temperature profiles are used to determine the upward temperature gradient from heat source to the lower tunnel and downward temperature gradients from heat source to groundwater from the aerobic nszd reaction zone between the lower tunnel and groundwater these temperature gradients were used to determine temperature based nszd rates as described in sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2015 and sale et al 2014 sale et al 2018b determining the upward temperature gradient attributable to subsurface heating typically requires a background location to correct for the effect of seasonal temperature variations on shallow vadose zone temperatures askarani et al 2018 two tunnel wells located within the tank farm rhmw02 and rhwm03 exhibited temperatures profiles consistent with a subsurface heat source below the lower tunnel within the depth interval of 80 ft to 100 ft 24 to 30 m above mean sea level msl because all the site soil gas and high permeability geology indicates that nszd related biodegradation at this site is aerobic the temperature profiles provide reliable information about the vertical interval of lnapl in the vadose zone in the vicinity of the monitoring wells at these two locations the groundwater temperature at the top of the water table 23 8 c and 26 0 c was well above the background range of 21 0 c to 22 5 c and the groundwater temperature decreased with depth below the water table two factors consistent with a substantial vadose zone heat source the other two tunnel wells rhmw01 and rhmw05 are located between the tank farm area and a large pumping well that likely controls the flow of groundwater within the area assuming groundwater flow from the tank farm to the pumping well rhmw01 is located at the downgradient edge of the tank farm and rhmw05 is located approximately halfway between the edge of the tank farm and the pumping well these two wells exhibited elevated groundwater temperatures at the top of the water table 22 8 c and 24 5 c but vadose zone temperature profiles were less indicative of vadose zone heating suggesting that these two wells are both located downgradient of the primary nszd heat generation area while the temperature profile for rhmw05 shows no evidence of vadose zone heating the temperature profile for rhmw01 show a small inflection at depth of approximately 25 ft below the lower tunnel floor that could be indicative of a small amount of heat generation see supplemental materials because the temperature profile for rhmw01 was potentially consistent with either background temperature conditions or with a small amount of vadose zone heat generation two set of nszd rates were calculated i nszd rates were calculated for three locations rhmw01 rhmw02 and rhmw03 using rhmw05 for background correction and ii nszd rates were calculated for two locations rhmw02 and rhmw03 using rhmw01 for background correction the nszd calculations are provided as supplemental materials and the results are summarized in table 3 averaging across the three wells located within the tank farm area and using a tank farm area of 13 acres the temperature data indicate an overall nszd rate for the facility of 8600 gal year to 13 000 gal year 33 000 to 49 000 l yr within a factor of two of the rate range estimated based on the co2 flux 4 discussion two different methods co2 flux and heat flux were used to measure the rate of nszd at a large petroleum storage facility in hawaii both fossil fuel associated co2 and excess heat were measured at the facility providing strong evidence that nszd is occurring the estimated petroleum degradation rates were 4600 to 7400 gal year 17 000 to 28 000 l yr based on co2 flux and 8600 to 13 000 gal year 33 000 to 49 000 l yr based on heat flux the relatively close agreement in nszd rates between the two methods provides increased confidence in the overall findings in addition the monitoring wells adjacent to the tanks and screened below likely zones of lnapl within the vadose zone showed groundwater temperatures were elevated by 3 c to 5 c relative to monitoring wells not located in the immediate vicinity of the tanks data not shown confirming the presence of a large biodegradation related heat source in the vadose zone note that the datasets for the two evaluation methods co2 flux and heat flux do not support an evaluation of spatial consistency i e whether or not the two methods indicate that nszd is occurring in the same area oxygen co2 and methane concentrations were measured in vadose zone samples collected from available soil gas monitoring points installed below the fuel tanks and well headspace samples for monitoring wells screened across the water table these samples showed no detectable methane 0 1 in any samples and oxygen concentrations indicative of aerobic conditions throughout the vadose zone these results indicate that the common nszd two step process of anaerobic methanogenic degradation of petroleum constituents within the lnapl source area and methane oxidation at a shallower depth interval in the vadose zone e g garg et al 2017 warren and bekins 2015 is not applicable at this site instead the occurrence of high oxygen concentrations throughout the vadose zone suggest that nszd is occurring through the direct aerobic degradation of lnapl within the vadose zone fig 5 and that the elevated temperature in the vertical temperature profiles at two of the monitoring wells correspond to the location of lnapl that is being biodegraded aerobically although no methane was detected above or below the lnapl source no methane or oxygen measurements were taken directly within the lnapl source area thus it is possible that the lnapl source area may contain an anaerobic methanogenic core with methane oxidation occurring above and below this anaerobic core the differential pressure measurements indicate that the pressure within the lower tunnel is lower than the pressure in the surrounding basalt supporting the flow of air from the basalt into the tunnel in addition the measurement of fossil fuel associated co2 in the lower tunnel is consistent with air flow from the lnapl source area into the lower tunnel together these results indicate that the low pressure in the lower tunnel is acting as a very large vapor extraction system inducing air flow through the vadose zone into the lower tunnel this induced air flow may contribute to the maintenance of aerobic conditions within the lnapl source area to our knowledge this is the first petroleum release site where the available data support a conceptual model of direct aerobic biodegradation of lnapl in the vadose zone and provides nszd rates of lnapl
